      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People can feel different levels of pain. This may depend on social, cultural, and biological&#xD;
      factors. These factors can also influence how people respond to each other, and how they&#xD;
      judge other people s experiences. Researchers want to learn more about these relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study if social and cultural factors lead to differences in pain experience and how pain&#xD;
      is interpreted by other individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-60&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 or 2 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and nursing assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electric shock through small sticky pads on the arm, leg, or foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal stimulation. A device called a thermode will be placed on the arm, leg, or foot. A&#xD;
      computer controls the thermode temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lowering their hand into very cold water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videos or pictures of the face will recorded while participants get painful stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A test to record heart electrical activity. Small metal disc or sticky pad electrodes will be&#xD;
      placed on the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse rate and breathing measured. Sweating will be measured with two small sensors stuck on&#xD;
      the hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A test to measure the electrical activity of facial muscles. Small metal disk or sticky pad&#xD;
      electrodes will be attached to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viewing pictures and/or videos of other people who get painful and nonpainful stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will make decisions about the images. They will respond by keyboard, mouse, or&#xD;
      button.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye tracking. A camera will measure participants pupil size and follow their eye movements.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposal investigates behavioral, psychophysiological, and social processes that&#xD;
      may help explain biases and disparate outcomes in pain. Health disparities, or health&#xD;
      outcomes that adversely affect disadvantaged populations, are pervasive and apparent in many&#xD;
      diseases and symptoms, including pain. Pain is the number one reason individuals seek medical&#xD;
      treatment. Health disparities in pain encompass both differences in pain experience and&#xD;
      treatment for pain. For instance, research indicates that Black individuals report increased&#xD;
      pain and have reduced pain tolerance relative to White individuals, yet doctors are less&#xD;
      likely to treat minority patients pain and underestimate their pain experience. This project&#xD;
      aims to address this systemic discrepancy by focusing on interpersonal processes that may&#xD;
      contribute to these disparities, including socially-relevant responses to pain (i.e. pain&#xD;
      expression) and pain assessment (e.g. visual attention). The proposed research aims to&#xD;
      determine whether the study of pain expressions and their assessment can yield insights on&#xD;
      how social factors shape pain and its treatment. Further, we test the efficacy of potential&#xD;
      interventions designed to improve accuracy and reduce biases in pain assessment. If&#xD;
      successful, this work will form the foundation of a new research program that will link the&#xD;
      field of pain research with the field of social neuroscience, and forge new insights on the&#xD;
      critical problem of health disparities in pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will accrue up to 600 total healthy volunteers to target 212 completers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overall aim is to understand how social factors influence the assessment and management&#xD;
      of pain, and to gain insight into psychosocial processes that may underlie health disparities&#xD;
      in pain. We propose a series of studies designed to test these links. First, we will measure&#xD;
      pain perception and physiological responses to painful stimuli in a diverse group of&#xD;
      individuals to test for sociocultural and biological influences on pain and pain-related&#xD;
      responses. In subsequent studies, new participants (&quot;perceivers&quot;) will view images of these&#xD;
      initial participants (&quot;targets&quot;) and will provide estimates of targets' pain experience. We&#xD;
      will measure a) whether perceivers can accurately estimate targets' pain experience; b)&#xD;
      whether accuracy differs as a function of similarity between target and perceiver (ingroup vs&#xD;
      outgroup); and c) whether individuals can improve accuracy through feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures for all experiments will be decisions about pain (experienced by&#xD;
      self or other) measured with visual analogue scales, reaction time, and/or categorical&#xD;
      judgments (pain/no pain). We will also measure physiological responses (e.g., facial muscle&#xD;
      response, skin conductance, pupil dilation) as secondary outcome measures. We will test&#xD;
      whether pain and pain-related responses varies as a function of sociocultural/demographic&#xD;
      factors (e.g. race, ethnicity, gender) and whether accuracy in assessing others pain is&#xD;
      influenced by group similarity (i.e. ingroup vs. outgroup) and training (e.g.&#xD;
      performance-related feedback).&#xD;
