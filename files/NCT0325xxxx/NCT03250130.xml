      The main objective is to assess the feasibility of an intervention based on medical&#xD;
      Ericksonian hypnosis as a complementary therapy in patients treated with surgery after a&#xD;
      diagnosis of breast cancer, followed by an indication of adjuvant chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy&#xD;

      In the field of management of cancer, many approaches have been used since tens of years,&#xD;
      particularly in regard of pain management, both in achieving surgical or invasive procedures&#xD;
      in the pain induced by the disease itself. the investigators owe the first description in&#xD;
      1829 Chapelin and col who used hypnosis in a patient with breast cancer in which a mastectomy&#xD;
      should be performed. Meta-analysis (2000) showed the positive impact of analgesia obtained&#xD;
      through hypnosis on the perception of pain intensity. In children in whom regular venous&#xD;
      punctures is performed, using hypnosis seems indisputable on the management of anticipatory&#xD;
      anxiety, leading to a better experience of the act itself. Regarding the nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      induced by chemotherapy, numerous studies are old, not always randomized and performed often&#xD;
      before the era of the setrons; but seems favorable impact on anticipated nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      the updated studies should emerge on the issue of delayed emesis which remain a serious&#xD;
      adverse event and not completely resolved. Mark to improve the EORTC validated tools of&#xD;
      quality of life measurement widely used for example in ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of hypnosis on the quality of life or the side effects of treatment or&#xD;
      rehospitalization for toxicity remains controversial (Judson, 2011). A meta-analysis&#xD;
      combining the tests carried out before and after the era of setrons (Richardson, 2007)&#xD;
      concluded that the effectiveness of the anticipated nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context,the investigators proposed to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the&#xD;
      role and impact of medical Ericksonian hypnosis on acute and delayed adverse event (incl&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting) in female patients treated by adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the feasibility of an intervention based on medical&#xD;
      Ericksonian hypnosis as a complementary therapy in patients treated with surgery after a&#xD;
      diagnosis of breast cancer, followed by an indication of adjuvant chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy&#xD;

    <description>The main objective is to assess the feasibility of an intervention based on medical Ericksonian hypnosis as a complementary therapy in patients treated with surgery after a diagnosis of breast cancer, followed by an indication of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.&#xD;
Primary endpoint is the proportion of patients rated as being compliant to self-hypnosis sessions during adjuvant chemotherapy (6 sessions). A patient is considered as compliant if it achieves at least 2/3 of the planned self-hypnosis sessions, that is, 4 of 6 planned sessions.</description>
