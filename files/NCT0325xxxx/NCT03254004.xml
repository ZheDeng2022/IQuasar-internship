        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Primary lung adenocarcinoma patients with stage I and less than 4 centimeter of&#xD;
             primary tumor, whose tumor should be solid-predominant or micropapillary (&gt;5%) by&#xD;
             postsurgical pathological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: The specific methods and principles of pathology results follow the WHO's&#xD;
                  pathology guidelines. The institution uses diagnostic pathology results from the&#xD;
                  institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Adenocarcinoma, solid-predominant subtype; This variant shows a major&#xD;
                  component of polygonal tumor cells forming sheets that lack recognizable patterns&#xD;
                  of adenocarcinoma, i.e., acinar, papillary, micropapillary, or lepidic growth. If&#xD;
                  the tumor is 100% solid, intracellular mucin should be present in &gt;5 tumor cells&#xD;
                  in each of two high-power fields, and confirmed with histochemical stains for&#xD;
                  mucin.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Adenocarcinoma, micropapillary subtype; This variant has, as a major&#xD;
                  component, tumor cells growing in papillary tufts forming florets that lack&#xD;
                  fibrovascular cores. These may appear detached from and/or connected to alveolar&#xD;
                  walls. The tumor cells are usually small and cuboidal, with variable nuclear&#xD;
                  atypia. Ring-like glandular structures may float within alveolar spaces. Vascular&#xD;
                  and stromal invasion is common. Psammoma bodies may be seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No evidence of disease (NED) after surgical resection on baseline tumor imaging (chest&#xD;
             CT, covering up to both adrenals). The following conditions are satisfied with the&#xD;
             condition of the complete ablation(R0):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  free resection margins proved microscopically&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  no evidence of nodal metastasis by ststematic and radical nodal dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be 20 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be willing to provide tissue from surgical specimen or excisional biopsy of a tumor&#xD;
             lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 1, all screening labs should&#xD;
             be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation.&#xD;
