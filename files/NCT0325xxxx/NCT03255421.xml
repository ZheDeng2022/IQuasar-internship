      This study evaluate the feasibility and the accuracy of an emptying cystometry in order to&#xD;
      simplify the manometric follow-up of overactive detrusor in neurological patients under&#xD;
      anticholinergic or botulinum toxin injections.&#xD;

      Bladder pressure assessment is necessary for the diagnosis, the prognostic assessment and the&#xD;
      management of neurogenic bladder. High bladder pressures increase the rate of urological&#xD;
      complications and mortality in patients with neurogenic bladder. Thus many treatments are&#xD;
      proposed in order to improve bladder compliance and reduce uninhibited detrusor contractions&#xD;
      (anticholinergic drugs, botulinum toxin injections, cystoplasty, sacral neuromodulation,&#xD;
      beta-3-agonist, posterior tibial nerve stimulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data, symptoms scales, quality of life questionnaires, renal ultrasound, biological&#xD;
      tests of renal function and urodynamic studies are used to control the treatment efficacy of&#xD;
      neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. Filling cystometry is the usual way to record&#xD;
      bladder pressure. Urodynamic techniques using external pressure transducers (microtip,&#xD;
      air-filled or fluid-perfused catheters) connected to the patient with fluid-filled lines are&#xD;
      recommended. This multichannel cystometry is performed in a specialized department with the&#xD;
      inconvenience of delays for appointments and cost of the urodynamic assessment. Moreover,&#xD;
      only some parameters are important and are taken in account in the follow-up of these&#xD;
      neurogenic bladders: bladder capacity, bladder compliance and maximum detrusor pressure at&#xD;
      the end of the filling phase. All these parameters can be recorded with a self-assessment of&#xD;
      bladder pressure at home with a very simple device made of 1) a self-intermittent catheter;&#xD;
      2) a three way stopcock; 3) a simple graduated tube. This device has in fact been used in the&#xD;
      past to realize cystometries, in particular in the elderly subject. A such device should&#xD;
      provide a monitoring in changes in bladder pressure in order to initiate adjustments in&#xD;
      treatment sooner than would be achieved when patients are evaluated periodically but less&#xD;
      frequently in the neurourology department. The early detection of high bladder pressures may&#xD;
      avoid bladder deformation, reflux and upper tract deterioration. Moreover, the home control&#xD;
      of appropriate bladder pressure may improve the patients' quality of live by reducing the&#xD;
      constraint linked to the time-consuming specialized follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will test a reverse single channel cystometry performed just&#xD;
      after a classical filling cystometry during the usual emptying by means of a device allowing&#xD;
      serial bladder pressure measurements during the bladder emptying. In case of such a&#xD;
      feasibility and a good precision of the reverse cystometry, the manometric follow-up of&#xD;
      overactive detrusor in neurological patients under anticholinergic or botulinum toxin&#xD;
      injections could be simplified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and the accuracy of sequential&#xD;
      measurements of bladder pressure during the bladder emptying and to compare the evolution of&#xD;
      bladder pressures during the emptying phase with the bladder pressures recorded during the&#xD;
      filling phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over 18 years old, consulting for lower urinary tract symptoms and performing an&#xD;
      urodynamic examination with a cystometry in a tertiary center are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History, treatment and urodynamics data are recorded. Conventional supine multichannel&#xD;
      cystometry with isotonic saline infused at 50ml/min (filling cystometry), conform to the&#xD;
      International Continence Society (ICS) recommendations will be performed. At the end of the&#xD;
      standard cystometry when the maximum cystometric capacity will be reached, if no micturition&#xD;
      was obtained, urodynamic catheter was withdrawn and a CH12 urinary catheter will be&#xD;
      introduced in the bladder according to the usual department procedure (usually, this catheter&#xD;
      allows to empty the bladder). This catheter will be connected to a three-way stopcock. The&#xD;
      second way of the stopcock will permit the emptying into a measuring container, graduated&#xD;
      each 50ml. The third way of the stopcock will be connected via a tube extension to a rigid&#xD;
      vertical 70cm tube (central venous pressure set) graduated each centimeter. The zero pressure&#xD;
      of the vertical tube will be set at the upper edge of the symphysis pubis. For measuring the&#xD;
      bladder pressure at the maximum cystometric capacity, the valve will be open between the&#xD;
      bladder and the graduated tube, manometric data will be derived by observing the rise of the&#xD;
      column of fluid in the centimeter scale tube. This procedure will be repeated every 50ml&#xD;
      until bladder full emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compared each bladder pressure measures every 50ml during the&#xD;
      &quot;backwards cystometry&quot; with each bladder pressure measured every 50ml from the maximum&#xD;
      capacity during the filling cystometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is the agreement between the two cystometries evaluated using a kappa&#xD;
      coefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome is the correlation between the pressures during the two cystometries.&#xD;
