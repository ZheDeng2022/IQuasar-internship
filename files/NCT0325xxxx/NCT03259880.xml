    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis (AP) is rapid-onset inflammation of the pancreas that varies in severity&#xD;
      from a self-limiting mild illness to rapidly progressive multiple organ failure. Statistics&#xD;
      suggest that 10-20% of patients with AP develop severe AP (SAP),1 which usually has an&#xD;
      unfavourable disease progression and is associated with a poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two most common and important causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones (40-70%) and&#xD;
      alcohol (25-35%) Gallstone pancreatitis is usually due to an obstructing stone in the&#xD;
      pancreatic duct near the sphincter of Oddi . In alcohol-related pancreatitis, it is believed&#xD;
      that the acinar cells of the pancreas are susceptible to damage by ethanol and underlie the&#xD;
      etiology of the disease . Another common cause, iatrogenic pancreatitis, may occur after&#xD;
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in up to 5% of patients. Other&#xD;
      etiologies of acute pancreatitis include medications, infections, trauma, hereditary,&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia and autoimmune disease.&#xD;

      Acute pancreatitis (AP) is rapid-onset inflammation of the pancreas that varies in severity&#xD;
      from a self-limiting mild illness to rapidly progressive multiple organ failure. Statistics&#xD;
      suggest that 10-20% of patients with AP develop severe AP (SAP),1 which usually has an&#xD;
      unfavourable disease progression and is associated with a poor prognosis. (Banks PA,&#xD;
      Bollen,et al.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two most common and important causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones (40-70%) and&#xD;
      alcohol (25-35%) (Tenner S et al., 2014) Gallstone pancreatitis is usually due to an&#xD;
      obstructing stone in the pancreatic duct near the sphincter of Oddi ( Bhatia M et al .,2005).&#xD;
      In alcohol-related pancreatitis, it is believed that the acinar cells of the pancreas are&#xD;
      susceptible to damage by ethanol and underlie the etiology of the disease ( Tonsi AF et al .,&#xD;
      2009). Another common cause, iatrogenic pancreatitis, may occur after endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in up to 5% of patients. Other etiologies of acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis include medications, infections, trauma, hereditary, hypertriglyceridemia and&#xD;
      autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the American College of Gastroenterology, a patient must have two of the&#xD;
      following three features present to make a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis The diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria used for acute pancreatitis includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical criteria - history of pain in abdomen radiating to the back and relieved on&#xD;
           bending forward associated with tenderness/guarding in the upper abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Radiographic evidence - Computed Tomography findings suggestive of acute pancreatitis&#xD;
           such as pancreatic edema, pancreatic necrosis, peripancreatic fluid collections&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Biochemical - Serum amylase concentration greater than 180 Somogyii units (by the&#xD;
           Somogyii method).&#xD;
