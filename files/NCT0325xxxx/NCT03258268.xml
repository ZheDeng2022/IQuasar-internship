  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 26-week, multicenter, parallel two-arm, randomized controlled trial of the glycemic&#xD;
      outcomes of individualized treatment support in patients with type 2 diabetes. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the trial is to confirm the superiority of standard of care with EASY DSS versus&#xD;
      standard of care without EASY DSS in terms of glycemic control in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes with ongoing treatment with any antidiabetic drug(s).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood&#xD;
             pressure &gt; 100 mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal failure stage 5, defined as (estimated or exact) glomerular filtration rate &lt; 15&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73m2&#xD;

          -  Major psychiatric disorders, mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barrier&#xD;
             precluding adequate understanding of the trial procedure or cooperation with the trial&#xD;
             site personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life-threatening disease including malignant neoplasms and medical history of&#xD;
             malignant neoplasms within the last 5 years (except basal and squamous cell skin&#xD;
