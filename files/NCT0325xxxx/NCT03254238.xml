  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prescription drug abuse is a major challenge in public health, in particular in countries&#xD;
      such as France, one of the main consumers of medication in Europe. A single source of&#xD;
      information is rarely sufficient to measure such a complex phenomenon. This project entitled&#xD;
      MEGADOSE (Monitoring prEscriptiondruG Abuse using DOctor Shopping bEhavior) may complete&#xD;
      efficiently the available data from the addictovigilance centres allowing the health&#xD;
      authorities (French Drug Agency) to answer to the main general questions (What are the main&#xD;
      prescription drug abused in France? What are the national trends in prescription drug abuse?&#xD;
      What is the impact of a public health measure on prescription drug abuse). This project&#xD;
      constitutes the opportunity of &quot;extending&quot; the application of our tool (the DS method) on a&#xD;
      French national database with a minimal risk since this method has already been validated and&#xD;
      applied on different geographic areas, on different drugs and at different levels of&#xD;
      analysis. The project would also be integrated in routinely as a useful tool included in the&#xD;
      addictovigilance monitoring, also allowing a multi-approach approach and the monitoring of&#xD;
      policy and practice interventions implemented by the French Drug Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project MEGADOSE is also in accordance with the main topic of the projects funded by ANSM&#xD;
      related to drug misuse in particular: development and identification of systems and tools&#xD;
      able to detect earlier misuse phenomenon; analysis of the impact of communications,&#xD;
      guidelines, decisions to health authorities and patients&#xD;

      Medicines such as analgesics, opioids substitution drugs, sedatives, hypnotics are&#xD;
      increasingly being misuse to induce psychoactive effects or to alter the effects of other&#xD;
      consumed drugs, potentially resulting in abuse and dependence (24). Awareness of medicine&#xD;
      misuse, especially prescription drugs misuse has been increasing in the past few years and&#xD;
      organizations such as the United Nation's International Narcotics Control Board predict that&#xD;
      worldwide misuse of prescription drugs will exceed illicit drug use. A major potential part&#xD;
      of psychoactive drug misuse is related to drug abuse. Assessment of misuse, abuse and&#xD;
      diversion of prescription drugs must address its occult nature and involves fundamentally&#xD;
      different monitoring methods compared to other pharmaceutical products. Current best practice&#xD;
      is to use multiple detection systems to assess misuse, abuse, and diversion of CNS active&#xD;
      drugs by various populations in a timely, sensitive and specific manner (20). In order to&#xD;
      detect earlier the prescription drug abuse related to misuse, the investigators have&#xD;
      developed a specific method, the doctor shopping method, at the regional level. Doctor&#xD;
      shopping is a well-known behavior defined as obtaining prescriptions from several physicians&#xD;
      for the same medication at the same time. By cumulating the prescriptions of different&#xD;
      physicians during the same period of time, doctor shopping enables patients to be delivered a&#xD;
      daily dose superior to that prescribed by each physician on an individual basis. Doctor&#xD;
      shopping behavior is regarded as not only a means of obtaining high-dose prescriptions but as&#xD;
      the principal method of diversion of prescription medications to street markets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using health Insurance Database, the investigators have developed and validated a specific&#xD;
      method &quot;the doctor shopping method&quot; providing two indicators: the DSI (Doctor Shopping&#xD;
      Indicator expressed in %) and the DSQ (Doctor Shopping Quantity expressed in DDD), reflecting&#xD;
      respectively the risk of abuse and the extent of abuse. This previous large work, based along&#xD;
      ten years of development and validation through several different studies, has i) been always&#xD;
      performed at the regional level on SNIIR-AM (several French areas - Paca Corse, Rhône Alpes,&#xD;
      Midi Pyrenées), ii) focused on one product (buprenorphine, clonazepam, methylphenidate) or on&#xD;
      one pharmacological class (opioids, benzodiazepines) iii) measured the impact of national&#xD;
      prescription monitoring programme (buprenorphine). More recently the investigators have&#xD;
      performed a global overview of the extent and risk of abuse of more than 100 psychoactive&#xD;
      medications among 11.7 million inhabitants according the doctor shopping method, used as a&#xD;
      proxy of drug abuse. Based on this experience, and because there is a need to measure&#xD;
      prescription drug abuse, to understand trends over the time and to compare abuse of one&#xD;
      product to another, the aim of this project is to provide an up-to-date and nationally&#xD;
      consolidated estimation of the risk and the extent of abuse associated with more of 100&#xD;
      psychoactive drugs in the French population, using doctor shopping method on National&#xD;
      SNIIR-AM, covering the entire French population (65 million inhabitants). To increase the&#xD;
      accuracy of its estimation and its description, the study will take into account relevant&#xD;
      factors and determinants of drugs abuse such as i) formulation (dosage, extended or immediate&#xD;
      release, route of administration) ii) geographical level iii) time factor (trends analysis&#xD;
      between 2010 and 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescription drug abuse is a major challenge in public health, in particular in countries&#xD;
      such as France, one of the main consumers of psychoactive medications in Europe. A single&#xD;
      source of information is rarely sufficient to measure such a complex phenomenon. This project&#xD;
      entitled MEGADOSE (Monitoring prEscriptiondruG Abuse using DOctor Shopping bEhavior) may&#xD;
      complete efficiently the available data from the addictovigilance centres allowing the health&#xD;
      authorities (French Drug Agency) to answer to the main general questions (What are the main&#xD;
      prescription drug abused in France? What are the national trends in prescription drug abuse?&#xD;
      What is the impact of a public health measures on prescription drug abuse).&#xD;

        The target population is the whole French population. The SNIIR-AM will be used as the&#xD;
        source population. The SNIIR-AM (Systeme National d'Information Inter-Régime de l'Assurance&#xD;
        Maladie) is the information system of the French National Health Insurance Scheme,&#xD;
        containing individualized, anonymous, and exhaustive data on all health spending&#xD;
        reimbursements of the overall French insured population (almost 65 million inhabitants).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The information contained in this database covers the health care services reimbursed&#xD;
        including:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Characteristics of medication dispensed (name, formulation, dates of prescription,&#xD;
             date of dispensing, quantity dispensed and cost)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients characteristics including age, gender, area of residence, type of&#xD;
             affiliation, dependency on the universal health care coverage or CMU (Couverture&#xD;
             Médicale Universelle Complémentaire, CMUC, which is attributed to the unemployed and&#xD;
             low income insurees, and which can be used as a proxy of the income level),&#xD;
