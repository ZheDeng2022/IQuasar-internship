    <textblock>
      This research study is a sub-study within the Behavioral Activation for Smoking Cessation and&#xD;
      the Prevention of Post-Cessation Weight Gain main study (NCT02906787). Participants who are&#xD;
      eligible for the main study and meet certain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) related study&#xD;
      criteria (i.e. conditions) may also elect to complete a series of computer tasks inside a&#xD;
      standard, closed MRI scanner to examine changes in brain activity associated with the smoking&#xD;
      cessation counseling that participants will receive in the main study. In total, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete 2, one-hour fMRI scans: 1 before completing their first counseling&#xD;
      session and 1 during the final 7 days of the scheduled 8-week nicotine patch treatment&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This neuroimaging sub-study will examine a sub-set of the main study's (Smoking Cessation and&#xD;
      the Prevention of Post-Cessation Weight Gain) randomized clinical trial participants&#xD;
      (balanced sample between BAS+ and SC). Participants who meet MRI eligibility and elect to&#xD;
      participate in the sub-study will complete two, 1-hour functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) scans while completing computer tasks inside an MRI scanner. fMRI can identify&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying behavior change beyond self-report and behavioral measures. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine neural responses in three parallel pathways including: cognitive&#xD;
      control, food cue reactivity, and food reinforcement. The project's three aims address: 1)&#xD;
      identifying putative brain mechanisms underlying BAS+ (vs. SC) treatment for smoking&#xD;
      cessation and PCWG; 2) evaluating the relative contribution of treatment-induced changes in&#xD;
      task related brain signal (Food Cue Response, Food Reinforcement/Choice) in prediction of&#xD;
      post treatment food intake; and 3) testing whether BAS+ (vs. SC) induced change in neural&#xD;
      responses to food cues and food reinforcement is a stronger predictor of food intake among&#xD;
      smokers with greater cognitive control. The findings will address why BAS+ may be effective&#xD;
      in managing PCWG and provide insight into which patients are best supported by this&#xD;
      treatment. The investigators will also test whether cognitive control processes moderate the&#xD;
      influence of BAS+ treatment on food intake.&#xD;

    <description>Smoking abstinence will be assessed and biochemically verified at the 12-week Follow-Up Visit (12 weeks post target quit date). Seven-day point prevalence abstinence (no smoking, not even a puff, for at least 7 days prior to the assessment) will be biochemically verified by a carbon monoxide (CO) reading &lt; 8 parts per million and by saliva cotinine &lt; 15ng/ml.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline food intake (kcals/day) at 12 weeks post target quit date</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,12-Week Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Food intake will be assessed via 3 telephone-administered, 24-hour dietary recalls during the week after (or near) the Baseline Visit, Mid-Treatment 3 Visit (week 4), End of Treatment Visit (week 8) and the 12-week Follow-Up Visit. A trained member of the research staff will use a multi-pass method with an interactive computerized software program, the ASA24Â® (Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Recall), to determine total kcal/day (outcome variable).</description>

    <description>T2*-weighted Blood Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) images will be acquired using a wholebrain, single-shot gradient-echo (GE) echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence.

    <description>The goal of the BAS+ is to maintain a level of overall reward after cessation by structuring and enhancing opportunities for reinforcement to: (1) ensure that not smoking is as reinforcing as smoking; and (2) prevent an over-reliance on food as a substitute reinforcer for smoking so that PCWG does not precipitate smoking relapse.</description>

    <description>Overeating and weight gain are common concerns reported during smoking cessation treatment. Per convention, SC will address these concerns through standard recommendations to consume low-calorie snack foods, drink water, eat nutritious meals, and exercise, but will not include skills to shape the use of these suggestions.</description>

             will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the appropriate personnel prior to an&#xD;
             eligibility decision considering exceptions can be made based on the nature and&#xD;
             severity of the trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of brain or spinal tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pacemakers, certain metallic implants or objects, or presence of metal in the eye as&#xD;

             physical impairments) and/or conditions that may interfere with MRI and MRI-related&#xD;
             study visit procedures. All potential exclusionary circumstances and/or conditions&#xD;
             will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the appropriate personnel prior to an&#xD;
             eligibility decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of gunshot wounds. Injuries from BB guns will be evaluated on a case-by-case&#xD;

             of the Principal Investigator as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A Breath Alcohol Reading greater than 0.010 at either Scan Visit. Depending on the&#xD;
             circumstances, the Principal Investigator may permit the participant to remain in the&#xD;
