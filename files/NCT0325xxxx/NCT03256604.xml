  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with clinical symptoms of respiratory infection, rapid identification of cases&#xD;
      requiring antibiotic therapy is crucial to avoid development of multiple resistant bacteria.&#xD;
      Identification of local acute-phase reactants can help assess the host's response to&#xD;
      bacterial infection at the injury site. Here, the investigators developed an affordable,&#xD;
      stable, feasible, and accurate diagnostic tool based on a locally produced protein with&#xD;
      specific binding affinity to polysaccharides. The investigators further evaluated the ability&#xD;
      of the novel test strip to rule out pneumonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A lower respiratory tract infection is a serious situation that can abruptly become&#xD;
      complicated by sepsis, respiratory failure, lung tissue necrosis, and multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction. Hence, empiric antibiotic treatment is commonly initiated as soon as infection&#xD;
      is suspected and cultures and/or other diagnostic tests are procured, representing a major&#xD;
      reason for antibiotic prescription. Widespread antibiotic overuse and misuse have led to the&#xD;
      emergence of multiple resistant bacterial strains, posing a major health threat. There exists&#xD;
      a critical need for practical solutions to prevent antibiotic overuse, especially in&#xD;
      communities where antibiotics are available without prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiologic studies show that infection does not result from bacterial or viral&#xD;
      overgrowth alone, but rather from the microorganisms' penetration beyond the host immune&#xD;
      system. Therefore, infection assessment requires investigation of both microorganism presence&#xD;
      and the defense mechanisms activated within the patient's body. Bacteria overgrowth leads to&#xD;
      lung tissue inflammation, recruitment of white blood cells to the infected area, and&#xD;
      chemokine and cytokine production and release, which can cause the alveoli to become filled&#xD;
      with fluid, leading the patient to develop a cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and&#xD;
      dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections requires assessment of the&#xD;
      invading microorganism by examination of sputum using microscopy, quantitative culture, and&#xD;
      PCR. However, such microbiological investigations have limited value in pneumonia management.&#xD;
      Polymicrobial flora make it difficult to interpret cultures from patients with chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis. It is also difficult to evaluate cultures from nosocomial pneumonia since the&#xD;
      pathogenic bacteria are often identical to those appearing in the throat flora.&#xD;
      Immunosuppressed patients frequently produce sputum containing low number of white blood&#xD;
      cells. The patient's clinical signs, such as respiratory and circulatory status, are the most&#xD;
      reliable markers for determining treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practice, most physicians choose to examine additional markers at early stages to closely&#xD;
      monitor the effects of therapy, particularly in high-risk patients who have been admitted to&#xD;
      intensive care units. Commonly used systemic markers include body temperature, C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)&#xD;
      concentration reportedly increases during organ damage, such as that caused by infectious&#xD;
      diseases. Studies show increased HGF concentrations in serum and exhaled-breath condensate&#xD;
      from patients with pneumonia, with HGF presence being significantly correlated with survival.&#xD;
      Moreover, HGF levels markedly decrease within 48 hours of initiating appropriate antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) results indicate that HGF produced during acute&#xD;
      infection shows high affinity for the extracellular matrix component heparan sulfate&#xD;
      proteoglycan (HSPG). These findings suggest that HGF assessment in sputum could be a tool for&#xD;
      detecting bacterial infection at the site of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteins can be detected based on their specific interaction with a corresponding antibody.&#xD;
      However, this measurement system relies on specialized resources, limiting its usefulness in&#xD;
      non-equipped centers or as a self-test. Metachromasia is a characteristic color change&#xD;
      exhibited by certain aniline dyes upon binding to chromotropic substances. This phenomenon&#xD;
      has been widely used in histology. Methylene blue (O-Toluidine) is an excellent metachromatic&#xD;
      dye that changes from blue to pink upon binding to high-molecular-weight polysaccharides,&#xD;
      such as sulfated glycan. The pink dye will then quickly turn back to blue following addition&#xD;
      of a proportional amount of a protein with high affinity to sulfated glycan (inverted&#xD;
      metachromacia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators used this approach to develop a new strip test-referred to herein as&#xD;
      the index text-to assess the presence of dextran-sulfate-binding proteins in sputum. The&#xD;
      investigators then assessed the accuracy of this strip test for detecting bacterial infection&#xD;
      in sputum, by analyzing leftover sputum samples that were sent for examination to the&#xD;
      Department of Microbiology, University hospital in Link√∂ping.&#xD;

    <description>We assessed immunoreactive human HGF and calprotectin (Human S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer) concentrations by ELISA (80 randomly chosen samples) using commercially available ELISA kits (Quantikine ELISA; R&amp;D systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). This method measures HGF and calprotectin in serum, plasma, culture media, and other biological fluids. Sputum samples that had been stored -20C were thawed and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 minutes prior to analysis. The minimum detectable dose (MDD) as defined by supplier for this assay was 0.04 ng/ml for HGF and 0.086 ng/ml for calprotectin.</description>

    <description>Paired analysis was performed on 47 randomly chosen samples. Measurements and ligand immobilization procedures were conducted using a Biacore 2000 system (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Three different ligands were immobilized in separate channels on the SPR-chip. The ligands were affinity purified polyclonal antibodies directed against HGF peptides mapping at the N-terminus of human HGFŒ≤ (N-19), the N-terminus of human HGFŒ± (N-17), and amino acids 32-176 of human HGFŒ± (H-145). These ligands were diluted 1:10 in 10 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.5) and immobilized to carboxymethylated dextran CM5 chips</description>

    <time_frame>The data was obtained from paper journals from patients that were admitted (December to March) to the Department of Infectious diseases in Link√∂ping in 1970,1980 and1990</time_frame>
    <description>We studied the archived paper journals from patients that were admitted to our ward and dismissed under diagnosis pneumonia/bronchopneumonia, beginning in 1970. We aimed to identify the diagnostic approaches that were used at the same center and had an impact on the correct diagnosis of pneumonia. Patients received a code depending on the date of admission to the ward from January-December and were registered under the code in a book. The codes belonging to a particular diagnosis were collected on a card and kept separately in boxes (one card corresponded to one diagnosis and one year). We randomly chose the first 40 coded cases with a diagnosis of Pneumonia (ICD-9 diagnosis code 486.9) in 1970, 1980, and 1990 and collected the paper journals and identified the criteria for diagnosis.</description>
