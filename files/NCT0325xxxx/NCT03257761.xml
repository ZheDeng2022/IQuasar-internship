      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of guadecitabine and how well it&#xD;
      works when given together with durvalumab in treating patients with liver, pancreatic, bile&#xD;
      duct, or gallbladder cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Guadecitabine may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by&#xD;
      targeting certain cells. Giving guadecitabine and durvalumab may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with liver, pancreatic, bile duct, or gallbladder cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the dose limiting toxicities and determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose/recommended phase 2 dose of the combination of guadecitabine and durvalumab. (Dose&#xD;
      escalation part) II. To evaluate the objective response rate (per Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) for the combination of guadecitabine and durvalumab in&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma cohorts, respectively.&#xD;
      (Expansion part)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the safety and tolerability of the combination of guadecitabine and&#xD;
      durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the progression-free and overall survival of patients with advanced&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), pancreatic cancer and biliary cancers treated with the&#xD;
      combination of guadecitabine and durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Correlate programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)&#xD;
      expression on various cells within tumor samples and anti-tumor effect (response rate and&#xD;
      survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlate effector T cells (Teff)/regulatory T cells (Treg) ratio in the tumor and&#xD;
      anti-tumor effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlate granulocytic and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) level in&#xD;
      the peripheral blood using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and anti-tumor effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate changes in inflammatory T cell signatures pre and post treatment and potential&#xD;
      associations with anti-tumor effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess the induction, activation, expansion and tumor infiltration of tumor&#xD;
      neo-epitope-specific T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Explore changes in gene methylation and expression with anti-tumor effect, with&#xD;
      particular emphasis on the ancestry-informative marker (AIM) gene panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Correlate immunologic changes in pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cell (PBMCs) and anti-tumor effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of guadecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive guadecitabine subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and durvalumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 8. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.&#xD;
