      Objective: to compare the changes of the mechanical properties measured by tensile test and&#xD;
      three point bending test of two NiTi archwires (heat-activated and superelastic); when&#xD;
      exposed to the oral conditions during the first three months of orthodontic treatment and to&#xD;
      evaluated their clinical efficacy in lower arch crowding resolution in the anterior&#xD;
      mandibular arch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Randomized clinical trial in 54 orthodontic patients with moderate crowding. They&#xD;
      are going to be randomly assigned in to two intervention groups, each group with 27 patients.&#xD;
      One group are going to be treated with heat-activated NiTi archwires and the other group with&#xD;
      superelastic NiTi archwires. The patients are going to be followed up for three months and&#xD;
      cast models will be taken every month. Measures of anterior lower arch crowding resolution&#xD;
      are going to be taken by previously-calibrated operators. Six archwires of each group will be&#xD;
      chosen at random and will have tensile test and three-point bending test and the mechanical&#xD;
      properties are going to measure before and after its clinical use. The outcomes are going to&#xD;
      be determined and compared between groups, with correspondent statistical test and the&#xD;
      results are going to be analyzed.&#xD;

      PICO QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the amount of the resolution of the anterior lower arch crowding increase in the&#xD;
           patients with superelastic NiTi archwire compared with the patients with heat-activated&#xD;
           NiTi archwire during the first three months of orthodontic treatment and/or its&#xD;
           mechanical properties change after three months of clinical use?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Orthodontic patients with moderate anterior mandibular crowding Intervention:&#xD;
      .014&quot; Superelastic NiTI archwire (3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA) Comparison: .014&quot; Heat activated&#xD;
      NiTi archwire (3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantity of resolution of anterior mandibular crowding every month for three months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mechanical properties measured by tensile test and three point bending test before and&#xD;
           after the three first months of orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: Archwires deformation under oral conditions during the first three months&#xD;
      of the orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL AIM To compare the changes of the mechanical properties measured by tensile test and&#xD;
      three point bending test of two NiTi archwires (heat-activated and super-elastic); when&#xD;
      exposed to the oral conditions during the first three months of orthodontic treatment and to&#xD;
      evaluated the clinical efficacy in lower anterior arch crowding resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To recruit 54 orthodontic patients, 13-25 years old, without extraction into a&#xD;
           randomized clinical trial design, single-blinded trial, into the effects of NiTi&#xD;
           arch-wires alloy in the resolution of the anterior mandibular crowding during the three&#xD;
           first months of the orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that, compared the resolution of the anterior mandibular crowding&#xD;
           in the first three months of orthodontic treatment, with those to receive NiTi&#xD;
           heat-activated arch-wire, those assigned to receive superelastic NiTi archwire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More amount of resolution of the anterior mandibular crowding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences in the changes of mechanical properties after clinical use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less archwire deformation&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERVIEW OF DESIGN Study Design: Randomized clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized clinical trial in 54 orthodontic patients with moderate crowding. They are&#xD;
           going to be randomly assigned in to two intervention groups, each group with 27&#xD;
           patients. One group are going to be treated with heat-activated NiTi archwires and the&#xD;
           other group with super-elastic NiTi archwires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blinding: It is not possible to blind patients and clinical staff, but we are going to&#xD;
           blind the operators who will perform the measurements and the data analysis&#xD;
           (single-blinded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are going to have an exact clinical protocol for both groups with the only difference&#xD;
      being in the NiTI arch-wire alloy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBT prescription .022 slot. Alginate impressions and cast models at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study, immediately after the first, second and third month of the orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of anterior lower arch crowding resolution are going to be taken by&#xD;
      previously-calibrated operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arch-wires deformation are going to be evaluated by visual observation every month in monthly&#xD;
      clinical visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measures of the mechanical properties measured by tensile test and three point bending&#xD;
      test of two NiTi archwires (heat-activated and super-elastic); are going to take before and&#xD;
      after the first three months of orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN FOR SAMPLING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Orthodontic patients from the orthodontic department clinic of the UniCIEO&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No probabilistic: convenience sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consecutive sample of consenting patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLANS FOR RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of the Clinic University (UniCIEO) that meet the selection criteria and accept to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN PREDICTOR VARIABLE&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Type of NiTi Alloy used (NiTi superelastic arch-wire; NiTi heat-activated arch-wire)&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENCIAL CONFOUNDING VARIABLES - Age&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Sex&#xD;
&#xD;

      - Quantity of anterior mandibular crowding resolution measured monthly&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical Properties Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Measured in vitro with an Instrom before and after three months of the orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment by tensile test and three point bending test&#xD;

&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ISSUES&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPROACH TO STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be processed in the statistics program Stata 14 (Stata Corp 2011. Stata&#xD;
      Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: Stata Corp LP). Qualitative variables&#xD;
      are going to be described by frequencies and percentages; quantitative variables will resume&#xD;
      as average and standard deviation. The association between qualitative variables will be&#xD;
      calculated by Chi-square test. For two group comparisons, we are going to use the t test or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Significance level is going to be set at P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS, SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis H0: compared the resolution of the anterior mandibular crowding in the first&#xD;
      three months of orthodontic treatment, with those to receive NiTi heat-activated archwire,&#xD;
      those assigned to receive superelastic NiTi archwire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Same amount of resolution of the anterior mandibular crowding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Same changes in mechanical properties after clinical use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Same archwire deformation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate Hypothesis Ha: compared the resolution of the anterior mandibular crowding in the&#xD;
      first three months of orthodontic treatment, with those to receive NiTi heat-activated&#xD;
      archwire, those assigned to receive superelastic NiTi archwire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More amount of resolution of the anterior mandibular crowding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences in the changes of mechanical properties after clinical use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less archwire deformation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation and power:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was calculated with the software Epidat (software Epidat version 4.1). With 90% power and&#xD;
      a 5% level of significance and with standard deviation data from a previous study, the sample&#xD;
      should comprise at least 27 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY CONTROL AND DATA MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias Control:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The principal investigators are going to train the observers in the theoretical and&#xD;
           practical issues of all the measures of the variables of this study developing an&#xD;
           operations manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The observers are going to be calibrated and evaluated in intra and extra observer&#xD;
           concordance by Bland Altman plot with previously fixed acceptable limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All variables, are going to be re-measured after two weeks in subjects randomly&#xD;
           selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Random and systematic errors are going to be calculated with Dahlberg´s formula and&#xD;
           dependent t test, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Same clinical protocol for groups, the only difference in the intervention. All clinical&#xD;
           and laboratory procedures will meet quality standards. The research team will take care&#xD;
           of the data in order to be reliable and accurate The research team will take care that&#xD;
           complete and accurate records will be maintained Statistical methods are going to be&#xD;
           pre-specified and carefully followed The results are going to be clearly and fairly&#xD;
           reported&#xD;
