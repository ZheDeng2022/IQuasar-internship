  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has recently been renewed interest in the measurement of post percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR). Previous studies have suggested that&#xD;
      post-PCI FFR values ≥0.90 are associated with better clinical outcomes for patients but the&#xD;
      available data suggest that despite angiographically satisfactory results, this is actually&#xD;
      achieved in less than 40% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main mechanisms for sub-optimal post-PCI FFR measurements have been proposed to be&#xD;
      suboptimal stent deployment, unmasking of a second lesion in the target vessel post PCI,&#xD;
      residual diffuse disease in the untreated segments and pressure drift (a technical artefact&#xD;
      of pressure wire technology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using post-PCI FFR to guide stent optimisation and/or further intervention in the target&#xD;
      vessel has been shown to increase the frequency of achieving optimal post-PCI FFR results&#xD;
      (and therefore presumably better clinical outcomes). However, there are additional costs&#xD;
      involved in the routine use of post-PCI FFR and it is not clear just how often it is even&#xD;
      possible to increase the initial post-PCI FFR to ≥0.90. This uncertainty means that it is&#xD;
      currently difficult to either recommend the routine use of post-PCI FFR or justify its cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective study to assess the feasibility of achieving post-PCI&#xD;
      FFR ≥0.90 during standard PCI procedures in consecutive patients. The study would also&#xD;
      attempt to elucidate the mechanisms for sub-optimal FFR results when they occur. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate using the data from this developmental study to support a subsequent&#xD;
      funding application for a definitive phase 3 study of the impact of FFR targeted PCI on&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Original hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple Physiology-guided Incremental Optimisation Strategy (PIOS) can increase the&#xD;
      proportion of patients undergoing PCI in whom a post-PCI FFR ≥0.90 can be achieved from 40%&#xD;
      to 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental details and design of proposed investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial of a physiologly-guided optimisation strategy to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of increasing the proportion of post-PCI FFR measurements ≥0.90 in a consecutive&#xD;
      series of patients undergoing standard PCI procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      260 consecutive patients with stable angina referred for invasive management to the cardiac&#xD;
      catheterisation lab who have been selected to undergo PCI based on either angiographic&#xD;
      appearances or prior FFR assessment. Patients will be caffeine free for &gt;12 hours&#xD;
      pre-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained prior to cardiac catheterisation in all potential subjects&#xD;
      conforming to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be randomised to one of two groups (described below) and PCI will be&#xD;
      performed, using a pressure guidewire, according to standard practice at the Golden Jubilee&#xD;
      National Hospital (including lesion pre-dilation and post-dilation of the stented segment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (PIOS Group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operator-blinded coronary physiology measurements will be recorded pre and post PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the post-PCI FFR is ≥0.90, no further intervention will be performed and the procedure is&#xD;
      considered complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If post-PCI FFR is &lt;0.90, the result will be disclosed to the operator and a hyperaemic&#xD;
      pressure wire pullback during a standard peripheral intravenous adenosine infusion&#xD;
      (140mcg/kg/min) will be performed. Depending on the result the operator would then have the&#xD;
      following options:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. If there is a step-up of ≥0.05 across the stented segment(s) further post-dilatation with&#xD;
      a 0.25 - 0.50mm larger non-compliant balloon to at least 18 atmospheres should be performed&#xD;
      followed by repeat FFR. Alternatively, the operator may choose to employ intracoronary&#xD;
      imaging (IVUS or OCT) to guide post-dilation/optimisation of the stented segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. If there is a step-up of ≥0.05 across a relatively focal (&lt;20mm) unstented segment which&#xD;
      is technically suitable for further stenting then a further stent should be implanted&#xD;
      followed by repeat FFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. If the FFR remains &lt;0.90 after steps A +/- B, a further FFR pullback will be performed. If&#xD;
      the criteria for Step B are again met, one additional stent may be deployed and a final FFR&#xD;
      pullback performed. Following this, the FFR result will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. If the residual pressure gradient is interpreted to reflect diffuse atherosclerosis with&#xD;
      no focal step-ups, the result is accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. At the end of the procedure the pressure wire sensor will be withdrawn to the tip of the&#xD;
      guiding catheter and compared with the aortic pressure. A pressure drift of ≤0.03 will be&#xD;
      accepted and the final FFR result adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. If there is a drift of ≥0.04, the wire should be re-equalised and the final FFR&#xD;
      measurement be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. The patients will have their demographics and procedure details recorded. All patients&#xD;
      will be asked to complete follow-up questionnaires at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (Control Group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre and post-PCI coronary physiology measurements will be recorded but not disclosed to the&#xD;
      operator. The angiographically defined result will be accepted. The patients will have their&#xD;
      demographics and procedure details recorded. All patients will be asked to complete follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected value of results&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Confirmation that the proposed PIOS protocol significantly increases the proportion of&#xD;
           patients obtaining a physiologically optimal post-PCI result will demonstrate the&#xD;
           feasibility of this strategy and should lead to an increase in post-PCI pressure wire&#xD;
           usage to achieve physiologically optimal results for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators hypothesise that the PIOS intervention can increase the proportion of&#xD;
           patients achieving this target from 40% to 60% and believe that an increment of at least&#xD;
           this magnitude would be necessary to make a future larger study with both&#xD;
           patient-oriented clinical (target vessel failure) and health care system (resource&#xD;
           utilisation) outcomes acceptable to the interventional cardiology community and&#xD;
           potential funders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary outcome measures, albeit underpowered for clinical outcomes in this study,&#xD;
           will hopefully still give a signal that achieving a target post-PCI FFR ≥0.90 does yield&#xD;
           objective benefits for patients. This could then form the basis for a larger phase 3&#xD;
           trial to confirm improved clinical outcomes and cost- effectiveness of FFR-targeted PCI&#xD;

    <description>Operator-blinded pre and post-PCI coronary physiology measurements will be recorded. If FFR is &lt;0.90, the result will be disclosed to the operator and a hyperaemic pressure wire pullback will be performed during a standard peripheral intravenous adenosine infusion (140mcg/kg/min).&#xD;
The operator will then follow the PIOS protocol to attempt to obtain the target optimal post-PCI FFR result.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients &gt;18 years of age with coronary artery disease (including stable angina and&#xD;
             stabilised non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)) who are able to provide&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PCI in a coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PCI to an in-stent restenosis (ISR) lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PCI to a target artery providing Rentrop grade 2 or 3 collateral blood supply to&#xD;
             another vessel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to receive adenosine (for example, severe reactive airway disease, marked&#xD;
             hypotension, or advanced atrioventricular block without pacemaker).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent (within 1 week prior to cardiac catheterization) ST-segment elevation&#xD;
             myocardial infarction (STEMI) in any arterial distribution (not specifically target&#xD;
             lesion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction &lt;30%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal insufficiency such that an additional 20 to 30 mL of contrast would, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the operator, pose unwarranted risk to the patient.&#xD;
