      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Obesity is a global pandemic affects all age groups and is independent risk&#xD;
      factors for most chronic diseases. Dietary intervention is an essential component of obesity&#xD;
      management. Dietary fibre supplements have the potential to facilitate weight reduction based&#xD;
      on their viscosity. Up to date, the evidence of effects of some fibres on weight is&#xD;
      inadequate, and literature provides insufficient information about the effects of the fibre&#xD;
      viscosity in weight management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs will be conducted to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of viscous fibres, (agar, alginate, b-glucan from oat and barley, guar gum,&#xD;
      glucomannan, pectin, PGX, psyllium), on body weight reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Only randomised controlled trials are accepted. The trails must have one of the&#xD;
      selected fibres as a supplement, and the outcomes must have body weight, BMI, waist&#xD;
      circumference, or body fat percentage. Studies shorter than 4 weeks are excluded. Three&#xD;
      databases, (Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane library), were searched through 04/03/2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: After removing duplicates, 82 studies will be reviewed in full. Significance: This&#xD;
      meta-analysis is the first meta-analysis that is based on fibre viscosity, and it will&#xD;
      quantify the effect of each fibre in improving weight loss. It will also direct future&#xD;
      research in the best direction to further explore this area.&#xD;

      Background: Obesity is a global pandemic and is an independent risk factor for chronic&#xD;
      disease. Dietary intervention is an essential component of obesity management. Observational&#xD;
      studies show an inverse relationship between dietary fibres and body weight. Therefore,&#xD;
      supplements of dietary fibres have the potential to facilitate weight reduction, possibly on&#xD;
      the basis of the viscous properties of the fibre. Viscosity is the ability of gel forming&#xD;
      that holds water and increase satiety and decreases the amount of intake food. This ability&#xD;
      makes dietary fibre supplements considered as appetite suppressants. To date, the evidence of&#xD;
      the effect of dietary fibre on weight is inconsistent and controversial and may be dependent&#xD;
      on the ability of fibre to induce viscosity. Three previous meta-analyses on Konjac show&#xD;
      inconsistency on the effect and its significance. In addition, other meta-analyses on&#xD;
      individual viscous fibres show that some viscous fibre does not has an effect on body weight.&#xD;
      This is the first meta-analysis that studies the effect of all these fibres together based on&#xD;
      their viscosity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs will be conducted to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of viscous and non-viscous fibres on body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and body&#xD;
      fat percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: To meet eligibility criteria, the study should be: randomized, controlled, include&#xD;
      one of the selected fibres (agar, alginate, b-glucan from oat and barley, guar gum, konjac,&#xD;
      pectin, PGX, Psyllium, and xanthan) as a supplement and one of the required outcomes (body&#xD;
      weight, BMI, waist circumference or body fat percentage). Studies shorter than 4 weeks in&#xD;
      duration will be excluded. Three databases (Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library) were&#xD;
      searched. After the search, a title/abstract screening was done to exclude the ineligible&#xD;
      articles before extracting data from full eligible studies. Data were extracted using a&#xD;
      PROFORMA. Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan) was used to carry out the analysis using generic&#xD;
      inverse variance method (GIVM). Change from baseline and standard deviation were utilized in&#xD;
      random effect model to get the pooled mean difference effect. Subgroup analyses were done&#xD;
      using meta-regression in STATA to explore confounders. GRADE approach was conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Databases were searched through 04/03/2016 and updated on 11/04/2017. Twenty-seven&#xD;
      studies were eligible for analyses . The overall effect of viscous fibres on body weight was&#xD;
      a significant reduction of -0.38 kg [95%CI: -0.3, -0.13] (P=0.003). BMI, waist circumference&#xD;
      and body fat were also significantly reduced: -0.41 kg/m2 [95% CI: -0.61, -0.21](p = 0.0001)&#xD;
      -0.78 cm[95%CI: -1.33, -0.24] (p = ) and -1.28 %[95% CI: -2.09, -0.46] (p = ), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that evaluated&#xD;
      separately the effect of viscous and non-viscous fibres on weight in the general population.&#xD;
      The analysis may help guide diet recommendations for obesity and identify the effect of&#xD;
      fibres to direct future research this area.&#xD;
