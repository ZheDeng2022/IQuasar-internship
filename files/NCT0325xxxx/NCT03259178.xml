  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sports-related concussion affect 1.6 to 3.8 million people each year in the United States.&#xD;
      Despite increased media attention and awareness campaigns, the exact number is difficult to&#xD;
      determine due to underreporting by athletes. The types of symptoms experienced with a&#xD;
      concussion depend on the area of the brain that was affected. The most frequent symptoms&#xD;
      include: headaches, cognitive difficulties, dizziness, neck pain, visual disturbances,&#xD;
      difficulty sleeping, and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the availability of many treatment options, some patients continue to experience many&#xD;
      symptoms - such as headaches, dizziness, visual disturbances, balance problems, sensitivity&#xD;
      to light, and difficulties concentrating - that negatively affect school, work, and quality&#xD;
      of life for long periods of time. All of these symptoms are similarly experienced by&#xD;
      individuals with visual dysfunctions, such as the inability of the eyes to move together.&#xD;
      This finding has led some to recommend a visual component in concussion management.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine whether changes in the results of 7&#xD;
      binocular vision tests (BVT) over time in patients with concussion correlate with changes in&#xD;
      concussion symptoms. The investigators will measure 46 concussion patients aged 18 to 30&#xD;
      years with each of these tests and assess their concussion symptoms on up to four separate&#xD;
      visits, which depend on when the patient's symptoms improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tests the investigators will evaluate measure: 3D vision, uniform movement of the eyes,&#xD;
      ability of the eyes to adapt to a target moving towards and/or away from the eyes, quick&#xD;
      movements of the eyes, natural alignment of the eyes, and double vision as a target is moved&#xD;
      towards the eyes. In addition, concussion symptoms will be measured by a standardized&#xD;
      concussion questionnaire (SCAT3) at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of each BVT will be entered into a statistical model with the participant's&#xD;
      concussion symptom score to determine if there is an association between the change in&#xD;
      symptoms and the change in the results of the tests.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sports-related concussion affect 1.6 to 3.8 million people each year in the United States.&#xD;
      Despite increased media attention and awareness campaigns, the exact incidence is difficult&#xD;
      to determine due to underreporting by athletes. Concussion is defined as a set of&#xD;
      pathological reactions leading to direct damage of the brain, which may occur from a direct&#xD;
      or indirect blow to the head. The types of symptoms experienced depend on the area of the&#xD;
      brain that was affected. The most frequent symptoms include: headaches, cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties, dizziness, neck pain, visual disturbances, difficulty sleeping, and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the availability of many treatment options such as neurological and psychological&#xD;
      tests, some patients continue to experience many symptoms - such as headaches, dizziness,&#xD;
      visual disturbances, balance problems, sensitivity to light, and difficulties concentrating -&#xD;
      that negatively affect school, work, and quality of life for long periods of time. All of&#xD;
      these symptoms are similarly experienced by individuals with visual dysfunctions such as&#xD;
      dysfunctions of binocular function or convergence insufficiency. This finding has led some to&#xD;
      recommend a visual component in concussion management. Therefore, the purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to determine if changes in the results of 7 binocular vision tests (BVT) over time in&#xD;
      patients with concussion correlate with changes in concussion symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure 46 concussion patients with each of these tests and the SCAT3&#xD;
      on up to 4 separate milestone time points as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  M1 = baseline; as soon as possible after recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  M2 = when participants qualitatively feel that their concussion symptoms have&#xD;
           &quot;significantly improved&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  M3 = when participants are symptom-free at with activity for 1 week, or at 3 months&#xD;
           post-enrolment in the study, whichever comes first. This milestone will also be the last&#xD;
           measurement and mark the end of their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  M* = Participants who do not have significant improvement (i.e. M2) within 2 weeks of&#xD;
           baseline testing will also be tested at the 2-week mark. They will still be tested at&#xD;
           both M2 and M3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information relevant to the study will be collected in order to appropriately&#xD;
      describe the population and evaluate the potential effect modification of these factors on&#xD;
      the observed correlations. Demographic variables to be recorded include: age, sex, highest&#xD;
      level of education achieved, the use of corrective lenses for vision problems, occupation,&#xD;
      any relevant past medical history (i.e. migraines, vision problems, medication, etc.), the&#xD;
      main sports activity the athlete is involved in, and the last of activities that the athlete&#xD;
      will be returning to after healing, with an emphasis on high risk activities for concussions.&#xD;
      Furthermore, information relevant to the concussion event will be recorded to characterize&#xD;
      the injury. This includes information regarding the accident resulting in concussion,&#xD;
      activity at the time of injury, and the mechanism of injury (the presence or absence of head&#xD;
      contact is important).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete the symptom portion (section 3) of the validated SCAT3 form that&#xD;
      is part of the accepted standard for management of concussion. The symptoms listed are:&#xD;
      headache, &quot;pressure in head&quot;, neck pain, nausea or vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision,&#xD;
      balance problems, sensitivity to light or noise, &quot;feeling slowed down&quot;, feeling like &quot;in a&#xD;
      fog&quot;, &quot;don't feel right&quot;, difficulty concentrating, difficulty remembering, fatigue or low&#xD;
      energy, confusion, drowsiness, trouble falling asleep, more emotional, irritability, sadness,&#xD;
      nervous or anxious. Symptoms are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 6 (severe). The overall&#xD;
      symptom score is the sum of all individual symptom scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include an additional seven questions about symptoms - that are asked&#xD;
      by some clinicians: &quot;Symptoms worse with physical activity&quot;, &quot;Symptoms worse with mental&#xD;
      activity&quot;, &quot;Motion sickness&quot;, &quot;Discomfort while reading&quot;, &quot;Discomfort while using a&#xD;
      computer&quot;, &quot;Double vision&quot;, &quot;Pain behind your eyes&quot;. Each symptom is again scored between 0&#xD;
      (none) to 6 (severe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BVTs will be examined, which differ from optometry tests in that they use more advanced&#xD;
      equipment which can measure very small deviations in several domains of the visual system.&#xD;
      These BVT measure various elements of the visual system and will be described in detail&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gross stereoscopic acuity: (range 0 - 15 arc seconds) Our binocular vision allows us to&#xD;
           see in three dimensions (3D), or more simply, to perceive depth. In this tests, seated&#xD;
           participants wearing 3D glasses are shown images. Inability to see depth or in 3D will&#xD;
           cause the images to appear as points instead of raised objects. The objects are&#xD;
           presented in different stages, with each stage requiring participants to discriminate&#xD;
           different levels of depth perception. The test is scored in optical units - ranging from&#xD;
           0 to 15 arc-seconds. The maximum score corresponds to the level where the last object&#xD;
           was identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Convergence measured by &quot;motor punctum proximum&quot;: (cm) When an object is moving towards&#xD;
           our eyes, they symmetrically converge in order to maintain focus. There is, however, a&#xD;
           point at which our eyes no longer symmetrically converge, which is referred to as the&#xD;
           point of convergence or &quot;motor punctum proximum&quot;. This test measures the distance (cm)&#xD;
           between the bridge of the nose and the point of convergence in seated participants as an&#xD;
           object is moved closer to their head.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Convergence fusional proximum: (diopters, prism convergence units) This test is similar&#xD;
           to (2). When an object is moving closer to our head, our eyes symmetrically converge to&#xD;
           maintain focus. However, when the object is moved beyond the participant's ability&#xD;
           converge, the participant will begin to see two images (double vision). This test&#xD;
           measures the distance between the bridge of the nose and the point where double vision&#xD;
           (cm) occurs in seated participants as an object is moved closer to their head.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Binocular fusion with convergence: (diopters, prism convergence units) This test&#xD;
           measures how well a participant can adapt to challenges in focusing light on the retina.&#xD;
           This measure is comprised of two almost identical tests - differing only by distance.&#xD;
           One test occurs when an object placed at 3m from the seated participant, and the other&#xD;
           with an object placed at 30cm from the seated participant. Light from the object is&#xD;
           passed through a prism - this is analogous to moving the object further from the body.&#xD;
           In response, the eyes must diverge (separate) to focus on the object, just as they would&#xD;
           if the image actually moved away from the body. Different prisms are used to create&#xD;
           increasing challenges for the participants. The score for these tests is the maximum&#xD;
           amount of prism convergence (dioptres, noted on the prism as one would note diopters on&#xD;
           eye glasses) that the seated participant can accommodate at 3m and at 30cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Binocular fusion with divergence: (diopters, prism convergence units) This is the same&#xD;
           test as (4), except that the prisms diverge the light and the participant has to&#xD;
           converge (instead of diverge) their eyes to maintain focus. The score for these tests is&#xD;
           the maximum amount of prism divergence (diopters, noted on the prism, as one would note&#xD;
           diopters on eye glasses) that the seated participant can accommodate at 3m and at 30 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Saccadic movements or oculomotor capacity: (Score = bad, medium, good) Saccadic&#xD;
           movements are rapid movements of the eyes that abruptly alter the point of fixation.&#xD;
           During this test, lights will appear and disappear - in different locations on the&#xD;
           screen - at a rate of 100 flashes per minute, for a total of 2 minutes. The participant&#xD;
           assumes a tandem stance (dominant foot placed in front of non-dominant foot and in line)&#xD;
           and stands an arm's length away from the screen. The participant is told to keep his/her&#xD;
           head still, only moving his/her eyes to focus on the appearing lights. The test result&#xD;
           is scored by the clinician based on a global qualitative impression over the entire 2&#xD;
           minute duration of the tests, with 3 separate sub-scores on an ordinal scale for quality&#xD;
           - for synchronization (bad, medium, good) and saccadic correction (many corrections, few&#xD;
           corrections, no corrections). The three sub-scores are combined into an overall score&#xD;
           according to our industry partner's (Apexk) proprietary algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Anatomic oculomotor deviation: (diopters, prism convergence units) This test measures&#xD;
           the natural deviation of the eyes (heterophobia) and also allows for the detection of&#xD;
           strabismus. In strabismus, anatomic deviation is easily detected as the individual's&#xD;
           eyes are misaligned, such that the individual's dominant eye is looking at the object of&#xD;
           interest, but the &quot;lazy/deviated&quot; eye is not. In heterophobia, anatomic deviation is not&#xD;
           visible to the naked eye; in fact, the deviation must be triggered by covering one eye&#xD;
           at a time in sequence, to trigger the deviation. This measure is comprised of two&#xD;
           identical tests, differing by distance: one occurs with an object placed 3m from the&#xD;
           seated participant (far vision), and the other with an object placed 30cm from the&#xD;
           seated participant (near vision). In this test, seated participants focus on an object.&#xD;
           The clinician covers and uncovers the participant's eyes to trigger movements and uses a&#xD;
           prism to cancel these movements. The prism that achieves this cancellation of movements&#xD;
           is the measure of anatomic deviation. The score of the test is the rating of the prism&#xD;
           that achieves the movement cancellation, for the object placed at 30cm and at 3m.&#xD;
           Participants with strabismus are excluded from our study as strabismus is a&#xD;
           contraindication to post-concussion visual training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the change in&#xD;
      symptoms and the change in the results of the binocular vision tests. There are at least&#xD;
      three milestone timepoints for each participant: baseline (M1), significant improvement in&#xD;
      symptoms (M2), and when the participant is asymptomatic with activity or 3 months post&#xD;
      baseline testing (M3). Participants that do not have significant improvement at least 2 weeks&#xD;
      post-M1 - will be measured at 2 weeks (M*) to determine if the visual tests of function have&#xD;
      improved. These participants will also still be measured at M2 and M3 - for a total of 4&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These milestones represent patient states: symptomatic, improved, resolution/end of study.&#xD;
      For our primary analyses, any patient who does not improve significantly over 3 months would&#xD;
      have measures at M1, M*, and M3 (end of study). Because they would not have improved in&#xD;
      symptoms, including them in a correlation between changes in symptoms and changes in test&#xD;
      results is not meaningful. Therefore, they will be excluded from the primary analyses and&#xD;
      will be analyzed separately. This is because the investigators are still interested in&#xD;
      knowing whether the test results can change in the absence of a change in symptoms. The first&#xD;
      step is to assess if there is a correlation between the score on BVT and the participants'&#xD;
      symptoms (Sx) at each time a milestone occurs. For clarity, the analysis is conducted from a&#xD;
      dataset where each line of data is represented by: Participant, Time (M1, M2, M3), Symptom&#xD;
      Score, and BVT Score. The overall statistical model is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      E [BVT] = β0 + β1*Sx + β2*M2 + β3*Sx*M2 + β4*M3 + β5*Sx*M3 + ε&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where M2=1 when the Sx and BVT are measured at M2 and is equal to 0 otherwise, M3=1 when the&#xD;
      Sx and BVT are measured at M3 and is equal to 0 otherwise, and ε refers to a random effect&#xD;
      variable that is used to account for repeated measures on the same participants. In this&#xD;
      model, the coefficient β1 is the association between all of the participants' symptom scores&#xD;
      and the BVTs. This is because M2=M3=0, so the terms to the right of β1*Sx all equal 0. In&#xD;
      this model, testing if the time of measurement (i.e. M1, M2, or M3) affects the correlation&#xD;
      is straightforward. If the correlation is the same at M2 as it is at M1, then the&#xD;
      coefficient, β3, will be 0. Similarly, if the correlation is the same at M3 as it is at M1,&#xD;
      then the coefficient, β5, will be 0. If both β3, and β5 are found to be close to zero, then&#xD;
      the associations are independent of the milestone at which the data were collected and the&#xD;
      analysis will be re-run with all the data together in a simplified analysis to increase the&#xD;
      power of subgroup analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the association in change of BVT with change in Sx will be measured. For these&#xD;
      analyses, the data to the relevant milestones will be restricted. The statistical models are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      E [BVT M2 - BVT M1 | M2=1, M1=1] = β0 + β6*(SxM2-SxM1) + ε E [BVT M3 - BVT M2 | M3=1, M2=1] =&#xD;
      β0 + β7*(SxM3-SxM2) + ε where BVT M# refers to the BVT measured at milestone number = #, and&#xD;
      SxM# refers to the symptom score measured at milestone number = #.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the values of β6 and β7 are found to be similar, then the associations are, again,&#xD;
      independent of the milestones at which the data were collected. As above, the analysis will&#xD;
      be re-run with all the data together in a simplified analysis to increase the power of&#xD;
      subgroup analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above equations can be used to assess the association in change of total symptom score to&#xD;
      change in total BVT score, change in any one symptom score and change in any one BVT, and&#xD;
      changes in subgroups of symptom scores and changes in subgroups of BVTs. Because a deficiency&#xD;
      in a particular visual function would be expected to cause only certain symptoms and only&#xD;
      affect certain BVTs, our primary analyses will be restricted to 5 comparisons, discussed in&#xD;
      the outcome measure section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gross stereoscopic acuity and anatomic oculomotor deviation are tests that measure visual&#xD;
      function that existed prior to the concussion, and are, therefore, not expected to correlate&#xD;
      with any changes in symptoms. These tests are conducted as part of a general visual&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following symptoms in the SCAT3 are not expected to correlate with any visual tests:&#xD;
      pressure in the head, neck pain, sensitivity to noise, feeling slowed down, confusion,&#xD;
      drowsiness, trouble falling asleep, more emotional, irritability, sadness, nervous or&#xD;
      anxious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary analyses will include associations between the total symptom score and the&#xD;
      total BVT score, and the associations between the scores for each symptom and the scores for&#xD;
      each binocular vision measure separately. In addition, the investigators will explore&#xD;
      associations within subgroups of the participants based on clinician impression if there are&#xD;
      abnormalities in the visual system at the first visit (y/n), time between concussion and&#xD;
      baseline testing (&lt;14 days, 14-28 days, &gt;28 days), past history of concussion (y/n), and past&#xD;
      treatment for psychological condition (y/n).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As concussions are common, this study has the potential to contribute to improved management&#xD;
      for the many patients suffering from dizziness and other symptoms following a concussion.&#xD;
