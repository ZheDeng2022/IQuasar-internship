      Purpose of Study (The Effect of Non-Viscous Fibre Supplementation on Glycemic Control (NVFS &amp;&#xD;
      GC) in Individuals with Diabetes Mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the remarkable advancement in pharmacotherapy, diabetes mellitus remains a&#xD;
      major concern with more than 300 millions living with its complications including CVD.&#xD;
      Nutrition is a cornerstone in diabetes management, and increasing total dietary fibre have&#xD;
      been shown to decrease HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, fructosamine, and HOMA-IR.&#xD;
      However, the main underlying mechanism is still not fully understood, and the specific type&#xD;
      and proportion of fibre supplementation to be recommended for such individuals is still&#xD;
      controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the available findings/ results from small RCTs are inconsistent. The systematic&#xD;
      review method depends on combining data from many small studies in order a pooled estimate of&#xD;
      the pooled effect. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of non-viscous&#xD;
      fibre supplementation on fasting glucose and insulin in individuals with diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      We hope the findings of this study will play a role in developing the nutritional guidelines&#xD;
      for individuals with diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background: High fibre diets have been recommended for individuals with diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      However, the findings on the effect of non-viscous fibre supplementation such as inulin,&#xD;
      wheat bran and resistant starch on glycemic control in individuals with diabetes are&#xD;
      inconsistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: In order to improve the evidence-based guidelines for diabetes mellitus, we will&#xD;
      conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess evidence from randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) on the effect of non-viscous fibre supplementation on glycemic control in&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Cochrane handbook for systematic review of interventions will be used for planning&#xD;
      and conducting this meta-analysis. The reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items&#xD;
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials will be&#xD;
      searched using appropriate pre-determined search terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: All the included trials must be randomized, controlled, with duration of ≥ 3&#xD;
      weeks investigating the effect of supplementing diet with non-viscous fiber on glycemic&#xD;
      control outcomes in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Acute studies, non-randomized, not&#xD;
      appropriately controlled studies will be excluded. Both isocaloric and non-isocaloric will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two independent reviewers will extract information about fiber type, sample&#xD;
      size, subject characteristics, dose, follow-up, composition of the background diets, and&#xD;
      statistical analyses. Mean±SEM values will be extracted for all outcomes. Standard&#xD;
      computation and imputation will be used to derive all missing variance data. Risk of bias and&#xD;
      study quality will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Grading of&#xD;
      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: This meta-analysis will assess a set of outcomes related to glycemic control in&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes mellitus. These outcomes are: (1) glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)&#xD;
      or (2) fructosamine, (3) fasting glucose (FG), (4) fasting insulin (FI), and (5) Homeostasis&#xD;
      model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Pooled analysis will be conducted using the Generic Inverse Variance method.&#xD;
      Rand-effects models will be used even in the absence of statistical significant between-study&#xD;
      heterogeneity because they yield more conservative summary effect estimates in the presence&#xD;
      of residual heterogeneity. Heterogeneity will be assessed using Cochran's Q test and&#xD;
      quantified by the I2 statistic. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses will be used to explore&#xD;
      sources of heterogeneity. A priori subgroup analyses include study design, does, fiber type,&#xD;
      follow-up (duration), baseline values, study quality, food matrix, and composition of the&#xD;
      background diet. The significance of subgroup analyses will be assessed using meta-regression&#xD;
      analyses. Publication bias will be assessed using the inspection of funnel plots and&#xD;
      application of Egger's and Begg's tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: Results will be shared through traditional, national, and&#xD;
      international scientific meetings and they may be submitted to high impact factor journals&#xD;
      for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: We hope the results of this study will play a role in improving the guidelines/&#xD;
      recommendations for individuals with diabetes mellitus by raising the awareness towards&#xD;
      viscous fiber consumption among health providers, patients, and industry. Hopefully, this&#xD;
      study will aid in guiding future research in the dietary fiber field.&#xD;
