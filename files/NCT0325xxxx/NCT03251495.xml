      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the antibody response to the cholera&#xD;
      vaccine, Vaxchora®, in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators also seek to evaluate additional markers of the adaptive immune response&#xD;
      including plasmablasts, activated B cells, memory B cells, and T cell responses in healthy&#xD;
      subjects receiving cholera vaccine, produce monoclonal antibodies against cholera, and&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and reactogenicity in healthy subjects receiving cholera vaccine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cholera is a life-threatening illness that causes diarrhea. Cholera is caused by eating or&#xD;
      drinking the Vibrio cholera bacteria. Each year, there are about 1.3 to 4.0 million cases of&#xD;
      cholera worldwide, resulting in 21,000 to 143,000 deaths. The bacteria is spread through&#xD;
      water or food that has stool in it. Up to 50 countries with limited access to clean water are&#xD;
      more likely to have outbreaks. In the United States most cases are linked to travel to these&#xD;
      countries; however, there are 10-15 cases acquired in the United States each year because of&#xD;
      undercooked seafood. Cholera spreads very easily. Illness from Cholera can vary from no&#xD;
      symptoms to severe watery diarrhea that can cause death by dehydration in a healthy person&#xD;
      within hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaxchora is a live attenuated cholera vaccine that protects against some cholera strains. It&#xD;
      has been approved by the FDA since June 2016. Since October, 2016, this vaccine has been&#xD;
      recommended for certain travelers 18 through 64 years of age going to cholera-affected areas.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to look at the immune responses to the FDA approved cholera&#xD;
      vaccine (Vaxchora®).&#xD;
