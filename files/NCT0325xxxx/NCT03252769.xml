  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cytology screening coverage in Northern Ireland (the proportion of eligible women,&#xD;
      aged 25-64 years who have had a test result recorded in the previous five years) has&#xD;
      increased steadily since 2005 to 78% in 2012/2013; almost reaching the 80% coverage target.&#xD;
      The uptake of cervical screening among women in the 25-29 year age group in Northern Ireland&#xD;
      however, has remained consistently lower (70-73%) than all other age groups except for the&#xD;
      60-64 year age group where the coverage rate is similar. The main barriers preventing women&#xD;
      from attending for cervical screening are: embarrassment; inconvenience; time and discomfort&#xD;
      associated with obtaining cervical samples. Studies have shown that offering women the&#xD;
      opportunity to collect a vaginal self-sample to test for HPV (the main risk factor for&#xD;
      cervical cancer) could increase screening coverage. Non-attenders in the Western and Belfast&#xD;
      Health and Social Care Trust area, aged 25-29 years, will be identified by GPs. Letters with&#xD;
      information relating to the study and collection devices will be sent to women giving them&#xD;
      two options: 1. inviting them to book a normal screening appointment; 2. inviting them to&#xD;
      collect a self-sample for HPV testing with either a swab or brush collection device.&#xD;
      Participants for receipt of swab or brush will be randomised. Acceptance to participate in&#xD;
      the study will be indicated by signed consent. Returned self-collected samples will be HPV&#xD;
      tested. If a sample is negative, no further investigation is required and the woman will be&#xD;
      encouraged to accept her next screening invitation. If a sample is positive the woman will be&#xD;
      encouraged to book a screening appointment. The study will evaluate: impact on screening&#xD;
      uptake, acceptance of self-sampling for both devices, practicality and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Women aged 25-29 years who have not attended for cervical screening 9 months after being&#xD;
      called initially will be considered non-attenders and therefore eligible participants. GPs&#xD;
      will identify non-attenders and pass lists to cytology Audit Officers. A group of age-matched&#xD;
      non-attenders will act as controls. Potential participants/controls will be ramdomly&#xD;
      allocated to each group as cases arise. Study packs containing: invitation letters,&#xD;
      participant information, consent forms and HPV self-sampling devices/instructions with return&#xD;
      sample packaging will be sent to non-attenders, 3 months after their GP final reminder, by&#xD;
      the Audit Officers inviting them to participate in the study by collecting a vaginal&#xD;
      self-sample for HPV testing. The letter will contain two options for non-attenders: 1.&#xD;
      inviting them to book a normal screening appointment (non-participation); 2. inviting them to&#xD;
      participate in the study by collecting a self-sample for HPV testing with either a swab or&#xD;
      brush collection device. Potential participants for receipt of swab or brush will be&#xD;
      randomised. The participant information sheet will explain the purpose of the study, how the&#xD;
      test is conducted, by the woman and at the laboratory, how the results will be conveyed to&#xD;
      the woman and her GP and the implications of the HPV test result. The consent form will seek&#xD;
      permission from the woman to process the sample, report the results to the woman, her GP and&#xD;
      the screening office. In addition permission for the research team to check the patient&#xD;
      LabCentre database for subsequent cervical screening results in the event of the woman&#xD;
      testing HPV positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will return the self-sample to the Cytology laboratory, Altnaelvin in the pre-paid&#xD;
      envelope provided. The sample will be HPV tested by the research team and the results sent to&#xD;
      the woman, her GP and the screening office. Women who test HPV positive will be sent a&#xD;
      results letter and advised to attend for cervical screening. The woman's GP will also be&#xD;
      advised of the management recommendations. Women who test HPV positive will also be given a&#xD;
      helpline number if they wish to discuss their result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will be responsible for recalling women who test HPV positive for cervical&#xD;
      screening. A reminder letter will be sent to women who test HPV positive if they have not&#xD;
      attended cervical screening 3 months post self-sampling intervention. Women who test HPV&#xD;
      negative do not require further investigation so will be reassured and encouraged to accept&#xD;
      their next screening invitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who have tested HPV positive but have negative cytology will be offered repeat HPV&#xD;
      testing (GP collected sample) in 12 months and if this is still HPV positive the woman will&#xD;
      be offered a further HPV test 12 months later. The research team will issue these invitations&#xD;
      in conjunction with the woman's GP. Women with a persistent HPV infection will be referred to&#xD;
      colposcopy by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of women returning the self-sampling devices and the number of HPV positive women&#xD;
      attending for subsequent cervical screening will be monitored by the research team. The Audit&#xD;
      Officers will provide anonymised cervical screening uptake data for control groups in order&#xD;
      to ascertain the proportion of cervical screening samples that were obtained as a result of&#xD;
      self-sampling/HPV positivity. Outcomes will be measured at 6 and 12 months post intervention&#xD;
      result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 18 months. The end of trial will be when the LabCentre database has been&#xD;
      checked for cervical screening results obtained as a result of the intervention for all&#xD;
      participants at the maximum time limit for return of self-samples plus 3 months to allow for&#xD;
      return of HPV results to participants and recording of any cervical screening results on&#xD;
      LabCentre.&#xD;
