  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team aims to perform a prospective observational case series of one hundred&#xD;
      consecutive distal radial artery heart catheterizations to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of distal radial access. Distal radial artery access has evolved in the past few&#xD;
      years as an alternative to the standard radial artery access for coronary angiography and&#xD;
      interventions. However, the available data on the distal radial artery access for coronary&#xD;
      angiography and interventions is limited to case reports and small retrospective case series.&#xD;
      To date, no prospective randomized data is available. Therefore, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      perform a prospective observational case series of one hundred sequential left heart&#xD;
      catheterizations performed via distal radial artery to evaluate the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      the distal radial artery access.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the abundance of data supporting the use of the radial artery compared to the femoral&#xD;
      artery, data on the use the distal radial access site in the anatomical snuffbox is limited.&#xD;
      Most of the available literature on the distal radial access comes from case reports and&#xD;
      small retrospective case series looking primarily at the feasibility and success rates with&#xD;
      this approach (4-6). Crossover rate from proximal radial to femoral approach in a prior&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial was reported at 3.7% (2). A similar rate has been reported in&#xD;
      case series studies of distal radial access, with success rates ranging from 88.6% to 96.3%&#xD;
      (4-6). No cases of radial artery occlusion, hematoma, or hand paresthesia were reported in&#xD;
      any of these series. Given the promising results with the distal radial approach, its use has&#xD;
      expanded to many cardiac catheterization laboratories across the country. However,&#xD;
      prospective randomized data comparing distal versus the conventional proximal radial arterial&#xD;
      access sites is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to compile a prospective observational case series to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and feasibility of distal radial artery access in a prospective case&#xD;
      series. If an acceptable safety profile can be demonstrated, the case series will be followed&#xD;
      with a randomized controlled trial directly comparing distal to standard proximal radial&#xD;
      artery approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the present study is to assess the safety and feasibility of distal radial&#xD;
      arterial access. The study hypothesis is that distal radial access for coronary angiography&#xD;
      is associated with similar incidence rates of access site related complications compared to&#xD;
      complication rates previously reported with the standard proximal radial artery access.&#xD;
