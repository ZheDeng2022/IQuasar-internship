  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, with the progress in the treatment field, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC)&#xD;
      has become the most successful cancer species in precision medicine. Patients with positive&#xD;
      driving genes such as EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF and so on have clearly targeted drugs, which&#xD;
      bring survival benefits to patients.However, about 50% of patients still lack a clear driving&#xD;
      gene target, which has become the focus of current research.In the field of wild-type NSCLC&#xD;
      with negative driver genes, the classic first-line treatment regimen is the two-drug regimen&#xD;
      containing platinum.The study by Kimura T in the first-line treatment of 54 wild-type&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC patients with carboplatin and pemetrexed showed that the ORR, mPFS and mOS of&#xD;
      patients with wild-type non-squamous NSCLC treated with carboplatin permetrexine were 35.8%,&#xD;
      5.4 months and 12.7 months respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and&#xD;
      development.In the phase Ⅲ study, patients who failed at least two kinds of systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance were treated with anlotinib or&#xD;
      placebo, the anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.46 months, the placebo group&#xD;
      PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.37 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of Anlotinib combined with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin followed by&#xD;
      maintenance therapy with Anlotinib plus Pemetrexed as the first-line treatment in patients&#xD;
      with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC deserve further exploration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre single arm clinical trial conducted in China.The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate and observe Anlotinib (12mg,QD, PO d1-14, 21 days per cycle) combined with&#xD;
      Pemetrexed(500mg/m2,IV,d15-21,21 days per cycle)and Carboplatin(AUC5,IV,d15-21,21 days per&#xD;
      cycle,4 cycles) as the first-line treatment in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC&#xD;
      .After four cycles of induction,patients continued to receive Anlotinib and Pemetrexed.As the&#xD;
      report,The median PFS of advanced NSCLC treated by Pemetrexed and Carboplatin was 6 months.We&#xD;
      expect the median PFS of Anlotinib combined with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin as the first-line&#xD;
      treatment in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC was 10 months.Using PASS15, we&#xD;
      calculated the sample size of this study was 34(α=0.05、β=0.2), according to 20% censoring,the&#xD;
      expected sample size is 43.&#xD;
