      This trial is a pathophysiological study evaluating the impact of a cognitive therapy on the&#xD;
      perineal neuromuscular mechanisms in women patients with urinary incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some research works have been realized on the impact of a cognitive load test (CLT) on the&#xD;
      neuromuscular continence urinary mechanisms. It had been demonstrated that a CLT induced an&#xD;
      increase in the latency of voluntary perineal contraction. It had also been demonstrated that&#xD;
      a CLT had an influence on the involuntary perineal contraction pre-activation. Most recently,&#xD;
      the impact of a cognitive therapy on the perineal neuromuscular mechanisms on healthy&#xD;
      participants had been evaluated. It demonstrated that a cognitive therapy inhibited the&#xD;
      impact of the CLT on the perineal neuromuscular mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project is about the evaluation of the interest of a cognitive therapy on the&#xD;
      neuromuscular mechanisms in case of attentional test in a urinary incontinent women&#xD;
      population. It could conduce to new therapeutic leads for the management of urinary&#xD;
      incontinence.&#xD;

      Objectives and results expected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognition seems to have an effect on the physiological mechanisms of urinary continence.&#xD;
      Urinary continence is, among others, the effect of a good coordination between detrusor's&#xD;
      contraction and pelvic floor muscles' contraction. A cognitive disturbance involves&#xD;
      coordination's disturbance. It has already been demonstrated that a double task&#xD;
      rehabilitation (between cognition and perineal muscles) could annihilate the effects induced&#xD;
      by a cognitive disturbance on the physiological neuromuscular mechanisms of the urinary&#xD;
      incontinence. The objective of this study is to evaluate the benefit of a double task&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation for the patients with urinary incontinence (UI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current knowledge situation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic floor muscles have a major incidence for the physiological urinary continence. Even if&#xD;
      the external anal sphincter (EAS)'s muscles are not directly involved in urinary&#xD;
      incontinence, many studies have shown they had a synergistic contraction with levator ani&#xD;
      muscles during the voluntary and involuntary perineal contraction . Because they are easily&#xD;
      reachable for an electromyographic (EMG) recording, many authors have registered these&#xD;
      muscles in order to investigate the physiologic urinary continence. Amarenco et al. had shown&#xD;
      that pelvic floor muscles' intensity of contraction in response to a cough fit was&#xD;
      proportional to the cough intensity in an healthy volunteers population. This correlation was&#xD;
      beyond bladder's filling. For the patients with UI, Deffieux et al. shown a loss of&#xD;
      correlation between cough intensity and perineal contraction. Deffieux et al. also analyzed&#xD;
      the temporal sequence of muscle activation for the EAS during a cough fit. A perineal pre&#xD;
      contraction in an healthy volunteers population was observed. EAS's muscles EMG activation&#xD;
      began 210 ms (median) before external intercostal (EIC) muscles. This EAS's muscles&#xD;
      anticipation of contraction was not found in the group of patients with UI. The observation&#xD;
      that fewer patients were activating their AES's muscles, more the modulation of EAS's muscles&#xD;
      contraction was distorted when coughing was made. Thubert et al. observed that the perineal&#xD;
      contraction's latency was multiplied by 4 in case of cognitive load test (CLT) in an healthy&#xD;
      volunteers population. CLT leads to an EAS's muscles pre activation in case of coughing&#xD;
      effort, was also observed. A lowing of 29% of AES's muscles pre activation has been&#xD;
      demonstrated. These results suggest that cognition is involved in urinary continence's&#xD;
      physiological mechanisms. So it seamed to be interesting to study the impact of a double task&#xD;
      rehabilitation (cognitive and muscular) on the urinary continence's neuromuscular mechanisms&#xD;
      in case of diversion of attention. It was a randomized trial including two groups of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers: one group had double task rehabilitation during 15 days, the other had no&#xD;
      rehabilitation. After 15 days rehabilitation, in the rehabilitation's group, the attention&#xD;
      deficit's correction restored the resistive abilities of UI in case of attention hijacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the last AFU's (Association Française d'Urologie - Urology French Association)&#xD;
      and CNGOF's (Collège national des gynécologues et obstétriciens français - French&#xD;
      Gynecologists and Obstetricians National College) recommendations, the first intention&#xD;
      treatment of urinary incontinence is pelvi-perineal rehabilitation. Pelvi-perineal&#xD;
      rehabilitation conducted by a therapist is multimodal with different facets: a cognitive part&#xD;
      (education, pelvic floor realization), a behavioral part of bladder training (modification of&#xD;
      micturition habits), a muscle building part (voluntary contractions against resistance with&#xD;
      and without biofeedback and electrosimulation), and also a postural work part (balance and&#xD;
      pelvis position). Perineal rehabilitation technics' heterogeneity and the lack of description&#xD;
      of these technics let the professionals adapt their rehabilitation's protocols. The objective&#xD;
      of this study is to compare the results of two rehabilitation's technics in urinary&#xD;
      incontinent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology, study population, previous studies and feasibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The population is made of voluntary incontinent women. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
      are the followings: Major women with stress urinary incontinence or mixed urinary&#xD;
      incontinence or urge urinary incontinence, in need to benefit from perineal rehabilitation or&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral rehabilitation, women able to read, understand, accept and sign the&#xD;
      consent. Exclusion criteria are the following: pregnant women, refusal to participate,&#xD;
      dementia and cognitive troubles (Mini Mental State score: MMS &lt;30). Participants will be&#xD;
      subjects to a medical statement (antecedents, age, weight, size, UDI6 (Urogenital Distress&#xD;
      Inventory) questioner, Contilife and Wexner scores). The absence of a mental deficit will be&#xD;
      verifies by Mini Mental Status questioner (MMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: A &quot;CPP&quot; (comité de protection des personnes - persons' protection&#xD;
      comity) have been requested and obtained for this study (N° cpp17-065a/2016-A01651-50). An&#xD;
      information letter will be delivered to the volunteers, who will be included only after the&#xD;
      acceptation and signature of the written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers' randomization: Participants will be randomized in two groups (1/1) with data&#xD;
      processing software at the first visit at the therapist practicing the perineal&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The first group will receive &quot;Classical&quot; perineal rehabilitation for duration&#xD;
      of height weeks. The second group will receive perineal rehabilitation associated with a&#xD;
      double task cognitive therapy for a duration of height weeks. Participants will be evaluated&#xD;
      during the consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial evaluation of volunteers: initial evaluation will consist of an interrogation able to&#xD;
      check the participants' antecedents and characteristics, urinary incontinence symptoms&#xD;
      (quality life score (Contilife) and severity score (International Consultation on&#xD;
      Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form: ICIQ-SF), Urinary Handicap Measurement (MHU - Mesure&#xD;
      du Handicap Urinaire) and also clinical examination (Pelvic Organ Prolaps Quantification:&#xD;
      POP-Q, Ulmsten Test, levator Testing among Oxford, ureteral mobility). In a second time, the&#xD;
      EMG analysis will be realized. It consists in the analysis of the CLT impact on the voluntary&#xD;
      and unvoluntary perineal contraction. The CLT used is Paced Auditory Serial addition Test&#xD;
      (PASAT). Test arrangements are the followings: The volunteer will listen to an audiotape on&#xD;
      witch is recorded a 61 random numbers set inconstant from 1 to 9 (for example &quot;1, 9, 4, 5…&quot;).&#xD;
      The volunteer patient will have to add each pair of number in order to add the number with&#xD;
      the previous and speak verbally the response. To test the willingly perineal contraction, the&#xD;
      volunteer will be in a sitting position with her arms on the armrests. The practitioner will&#xD;
      position the two electrodes with self-adhesive surface from either side of the volunteer's&#xD;
      anus regarding to the EAS muscle. These electrodes are usually used in a setting of classical&#xD;
      evaluation with biofeedback or electro simulation. An order will be given to the volunteer in&#xD;
      order to contract perineal muscles when she feels a stimulus on the left wrist (an electric&#xD;
      reflex hammer regarding to the median nerve on the inside of the left wrist). The volunteer&#xD;
      women will have to repeat the experience in two conditions: with and without the CLT.&#xD;
      Different settings measurement will be realized: time limit for the perineal contraction&#xD;
      reaction (RT), that is latency between stimulus and begins of AES's EMG activity increase.&#xD;
      The other settings will be the RT max (latency between stimulus and maximum AES's EMG&#xD;
      activity), maximum AES's EMG activity and air under the curve for the AES's EMG activity.&#xD;
      Volunteer's perineal contraction (following coughing instruction) will also be evaluated with&#xD;
      and without CLT. The coughing instruction will be ordered by an impulse (Reflex hammer) on&#xD;
      the inside of the left wrist. Two more self-adhesive detection electrodes will be glued&#xD;
      regarding the external intercostal muscles (7th right space). Principal data analyzed will&#xD;
      be: latency between stimulus and perineal muscles (RT1) and latency between intercostal&#xD;
      muscles and perineal muscles (RT3). The data set will be collected using a Biopac ®,&#xD;
      Acknowledge ®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classical perineal rehabilitation protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will benefit from two-phases perineal rehabilitation: first phase pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscles (PFM)'s analytic rehabilitation, then a functional rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First phase will include the PFM's awareness and voluntary contraction learning with manual,&#xD;
      biofeedback technics and functional electro stimulation (FES). Then, therapist will propose&#xD;
      PFM's reinforcement under the PERFECT method (Pressure, Endurance, rapid Contraction, time&#xD;
      measurement between each contraction sequence). These exercises will call out the manual&#xD;
      rehabilitation technics (voluntary contraction learning, pelvic anatomy), biofeedback and&#xD;
      electro stimulation. Electro stimulation and biofeedback will necessit the use of an&#xD;
      electrode that serves to the electromyographic measurement with and without cognitive load&#xD;
      test. Each classical rehabilitation session will take 30 minutes with 20 minutes of active&#xD;
      working, twice per week. About the self-training, there will be no consensus for optimal&#xD;
      homemade exercises, neither on the number, nor on the duration. The different authors&#xD;
      describe very different types of protocols. The self-training program will be set up as soon&#xD;
      as the participant will be able to realize, under therapist's manual control, a voluntary&#xD;
      analytic contraction without synergy or command reversion. Exercises' number and&#xD;
      characteristic will be given according to the PERFECT Scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second phase, the participant will hold a micturition calendar. With the noticed&#xD;
      elements, a behavior analyze will be summarized in order to update the favoring situations&#xD;
      and inappropriate situations. The objective will be the learning of perineal locking and&#xD;
      reinstatement of anticipative postural activity for stress urinary incontinence. The strategy&#xD;
      put in place will be organized in unlearning of deleterious perineal habits and learning new&#xD;
      behavior program. The functional training program will be made of activation of PFM's&#xD;
      voluntary contractions during different stains of every day life; the main goal being the&#xD;
      perineal locking set up (PFM's voluntary contraction associated with a good abdominal and&#xD;
      perineal synergy), this locking must be systematic before and during efforts like carrying&#xD;
      loads, trimming, coughing. During the second phase, the physiotherapist will twice weekly&#xD;
      perform evaluations. These evaluations are similar to those in the first phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive associated rehabilitation protocol: Added to the classic perineal muscular&#xD;
      rehabilitation, the cognitive associated rehabilitation group randomized participants will&#xD;
      have to execute twice a day the rehabilitation protocol. Each cognitive rehabilitation&#xD;
      session will take three minutes. Participants will have to synergistically execute&#xD;
      attentional tests (N-Back Test) and execute a perineal contraction during the contraction&#xD;
      instructions. (10 randomized auditory stimuli in three minutes). The attentional tests'&#xD;
      difficulty will be gradually increased each 15 days. N-Back Test modalities are the&#xD;
      followings: the participant will visualize a series of random numbers. First difficulty step&#xD;
      will be to click the dedicated button when the volunteer will see the indicated letter. The&#xD;
      second difficulty step will be to click the dedicated button when she will see two&#xD;
      consecutives times the same letter. The third difficulty step will be to click the dedicated&#xD;
      button when she will see two times the same letter separated by one different letter, and so&#xD;
      on… The data will be saved on the digital application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Participants will consult twice per week their therapist. An intermediary&#xD;
      clinical and EMG recording will be done in the fourth week to evaluate the evolution of&#xD;
      symptoms and EMG's criteria, with the same arrangements as those of the first evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' final evaluation: During the last visit in the eighth week, participants will&#xD;
      be evaluated with same arrangements as those of the first evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Judgment criteria: About the involuntary perineal contraction study, the principal judgment&#xD;
      criteria will be the latency between intercostal muscles contraction and perineal muscles&#xD;
      contraction (RT3). Secondary judgment criteria will be: latency between stimulus and perineal&#xD;
      muscles contraction (RT1) for the voluntary perineal contraction study, MHU score obtained&#xD;
      (Mesure du Handicap Urinaire - urinary handicap score), ICIQ (International Consultation on&#xD;
      Incontinence Questionnaire), Contilife.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data will be expressed in the form of median and interquartile gap. The Wilcoxon&#xD;
      Test will be used to compare quantitative values before and after rehabilitation, and Student&#xD;
      Test to compare quantitative values between &quot;classical perineal rehabilitation&quot; group and&#xD;
      &quot;perineal rehabilitation + cognitive therapy&quot; group. According to the literature, middle RT3&#xD;
      is -60ms, expected difference after rehabilitation is 16,66ms and known standard deviation is&#xD;
      18,7ms. For an alpha risk 5% and power 80%, it is necessary to include 20 participants by&#xD;
      group, whether total of 40 participants.&#xD;
