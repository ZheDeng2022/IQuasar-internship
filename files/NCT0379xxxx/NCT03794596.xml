    <textblock>
      This research is being done because the investigators are looking for new and better ways to&#xD;
      treat a type of breast cancer called triple negative breast cancer. This type of breast&#xD;
      cancer can be more difficult to treat than other types of breast cancer as it does not&#xD;
      respond to drugs such as hormonal therapies. One type of treatment that looks promising is&#xD;
      immunotherapy using new drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune checkpoints help to regulate the immune system and can stop the immune system from&#xD;
      attacking cancer cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors block this 'off-switch' and aim to help&#xD;
      the immune system control the cancer. These drugs have been very effective in other cancers&#xD;
      such as melanoma and are now being tested in breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study patients will receive an immune checkpoint inhibitor called avelumab. Half the&#xD;
      patients on the study will also receive aspirin tablets for approximately 18 days as the&#xD;
      investigators wish to compare the effects of avelumab alone versus in combination with&#xD;
      aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend hospital approximately five times in order to complete all necessary&#xD;
      study assessments. The first visit screens patients for suitability, after which a baseline&#xD;
      visit will collect the first of two breast tissue biopsies. At the third visit a single dose&#xD;
      of Avelumab will be given via an infusion (a drip in the forearm). Patients will then return&#xD;
      approximately two weeks later for a second breast tissue biopsy before having a final follow&#xD;
      up visit another two weeks later. Blood and urine samples will be taken at various visits&#xD;
      throughout the study to help us learn more about the effects these treatments may have on the&#xD;
      immune system and on breast cancer cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TNBC is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer associated with poor survival and new&#xD;
      treatments are needed. A key feature of cancer is its ability to go undetected by the immune&#xD;
      system. Recent developments in cancer research have identified immune checkpoints as a&#xD;
      possible treatment option as they seem to promote an anti-tumour immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some breast cancers have considerable cancer cell infiltration, which has been associated&#xD;
      with better prognosis. This is where white blood cells have permeated the cancer cell and&#xD;
      infiltrated the infected cell in an attempt to 'cure' the infected cell. Greater&#xD;
      immune-sensitivity is thought to correlate with greater cancer cell infiltration therefore&#xD;
      researchers are looking at ways in which immune-sensitivity can be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach is to target inflammation that is known to play a major role in cancer&#xD;
      development and progression. Certain proteins can often be abnormally expressed in many&#xD;
      cancers. In preclinical models the investigators recently demonstrated that the presence of&#xD;
      certain cancer cell-derived proteins is critical for the growth of tumours formed by&#xD;
      melanoma, colorectal and breast mouse cancer cell lines. In the mouse preclinical trials it&#xD;
      indicated that by blocking the cancer cells ability to produce these proteins was associated&#xD;
      with a marked shift in the inflammatory profile. To test this theory, this study will use&#xD;
      aspirin as the chosen protein inhibitor and it is speculated that the addition of aspirin&#xD;
      might enhance the efficacy of the immune checkpoint blockade, avelumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL AIMS &amp; DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to determine whether aspirin enhances the efficacy of avelumab by&#xD;
      promoting a greater anti-cancer immune response. This is a multi-centre study recruiting&#xD;
      patients with confirmed TNBC from across four trial sites within the United Kingdom. It is&#xD;
      anticipate that 50 participants will need to be screened in order to successfully enrol 42&#xD;
      patients onto the trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two arms:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  21 patients into Arm A: Avelumab + Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  21 patients into Arm B: Avelumab + Aspirin + PPI&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated duration of participation for a participant is up to 10 weeks. Each subject&#xD;
      will be asked to complete 5 study visits. After successfully completing a Screening Visit&#xD;
      (Visit 1), each eligible subject will attend for a Baseline Visit (Visit 2) and will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to treatment ARM A or ARM B. As part of the baseline visit subjects will&#xD;
      have their first of two breast tumour biopsies. All subjects will commence their PPI&#xD;
      following the baseline visit, those subjects randomised to ARM B will also commence their&#xD;
      Aspirin at this time. At visit 3 all subjects will receive their Avelumab infusion. At Visit&#xD;
      4 (Follow up Visit A) each subject will undergo their second research biopsy and further&#xD;
      research blood sampling this will be the first of two follow up visits, with Visit 5 (Follow&#xD;
      up Visit B) concluding the patients participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit windows have been used to aid visit planning in the hope that most research&#xD;
      appointments can take place in line with patients' ordinary care visits so as to reduce any&#xD;
      burden inflicted on the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be collected from the time of&#xD;
      randomisation and will continue to be collected up until Visit 5 (Follow up Visit B). All&#xD;
      post biopsy treatment will be at the discretion of the subject's treating physician per local&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT IDENTIFICATION &amp; SCREENING&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a multi-centre trial consisting of four NHS secondary care&#xD;
      out-paints clinics from across the United Kingdom. Each site has been chosen for their&#xD;
      expertise in oncology and their ability to identify patients for the trial directly from&#xD;
      their clinics with each centre treating between 20 to 40 patients per annum; this pool of&#xD;
      patients will constitute the source of recruitment in the study, PIC sites may also be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified by the Principal Investigators multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      team following recent diagnosis of TNBC. The multidisciplinary team shall be trained on the&#xD;
      study protocol and required to sign the trial delegation and training log in advance of&#xD;
      working on the trial or identifying participants. Potential participants will have at least&#xD;
      24 hours to read the patient information and decide if they would like to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Participants must have the capacity to provide fully informed consent. Participants&#xD;
      must not participate in any other therapeutic trials whilst on study treatments, however once&#xD;
      all study treatments as specified by trial schema are completed, participation in further&#xD;
      studies will not be affected.&#xD;

          5. Contraindications to aspirin dosing including hypersensitivity to aspirin (eg known&#xD;
             aspirin sensitive asthma; history of peptic ulcer disease, gastric bleeding or&#xD;
             cerebrovascular haemorrhages; haemorrhagic diathesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Evidence of distant metastases apparent prior to randomisation. Patients who are&#xD;
             diagnosed with distant metastases during the course of the study can complete study&#xD;
             procedures if willing to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Significant cardiovascular disease including a history of myocardial infarction, acute&#xD;
             coronary syndrome or coronary angioplasty/stenting/bypass grafting within the last 6&#xD;
             months or clinically significant congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any other serious or unstable pre-existing medical conditions (aside from malignancy&#xD;
             exceptions specified above), psychiatric disorders, or other conditions that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator could interfere with the patient's safety, obtaining&#xD;
             informed consent, or compliance with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or Hepatitis C&#xD;
             Virus (HCV) infection (patients with laboratory evidence of cleared or chronic (not&#xD;
             active) HBV and HCV infection will be permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with type 1&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin or&#xD;
             rheumatological disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis or&#xD;
             alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the&#xD;
             absence of an external trigger will be permitted to enrol. Autoimmune conditions such&#xD;
             as ulcerative colitis that have been definitively treated (e.g. with total colectomy)&#xD;
             will be permitted to enrol but should be discussed with the CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids&#xD;
             (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14&#xD;
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement&#xD;
             steroid doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent are permitted in the absence of&#xD;
             active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the&#xD;
             detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders likely in to interfere with absorption of the trial&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Active infection requiring systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Current or previous regular use of aspirin (at any dose) or current use of another&#xD;
             NSAID for any indication (see appendix IV for list of medications not permitted in the&#xD;
             trial). Regular aspirin use is defined as taking aspirin more than twice in any given&#xD;
             week for more than 4 consecutive weeks. Current NSAID use is defined as taking any&#xD;
             NSAID for more than a week in the preceding month. If investigators feel that this&#xD;
             definition may unfairly exclude a participant, this can be discussed with the CI/MCTU&#xD;
             and a case by case decision will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs&#xD;
             chemically related to the study treatments.&#xD;
