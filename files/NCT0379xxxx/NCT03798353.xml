      Myocardial infarction causes necrosis of myocardial cells and reduces cardiac function.&#xD;
      Today, there are treatments such as primary angioplasty and thrombolysis that are effective&#xD;
      in limiting cell death after acute myocardial infarction. However, the post-infarct scar&#xD;
      often conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart&#xD;
      failure and in more advanced stages the only therapy that completely restores cardiac&#xD;
      function is heart transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent cells found from embryonic mesoderm and found in all&#xD;
      tissues. In the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit&#xD;
      when treated with MSCs from different origins. Our approach is based on a decellularized&#xD;
      matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction.&#xD;

      Myocardial infarction causes necrosis of myocardial cells and reduces cardiac function. Today&#xD;
      there are treatments such as primary angioplasty and thrombolysis that are effective in&#xD;
      limiting cell death after acute myocardial infarction. However, the post-infarct scar often&#xD;
      conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart failure&#xD;
      and, in more advanced stages, the only therapy that completely restores cardiac function is&#xD;
      heart transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental studies are evaluating new therapeutic approaches based on tissue engineering&#xD;
      for myocardial regeneration. Cardiac tissue engineering attempts to create functional tissue&#xD;
      constructs that can restore the structure and function of damaged myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that develop from embryonic mesoderm and&#xD;
      are found in all structural tissues of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit when&#xD;
      treated with MSCs from different origins. The investigators approach is based on a&#xD;
      decellularized matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the different types of MSC currently available, the investigators propose the use of&#xD;
      those derived from the connective tissue surrounding the great vessels (2 arteries and one&#xD;
      vein) of the umbilical cord called Wharton's gelatin (MSC, WJ) whose immunomodulatory&#xD;
      properties are described extensively in the literature. These MSC, WJ cells have a PEI&#xD;
      approved by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Healthcare Products (AEMPS) (PEI 16-017)&#xD;
      that guarantees an optimal manufacturing process for a clinical trial.&#xD;
