  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of a cohort&#xD;
      of 60 patients in whom a multilayer closure with a Durepair patch is performed with a prior&#xD;
      cohort of patients in whom a standardized repair without patch (n = 32) was performed using&#xD;
      the same minimally invasive fetoscopic repair technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that there will be a thicker repair (as measured by MRI at 6 weeks post&#xD;
      surgery) and less MMC repair dehiscence and/or CSF leak with the patch repair.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spina bifida can be a devastating neurological congenital anomaly. It results from incomplete&#xD;
      closure of the neural tube between 22 and 28 embryological days. Its incidence is&#xD;
      approximately 1-2 per 1,000 births. It is considered the most common congenital anomaly of&#xD;
      the central nervous system compatible with life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The most frequent form is myelomeningocele (MMC), characterized by the extrusion of the&#xD;
           spinal cord into a sac filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and is associated with&#xD;
           lower limb paralysis and bowel and bladder dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The majority of MMCs can be diagnosed between 14 and 20 weeks of gestation. MMC is&#xD;
           associated with Chiari II malformation, which includes a constellation of anomalies such&#xD;
           as hindbrain herniation, brainstem abnormalities, low-lying venous sinuses and a small&#xD;
           posterior fossa.The Chiari II malformation can have deleterious effects on motor,&#xD;
           cranial nerve and cognitive functions. Postnatally most MMC patients develop&#xD;
           hydrocephalus and require a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Shunts require lifelong&#xD;
           monitoring and have a high failure rate due to infection, obstruction, and fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental studies using animal models have shown that prenatal coverage of a spina&#xD;
      bifida-like lesion can preserve neurological function and reduce or reverse hindbrain&#xD;
      herniation.These studies suggest a &quot;two-hit&quot; hypothesis in which the ultimate neurologic&#xD;
      deficit results from a combination of the failure of normal neural-tube closure (first hit)&#xD;
      with secondary spinal cord injury resulting from prolonged exposure of sensitive neural&#xD;
      elements to the amniotic fluid (second hit mechanism).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this hypothesis, open fetal surgical repair of MMC was proposed, and the 2011&#xD;
      publication of the NICHD sponsored randomized controlled trial demonstrated clear neonatal&#xD;
      benefit of open in-utero fetal surgical repair of MMC. The study showed a reduction in the&#xD;
      incidence of hydrocephalus and in the radiographic severity of hindbrain herniation (relative&#xD;
      risk: 0.67; 95% confidence interval: 0.56-0.81).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open in-utero fetal surgery is not without risk and the NICHD study (MOMS Trial) showed an&#xD;
      elevation in maternal-fetal morbidity/risk when compared to the postnatally treated group,&#xD;
      including higher risk for chorioamniotic separation (26% vs. 0%, respectively), maternal&#xD;
      pulmonary edema (6% vs. 0%), oligohydramnios (21% vs. 0%), placental abruption (6% vs. 0%),&#xD;
      spontaneous membrane rupture (46%; RR: 6.15; 95% CI: 2.75-13.78), spontaneous labor (38%; RR:&#xD;
      2.80, 95%CI: 1.51-5.18), maternal blood transfusion (9%; RR: 7.18; 95%CI: 0.90-57.01), and&#xD;
      preterm delivery before 34 weeks (46%; RR: 9.2; 95%CI: 3.81-22.19). The reason for the&#xD;
      increased incidence of these complications is related to the nature of the open fetal&#xD;
      procedure, which involves a multi-faceted invasive approach including maternal laparotomy,&#xD;
      large hysterotomy with uterine edge stapling, and open fetal repair of the spina bifida&#xD;
      defect that may involve manipulation and exposure of the fetus for a significant amount of&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal endoscopic surgery has progressed rapidly over the past decades and investigators are&#xD;
      now able to perform a number of intricate procedures inside the uterus with specially&#xD;
      designed instruments. These procedures include laser therapy for Twin-twin-transfusion&#xD;
      syndrome, fetal cystoscopy and fulguration of posterior urethral valves, release of amniotic&#xD;
      bands, and placement of various shunts and balloons inside fetal structures and cavities&#xD;
      (peritoneal, pleural, cardiac, and trachea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetoscopy offers a less invasive therapeutic option that could reduce a number of the&#xD;
      morbidities (both maternal and fetal) related to open fetal procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few animal studies and growing clinical human experience with fetoscopic repair of MMC have&#xD;
      demonstrated the feasibility of covering the defect and performing a full repair. These&#xD;
      repairs have been accomplished using at least two (and sometimes more) entry ports through&#xD;
      the uterine wall. Kohl et al. in Germany, have demonstrated the feasibility of performing a&#xD;
      complete percutaneous fetoscopic repair of MMC using carbon dioxide to distend the uterus and&#xD;
      provide a dry working area for the surgeon to perform the repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These investigators described a two-layer covering technique using an absorbable patch&#xD;
      (Durasis, Cook, Germany) and sutures. However, while they showed that the procedure is&#xD;
      feasible, their percutaneous technique with complete two layer surgical closure of the defect&#xD;
      using sutures was associated with prolonged operative time and significant maternal and&#xD;
      obstetrical morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetoscopy in a CO2 gas filled uterus has been recently reported by groups in Bonn, Germany&#xD;
      (Kohl et al) and Sao Paulo, Brazil (Pedreira et al). The fetoscopic technique the&#xD;
      investigators use has been developed and tested in a fetal sheep model of MMC by the&#xD;
      investigators group and others (Peiro et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This fetoscopy technique has evolved over time to a 2-port technique developed by the team in&#xD;
      Houston, Texas and its feasibility and applicability to the human uterus and fetus have been&#xD;
      demonstrated and published (Belfort et al, 2017) and demonstrate an improved degree of&#xD;
      flexibility in terms of access to the fetus regardless of placental location. The technique&#xD;
      is designed to decrease the maternal risks of open uterus fetal surgery while maintaining a&#xD;
      similar level of fetal benefit as seen in the MOMS trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators technique employs an open abdomen/exteriorized (but closed) uterus&#xD;
      methodology that allows the minimally invasive multi-layer closure of the fetal neural tube&#xD;
      using the same closed skin repair currently employed at Baylor College of Medicine/Texas&#xD;
      Children's Fetal Center using the open uterus approach. The technique employs a novel&#xD;
      approach to low pressure uterine distention using the same carbon dioxide gas (8-12 mmHg&#xD;
      pressure) that others attempting fetoscopic repair have used, but employing a much lower gas&#xD;
      flow rate. In addition, the exteriorized uterus technique used by the Baylor investigators&#xD;
      (as compared with the percutaneous method) allows improved access to the fetus in cases of&#xD;
      anterior placentation, ability to manipulate and maintain the fetus in the required position,&#xD;
      and optimal port placement resulting from the exteriorized maternal uterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, because of the exteriorized uterus and the optimal placement this allows, only&#xD;
      two access ports are needed and these can be sutured into the uterus allowing a closed seal&#xD;
      and minimizing gas leakage. The use of humidified, warmed CO2, pioneered by the Baylor group,&#xD;
      in fetal surgery, decreases membrane disruption and may prolong gestation without rupture of&#xD;
      the membranes. Finally, recent advances in miniature surgical instruments (Storz 1.5 - 3mm&#xD;
      surgical sets) allow unprecedented flexibility which enables a full surgical repair to be&#xD;
      performed via a fetoscopic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for the human trial the Barcelona group of Peiro et al tested their patch and&#xD;
      sealant technique in a sheep model using single or double port access. Fetoscopic neural tube&#xD;
      closure using a 12 F cannula, and when needed a second 9F cannula, a cover patch, and a&#xD;
      medical sealant . They had similar results to that seen with open fetal surgical repair in&#xD;
      the same sheep model.26 When they progressed to human trials this success in closing the&#xD;
      lesion was not seen and they abandoned this approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team at Baylor College of Medicine/Texas Children's Fetal Center have now completed 53&#xD;
      cases using a 2 port exteriorized technique with results that support the initial hypothesis&#xD;
      (Belfort et al , 2017). As with any technique there have been advances in instrumentation and&#xD;
      technique and a multilayer closure (with or without a patch) has now been developed. The&#xD;
      current study is designed to investigate the multilayer closure technique using a Durepair&#xD;
      patch and to compare results to those achieved with the single layer closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently added a percutaneous approach option for those patients with an anterior&#xD;
      uterine window (i.e. an area of the uterine surface under the maternal anterior abdominal&#xD;
      wall that is completely free of placenta (i.e. there is a posterior placenta or placenta that&#xD;
      is located laterally and posterior such that the anterior uterine wall is free of placental&#xD;
      tissue). The rationale for this is that in some selected cases, it will be possible to access&#xD;
      the uterine surface in such a way that exactly the same port placement, membrane plication&#xD;
      sutures and surgical repair as we currently perform, can be done through two smaller openings&#xD;
      than the currently utilized large lower abdominal laparotomy that we use. The benefits of&#xD;
      this proposed percutaneous approach are: Maternal - it will avoid the larger incision and&#xD;
      reduce potential blood loss and infection risk from a long incision, reduce hospital length&#xD;
      of stay, decrease maternal recovery and pain, and possibly give a better cosmetic outcome by&#xD;
      avoiding a large scar. The fetal benefits will potentially include decreased heat loss from&#xD;
      an open abdomen and thus reduced fetal hypothermia, decreased uterine artery manipulation and&#xD;
      thus reduced risk of ischemia during the procedure, and a shortened surgery because of a much&#xD;
      smaller length of abdominal opening to be closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, All women who have an appropriate window and choose fetoscopic surgery will&#xD;
      be offered (along with the standard open hysterotomy approach) the two fetoscopic options,&#xD;
      (i) laparotomy assisted and, (ii) totally percutaneous expandable port assisted. In this new&#xD;
      aspect of our protocol, the repair of the open neural tube defect will continue to follow the&#xD;
      same principles used in open repairs currently being done at this institution and at others&#xD;
      around the world. This involves release of the placode, dissection of the surrounding skin,&#xD;
      development of myofascial flaps on either side of the defect, suture of the flaps over the&#xD;
      freed placode, and attempted primary closure of the defect using available skin. The&#xD;
      additional step in this protocol will add introduction of the Durepair patch to be laid on&#xD;
      top of the placode prior to closure of the myofascial flaps. If necessary we will use&#xD;
      relaxing incisions to provide additional mobility to the skin to be closed over the defect -&#xD;
      an accepted technique routinely used in open procedures at our institution. In those cases,&#xD;
      where we are able to complete the procedure with full skin closure of the defect, the only&#xD;
      difference between the open uterus procedure, the laparotomy assisted fetoscopic procedure,&#xD;
      and the totally percutaneous expandable port assisted procedure will be the approach inside&#xD;
      the uterus. In the event of expandable port assisted repair being deemed too difficult or too&#xD;
      risky, we will revert to laparotomy assisted fetoscopic repair, or to open repair (as has&#xD;
      always been our alternative for any abandoned fetoscopic case).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 6 weeks after the surgery a post-procedure fetal MRI will be performed. If&#xD;
      there is evidence of good closure of the neural tube defect and reversal of the Chiari II&#xD;
      malformation, a vaginal delivery can be attempted based on obstetric criteria. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed in person every 3-4 months after birth to 12 months at the Spina Bifida Clinic at&#xD;
      TCH. Remaining visits will be yearly up to 5 years. If this is not possible, questionnaire(s)&#xD;
      will be performed over the phone with the child's parents and records will be requested from&#xD;
      the treating neurosurgeon on this same schedule.&#xD;
