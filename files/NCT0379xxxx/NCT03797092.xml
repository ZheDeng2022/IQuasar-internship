      The overall aim of the project is to test the feasibility and safety of allogeneic&#xD;
      adipose-derived stromal cells (CSCC_ASC) investigational medicinal product, to improve&#xD;
      myocardial function in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathies (NIDCM) and heart&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate safety and regenerative capacity of&#xD;
      direct intra-myocardial injection of 100 million allogeneic CSCC_ASCs in NIDCM patients with&#xD;
      reduced left ventricular EF (≤ 40%) and heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a proof of concept study enrolling a total of 30 NIDCM patients with heart failure who&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to either CSCC_ASC cell therapy (Stem Cell Group)&#xD;
      or no cell therapy (Control Group). The treatment period is estimated to be 6 months&#xD;
      (efficacy end-point) with a 12-month follow-up period for safety end-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient treatment and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cell IMP will be delivered by a courier service to from REGIONH to UKCL using&#xD;
           validated portable dry liquid nitrogen shipping containers. It will then be stored in&#xD;
           nitrogen vapour containers until treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The preparation of the IMP will be performed as described in the treatment manual. The&#xD;
           IMP will be thawed and prepared for injection immediately before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 3-D map of the left ventricle will be created using the NOGA XP® system (Biological&#xD;
           Delivery System, Cordis, Johnson &amp; Johnson, USA). The delivery of the IMP (100 million&#xD;
           ASCs) into the myocardium will be performed by 10-15 injections of 0.2 cc, as described&#xD;
           in the treatment manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The post cell therapy surveillance will include clinical and laboratory safety follow-up&#xD;
           with monitoring of cardiac enzymes, hemodynamic and rhythm stability. The clinical&#xD;
           follow-up will be obtained at pre-defined time points. The presence of allogeneic HLA&#xD;
           anti-bodies will be monitored three and six months after treatment. End-points will be&#xD;
           monitored continuously and reported as occurring throughout the 12 months follow-up&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is change in left ventricle end-systolic volume (LVESV) at 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up measured by Echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are safety evaluated by development of allogeneic antibodies and&#xD;
      laboratory safety measurements 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment and changes in left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), end-diastolic volume and myocardial mass at 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional secondary endpoints are changes in NYHA, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire,&#xD;
      EQ-5D3L Questionnaire, 6 min walking test, additional echocardiographic measures (Global&#xD;
      strain %) and NT-pro-BNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of allogeneic CSCC_ASCs with respect to incidence and severity of serious adverse&#xD;
      events and suspected unrelated serious adverse events will be evaluated at 12 months&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures for safety Safety endpoints will be collected, reported to the authorities&#xD;
      and monitored according to legislation during the entire study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who was treated&#xD;
      with an investigational product, and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the&#xD;
      treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease,&#xD;
      whether or not related to the investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. results in death&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. is life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. is a congenital anomaly/birth defect&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. is medically important&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected unexpected serious adverse event reactions (SUSAR) is defined as a SAE occurring in&#xD;
      a subject in an interventional study that is assessed as both causally related to the suspect&#xD;
      product under clinical investigation and unexpected per the Investigator's Brochure (IB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      of the treatment. The DSMB will report directly to the director of the Project Management&#xD;
      Board, which will take the necessary action upon the DSMB's recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication The investigational cell product, CSCC_ASC, will be produced in an approved&#xD;
      GMP facility in Cardiology Stem Cell Centre at Rigshospitalet University Hospital,&#xD;
      Copenhagen, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The production of the allogeneic CSCC_ASCs will follow the description in an approved&#xD;
      Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier. The cell product will come from healthy donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The production unit will label the investigational medicinal product (IMP) in accordance with&#xD;
      the legislation and keep the randomisation code until finalisation of the clinical trial. The&#xD;
      final cell products will be stored in nitrogen vapour containers until clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic MSCs and ASCs have been administered to more than 600 patients with heart disease.&#xD;
      In the conducted clinical trials there has not been any serious adverse event due to the&#xD;
      treatment. A few patients have developed transient donor specific HLA-antibodies in serum&#xD;
      within the first months after treatment. However, none of the patients had any symptoms&#xD;
      related to the presence of antibodies. Transient fever was registered in a few patients, but&#xD;
      it could as well be due to the treatment procedure or the disease for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the accumulated safety and efficacy evidence with clinical use of allogeneic MSCs&#xD;
      and ASCs in conducted clinical trials and the safety data from the CSCC_ASC phase I trial and&#xD;
      the two ongoing phase II trials then it is concluded that it is safe to conduct a pilot&#xD;
      CSCC_ASC trial in patients with NIDCM and HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      The echocardiography data will be recorded at pre-defined intervals according to American&#xD;
      Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI)&#xD;
      recommendations. For each patient at least five end-expiratory full cardiac cycles will be&#xD;
      recorded for each protocol specified view. All acquired images will be de-identified and&#xD;
      transferred to independent imaging core-lab (Stanford Cardiovascular Institute Clinical&#xD;
      Biomarker &amp; Phenotyping Core Lab). The recordings will be analyzed at the end of the study by&#xD;
      an independent echocardiographer who will be blinded to the patient's treatment status and&#xD;
      the timing of the recordings. All measurements will be performed according to ASE/EACVI&#xD;
      recommendations. All echocardiographic measurements will be averaged over 5 cardiac cycles.&#xD;
      Left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESD) and end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) will be&#xD;
      measured in the parasternal long-axis view. Left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV),&#xD;
      left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), and LVEF will be estimated using the Simpson's&#xD;
      biplane method. Peak longitudinal strains will be computed automatically to generate regional&#xD;
      data from each of the 17 segments and then averaged to calculate global longitudinal strain.&#xD;
