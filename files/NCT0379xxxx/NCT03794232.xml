  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-controlled, exploratory clinical study.Through the intervention of soluble dietary&#xD;
      fiber in the pre-type 2 diabetic population, the change of blood glucose spectrum before and&#xD;
      after intervention can show the effect of this intervention on the outcome, and further&#xD;
      elucidate the effect of soluble dietary fiber intervention on the level of insulin resistance&#xD;
      and its effect on outcome. Helps to prevent the more scientific and effective prevention of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes from pre-diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who met the criteria were randomly divided into the experimental group and the&#xD;
      control group, after 24 weeks of intervention, the incidence of blood sugar reversion to&#xD;
      normal was main observed.The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      soluble dietary fiber treatment regimens on the conversion rate of pre-type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (converted to normal blood glucose, type 2 diabetes, or stable in the stage of impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance). The secondary objective was to study the improvement of insulin&#xD;
      resistance and changes in intestinal flora after intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The soluble dietary fiber (NIUCHANG®) and placebo used in the trial were exclusively produced&#xD;
      by Inuling (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd. and provided free of charge. During the treatment&#xD;
      period, the treatment group was given oral &quot;NIUCHANG®&quot; (once 15g,once a day)and the control&#xD;
      group was given oral placebo (once15 g, once a day) for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test was performed for 12 weeks as a course of treatment。At the end of one course of&#xD;
      treatment, if the glucose tolerance was changed to normal or the blood glucose was stable in&#xD;
      the pre-diabetes phase, the original dose was maintained and continued for 12 weeks. At 24&#xD;
      weeks, patients with normal blood glucose and glucose tolerance tests were followed up for 48&#xD;
      weeks. At the end of one course of treatment, if the blood glucose progresses to the stage of&#xD;
      diabetes, the test is withdrawn and treated according to clinical routine.&#xD;
