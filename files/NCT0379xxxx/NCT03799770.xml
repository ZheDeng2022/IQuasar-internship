  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this is observational study . the investigator will measure optic nerve sheath diameter by&#xD;
      ultrasound on the eye during living donor liver transplantation operation at different stages&#xD;
      to predict the occurance of early tacrolimus neurotoxicity post liver transplantation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurotoxicity is mainly associated with tacrolimus and cyclosporin, amounting to 10 - 30% for&#xD;
      CS and up to 32% for tacrolimus.(2) . Sirolimus, everolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil lack&#xD;
      the neurotoxicity of calcineurin inhibitors (3-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurotoxicity mostly occurs in the early postoperative period increasing morbidity, mortality&#xD;
      and hospital and intensive care stay. Neurotoxicity has variable manifestations and mainly&#xD;
      affects the CNS. They are usually divided into minor manifestations as tremor, headache,&#xD;
      insomnia and paraesthesia or major encephalopathy, akinetic mutism, seizures, speech&#xD;
      disorders, polyneuropathy, myopathy, pseudobulbar palsy and even stroke. (2) The main&#xD;
      pathogenesis of calcinurin inhibitors neurotoxicity appears to be ﬂuid extravasation&#xD;
      (vasogenic edema) due to disruption of blood brain barrier, not cell destruction (cytotoxic&#xD;
      edema).(5) During liver transplant operation there are changes in the intracranial pressure&#xD;
      and cerebral perfusion pressure especially during reperfusion that may affect the integrity&#xD;
      of blood brain barrier. (6) There are multiple methods for monitoring of intracranial&#xD;
      pressure invasive or non -invasive. The invasive method remains the gold standard for&#xD;
      monitoring of intracranial pressure but there is a controversy about its use in liver&#xD;
      transplantation as it may be complicated by bleeding and infections (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also there are a multiple non-invasive methods for monitoring of ICP. Ultrasonographic&#xD;
      measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) was introduced recently as a useful&#xD;
      noninvasive method for evaluating ICP. ONSD demonstrated a good correlation with the ICP&#xD;
      level in many previously published studies. (8,9) Rajajee et al. found that the optimal&#xD;
      cutoff of ONSD for the detection of an acutely increased ICP &gt; 20 mm Hg was greater than 4.8&#xD;
      mm. (10) We hypothesize that the absolute value or the changes of ONSD during different&#xD;
      stages of living donor liver transplantation operation may predict occurrence of early&#xD;
      calcinurin inhibitor neurotoxicity (CNIN).We will investigate whether the absolute value or&#xD;
      changes of ONSD during different stages of living donor liver transplantation operation may&#xD;
      be a predictor of early calcinurin inhibitor neurotoxicity in the first month post liver&#xD;
      transplantation. This is a prospective observational cohort study that will be conducted to&#xD;
      all adult patients of both sex undergoing living donor liver transplantation operation at&#xD;
      Gastro-Intestinal Surgical Centre (GISC), Mansoura university Hospitals, Mansoura, Egypt over&#xD;
      the period covering more than 100 consecutive cases. After Institutional review board&#xD;
      approval, we will secure informed consents from all included patients during the preoperative&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and surgery techniques will be done according to our center's protocol.(11)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reperfusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On portal vein declamping, we will start rapid 500 ml 4% albumin infusion or packed RBCs&#xD;
      (according to the anhepatic hemoglobin level 5 min before declamping) through 14 Gauge&#xD;
      peripheral venous cannula in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hypotension we will give norepinephrine and for resistant hypotension we will use&#xD;
      adrenaline as rescue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique of ONSD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonographic measurement of ONSD was performed with the same manner of previous studies.&#xD;
      Patients were placed in the supine position with their eyes closed, and a thick gel layer was&#xD;
      applied to the closed upper eyelid. The 7.5-MHz linear probe was placed on the gel without&#xD;
      excessive pressure and adjusted to the proper angle for displaying the entry of the optic&#xD;
      nerve into the globe. The intensity of the ultrasound was adjusted to display optimal&#xD;
      contrast between the retrobulbar echogenic fat tissue and the vertical hypoechoic band. An&#xD;
      ultrasound beam was focused on the retrobulbar area using the lowest possible acoustic power&#xD;
      that could measure ONSD. The ONSD was measured 3 mm behind the optic disc. Measurements were&#xD;
      performed in the transverse and sagittal planes of both eyes, and the ﬁnal ONSD value was&#xD;
      calculated by averaging 4 measured values. (8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunosuppression:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive intravenous 0.5 gm methylprednisolone at the start of the warm&#xD;
      ischemia. After hepatic artery anastomosis and declamping, we will administer 500 mg&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil through the nasogastric tube and i.v. 20 mg basiliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ICU, patients will receive oral tacrolimus starting the day after the operation&#xD;
      (adjusting the dose targeting serum level of 5-10 ng/ml) , mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg twice&#xD;
      per day and basiliximab 20 mg iv 4 days after.&#xD;
