    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters [SOD] of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD) as assessed by the investigator per RECIST 1.1, which is modified for this study to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. For participants with GBM, response will be assessed by the investigator based on RANO criteria (CR: disappearance of all target lesions, PR: sum of products of diameters [SPD] decreased by ≥ 50% from baseline value).
