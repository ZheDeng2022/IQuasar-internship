  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD), a condition predominantly caused by atherosclerosis, is the&#xD;
      leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the investigator's society. Peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease (PAD), a subset of CVD, occurs when the atherosclerosis progresses to compromise the&#xD;
      lower extremity circulation resulting in ischemic symptoms. Although atherosclerosis has been&#xD;
      generally regarded as a disease of developed or affluent countries, recent evidence showed a&#xD;
      progressive rise in the prevalence of CVD in developing countries where an epidemiological&#xD;
      shift of disease prevalence patterns from infectious illnesses to atherosclerotic disease has&#xD;
      occurred. Management of CVD, particularly with an emphasis of disease prevention, will&#xD;
      undoubtedly play an increasing vital role in the health care system around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction, as reflected by the impaired arterial vasodilatory capacity,&#xD;
      represents one of the pathogenic mechanisms linking atherosclerosis and cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality. The ability of arteries to dilate in response to stimuli is a significant&#xD;
      indicator of underlying vascular endothelial function and associated CVD. Factors modulating&#xD;
      vasodilatory response include the release of vasoactive compounds such as nitric oxide (NO)&#xD;
      from the endothelium and vascular compliance. In healthy individuals, a major mechanism&#xD;
      responsible for vasodilation is the hyperemic-stimulated release of NO from the endothelium,&#xD;
      resulting in vascular smooth muscle relaxation with subsequent vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular endothelial function can be assessed using a non-invasive technique to determine&#xD;
      brachial artery reactivity whereby a high-resolution ultrasound is used to measure changes in&#xD;
      brachial artery diameter to endogenous production of endothelium-derived NO via flow-mediated&#xD;
      dilation (FMD). Therefore, reduced FMD has been described as a reliable indicator of vascular&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction as well as presence of underlying CVD risk factors and related&#xD;
      diseases. Recent studies have similarly shown that arterial pulse-wave velocity (PWV), which&#xD;
      is a non-invasive evaluation of arterial stiffness, is a reliable indicator of vascular&#xD;
      function. While numerous studies have documented the benefit of dietary intervention in the&#xD;
      reduction of CVD related sequelae, limited data is available regarding whether the beneficial&#xD;
      effect of dietary intervention are reflected in vascular endothelial function. The present&#xD;
      study was therefore conducted to assess the effects of plant-based diet (PBD) on vascular&#xD;
      endothelial function as assessed by FMD and PWV in patients with peripheral arterial disease&#xD;
      (PAD).&#xD;

      Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) will be included in the study. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria for PAD included an ankle brachial index (ABI) of 0.90 or less at baseline. Those&#xD;
      with an ABI greater than 0.90 at baseline were eligible if a non-invasive vascular ultrasound&#xD;
      demonstrated PAD, lower extremity angiography showed arterial stenosis of 70% or greater, or&#xD;
      medical records documented prior revascularization of lower extremities.9 Additionally,&#xD;
      subjects must be willing and able to maintain an on-line food journal using smartphone-based&#xD;
      dietary apps. Once enrolled, all participants underwent baseline evaluation, after which they&#xD;
      were enrolled in either dietary advice for plant-based diet (PBD group) or no specific&#xD;
      dietary advice (control group). The dietary intervention was continued for four months, at&#xD;
      the end of which a follow up evaluation was performed.&#xD;
