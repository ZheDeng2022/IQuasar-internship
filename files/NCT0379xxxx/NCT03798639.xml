  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and how well nivolumab works when given together&#xD;
      with radiation therapy or ipilimumab as adjuvant therapy in treating patients with Merkel&#xD;
      cell cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may&#xD;
      help the body?s immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, gamma rays, neutrons,&#xD;
      protons or other sources to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving nivolumab with&#xD;
      radiation therapy or ipilimumab after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the tolerability of two different experimental immunotherapy regimens in the&#xD;
      adjuvant setting in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability profile of each of the treatment using Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the efficacy of each of the treatment arms according to recurrence-free&#xD;
      survival (RFS) at one and half years, defined as the time between the date of randomization&#xD;
      and the date of first progression (local, regional or distant metastasis) or death (whatever&#xD;
      the cause), whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the efficacy of each of the treatment arms according to overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      at three years, defined from the time of randomization and the date of death, compared to&#xD;
      historical registry control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore potential biomarkers, next generation T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing will be&#xD;
      performed to identify and longitudinally track individual T cell clones thus granting a&#xD;
      comprehensive insight into immunological changes that occur within the tumor and peripheral&#xD;
      blood throughout the course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes at week 0. Treatments&#xD;
      repeat every 4 weeks for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Beginning week 2, patients also receive radiation therapy on Monday-Friday or 5&#xD;
      days per week for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes at&#xD;
      week 0. Treatments repeat every 2 weeks for nivolumab and 6 weeks for ipilimumab for up to 1&#xD;
      year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;
