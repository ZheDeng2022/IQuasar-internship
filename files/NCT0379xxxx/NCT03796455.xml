  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, the role of chronic (10 weeks) intake of low dose (2g/day) of EPA+DHA&#xD;
      in whole body protein metabolism, and functional performance and systemic inflammation will&#xD;
      be examined, and whether adding either HMB at 3.0 g/d to the low dose of EPA+DHA (2.0 g/d)&#xD;
      will enhance these effects even more.&#xD;

      Weight loss commonly occurs in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),&#xD;
      negatively influencing their quality of life, treatment response and survival. Furthermore,&#xD;
      limb muscle dysfunction (weakness and/or enhanced fatigue) is a major systemic comorbidity in&#xD;
      patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), negatively affecting their&#xD;
      exercise performance, physical activity, quality of life, and mortality. As nutritional&#xD;
      abnormalities are main contributors to muscle loss and dysfunction in COPD, nutritional&#xD;
      support is viewed as an essential component of integrated care in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although nutritional support is effective in the treatment of weight loss in COPD, attempts&#xD;
      to increase muscle mass and function in COPD by supplying large amounts of protein or&#xD;
      calories to these patients have been small. This suggests that gains in muscle mass and&#xD;
      function are difficult to achieve in COPD unless specific metabolic abnormalities are&#xD;
      targeted. The investigators and other researchers found that low muscle mass in COPD was&#xD;
      strongly associated with elevated whole body protein turnover and increased myofibrillar&#xD;
      protein breakdown rates indicative of muscle contractile protein loss. The investigators have&#xD;
      extended this finding recently to normal weight COPD patients characterized by muscle&#xD;
      weakness using a more precise and accurate pulse method of tau-methylhistidine tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial number of COPD patients, underweight as well as normal weight to obese, are&#xD;
      characterized by an increased inflammatory response as evidenced by elevated levels of the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, Interleukin (IL) 6 and 8, and the&#xD;
      soluble TNF-α receptors (55 and 75). Furthermore, CRP levels are elevated in COPD and&#xD;
      associated with reduced quadriceps strength, lower maximal and submaximal exercise capacity&#xD;
      and increased morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the few agents capable to suppress the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines are&#xD;
      eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA), primary ω-3 fatty acids found in&#xD;
      fish oils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous experimental research and clinical studies in cachectic conditions (mostly&#xD;
      malignancy) indicate that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are able to attenuate protein&#xD;
      degradation by improving the anabolic response to feeding and by decreasing the acute phase&#xD;
      response. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), in combination with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), has&#xD;
      been shown to effectively inhibit weight loss in several disease states, however weight&#xD;
      weight and muscle mass and function increase was not present or minimal. Also in healthy&#xD;
      older adults, fish oil can slow the decline in muscle mass and function. A randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial in COPD patients showed that extra nutritional supplementation with PUFAs&#xD;
      daily of 1000 mg EPA+DHA as adjunct to exercise training during 8 weeks enhanced exercise&#xD;
      capacity but did not lead to muscle mass gain. The patients who did not respond adequately (&lt;&#xD;
      2% gain in weight), had a higher TNF-α level than those who did gain sufficient weight, which&#xD;
      is in line with previous data in COPD showing an association between an increased systemic&#xD;
      inflammation with non-response to nutritional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although previous studies support the concept of EPA+DHA supplementation to ameliorate the&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response and decrease protein breakdown, there is no information&#xD;
      present on the effects of EPA+DHA supplementation on whole body and muscle protein metabolism&#xD;
      in COPD. The investigators have recently examined the dose-response effects of 0, 2 and 3.5 g&#xD;
      of EPA+DHA intervention ( EPA / DHA) for 4 weeks in stable moderate to severe COPD patients&#xD;
      (8pts /group) (unpublished data) but were not able to find a positive effect of muscle mass&#xD;
      and strength, even with the highest dose, likely related to the relatively short (4 week)&#xD;
      supplementation period. The effect of EPA+DHA intervention on whole body and muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis and breakdown rates is currently being analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although numerous animal studies have shown the benefit of HMB in downregulating muscle&#xD;
      protein breakdown under catabolic conditions, there is very little data in COPD patients.&#xD;
      Others have tested HMB (3g/d) in COPD patients in the ICU and reported anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      benefits and improvement in pulmonary function. In patients with bronchiectasis, 24 week&#xD;
      supplementation with an ONS containing HMB (1.5g/d) versus standard of care during pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation program, resulted in benefits on body composition, muscle strength and QoL. A&#xD;
      combination of HMB and EPA/DHA in a mouse model of cancer cachexia showed a synergy between&#xD;
      the two ingredients on preventing muscle loss and downregulation of muscle protein&#xD;
      degradation.&#xD;
