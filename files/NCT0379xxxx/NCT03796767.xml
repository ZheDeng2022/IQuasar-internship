  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well surgery and radiation therapy work in treating patients&#xD;
      with prostate cancer that has come back or spread to other parts of the body. Radiation&#xD;
      therapy uses high energy beams to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Surgical procedures,&#xD;
      such as oligometastasectomy, may remove tumor cells that have spread to other parts of the&#xD;
      body. Surgery and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with prostate cancer&#xD;
      that has come back or spread to other parts of the body.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess response to treatment of oligometastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess additional measurements of response to treatment of oligometastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression free-survival following treatment&#xD;
      of oligometastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess time to disease recurrence following treatment of oligometastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess time to initiation of antiandrogen therapy (ADT) for metastatic prostate cancer&#xD;
      following treatment of oligometastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the rate of undetectable PSA following treatment of oligometastatic disease in&#xD;
      subjects who have previously undergone prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess safety. VII. To assess the impact of study treatment on change in quality of&#xD;
      life over three years.&#xD;

                  over nadir.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects treated with prior definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer who have&#xD;
             positive molecular imaging (e.g., fluciclovine PET/CT scan or other per PI discretion)&#xD;
             suggesting recurrent intraprostatic disease must undergo transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)&#xD;
             biopsy less than or equal to one year before study enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the TRUS biopsy is negative, no additional treatment is required to the&#xD;
                  prostate in addition to that of scan positive sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the TRUS biopsy is positive, subject must undergo salvage prostatectomy or&#xD;
                  salvage radiotherapy to the primary site concurrently with the study treatment&#xD;
                  per the treatment protocol algorithm.&#xD;

          -  For patients with oligometastatic disease involving lymph nodes, metastasis is&#xD;
             confined to the pelvic or para-aortic (below IMA) regions on molecular imaging (e.g.,&#xD;
             fluciclovine PET/CT or PSMA PET/CT scan or other per PI discretion).&#xD;

             consent form (ICF) signature and lasting until at least 6 months after the last&#xD;
             radiation treatment. Because of the potential side effect on spermatogenesis&#xD;
             associated with radiation, female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
             a highly effective contraceptive method during and for 6 months after completing&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
