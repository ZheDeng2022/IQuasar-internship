&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be assessed for eligibility at the screening visit (Visit 1) three weeks&#xD;
      after TURB and re-TURB prior to randomization and only subjects who fulfil the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be included: patients with a diagnosis of High risk Non Muscle Invasive Bladder&#xD;
      Cancer (NMIBC): T1 tumor, G3, Carcinoma in Situ (CIS), or multiple and recurrent and large&#xD;
      (&gt;3 cm) Ta or patients in the last EAU recurrence category (EAU/EORTC recurrence score&#xD;
      &gt;/=10). Patients selected for the study, are centrally randomized (randomization is performed&#xD;
      at the Sant'Andrea Hospital) to receive BCG induction treatment according to the standard&#xD;
      protocol (an instillation once a week for six weeks) with Immucyst (81 mg Connaught strain&#xD;
      BCG). Patients in group two received BCG treatment with the same protocol with a 40 mg&#xD;
      mitomycin instillation the day before .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events All the adverse events that will occur in the study will be recorded in the&#xD;
      case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event (AE) is defined as a harmful clinical event occurring in a patient or a&#xD;
      human volunteer involved in a clinical experimentation who received a drug that does not&#xD;
      necessarily have a relationship with the treatment given. It is considered AE any medical&#xD;
      occurrence including undesirable signs or symptoms or abnormal lab finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE that, independently from the dosage of the drug used,&#xD;
      had one of the following characteristic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Results in death&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It's life threatening (i.e. the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event;&#xD;
           it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were&#xD;
           more severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. It's cause of hospital admission or increase the time of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. It's cause of congenital abnormalities at birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. It's cause of disability or severe and long lasting inability Treatment Emergent Adverse&#xD;
           Events (TEAE) is defined as any event not present prior to the initiation of the&#xD;
           treatments or any event already present that worsens in the either intensity or&#xD;
           frequency following exposure to the treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is the term used to refer to an&#xD;
      adverse event that occurs in a clinical trial subject, which is assessed as being unexpected,&#xD;
      serious and as having a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship with the study drug.&#xD;
      It is defined as an untoward and unintended response to a study drug, at any dose, which is&#xD;
      not listed in the product information, and meets one of the above mentioned serious&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally AEs are collected after signing the informed consent form and could be related or&#xD;
      unrelated to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For any AE/SAE recorded during the study a causal relationship with the drug used will be&#xD;
      assessed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Very likely: the AE/SAE is temporally associated to the drug administration, cannot be&#xD;
           explained by other clinical conditions and/or concomitant treatments, disappears with&#xD;
           drug withdrawal and recurs after drug reintroduction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Likely: the AE/SAE is temporally associated to the drug administration, cannot be&#xD;
           explained by other clinical conditions and/or concomitant treatments, disappears with&#xD;
           the drug withdrawal. There is no information on drug reintroduction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible: the AE/SAE is temporally associated to the drug administration, cannot be&#xD;
           explained by other clinical conditions and/or concomitant treatments, disappears with&#xD;
           drug. There is no information available on the drug withdrawal and reintroduction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doubtful: the AE/SAE could be temporally associated to the drug administration, but can&#xD;
           be explained by other clinical conditions and/or concomitant treatments;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not correlated: the AE/SAE is not temporally associated to the drug administration&#xD;
           and/or can be explained by other clinical conditions and/or concomitant treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An AE/SAE with causal relationship very likely, likely possible with the drug is&#xD;
           considered correlated with it and is defined Adverse Reaction (ADR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO) defines ADR as &quot;a response to a drug which is noxious &amp;&#xD;
      unintended and which occurs at doses normally used for prophylaxis diagnosis or therapy of a&#xD;
      disease or for modification of a physiological function&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between AE and ADR is that AE event does not imply causality but not for ADR,&#xD;
      a causal rule is suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ADR unexpected is defined an ADR that for nature and severity is not listed in the product&#xD;
      information (Reference Safety Information (RSI)/Investigator's Brochure (IB)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity evaluation Urine culture is performed 3 days before each bladder instillation to&#xD;
      check urine sterility (mandatory before the first course, optional before the following&#xD;
      instillations). Treatment related adverse events are recorded by the patients on a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome analysis: adverse events are self-recorded by the patients after each instillation&#xD;
      and classified by the investigator according to a classification grid considering account&#xD;
      duration and intensity as proposed by Saint et al. Thus, toxicity is classified as systemic&#xD;
      or local and class I (mild) up to class III (severe). The baseline symptoms are also&#xD;
      assessed. Local toxicity included bacterial cystitis, BCG induced cystitis, frequency,&#xD;
      macroscopic hematuria and &quot;other&quot;. Bacterial cystitis is defined as the occurrence of culture&#xD;
      proven (not BCG) bacterial cystitis. Irritative bladder symptoms with negative urine culture&#xD;
      are classified as BCG induced (chemical) cystitis. &quot;Other&quot; local side effects include&#xD;
      granulomatous prostatitis, epididymitis, ureteral obstruction and contracted bladder.&#xD;
      Systemic side effects are classified as fever (≥39 °C), influenza like symptoms including&#xD;
      general malaise and chills, BCG induced lung infection, liver toxicity, and BCG sepsis. Skin&#xD;
      rash, arthralgia and arthritis are classified as possible allergic reactions. Based on the&#xD;
      severity of adverse events experienced by the patient, one of the investigator, who is blind&#xD;
      to the given therapy, decides whether the next instillation is to be done, postponed, deleted&#xD;
      or whether the patient should receive specific anti-tuberculosis therapy. Dose reduction is&#xD;
      not allowed in either group. Patients will also complete flow-volume charts for three days&#xD;
      after BCG instillations and two questionaries to assess urinary symptoms and patient's&#xD;
      perception of bladder pain as the chronic prostatitis symptoms index (NIH-CPSI) and the&#xD;
      pelvic pain and urgency/frequency questionaire (PUF). The efficacy of both treatments is&#xD;
      assessed at 3, 6,9,12 months with flexible cystoscopy, urinary cytology and bladder biopsy if&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTYCAL ANALYSIS Using type I error, and a power of 2.5% and 81% respectively, and by&#xD;
      proposing the hypothesis that Immucyst induced a recurrence in about 60% of cases (EORTC risk&#xD;
      score 10) and its combination with mitomycin decreases this percent by 30%, it was calculated&#xD;
      that 66 subjects per group were necessary to detect this difference using the adjusted&#xD;
      chi-square method and Statistical Solution calculator. Student's T test was used for&#xD;
      continuous variables. Two-sided p values were calculated.&#xD;
