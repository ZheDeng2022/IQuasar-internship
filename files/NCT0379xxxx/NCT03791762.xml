  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an ideal endodontic treatment, maintenance of the original root canal morphology of the&#xD;
      canal during root canal preparation, an ideal preparation and obturation is essential. Even&#xD;
      if all stages are ideal, pain after endodontic treatment is a clinical condition that may&#xD;
      occur after a few hours or several days. Post-operative pain after endodontic treatment is an&#xD;
      undesirable condition which makes the clinician and the patient a distressing condition. Many&#xD;
      clinical studies reported a 25-40% postoperative pain rate after endodontic treatment, which&#xD;
      means that postoperative pain is a clinical symptom that should be considered for&#xD;
      endodontist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ProTaper Next files (Dentsply Tulsa Dental Specialties) operate in continuous rotary&#xD;
      motion, and their center of mass or center of rotation is positioned off-center relative to&#xD;
      the instrument's central axis of rotation. During rotation, the files of this design produce&#xD;
      a mechanical wave of motion, which travels along the length of the working part of the&#xD;
      instrument, minimizing the contact between the file and dentin. According to the&#xD;
      manufacturer, the offset design of this instrument also improves debris removal and&#xD;
      flexibility in the working part of the file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New heat treatment has been carried out on NiTi alloy, seeking to increase its flexibility&#xD;
      and cyclic fatigue resistance. Recently, the Wave One Gold instrument, manufactured with a&#xD;
      new thermal treatment called Gold treatment, was introduced on the market presenting some&#xD;
      differences in design, size and taper compared to Wave One. Wave One Gold instrument has a&#xD;
      parallelogram cross-sectional design, having two cutting edges, and consists of four&#xD;
      instruments, 21/.06 (small), 25/07 (primary), 35/06 (medium) and 45/05 (large) while Wave One&#xD;
      presents convex triangular cross-sectional design, besides larger size and taper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reciproc blue (REB, VDW), a new-generation reciprocating single-file system, is the latest&#xD;
      version of REC. Like the REC file, REB also has an S-shaped cross section, 2 cutting edges,&#xD;
      and a noncutting tip. However, REB files are manufactured by altering the molecular structure&#xD;
      through a new heat treatment in order to increase the cyclic fatigue resistance. This new&#xD;
      heat treatment gives the file its blue color. It was reported that REB files have&#xD;
      approximately 2 times higher cyclic fatigue resistance than REC files. In addition, REB files&#xD;
      can also be relatively prebent to better access curved canals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the effect of Reciproc Blue, Protaper Next, Waveone Gold within preparation on the&#xD;
      postoperative endodontic pain has not been investigated, yet. The aim of this prospective&#xD;
      clinical trial was to clinically compare the incidence of postoperative pain after use of&#xD;
      different nickel titanium file systems. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative pain root canal preparation performed with Reciproc Blue, Protaper&#xD;
      Next, Waveone Gold. The null hypothesis tested was that there is no difference in the&#xD;
      incidence and severity of postoperative pain following with any of the 3 instruments.&#xD;

      In the study, 180 patients who were diagnosed with asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis,&#xD;
      symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, acute apical periodontitis and chronic apical&#xD;
      periodontitis, and who applied to the Endodontics clinic for inclusion in the endodontics&#xD;
      clinic will be included. A female with systemic healthy patients who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be treated clinically and radiologically. The age and gender of the patient&#xD;
      will be recorded as patient-dependent variables, and location and type of the tooth to be&#xD;
      treated will be recorded as tooth-dependent variables. Before the root canal treatment, the&#xD;
      responsible researcher will provide training on patients with the Vizual Analog Scale (VAS)&#xD;
      and its use. Root canal treatments will be completed by this responsible investigator. Before&#xD;
      starting root canal treatment, local anesthesia will be applied using 2: Lidocaine anesthetic&#xD;
      solution containing 2: 80,000 epinephrine using the appropriate technique to the tooth. After&#xD;
      anesthesia is provided, endodontic access cavities suitable for the teeth will be opened. The&#xD;
      pulp tissue will be extruded using a turner. Subsequently, according to the entry path file&#xD;
      to be used, the subjects will be assigned to the group that is selected from the closed&#xD;
      envelopes that write the names of the groups, and random manual preparation will be divided&#xD;
      into 3 groups: the R-Pilot file will be used, the rotation preparation will be used, and the&#xD;
      ProGlider file will be used (n = 60). Working lengths will be determined by using K type file&#xD;
      10 and electronic apex finders. The manual preparation group will serve as the control group.&#xD;
      In this group, K type hand files (Dentsply Sirona) # 08, 10, 15, respectively, will be used&#xD;
      with the &quot;forward and retract&quot; technique proposed by Ruddle at the working length. The file&#xD;
      will be moved clockwise and then counterclockwise, by rotating quarterly, the resistance will&#xD;
      be advanced and retracted to the point where resistance is felt in the canal. This&#xD;
      preparation will be made with each file until the working length is reached. In the rotation&#xD;
      group where ProGlider file will be used, the entry way will be prepared at 300 rpm and 5 Ncm&#xD;
      torque values using the torque-controlled endodontic motor (X-Smart) until the working length&#xD;
      is reached with the crown-down technique. In the reciprocating movement group where the&#xD;
      R-Pilot file will be used, the entry path will be prepared using the &quot;Reciproc All&quot; mode in&#xD;
      the VDW-Silver endodontic engine. After the entryway preparation, standard procedures will be&#xD;
      performed for all three groups. The channels will be prepared with ProTaper Next file system.&#xD;
      During treatment, 10 mL of 5% NaOCl irrigation for each channel will be done using a 30-G&#xD;
      irrigation needle. After the preparation, final irrigation will be done with 17% EDTA,&#xD;
      distilled water and 5% NaOCl, respectively. In the samples in all three groups, after the&#xD;
      root canals are dried with sterile paper cone, they will be filled with cold Plus lateral&#xD;
      compaction technique with AH Plus canal paste and gutta percha cone. Patients' phone numbers&#xD;
      will be taken, a copy of the VAS form will be delivered to the patients to be filled in, and&#xD;
      it will be explained that postoperative pain measurements will be made with 6, 12, 18, 24, 36&#xD;
      and 48 hours of VAS. Patients will be reached by phone 48 hours after the completion of root&#xD;
      canal treatments and information about their pain levels will be received. VAS values will be&#xD;
      classified as follows: 0, no pain; 1-3, mild pain; 4-6, moderate pain; 7-10, severe pain. The&#xD;
      use of analgesics will also be evaluated and recorded within the first 48 hours.&#xD;

    <description>Visual analogue scale is a measure of pain intensity. In the present study, the visual analogue scale included a 10 cm straight horizontal line numbered at each centimetre from 0 to 10 showing two extreme symptoms of pain. &quot;0&quot; means no pain and &quot;10&quot; means the worst pain the subject has ever experienced. Each centimeter represents the pain intensity that the subject will mark orientated from 0 to 10. The intensity is increased from 0 to 10, therefore a higher score means a higher pain intensity and a worse outcome. 1-3 means &quot;mild pain&quot;, 4-6 means &quot;moderate pain&quot; and 7-9 means &quot;severe pain&quot;. There are no subscales.</description>
