      Chronic airway changes, such as smooth muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia, reticular basement&#xD;
      membrane (RBM) thickening, goblet cells hyperplasia characterize severe asthma. Chronic&#xD;
      inflammation, and especially eosinophilia and T2 cytokines are involved in these structural&#xD;
      changes. The aim of this prospective observational study is to assess airway changes,&#xD;
      assessed by bronchial biopsies before treatment, then after 6 months and 12 months, induced&#xD;
      by mepolizumab in 40 severe asthma patients who will receive the treatment as part of their&#xD;
      standard care. Changes in RBM thickening, in airway smooth muscle (ASM) area, in the number&#xD;
      of PGP9 sections will be assessed on bronchial biopsies after 6 months and 12 months of&#xD;
      mepolizumab treatment. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) levels of inflammatory and remodeling&#xD;
      mediators and of extra-cellular matrix (ECM) components will be measured after 6 months and&#xD;
      12 months of mepolizumab treatment. Relationship between clinical response to mepolizumab and&#xD;
      remodeling changes after 6 months and 12 months will be assessed.&#xD;

      1. Scientific Rationale &amp; Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Chronic airway changes, such as smooth muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia, reticular&#xD;
           basement membrane thickening, goblet cells hyperplasia characterize severe asthma.&#xD;
           Chronic inflammation, and especially eosinophilia and T2 cytokines are involved in these&#xD;
           structural changes. Increased ASM layer has been associated with eosinophilia for&#xD;
           example, but not RBM thickening, suggesting that differential patterns of remodeling can&#xD;
           be observed according to inflammatory patterns. Omalizumab, an anti IgE therapy, can&#xD;
           reduce some features of airway remodeling, especially RBM and some parameters related to&#xD;
           ASM. No data are available on potential changes in airway remodeling induced by&#xD;
           mepolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the study is to assess airway changes, assessed by bronchial biopsies,&#xD;
           induced by mepolizumab in severe asthma patients who will receive the treatment as part&#xD;
           of their standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All asthma patients refered to the asthma clinic are proposed to participate to the&#xD;
           COBRA cohort (French national asthma cohort). Serum and DNA are collected at inclusion&#xD;
           and every 6 months. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) is routinely performed as part of the&#xD;
           standard care for difficult-to-severe asthma in our centre for many years, to assess&#xD;
           differential diagnosis and inflammatory pattern since Fractional exhaled nitric oxide&#xD;
           (FeNO) is not routinely performed in France. BAL and 4 to 6 bronchial biopsies are&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Severe asthma patients, refered to Severe Asthma Centre in Bichat and Bicetre Hospitals,&#xD;
           receiving mepolizumab according to French recommendations (eos &gt;300mm3 in the previous&#xD;
           year, &gt;2 exacerbations, despite optimal step 4-5 therapy, including daily use of&#xD;
           steroids).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  General study design Prospective, observational study in one Severe Asthma Centre :&#xD;
                Bichat Hospital (Prof C.Taillé).&#xD;
&#xD;
                40 patients will be prospectively included during a 32 months period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in RBM thickening, in ASM area after 6 months and 12 months of mepolizumab&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in BAL levels of inflammatory and remodeling mediators and of ECM components&#xD;
           after 6 months and 12 months of mepolizumab treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the number of PGP9 sections in the bronchial wall after 6 months and 12&#xD;
           months of mepolizumab treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relationship between clinical response to mepolizumab and remodeling changes after 6&#xD;
           months and 12 months of mepolizumab treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and clinical characteristics of asthma (atopy, level of asthma control,&#xD;
           FEV1…) will be available at inclusion and follow up, to assess clinical effect of&#xD;
           mepolizumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will perform at inclusion, 6 months and 12 months after initiating mepolizumab:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical evaluation (age, BMI, atopic status, chronic rhinosinusitis, daily doses of&#xD;
           steroids, exacerbations…)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  benefit of mepolizumab will be evaluated according to the physician's Global Evaluation&#xD;
           of Treatment Effectiveness (GETE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  asthma control test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lung function test (FEV1, FEV1/VC, TLC, RV, pre/post salbutamol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FOB with BAL and 6 biopsies at inclusion, 6 months and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test for eosinophil count and serum conservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study groups/arms Group 1 (prospective) : patients initiating a mepolizumab&#xD;
                treatment. Group 2 (retrospective): to assess airway changes that can&#xD;
                &quot;spontaneously&quot; occur during a 12 month-period, a retrospective &quot;historical group&quot;&#xD;
                of patients included in the previous ASMATHERM study who had 2 sets of biopsies and&#xD;
                BAL within a 6 to 12 month-interval, without exposure to mepolizumab and without&#xD;
                change in their treatment during this interval, will be studied as a control group&#xD;
                . Clinical data are available at inclusion and after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Main tests or procedures All biopsies, BAL and serum analysis will be performed in&#xD;
                the UMR1152 lab unit (Head: Dr Marina Pretolani).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies are fixed in formaldehyde and processed to paraffin wax for immunohistochemical&#xD;
      (IHC) and morphometric studies. One biopsy will be stored at -80°C for further RNAseq&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RBM thickening (morphometry), ASM area and the rate of ASM-proliferating cells (PCNA&#xD;
      immuno-staining) will be measured. PGP9 staining can assess the number of nerves in the&#xD;
      bronchial wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of inflammatory cells (eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells, T-lymphocytes&#xD;
      evaluated respectively by MBP, elastase, tryptase, CD4 expression) and vascular sections will&#xD;
      also be enumerated after IHC. Eosinophils localization in the airway will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytospin preparations from BAL cell pellets will be used to assess the proportion of&#xD;
      eosinophils and neutrophils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, the levels of different pro-inflammatory and remodeling mediators will be&#xD;
      measured in BAL aliquots concentrated x 10, by specific Elisa and Luminex assays.&#xD;
