      Parent-focused Redesign for Encounters, Newborns to Toddlers (PARENT) is a team-based&#xD;
      approach to care using a health educator (&quot;Parent Coach&quot;) to provide the bulk of WCC&#xD;
      services, address specific needs faced by families in low-income communities, and decrease&#xD;
      reliance on the clinician as the primary provider of WCC services. The Parent Coach provides&#xD;
      anticipatory guidance, psychosocial and social needs screening/referral, and developmental&#xD;
      and behavioral surveillance, screening, and guidance at each WCC visit, and is supported by&#xD;
      parent-focused pre-visit screening and visit prioritization, a brief, problem-focused&#xD;
      clinician encounter for a physical exam and any concerns that require a clinician's&#xD;
      attention, and an automated text message parent reminder and education service for periodic,&#xD;
      age-specific messages to reinforce key health-related information recommended by Bright&#xD;
      Futures national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 major phases to this study. In Phase 1, the investigators will use a Community&#xD;
      Engagement &amp; Intervention Implementation process that has been successful in previous studies&#xD;
      to guide the intervention adaptation process, Parent Coach training, practice workflow, and&#xD;
      intervention implementation in the practices. In Phase 2, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      cluster RCT of PARENT to determine its effects on quality, utilization, and clinician&#xD;
      efficiency, and its cost/cost-offset.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Well-Child Care (WCC) visits for child preventive care during the first three years of life&#xD;
      are critical because they may be the only opportunity before a child reaches preschool to&#xD;
      identify and address important social, developmental, behavioral, and health issues that&#xD;
      could have significant impact and long-lasting effects on children's lives as adults. Despite&#xD;
      its potential, multiple studies have demonstrated that pediatric providers fail to provide&#xD;
      all recommended preventive and developmental services at these visits and that most parents&#xD;
      leave the visit with unaddressed psychosocial, developmental, and behavioral concerns.&#xD;
      Further, these missed opportunities are more pronounced for children in low-income families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A critical problem is that the structure of WCC in the U.S. cannot support the vast array of&#xD;
      WCC needs of families. Key structural problems include (a) reliance on clinicians&#xD;
      (pediatricians, family physicians, or nurse practitioners) for basic, routine WCC services,&#xD;
      (b) limitation to a 15-minute face-to-face clinician-directed WCC visit for the wide array of&#xD;
      education and guidance services in WCC, and (c) lack of a systematic, patient-driven method&#xD;
      for visit customization to meet families' needs. These structural problems contribute to the&#xD;
      wide variations in processes of care and preventive care outcomes, resulting in poorer&#xD;
      quality of WCC and perhaps worse health outcomes, particularly for children in low-income&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the gaps in current WCC this study introduces a new model of care to meet the&#xD;
      needs of children in low-income communities: Parent-focused Redesign for Encounters, Newborns&#xD;
      to Toddlers (PARENT). PARENT is a team-based approach to care using a health educator&#xD;
      (&quot;Parent Coach&quot;) to provide the bulk of WCC services, address specific needs faced by&#xD;
      families in low-income communities, and decrease reliance on the clinician as the primary&#xD;
      provider of WCC services. The Parent Coach provides anticipatory guidance, psychosocial&#xD;
      screening/referral, and developmental and behavioral surveillance, screening, and guidance at&#xD;
      each WCC visit, and is supported by parent-focused pre-visit screening and visit&#xD;
      prioritization, a brief, problem-focused clinician encounter for a physical exam and any&#xD;
      concerns that require a clinician's attention, and an automated text message parent reminder&#xD;
      and education service for periodic, age-specific messages to reinforce key health-related&#xD;
      information recommended by Bright Futures national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy of PARENT, the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT). The study will be conducted in partnership with 10 clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 major phases to this study. In Phase 1, the investigators will use a Community&#xD;
      Engagement &amp; Intervention Implementation process that has been successful in previous studies&#xD;
      to guide the intervention adaptation process, Parent Coach training, practice workflow, and&#xD;
      intervention implementation in the practices. In Phase 2, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      cluster RCT of PARENT to determine its effects on quality, utilization, and clinician&#xD;
      efficiency, and its cost/cost-offset. The project's community partners include two&#xD;
      federally-qualified health centers (FQHC). FQHC #1 has 4 clinics participating in the study&#xD;
      and FQHC #2 has 6 clinics participating in the study. The total number of clinics&#xD;
      participating in the study is 10 clinics randomized at the clinic level to intervention or&#xD;
      control condition. The intervention clinics will implement PARENT for all well-visits through&#xD;
      age 2 years at their clinical site, and the control clinics will continue usual care&#xD;
      (clinician directed well-visit). 1,000 families will be enrolled at infant age â‰¤12 months and&#xD;
      remain in the study for a period of 12 months. Parents will complete a survey at baseline and&#xD;
      at 6 and 12-months post enrollment.&#xD;

    <description>The Parent Coach intervention uses a health educator who provides anticipatory guidance, psychosocial screening/ referral, and developmental/behavioral surveillance, screening, and guidance at each well-visit. The Parent Coach uses a parent-focused, pre-visit questionnaire to customize the visit to the parents' needs. Every well-visit includes a brief, problem-focused encounter with a clinician for a physical exam and any concerns that require a clinician's attention. Finally, an automated text message service provides for periodic, age-specific messages to reinforce key health messages from Parent Coach-led well-visits.</description>
