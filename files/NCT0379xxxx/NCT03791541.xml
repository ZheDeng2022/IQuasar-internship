  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is the development and implementation of a survey&#xD;
      administered to hospitalized patients on Internal Medicine that can be used in conjunction&#xD;
      with previously validated predictive indices to identify patients at risk for readmission.&#xD;
      The survey consists of previously validated as well as investigator developed survey&#xD;
      instruments that will assess the following: health literacy, numeracy, medication adherence,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and tolerance. The predictive indices are the LACE, Charlson Comorbidity Index&#xD;
      (included in LACE), and the Comorbidity Polypharmacy Score (CPS) which have been previously&#xD;
      validated for risk of readmissions. The survey consists of both closed and open ended&#xD;
      questions. A part of the survey will be administered by the study personnel while the rest is&#xD;
      a questionnaire-based survey that will be completed by the subjects. Study personnel will be&#xD;
      with the subjects in an open dialogue while subjects are completing the survey to answer any&#xD;
      questions and identify questions that may be confusing or bias subjects. Approximately 30&#xD;
      days after hospital discharge, patients will be contacted via telephone to ask how many&#xD;
      admissions and/or Emergency Department (ED) visits they have had since discharge. A&#xD;
      correlation analysis will be done of the different aspects of the survey to determine whether&#xD;
      there are redundancies. A regression analysis will be done to determine the predictive&#xD;
      ability of the survey combined with predictive indices for readmission.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients are readmitted to the hospital shortly after discharge. Twenty percent of&#xD;
      Medicare beneficiaries discharged were re-hospitalized within 30 days at a cost to Medicare&#xD;
      estimated at $17.4 billion. This problem does not only affect the elderly. Medicaid enrollees&#xD;
      aged 21-64 had 10.7% 30-day readmission rate. Identifying which patients are at highest risk&#xD;
      is important for allocating resources to those high risk individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have attempted to retrospectively identify medical conditions, medications,&#xD;
      labs, and vitals associated with increased risk of readmission with different levels of&#xD;
      success. Examples of these include the Charlson Comorbidity Index, LACE, and the Comorbidity&#xD;
      Polypharmacy Score. Although not always developed for use in predicting readmissions, they&#xD;
      have been subsequently associated with this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While these indices examine objective data, it is thought that health beliefs, abilities, and&#xD;
      behaviors can also affect the risk of readmissions. Health literacy in particular has been&#xD;
      shown to be associated with 30 day readmissions after an acute myocardial infarction and in&#xD;
      general medical patients. Low numeracy has been associated with increased risk of 30 day&#xD;
      readmission in patients with acute heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient questionnaires are able to identify patients who are more likely than others to be&#xD;
      readmitted. Additionally, objective qualities such as insurance status, comorbidities, and&#xD;
      admissions within the past year are predictors of readmission. Due to the unique patient&#xD;
      populations at different health systems, an institution-specific approach is necessary to&#xD;
      analyze the specific factors contributing to readmission. Therefore, a survey will be used to&#xD;
      gauge the most predictive factors of readmissions and ED visits, including objective and&#xD;
      subjective sections. After further research and modification, the survey will potentially&#xD;
      serve as a tool for clinicians to select the best approach to post-discharge care and&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot will attempt to test a survey for predicting readmission through measurements of&#xD;
      health literacy, numeracy, medication adherence, self-efficacy, and tolerance, and in&#xD;
      conjunction with co-morbidity indices.&#xD;
