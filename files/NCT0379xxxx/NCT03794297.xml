  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well dabrafenib and trametinib work in&#xD;
      treating patients with Erdheim Chester disease that have BRAF V600 gene mutations. Dabrafenib&#xD;
      and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study the efficacy and safety of dabrafenib mesylate (dabrafenib) and trametinib&#xD;
      dimethyl sulfoxide (trametinib) as combination therapy in patients with BRAF V600E positive&#xD;
      Erdheim Chester disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the clinical response rate to dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy&#xD;
      in patients with BRAF V600E positive Erdheim Chester disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine time response, progression free survival and overall survival. II. To assess&#xD;
      disease resistance to this combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To monitor the degree of histiocytic infiltration-fibrosis progression, stability and&#xD;
      regression under combination therapy using fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans&#xD;
      and technetium (T)-99m bone scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To monitor serum C-reactive protein (CRP), estrogen receptor (ESR), and cytokine levels&#xD;
      as inflammatory markers prior to and during combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To monitor renal function prior to and during combination therapy in order to assess for&#xD;
      functional improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the level of functioning, fatigue, motor skills and ability to perform&#xD;
      routine daily activities prior to and during therapy in order to assess for improvements in&#xD;
      these areas as well as quality of life improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To establish duration of treatment-endpoints in patients with BRAF V600E positive&#xD;
      Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dabrafenib mesylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and trametinib dimethyl&#xD;
      sulfoxide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 48 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients can be previously or simultaneously enrolled in the natural history ECD&#xD;
             protocol #11-HG-0207, &quot;Clinical and Basic Investigations into Erdheim Chester&#xD;
             disease&quot;. Eligible patients must have been diagnosed with Erdheim Chester disease,&#xD;
             confirmed by pathological evaluation of the affected tissue with adequate staining.&#xD;
             Affected tissue must harbor the BRAF V600 mutation&#xD;
&#xD;

             Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment, involving interferon, anakinra, imatinib, steroids, chemotherapy&#xD;
             with, but not limited to cladribine, vinblastine, 6-mercaptopurine and etoposide, or&#xD;
             other medications used empirically for the treatment of ECD, will be acceptable. These&#xD;
             therapies should have been completed and discontinued 4 weeks or for biologic agents 4&#xD;
             weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever comes shorter) prior to enrollment in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Exception will be made for patients with ECOG performance status =&lt; 3 and&#xD;
                  Karnofsky performance scale &gt;= 50%, who require the use of wheelchairs, walkers&#xD;
                  or canes as well as assistance with daily routines secondary to disabilities&#xD;
                  caused by ECD cerebellar or brain disease that has been stable for &gt;= 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication and must not have any clinically&#xD;
             significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as&#xD;
             malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have BRAF V600 mutation in the tumor tissue and/or cell-free&#xD;
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), identified by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act&#xD;
             (CLIA)-certified lab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.0 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 8 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 75 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) except subjects&#xD;
             with known Gilbert's syndrome&#xD;

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14&#xD;
             days prior to registration or randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy and breast feeding. The effects of dabrafenib and trametinib on the&#xD;
             developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
             must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control, or&#xD;
             abstinence; hormonal contraception is not allowed due to drug-drug interactions which&#xD;
             can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective) for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and for at least 2 weeks after treatment with dabrafenib or for 4&#xD;
             months after dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Should a woman become pregnant&#xD;
             or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Based on studies in animals, it is also known that&#xD;
             dabrafenib may cause damage to the tissue that makes sperm. This may cause sperm to be&#xD;
             abnormal in shape and size and could lead to infertility, which may be irreversible.&#xD;
             Safety and efficacy of the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib in pediatric&#xD;
             populations have not been investigated. Dabrafenib or trametinib-dabrafenib&#xD;
             combination should not be administered to pediatric populations outside clinical&#xD;
             trials&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of prothrombin&#xD;
             time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) by the site. Exposure may be decreased&#xD;
             due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may need to be&#xD;
             adjusted based upon PT/INR. Consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin&#xD;
             exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin dose&#xD;
             adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate. Prophylactic low dose warfarin may&#xD;
             be given to maintain central catheter patency&#xD;
&#xD;

             wort), or strong inhibitors or inducers of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) or breast cancer&#xD;
             resistance protein 1 (Bcrp1) should also be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unresolved toxicity of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
             Adverse Events, version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0) grade 2 or higher from previous&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;

                  arrhythmias; clarification: subjects with atrial fibrillation controlled for &gt; 30&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Treatment refractory hypertension defined as a blood pressure of systolic &gt; 140&#xD;
                  mmHg and/or diastolic &gt; 90 mm Hg which cannot be controlled by anti-hypertensive&#xD;
                  therapy&#xD;

             study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             dabrafenib/trametinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to treatment with&#xD;
             dabrafenib/trametinib. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in&#xD;
             this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of retinal vein occlusion (RVO)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis not secondary to ECD&#xD;
