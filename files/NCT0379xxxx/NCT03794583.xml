  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study will evaluate the safety of continued therapy with inhaled treprostinil&#xD;
      in participants who have completed Study RIN-PH-304 (NCT03496623). This study hypothesizes&#xD;
      that long-term safety findings will be similar to those observed in the randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, adaptive study 'A Phase 3, Randomized, Placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      Double-blind, Adaptive Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Inhaled Treprostinil in&#xD;
      Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease&#xD;
      (PH-COPD)(RIN-PH-304).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label study for eligible participants who completed all&#xD;
      scheduled study visits during the Treatment Period of Study RIN-PH-304.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who provide informed consent for this open-label extension study on or prior to&#xD;
      the final study visit of RIN-PH-304 may participate in the study, provided all other&#xD;
      eligibility criteria are met. The RIN-PH-304 final study visit and the RIN-PH-305 Enrollment&#xD;
      Visit will occur on the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will reinitiate inhaled treprostinil at 3 breathes (18 micrograms [mcg]) 4&#xD;
      times daily (QID) during waking hours. Study drug doses should be maximized to tolerability&#xD;
      throughout the study, and dose titrations should occur as rapidly as possible (as directed by&#xD;
      the Investigator) with a target dosing regimen of 15 breaths QID or the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be instructed to walk down a corridor at a comfortable speed as far as they can manage for six minutes. Distance &lt;500 meters suggests considerable exercise limitation; Distance 500-800 meters suggests moderate limitation; Distance &gt;800 meters (with no rests) suggests mild or no limitation.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at enrollment, Week 6, and then every 12 weeks through study completion, estimated up to 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>The modified 0-10 category-ratio Borg scale is one in which the participants rate the maximum level of dyspnea they experienced during the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Scores range from 0 (for the best condition) and 10 (for the worst condition).</description>
