    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2a, open-label, randomized study. The study is designed to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the nucleoside inhibitor sofosbuvir combined with NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir&#xD;
      and NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitor CDI-31244 with/without the protease inhibitor asunaprevir&#xD;
      will result in high SVR rate with a shortened treatment duration (2 weeks) in non-cirrhotic&#xD;
      HCV genotype 1b-infected subjects.&#xD;
