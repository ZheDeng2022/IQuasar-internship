  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy is currently the only way to control HIV disease progression in HIV&#xD;
      infected subjects and to prevent transmission. However a sustained virological control&#xD;
      through antiretroviral therapy is requested for these objectives. There is currently 8-10% of&#xD;
      patients who failed therapy for many reasons other than virological resistance including&#xD;
      social unstability, psychiatric disorders, migrant status, drug or alcohol addictions.&#xD;
      Because many of these vulnerabilities can be managed and patients helped for following&#xD;
      adequately cares and treatments, study team designed the OPTICARE Program to help reduce&#xD;
      impact of the patients' vulnerabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OPTICARE study is designed as a prospective implementation interventional study which&#xD;
      aims to improve retention in care among vulnerable HIV infected patients over 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OPTICARE program is a support program dedicated to patients either lost to follow up or&#xD;
      in highly fraility situation that will offer an individualized care management to fill their&#xD;
      gaps towards optimized care and control of viral replication. Our aim is, in patients virally&#xD;
      failing in relation with poor adherence to care and treatment to test first part whether&#xD;
      tracking proactively lost to follow up patients or detecting frail individuals at risk of&#xD;
      lost to care is effective and secondly to evaluate the efficacy, the feasibility and the&#xD;
      acceptability of an intervention tailored to each individual to get them to treatment success&#xD;
      with viral suppression. In our context, a randomized approach would not be seen as ethical or&#xD;
      possible in an environment where investigators need to evaluate such intervention as a pilot&#xD;
      approach. Investigators therefore enrolled patients in a cohort population study OPTICARE&#xD;
      program aim to actively identify vulnerable HIV+ population and promote optimal access to&#xD;
      health care to this population using retention in care program in order to enable long term&#xD;
      HIV infection control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the feasability and the effectiveness of the OPTICARE&#xD;
      program. The OPTICARE program aims to propose an individualized care to vulnerable HIV&#xD;
      infected patients (UNAIDS/Second 90% goal) and to drive them to treatment success&#xD;
      (UNAIDS/Third 90% goal) within a one-year period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OPTICARE program is an individualized program proposed to vulnerable HIV infected&#xD;
      patients according to a baseline evaluation of the clinical, social, psychological and&#xD;
      cultural aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled in the OPTICARE program, each patient will benefit of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A comprehensive and complete check up personal interview, through a daily visit, with a&#xD;
           physician, an educational nurse, a social worker and a cultural mediator (if needed), in&#xD;
           order to identify mains issues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A specific follow up will be set up with obligatory visits at week 4, week 12, week 24,&#xD;
           week 36 and week 48 to assess the evolution of the previously identified issues. If&#xD;
           needed, additional visits will be set up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular (Day 15 and monthly) phone calls will be set up during the first six months of&#xD;
           the OPTICARE program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each patient will be accompanied by a tutoring nurse who will be in direct contact with&#xD;
           the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the specific needs, each patient may benefit of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a personal assistance to complete administrative procedures (update health insurance,&#xD;
           assistance to fill administrative papers, provide a budget for photo ID, transport&#xD;
           tickets)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a personalized medical follow up with regular phone calls, home visits (if the patient&#xD;
           agrees), assistance in taking HIV medication (set up pillbox, therapeutic education)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a close psychological and social support (connection with HIV organizations,&#xD;
           participation to monthly support group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a specific assistance related to dependence issues (connection with addiction&#xD;
           organization, sex therapist consultation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multidisciplinary team (physician, educational nurse, psychotherapist, social worker and&#xD;
      cultural mediator) will proactively assist the patient (home visits, recall) during a one&#xD;
      year follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program is initially proposed to the patient. In case of non-acceptance, the patient can&#xD;
      further join the program after 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not accept the OPTICARE program will be followed up in standard of care&#xD;
      according to French HIV management guidelines.&#xD;
      (https://cns.sante.fr/actualites/prise-en-charge-du-vih-recommandations-du-groupe-dexperts/).&#xD;
      All administratives and social procedures will be given to the social district.&#xD;
