  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib which has shown an affirmatory efficacy in ALTER0303 controlled trial as a 3rd-line&#xD;
      treatment on advanced NSCLC is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a favorable safety profile in&#xD;
      phase I trial which mainly targets VEGFR1/2/3, FGFR, PDGFR and c-kit. The purpose of this&#xD;
      trail is to establish whether advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients could benefit from the&#xD;
      combination treatment of docetaxel, carboplatin and anlotinib as the first-line and&#xD;
      maintenance treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First-line patients (or postoperative recurrence) with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC&#xD;
      were enrolled in this trail. The patients (clinical stage ⅢB/Ⅳ, with no sensitizing mutation&#xD;
      of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene or translocation of the anaplastic lymphoma&#xD;
      kinase gene) were confirmed by histological or cytological diagnosis. The primary endpoint is&#xD;
      PFS; secondary endpoint includes OS, DCR and ORR. The study was single-arm, conducted at 8&#xD;
      centers in China mainland. The primary end point was PFS (time from enrollment to first&#xD;
      RECIST1.1-defined PD or death). 45 patients were planned for enrollment. This estimate was&#xD;
      based on 80% power, with a two-sided 5% significance level. We analyzed PFS and OS using&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier methodology. The research protocol was approved by the relevant ethics&#xD;
      committees, and the study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice guidelines. Patients gave written informed consent to participate in the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
