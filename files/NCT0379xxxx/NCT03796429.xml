      1. Target population: patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (including gallbladder&#xD;
           carcinoma, intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Primary objective: progression free survival (PFS)/ overall survival (OS) of first-line&#xD;
           chemotherapy plus PD-1 antibody (Toripalimab) in patients with advanced biliary tract&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. objective response rate (ORR) of first-line chemotherapy plus PD-1 antibody&#xD;
           (Toripalimab)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. safety of first-line chemotherapy plus PD-1 antibody (Toripalimab)&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.Trial design: This is a monocenter, single arm, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of first-line chemotherapy plus PD-1 antibody (Toripalimab) in patients with advanced&#xD;
      advanced biliary tract cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.Treatment plan: Patients will be given treatment as below once recruited: PD-1 antibody&#xD;
      Toripalimab（240mg, iv, q3w），combined with GS regimen(gemcitabine 1000mg／m2 ，d1,d8 + S1&#xD;
      40-60mg bid*14d，Q21d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be continued until emerging of disease progression or intolerable adverse&#xD;
      effects (The upper time limit for treatment is 2 years).&#xD;
&#xD;

      Backgrounds:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toripalimab (JS-001) is a PD-1 antibody developed by Shanghai Jun Shi Biomedical technology&#xD;
      Co. Ltd. Nowadays, eighteen clinical trials of this drug have been conducted in patients with&#xD;
      different types of advanced malignant tumor. Until now, Toripalimab has exhibited favorable&#xD;
      safety in recruited patients. Incidence rate of SAE is 14.7%. JS001-Ib-CRP-1.0 is a phase&#xD;
      Ib/II basket trial, aiming at evaluating safety and efficacy of JS001 in treating advanced&#xD;
      gastric adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and head&#xD;
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma.The interim analyses results of 161 patients show that the&#xD;
      ORR is 22.4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now, the standard chemotherapies regimen for advanced biliary tract cancer include&#xD;
      gemcitabine, platinum and fluorouracil; Considering the synergistic effect of chemotherapy&#xD;
      and immune therapy, we choose GS regimen (gemcitabine+S1) to combine Toripalimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will shut down the study in advance, if unpredicted SAE or low efficacy occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with abnormal autoimmune status, unfavorable body function, factors impeding drug&#xD;
      taking, absorption and metabolism will be excluded. Study participants with disease&#xD;
      progression or severe/ intolerant toxicity during treatment will withdraw the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyper-progressive disease is defined as 1) progression 2) more than doubled growth rate 3)&#xD;
      tumor volume increase &gt;50% in 2 months after initialing the treatment.&#xD;
