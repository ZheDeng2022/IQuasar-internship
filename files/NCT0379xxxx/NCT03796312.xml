  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The integumentary system protects the underlying body from the external environment, such as&#xD;
      shocks, temperature, ultraviolet radiation, chemicals, and other threats. There is a&#xD;
      considerable body of clinical evidence highlighting the importance of the stratum corneum and&#xD;
      its barrier functions, which are especially beneficial for newborns. Given the dramatic&#xD;
      transition from the aqueous womb to the dry terrestrial environment at birth, studies&#xD;
      describing adaptations made by the skin barrier within the first month of life assume greater&#xD;
      importance. The skin of the baby is morphologically and functionally different from the skin&#xD;
      of adults. Neonatal skin is thinner, more fragile, and drier than adult skin; it is difficult&#xD;
      to maintain fluid-electrolyte balance and temperature regulation. Notwithstanding, structure&#xD;
      and function of skin continues to improve during the first months and even years of life.&#xD;
      Special care procedures are nonetheless necessary to ensure healthy development, to protect&#xD;
      the skin from irritation and reddening, and to help the newborn feel well. Therefore, this&#xD;
      study, taking the form of a randomized controlled trial, aims to examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      tub bathing and sponge bathing on the physiological parameters (heart rate, respiration rate,&#xD;
      oxygen saturation, body temperature) and comfort of late preterm infants. Increasing comfort&#xD;
      and physiological stabilization in premature infants during neonatal care improves their&#xD;
      neurophysiological development. Bathing procedures that support this development and will not&#xD;
      expose the newborn to stress should be preferred.&#xD;

      Increasing comfort and physiological stabilization in premature infants during neonatal care&#xD;
      improves their neurophysiological development. Bathing procedures that support this improves&#xD;
      and will not expose the newborn to stress should be preferred.This study aimed to examine the&#xD;
      eﬀectiveness of tub bathing and sponge bathing methods on the comfort and physiological&#xD;
      parameters of late preterm infants. The study was conducted in the Neonatal Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit of a university hospital in Turkey, between November 2015 and November 2016. Skin care&#xD;
      is routinely performed between 08.00 and 09.00 in the form of sponge bathing. This research&#xD;
      study sampled 120 stable, late preterm infants being cared for in the NICU. This sample was&#xD;
      deemed adequate based on a sample size calculation conducted in PS Power and Sample Size&#xD;
      Calculations (Version 3.0). Information concerning allocation was available only to the&#xD;
      principal investigator. Participants were assigned a sequential number that was placed in an&#xD;
      opaque, sealed envelope by the researcher who received the signed parental informed consent.&#xD;
      When the participant was scheduled to be bathing, the envelope was opened by the researcher&#xD;
      who then performed the test. The nurses could not be blinded to the allocation because of the&#xD;
      nature of the intervention. However, the outcome assessment of the participants was blinded.&#xD;
      Participats were randomly assigned to either sponge bathing or tub bathing groups. Bathing&#xD;
      was performed anywhere from 6 to 48 hours post-birth, based on individual participant needs.&#xD;
      Participants were subsequently placed in a preheated incubator, which varied according to the&#xD;
      participant's weight and age. In order to compensate for such differences, the heads of all&#xD;
      participants were placed at a height of 30 degrees in a right lateral position after bathing&#xD;
      and they were monitored. The participants were not dressed during the observation period.&#xD;
      After bathing, participants were left without intervention or contact for approximately 10&#xD;
      minutes or until settled before being assessed. The data collection instrument, the Preterm&#xD;
      Infant Bathing Study Record, was designed specifically for this study. The instrument&#xD;
      incorporates a number of scales for the measurement of outcome variables, physiological&#xD;
      parameters, and demographic information (age, gender, type of delivery, gestational age,&#xD;
      birth weight, body weight at study time, etc.). Outcome measures include neonatal comfort&#xD;
      behavior and physiological parameters (body temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation,&#xD;
      respiratory rate). Those responsible for data collection were blinded as to the allocation of&#xD;
      participants they were assessing. The ComfortNeo scale was used to measure newborns' comfort&#xD;
      and pain intensity. Comfort was inferred based on infant behavior, which was evaluated on two&#xD;
      separate occasions, 10 minutes before bathing and 10 minutes after bathing. Measurement took&#xD;
      approximately 1-2 minutes. Internal consistency was measured by way of Cronbach's alpha&#xD;
      coefficient, which was 0.94 before bathing, 0.93 after bathing for the second researcher, and&#xD;
      0.92 after bathing for the nurse. Kappa coefficients were approximately 0.84 for each&#xD;
      sub-item. Thus, there was harmony between the two observers. Infant physiological parameters&#xD;
      (heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature) were evaluated on&#xD;
      three separate occasions (10 minutes before bathing, 15 minutes and 30 minutes after&#xD;
      bathing).Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 and SAS (ver.9.3), with&#xD;
      statistical signiﬁcance set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was presented as means and standard deviations for continuous variables, and frequencies&#xD;
      for categorical variables. For participant characteristics, such as the type of delivery and&#xD;
      sex, a Chi-square test was applied to determine whether there were signiﬁcant between-group&#xD;
      differences. participant characteristics, such as birth weight and body weight at the time of&#xD;
      the study, were evaluated for signiﬁcant between-group diﬀerences using a one way ANOVA test.&#xD;
      For a comparison of the diﬀerent phases, measurement parameters (comfort score, heart rate,&#xD;
      oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, body temperature) through the baths were averaged&#xD;
      separately. Repeated measurement analysis of variance was performed to analyze both between&#xD;
      and within-group diﬀerences, followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized controlled two-group pre-test and repeated post-test study design were adopted. Preterm infants were randomly allocated before bathing by the researcher using a random computer-generated table to one of two groups: sponge bathing (routine care) or tub bathing. The bathing procedures were performed by the researcher. Nurses and a second researcher were blinded to the study hypotheses.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Data on comfort behavior was collected by a second researcher and by research nurses who had been trained by the lead researcher. Those responsible for data collection were blinded as to the allocation of infants they were assessing. The ComfortNeo scale was used to measure newborns' comfort. The ComfortNeo is a Likert-type scale consisting of six parameters: alertness, calmness/agitation, crying, body movement, facial tension, and (body) muscle tone. The lowest score that can be obtained using this scale is 6, and the highest score is 30. Scores in the range of 6 to 13 indicate that the newborn is comfortable, while scores 14-30 are indicative of pain or distress in the newborn, thus necessitating comforting. Comfort was inferred based on infant behavior 10 minutes before bathing and 10 minutes after bathing.</description>

    <description>Separate cotton cloths were prepared for each body area in the sponge bath. The room temperature was set to 26-27°C to prevent hypothermia. The temperature of the water used for sponge bathing was set to 37-38°C. Alongside the bath, the infant was placed on a flat, protected surface and washed from a bowl of water, using the same mild cleanser. The eyes, face, and head were wiped and dried while the baby was wrapped in a blanket. The wrap was opened so that body parts could be washed, dried, and then immediately rewrapped, after which infants were diapered.</description>

    <description>The infant's face was washed and dried while still wrapped before being immersed. The water level in the tub was set at approximately 9-12 cm or deep enough to cover the baby's shoulders. A folded cloth towel was placed into the tub before bathing. The temperature of the bath water was controlled using a special water thermometer and adjusted to 37-38°C. The infant was held securely; the head and neck were supported on the researcher's forearm, and the shoulder was grasped using the researcher's thumb and finger. Cleaning was performed using a soft cloth and baby skin cleaner. The front and back areas were cleaned without turning the infant. The newborn was safely removed from the water and wrapped in a clean towel.</description>
