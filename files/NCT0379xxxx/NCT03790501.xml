      We will conduct a four-year, observational study of 850 participants to measure physical&#xD;
      activity and diet, once a year for three years. All participants will also complete the&#xD;
      standard Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS)&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinical assessment procedures. An enhanced PRO&#xD;
      assessment (consisting measures of physical activity, diet intake and anthropomorphic&#xD;
      factors) will be included after the routine patient clinic visit at four CNICS sites: Case&#xD;
      Western Reserve University, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Washington,&#xD;
      and Fenway Health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PROSPER-HIV is a four-year, prospective, observational study of 850 CNICS participants who&#xD;
      will complete an enhanced patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessment to measure physical&#xD;
      activity and diet intake, once a year for three years. All participants will also complete&#xD;
      the standard CNICS PRO and clinical assessment procedures. We propose to integrate the&#xD;
      following measures, physical activity (triaxial accelerometery), dietary intake (24-hour diet&#xD;
      recalls), and anthropomorphic factors (waist-hip-ratio), into an enhanced annual assessment&#xD;
      of patient reported outcomes at four CNICS sites: Case Western Reserve University, University&#xD;
      of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Washington, and Fenway Health. Our four primary&#xD;
      objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify and characterize longitudinal, objectively measured, physical activity and&#xD;
           dietary patterns among PLHIV&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the relationship between objectively-measured physical activity and&#xD;
           self-reported physical activity on the Lipid Research Clinics Physical Activity&#xD;
           Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine which aspects of physical activity patterns and diet quality are associated&#xD;
           with decreased symptom burden and intensity in PLHIV, and if this relationship is&#xD;
           moderated by age and sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Explore the potential mediating effect of anthropomorphic and physical fitness variables&#xD;
           on the relationships between physical activity, dietary patterns, and symptom burden and&#xD;
           intensity in PLHIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that people living with HIV who 1) have more intense, frequent and longer&#xD;
      physical activity bouts will have age- and sex-dependent reduced symptom burden; 2) eat&#xD;
      better quality diets (e.g., more fiber and protein, fewer carbohydrates) will have reduced&#xD;
      symptom burden and intensity and that this relationship will also vary by age and sex.&#xD;

    <description>Symptom distress will be measured with the-20 item HIV Symptom Index. As recommended, our primary endpoints include 1) total symptom count (sum all symptoms that are reported as having the symptom and it bothers the participant at least a little); and 2) a total count of symptoms that bother the participant a lot (high symptom distress).</description>
