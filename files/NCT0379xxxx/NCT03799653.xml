      The Nurse Cohort Study Xiamen (NCSX) is an open-ended prospective cohort study with very&#xD;
      broad research aims. The primary objectives of the NCSX is planned to examine genetic,&#xD;
      epigenetic, biological, psychological, social, lifestyle and other environmental factors of&#xD;
      nurses in relation to incidence and progression of the common chronic diseases, such as&#xD;
      hypertension, ischemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and some&#xD;
      cancers, which are emerging with economic development in Xiamen, China. Specifically, we&#xD;
      intend to test whether empirically driven hypothesis and emerging risk factors mainly&#xD;
      developed in response to observations in economically developed Western societies apply in a&#xD;
      population living in a rapid changing lifestyle in China now.&#xD;

      Objectives: To establish a cohort of about 10,000 registered nurses (aged 20 or over) in&#xD;
      Xiamen, China; to describe the baseline major risk factors; to analyze their&#xD;
      interrelationships; and to examine the risks of incidence and progression of major chronic&#xD;
      diseases, such as hypertension, stroke, CKD and cancers, and all-cause and cause-specific&#xD;
      mortality by different levels of the risk factors after about 5 years follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: 7 public hospitals in Xiamen, China.&#xD;
      Participants: About 10,000 registered nurses (aged 20 or over) who work in public hospitals&#xD;
      in Xiamen, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome: Incidences of common chronic diseases, such as CVD, diabetes, chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease, and cancers; progression of these diseases; all cause and specific-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Relative risks of major risk factors. Results of the study should have strong&#xD;
      impact on prevention and control of these diseases and promoting nurses'health in the local&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
