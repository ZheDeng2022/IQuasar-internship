  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether the personal characteristics of the endoscopist is&#xD;
      associated with effect of interventions for colonoscopy quality improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, 9-month, multicenter, single-blind study. Baseline quality indicators&#xD;
      including adenoma detection rate, polyp detection rate, withdrawal time and adenomas per&#xD;
      colonoscopy of each endoscopist were measured in the health promotion centers of academic&#xD;
      hospitals for 3 months. Follow-up measurements of quality indicators were repeated every 3&#xD;
      months after each interventions (personal notification of quality indicators, open&#xD;
      notification of quality indicators, and colonoscopy quality education by a GI faculty. At the&#xD;
      end of the study, personal characteristics of each endoscopist was evaluated using fear of&#xD;
      negative evaluation scale, cognitive flexibility inventory, and almost perfect scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suboptimal colonoscopy quality is associated with development of interval colorectal cancer&#xD;
      and colorectal cancer-related death. It is uncertain how to improve colonoscopy quality&#xD;
      effectively. The quality of screening colonoscopy for colorectal cancer depends on the&#xD;
      endoscopist who performed the examination. The aim of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      impact of endoscopists' personal characteristics on the quality of colonoscopy and&#xD;
      effectiveness of intervention.&#xD;
