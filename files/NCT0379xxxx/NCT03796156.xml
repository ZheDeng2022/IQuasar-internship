  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to find out whether people with chronic kidney disease [CKD] should take low&#xD;
      dose aspirin to reduce the risk of first heart attack or stroke (cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      [CVD]). CKD is common and is associated with an increased risk of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CVD is caused by small blood clots and aspirin thins the blood to reduce the risk of such&#xD;
      clots developing but it also increases the risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin is recommended to prevent further CVD in people who have already had a first CVD&#xD;
      event (so called secondary prevention). Here the investigators want to study the use of&#xD;
      aspirin as primary prevention in people with CKD who have not had a CVD to prevent the first&#xD;
      event, to assess whether the potential benefits exceed the risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be recruited from their United Kingdom (UK) general practices and&#xD;
      allocated by chance to be prescribed once daily low dose aspirin or usual care only.&#xD;
      Follow-up will be for several years both electronically (for general practice, hospital and&#xD;
      mortality data) and by annual questionnaires to ascertain CVD and bleeding events.&#xD;

      Aim To test the hypothesis that the addition of 75mg aspirin once daily to usual care reduces&#xD;
      the risk of major vascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who do not&#xD;
      have pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Open label, multi-centre randomised controlled trial&#xD;

      Interventions Suitable participants will be randomised to receive: 75mg non-enteric coated&#xD;
      aspirin once daily in addition to their usual medication; or no additional treatment and&#xD;
      avoidance of aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration The trial will continue until 1,827 major vascular events have occurred: this is&#xD;
      anticipated 6 years after the recruitment start date, or 2.5 years following the recruitment&#xD;
      end date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and blinding Eligible participants, based on results of blood and urine tests&#xD;
      at screening, will be randomised (open label randomisation) 1:1 to general practitioner (GP)&#xD;
      prescription of aspirin vs. no prescription, stratified by age, diabetes and CKD severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Data on potential CVD and bleeding outcomes will be collected electronically from&#xD;
      GP records and national hospitalisation and mortality records. Adjudication panels (for CVD&#xD;
      and for bleeding) will asses the information blind to allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete an annual quality of life questionnaire (EQ5D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes. Primary outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to first major vascular event from the date of randomisation. A major vascular event is&#xD;
      defined as a primary composite outcome of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal&#xD;
      stroke and cardiovascular death (excluding confirmed intracranial haemorrhage and other fatal&#xD;
      cardiovascular haemorrhage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures (all time to event except quality of life)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Death from any cause&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Composite outcome of major vascular event or revascularisation (coronary and&#xD;
           non-coronary)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Individual components of the primary composite endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Health-related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Composite outcome of intracranial haemorrhage (fatal and non-fatal), fatal extracranial&#xD;
           haemorrhage and non-fatal major extracranial haemorrhage (adjudicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fatal and non-fatal (reported individually and as a composite) intracranial haemorrhage&#xD;
           comprising: i) primary haemorrhagic stroke (to distinguish from haemorrhagic&#xD;
           transformation of ischaemic stroke); ii) other intracranial haemorrhage (adjudicated).&#xD;
           Intra-cranial haemorrhage will be sub-categorised as traumatic or non-traumatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fatal and non-fatal (reported individually and as a composite) major extracranial&#xD;
           haemorrhage: i) upper gastrointestinal; ii) lower gastrointestinal; iii)&#xD;
           sight-threatening ocular; iv) multiple trauma; v) other (adjudicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding if hospitalised (adjudicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Composite outcome of fatal and non-fatal major extracranial haemorrhage and clinically&#xD;
           relevant non-major bleeding (if hospitalised).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary (exploratory) outcome measures (all time to event except hospitalisation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Transient ischaemic attack&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Unplanned hospitalisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hospitalisation with heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. New diagnosis of cancer (colorectal/other)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Death due to cancer (where cancer is the underlying cause of death)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. CKD progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. New diagnosis of dementia&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Major non-traumatic lower limb amputation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods The primary outcome measure of time to first major vascular event will be&#xD;
      analysed for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Deaths from other causes (including&#xD;
      fatal bleeding) will be treated as competing events. Patients who do not experience a major&#xD;
      vascular event will be censored at the date of last follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All primary, secondary and tertiary time to event outcomes will be described using&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier curves or Cumulative Hazard plots for time to event outcomes involving competing&#xD;
      risks for the ITT population. Analyses of time to event outcomes will be performed using Cox&#xD;
      proportional hazards models or Competing Risk regression models, both unadjusted and adjusted&#xD;
      for stratification factors: age, diabetes and CKD severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adjusted Competing Risk regression model for time to first major vascular event, with&#xD;
      deaths from other causes (including fatal bleeding) treated as competing events, and patients&#xD;
      who do not experience a major vascular event censored, will form the primary endpoint&#xD;
      analysis model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other secondary and tertiary endpoints will be assessed by arm using summary statistics (e.g.&#xD;
      Pearson's χ² tests) in the ITT population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of missing data and reasons for the incompleteness will be explored and presented&#xD;
      overall i.e. not by group. If the amount of missing data is deemed too high and if&#xD;
      appropriate (i.e. assuming the missing data is either missing at random [MAR] or missing&#xD;
      completely at random [MCAR] and censoring assumed to be non-informative), multiple imputation&#xD;
      will be performed accordingly, for which all covariates included in the multivariable model,&#xD;
      together with the censoring/event indicator and the cumulative baseline hazard will be&#xD;
      included in the multiple imputation model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health economic analysis will also be undertaken.&#xD;
