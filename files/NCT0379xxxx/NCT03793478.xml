  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quizartinib is an experimental drug. It is not approved for regular use. It can only be used&#xD;
      in medical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children or young adults with a certain kind of blood cancer (FLT3-ITD AML) might be able to&#xD;
      join this study if it has come back after remission or is not responding to treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medical condition being investigated is relapsed or refractory AML in participants aged&#xD;
      ≥1 month to ≤21 years with Feline McDonough Sarcoma (FMS)-like tyrosine kinase 3&#xD;
      (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations (FLT3-ITD AML), following failure of&#xD;
      front-line intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in multiple phases. An independent data monitoring committee&#xD;
      (DMC) will protect the rights, safety, and well-being of participants by monitoring the&#xD;
      progress and results. The DMC will comprise qualified physicians and scientists who are not&#xD;
      Investigators in the study and not otherwise directly associated with the Sponsor and will be&#xD;
      convened at the end of Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Dose Escalation/De-escalation Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants is determined by age group. Participants will be enrolled by&#xD;
      dose-level to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of quizartinib for pediatric&#xD;
      participants that provides similar exposure to adult patients treated at the target adult&#xD;
      dose of 60 mg orally once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Dose-Expansion Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the RP2D of quizartinib for their respective age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both dose escalation and dose expansion phases, participants will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-Induction Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intrathecal (IT) triple chemotherapy prophylaxis prior to and between cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In re-induction Cycles 1 and 2, fludarabine/cytarabine (FLA) followed by quizartinib as&#xD;
           a single agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After re-induction therapy, participants will be evaluated for eligibility to undergo&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Eligible participants may receive a&#xD;
      single 28-day cycle of consolidation therapy (standard of care chemotherapy with or without&#xD;
      quizartinib) if an allogeneic HSCT is not available immediately. The options for&#xD;
      consolidation therapy are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High intensity chemotherapy with quizartinib, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low intensity chemotherapy alone, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low intensity therapy with quizartinib as a single agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuation Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in remission after HSCT, or who are not eligible for HSCT but achieve at least a&#xD;
      partial remission (PR) after re-induction, will receive up to 12 continuous 28-day cycles of&#xD;
      quizartinib continuation therapy at the same dose received during re-induction in the dose&#xD;
      expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term follow-up phase begins upon completion of 12 cycles of quizartinib Continuation&#xD;
      Therapy or permanent discontinuation of quizartinib at any time. After completion of the&#xD;
      30-day safety follow-up visit, subsequent visits will occur at the following frequencies to&#xD;
      assess survival and anti-leukemic treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  every 3 months for the first 2 years, and then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  once a year thereafter until the last participant enrolled has been followed for three&#xD;
           years from the date of enrollment&#xD;
