  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common condition that affects 70% of people at least once. Sacroiliac&#xD;
      joint Dysfunction (SIJD) is a skipped health problem that is ignored in patients with low&#xD;
      back or hip pain. Fluoroscopy-guided SIJ injection showed that SIJD is a source of pain in&#xD;
      13-30% of patients with chronic low back pain. Inadequate function of SIJ leads to abnormal&#xD;
      gait pattern, pain during walking, increase in load on discs, long-term interdisciplinary&#xD;
      stability and causing to increase of the listhesis. The pain worsens with running, climbing&#xD;
      stairs or standing up from the sitting position. Pharmacological, non-pharmacological and if&#xD;
      required surgical treatment may be applied in the osteoarthritis treatment.&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological treatment includes patient education, exercise, massaging, SIJ,&#xD;
      manipulation-mobilization, chiropractic applications, physical therapy modalities, use of the&#xD;
      assistive device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinesio Taping is a treatment that has not been studied much and can be applied in SIJD. When&#xD;
      investigators reviewed the literature, investigators found a study and a case report&#xD;
      investigating the activity of Kinesio taping in sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Although the&#xD;
      mechanism of Kinesio taping cannot be understood, it is claimed that it has four beneficial&#xD;
      effects: normalizes muscular function, improves blood and lymphatic circulation, reduces&#xD;
      pain, regulates possible disorders of joints. In studies showing the effectiveness of Kinesio&#xD;
      banding in the reduction of pain in health problems related to the waist area with the&#xD;
      highest number of publications, it was noted that the pain was reduced rapidly within three&#xD;
      days, decreased the need for analgesics within two weeks and increased function in daily&#xD;
      living activities.&#xD;

      The study is a randomized, controlled study. 52 participants will be included to study who&#xD;
      apply to Dokuz Eyl√ºl University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Clinic with the complaint of hip and back pain, aged between 18-60 years.&#xD;
      Participants have diagnosed as Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction according to The International&#xD;
      Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) diagnostic criteria. These participants will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups randomly (Treatment group n:26, control group n:26). Because the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect may be seen with unsealed banding in Kinesio taping and the placebo effect&#xD;
      may not be evaluated, After the last evaluation, participants in both groups will be given&#xD;
      the necessary treatment and since there is no study on this subject in the literature, no&#xD;
      treatment was given to the control group due to the fact that the actual effect of banding&#xD;
      was desired. The treated group received Kinesio taping 3 times at 5-day intervals, one of the&#xD;
      fan-shaped cut bands, 2-3 inches above the SIJ, and the other below 2-3 inches below the SIJ,&#xD;
      and crossed each other by 90 degrees. Both groups were evaluated at baseline and on the 15th&#xD;
      day by physical examination of the sacroiliac joint, visual analog scale, Modified Oswestry&#xD;
      Pain Inquiry Form. The kinesiological taping group was also evaluated with VAS and positive&#xD;
      SIJ pain provocation tests, 20 minutes after the first banding, to assess the acute effect.&#xD;

    <description>It is a self-administered questionnaire divided into ten sections designed to assess limitations of various activities of daily living. Each section is scored on a 0-5 scale, 5 representing the greatest disability. The index is calculated by dividing the summed score by the total possible score, which is then multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage.</description>
