  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and obesity tend to coexist and are often associated&#xD;
      with arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and insulin resistance [1]. Polysomnography (PSG)&#xD;
      is the standard technique for diagnosing OSAS and determining its severity [2]. The results&#xD;
      of the examination provide the Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI], or the Respiratory Disturbance&#xD;
      Index [RDI]), which will be used to quantify apnea and classify its severity based on an&#xD;
      international score. In general, an AHI scoring less than 5 is considered &quot;normal&quot; (5-15 mild&#xD;
      sleep apnea; &gt;15 moderate sleep apnea; ≥30 severe sleep apnea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to improve those parameters in obese patients who have been diagnosed with OSAS and&#xD;
      are candidates for BS (BS), national and international guidelines recommend preoperative CPAP&#xD;
      (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) treatment in order to reduce anaesthesia risks [3-6].&#xD;
      Furthermore, several studies report that obese OSAS patients benefit from preoperative weight&#xD;
      loss [1,7] (in terms of AHI index, night snoring and arterial hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese patients who are candidates for BS often go on a preoperative diet in order to decrease&#xD;
      weight and liver volume (especially of the left lobe) and correct any vitamin/mineral&#xD;
      deficiency. The results of a recently published study show that 4 weeks of Ketogenic&#xD;
      Micronutrient Enriched Diet (KMED) significantly reduce body weight, liver lobe volume and&#xD;
      vitamin/mineral deficiencies in obese patients who prepare to undergo BS [8], with resulting&#xD;
      foreseeable reduction of intraoperative complications and surgical time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no prospective multicenter randomized trials demonstrating whether a&#xD;
      preoperative ketogenic diet associated with CPAP use improves OSAS versus treatment with CPAP&#xD;
      alone, with the possibility of reducing the preoperative treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: To assess the clinical advantage in combining two preoperative strategies&#xD;
      (CPAP + KMED) compared to preoperative treatment with CPAP alone, for the reduction of&#xD;
      surgical risks in morbidly obese patients with severe OSAS who are scheduled for BS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recent clinical study published in 2014 on the New England Journal of Medicine found that&#xD;
      often even an initial modest body weight reduction can favourably modify apnea events and&#xD;
      severity during the night, with the latter that can be reduced by about 30% (AHI) for a 10%&#xD;
      weight reduction compared to the initial weight [1]. However, considering the average AHI&#xD;
      data reported by the authors, which do not include post-treatment information, statistical&#xD;
      elements at our disposal are insufficient to assess the &quot;effect size&quot;. Therefore, a sample of&#xD;
      65 patients per group will be needed for the evaluation of the primary endpoint (statistical&#xD;
      significance of 5% [two-tailed], 80% power, &quot;effect size&quot; 0.25, calculated using the G* Power&#xD;
      software, Düsseldorf, Germany). A total of 66 patients will be enrolled (22 patients per&#xD;
      participating site) on the baseline assumption of a dropout of 10%. Most drop-outs may result&#xD;
      from CPAP use and, in particular, discomfort experienced by the patient with tube and facial&#xD;
      mask, difficult acceptance because of psychological reasons (shame or negative expectations&#xD;
      in terms of partner judgment), or subjective feeling of claustrophobic suffocation or&#xD;
      anxiety. The expected drop-out for KMED with the Ketocompleat protocol is 15%. Indeed, in&#xD;
      Schiavo et al [8] study, most patients (86%) showed high acceptability of the Ketocompleat&#xD;
      ketogenic protocol prescribed in the four weeks of preoperative treatment, and the only side&#xD;
      effect reported was mild headache with associated modest halitosis, especially during the&#xD;
      initial treatment days, which, however, did not prevent patients from continuing with the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment design and patient randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous, prospective, comparative and multicentre trial including 66 patients with severe&#xD;
      OSAS (polysomnogram with AHI≥30) suitable for gastric bypass surgery, and randomized into 2&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1: 33 morbidly obese patients with severe OSAS and suitable for gastric bypass surgery,&#xD;
      who underwent 4 weeks of CPAC treatment (these patients will not be required to change their&#xD;
      eating habits) according to the standard; GROUP 2: 33 morbidly obese patients with severe&#xD;
      OSAS and BS candidates who underwent CPAC + KMED treatment for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be conducted via permuted-block design (PBD), with stratification of&#xD;
      patients based on age, gender, and enrollement site Preoperative ketogenic&#xD;
      micronutrient-enriched diet: The ketogenic diet has been used for many years in clinical&#xD;
      settings [9]. Given its safety and effectiveness in determining weight loss, associated with&#xD;
      optimal adherence and patient compliance, the ketogenic diet has recently been used by&#xD;
      several obesity surgery centers in the preoperative management of obese patients who are&#xD;
      candidates for BS [8, 10-11]. The validated Ketocompleat protocol [8] will serve as the KMED&#xD;
      of choice. In particular, the protocol will provide a diet with ketogenic characteristics&#xD;
      that patients will have to follow for breakfast, snack, lunch and snack, and replacement of&#xD;
      the evening meal with the Ketocompleat ketogenic supplement. Figure 1 shows a daily diet&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In short, to ensure that all patients follow the same diet, the investigator will use the&#xD;
      software (https://www.eatthismuch.com) to develop two ketogenic diet plans (plan 1, days&#xD;
      1-14; plan 2, days 15-28), containing specific amounts of foods to be consumed. Each&#xD;
      ketogenic plan will comprise: 1150 to 1250 kcal/day, of which 4% carbohydrates, 71% fat, and&#xD;
      25% proteins. The composition of the supplement to use for the trial (Ketocompleat, MVMedical&#xD;
      Solutions, Serravalle, Republic of San Marino) is shown in Table 1. Ketocompleat is a&#xD;
      supplement included in the Ministry of Health's food supplement register (code 94721); given&#xD;
      its carbohydrate-free formulation, it can easily be associated to a low-carbohydrate&#xD;
      ketogenic diet. The diet plans and the Ketocompleat supplement will be provided free of&#xD;
      charge to all trial participants by MVMedical Solutions, which will have no role in designing&#xD;
      trial and patient enrollement in the different participating sites, or in processing any&#xD;
      trial-related data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient adherence to the prescribed preoperative diet will be confirmed through the following&#xD;
      scientifically validated tests: 3-Day Estimated Food and Records and 72-h Recalls [8], while&#xD;
      the presence of ketone bodies in the urine (Ketur-Test, Roche Diagnostic, Milan, Italy)&#xD;
      associated with weight loss will be used as the patient compliance index. The Ketur test will&#xD;
      be performed in outpatient mode during the weekly diet check.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polysomnography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polysomnography is a sleep study that collects a variety of parameters and conditions, such&#xD;
      as oxygen saturation, heart rate, presence (or absence in the case of apnea) of airflow&#xD;
      through mouth and nose, presence (or absence) of thoracic and abdominal movements, position&#xD;
      held by the subject during sleep, and snoring during sleep. By analysing these data, it will&#xD;
      be possible to define: number of episodes of haemoglobin desaturation during sleep&#xD;
      (desaturation index per hour - ODIindex), presence or absence of apnea during sleep,&#xD;
      differentiating between true apnea true (absence of air flow) and hypopneas (air flow&#xD;
      present, though substantially reduced), determination of &quot;obstructive&quot; &quot;central&quot; or &quot;mixed&quot;&#xD;
      apnea/hypopnea, hourly frequency of apnea/ hypopnea ( apnea/hypopnea events per hour or AHI&#xD;
      index), which allows defining the degree of severity of the disorder (disease stage), AHI in&#xD;
      supine and non-supine position (often this datum documents greater apnea frequency in the&#xD;
      supine position compared to data relating to the patient in lateral decubitus), and snoring&#xD;
      time during sleep. In order to evaluate the clinical advantage offered by the combination of&#xD;
      the two preoperative strategies (CPAP and ketogenic diet therapy) compared to CPAP&#xD;
      preoperative treatment alone, for the reduction of the surgical risk in morbidly obese OSAS&#xD;
      BS candidates, patients of both groups will undergo polysomnography before the trial and&#xD;
      after 4 weeks of CPAP alone or combined CPAP + KMED treatment. The tolerance interval for PSG&#xD;
      execution at the end of the treatment is 7 days; otherwise, patients will be considered&#xD;
      drop-outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP-type ventilator prescription CPAP use is the gold standard for the treatment of sleep&#xD;
      apnea syndrome. The CPAP device consists of a small fan connected to the patient through a&#xD;
      tube and a facial mask (nasal or oronasal). This device provides continuous air flow that&#xD;
      maintains the airways open, preventing the collapse (closing) of the critical points&#xD;
      responsible for respiratory obstruction during sleep, thus avoiding or limiting sleep apnea.&#xD;
      Patients with severe OSAS who are BS candidates will be treated with CPAP only at night&#xD;
      (Group 1), or CPAP at night + KMED daily (Group 2), for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative investigations and after 4 weeks of CPAP or CPAP + KMED treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the BS Centers participating in the trial, both experimental groups will undergo the&#xD;
      following evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete blood count with WBC differential, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL&#xD;
           cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, GOT, GPT, ΥGT, nitrogen, creatinine, urea,&#xD;
           iron, ferritin, ketone bodies, baseline glucose, baseline insulin, and CRP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body weight, height and BMI calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Waist and hip circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood gas analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polysomnography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory/instrumental clinical analyses, polysomnography and CPAP will be performed in the&#xD;
      sites participating in the project; data obtained will be evaluated by a Pneumologist, while&#xD;
      the statistical analysis will be entrusted to a Biostatistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
