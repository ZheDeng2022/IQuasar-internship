  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is planned as a randomised control trial to study the adjuvant use of antibiotics&#xD;
      (ceftriaxone and metronidazole) to achieve a clinical response in hospitalised patients with&#xD;
      acute severe ulcerative colitis&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with active ulcerative colitis who present to the Outpatient department or the&#xD;
      emergency services of PGIMER shall be screened. Those patients who have acute severe&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis shall be assessed for inclusion into the study. Patients who fulfil the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be randomised into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will include patients in the intervention arm. They will be given intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotics for three days. Injection ceftriaxone 1 gm will be prepared by reconstitution of&#xD;
      the crystallized powder form in 100 ml of normal saline. This preparation will then be&#xD;
      infused slowly over thirty minutes, after intradermal testing for hypersensitivity. Inj&#xD;
      ceftriaxone 1gm IV will be given twelve hourly. Injection metronidazole 500 mg is available&#xD;
      from pharmacies in solutions of 100 ml. It will be infused slowly over thirty minutes, three&#xD;
      times per day, after intradermal testing for hypersensitivity. Both the drugs will be given&#xD;
      for five days. In addition, they will receive the standard of care mentioned below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B will include patients from the placebo arm. They will be given the standard of care&#xD;
      as mentioned below. In addition, they will be infused 0.9 % saline of similar quantity,&#xD;
      colour, and from similarly shaped bottles, for three days after sensitivity testing with the&#xD;
      saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed history and examination shall be done for all the patients. History regarding the&#xD;
      stool output, any systemic symptoms, prior treatment history and history regarding any&#xD;
      precipitant for the acute episode shall be taken. Examination will include vitals (pulse&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure, temperature), general physical examination as well as an abdominal&#xD;
      examination. All patients will undergo blood investigations on all three days. This includes&#xD;
      a complete blood counts, kidney function tests, serum electrolytes, albumin, C-reactive&#xD;
      protein, osteopontin, blood culture. Stool routine microscopic examination, fecal&#xD;
      calprotectin, stool assay for clostridium difficile toxin will be done. X ray abdomen will be&#xD;
      done on all three days to monitor the diameter of transverse colon. Patients will undergo an&#xD;
      unprepared sigmoidoscopy with minimal air insufflation and mucosal biopsy. Biopsies will be&#xD;
      taken for histological examination. Procalcitonin, fecal calprotectin and CRP shall be&#xD;
      repeated on day 3 of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be prescribed the standard treatment for acute severe colitis, which&#xD;
      includes intravenous steroids (Inj Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV QID or Inj Methyprednisolone 60&#xD;
      mg iv OD), anticoagulation, (Inj Unfractionated heparin 5000 IU S/C BD), intravenous fluid&#xD;
      supplementation and correction of electrolytes. Patients will be allowed orally and will be&#xD;
      prescribed a diet of 25-30 kcal /kg/day.&#xD;
