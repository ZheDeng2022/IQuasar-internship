  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prototype device (ART) was developed that can harvest hundreds of full-thickness columns of&#xD;
      skin tissue using single-needle, fluid-assisted harvesting technology. The harvested tissue&#xD;
      can subsequently be placed directly onto a wound to aid in healing. This study will examine&#xD;
      the pain of harvesting the tissue, the tolerability of the harvest, and the time to heal of&#xD;
      that donor site.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin wounds sometimes are difficult to heal by primary closure and often require tissue&#xD;
      substitution by autologous grafting requiring harvesting of donor skin [1, 2]. The latter may&#xD;
      cause morbidities such as risk of infection, discoloration, pain, and scarring of both donor&#xD;
      and recipient areas [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full-thickness skin grafts (FTSG) are created when the entire dermis and epidermis are&#xD;
      harvested. These grafts are typically used for acute full-thickness wounds where the wound&#xD;
      can sustain and nourish the graft and improved cosmesis is important [4]. Split-thickness&#xD;
      skin grafting (STSG) has been used to close large skin wounds, [5] and it involves the&#xD;
      harvesting of the epidermis and upper dermis from a donor site. It is generally the preferred&#xD;
      grafting method for restoring the structural integrity of chronic wounds, as the wound bed&#xD;
      may not have the ability to support a FTSG [4]. Nevertheless, because deep dermal structures&#xD;
      such sweat glands and hair follicles are not harvested, the STSG is functionally abnormal.&#xD;
      Before the grafting process takes place, STSGs are commonly meshed and enlarged, increasing&#xD;
      the coverage area and allowing fluid drainage. However, the meshing process produces a&#xD;
      &quot;fish-net&quot; appearance of the grafted skin [1]. Other limitations include healing of the donor&#xD;
      site, which often is delayed and leaves unappealing pigmentary changes and, at times, scar&#xD;
      formation [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, engineered &quot;off the shelf&quot; grafts such as cadaveric skin, xenografts, and&#xD;
      artificial skin substitutes are being used in the management of chronic, difficult to heal&#xD;
      wounds. Skin substitutes work by providing cells, growth factors, and other key elements that&#xD;
      promote healing while preventing extracellular matrix degradation [6]. However, these only&#xD;
      offer transient wound coverage, and require secondary healing of the wound itself. Thus,&#xD;
      autologous skin grafting continues to be necessary. Scar formation at the donor and grafted&#xD;
      site remain most troublesome morbidities in autologous skin grafting. Scar tissue is stiff,&#xD;
      dysfunctional, often painful, and tends to contract over time, producing skin irregularities&#xD;
      [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, skin remodeling is a process that substitutes missing tissue while preserving&#xD;
      tissue architecture. While scarring is triggered by large-scale tissue damage, remodeling is&#xD;
      stimulated by microscopic tissue damage [8]. This principle became clear when fractional&#xD;
      photothermolysis (FP) was developed that is currently used for photoaged skin treatment and&#xD;
      wound scars [8, 9]. In FP, laser microbeams are used to produce microscopic thermal injury&#xD;
      per cm2 of skin surface, which causes very thin columns of tissue damage or ablation. It has&#xD;
      been found that columns less than 500 Âµm in diameter heal promptly without scarring [1, 10].&#xD;
      FP involves full-thickness (i.e. complete epidermis and dermis) tissue injury in which the&#xD;
      epidermis closes within 1 day, and the dermal damage is fixed in around 2 weeks, followed by&#xD;
      tissue remodeling without scarring [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the experience with FP showed that millions of small, full-thickness columns of skin&#xD;
      tissue can be removed without scarring, it was hypothesized that full-thickness microscopic&#xD;
      skin tissue columns (MSTCs) could be harvested from healthy skin with insignificant donor&#xD;
      site-morbidity and that these MSTCs could function as a graft to accelerate wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore this, a prototype device was developed that can harvest hundreds of full-thickness&#xD;
      columns of skin tissue (500 micrometer diameter) using single-needle, fluid-assisted&#xD;
      harvesting technology. The harvested MSTCs can subsequently be placed directly onto a wound&#xD;
      to aid in healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With conventional full thickness grafts and split thickness grafts, the donor area requires&#xD;
      sometimes a period of immobility, requiring attentive wound care and pain management [11].&#xD;
      The ART may provide a more effective method of harvesting skin with minimal or no pain,&#xD;
      healing rapidly with little scarring [1]. This can take place in an outpatient setting, with&#xD;
      the use of only local anesthesia.&#xD;
