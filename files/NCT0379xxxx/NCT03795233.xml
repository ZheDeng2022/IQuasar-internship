  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most urgent health threats in the U.S.&#xD;
      associated with antibiotic use. After an initial episode, disease recurrence is high and&#xD;
      relapses can occur in 20-30% of people treated with oral vancomycin. An antibiotic course can&#xD;
      affect the gut microbiome for years, and patients with CDI have additional dysbiosis of their&#xD;
      gut flora. Oral vancomycin perturbs the gut microbiome further. Restoration of the microbiome&#xD;
      with Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) has been proven a highly efficacious and&#xD;
      cost-effective treatment for recurrent CDI. FMT has had very limited study for a primary&#xD;
      episode of CDI to date because an endoscopic procedure was the recommended route of delivery.&#xD;
      However, FMT is now available via frozen oral capsules and has been shown to be non-inferior&#xD;
      to FMT via colonoscopy in randomized controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that outcomes after a first episode of CDI can be improved if&#xD;
      the microbiome is restored with oral FMT. It is further hypothesized that this will&#xD;
      compensate for any additional microbiome perturbation caused by administration of oral&#xD;
      vancomycin and decrease the likelihood of recurrence. Because the hypothesis is based on&#xD;
      restoration of the microbiome, the investigators propose this proof-of-concept pilot study to&#xD;
      examine whether FMT administered after oral vancomycin therapy for primary CDI restores&#xD;
      microbiome diversity compared to patients who do not receive FMT. Because of the potential&#xD;
      health benefits, this approach deserves further study. The results from this pilot study on&#xD;
      the microbiome diversity as well as the surveys to be conducted about GI symptomatology&#xD;
      (e.g., diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating), CDI recurrence and healthcare utilization, would&#xD;
      provide preliminary data to support a randomized controlled, multicenter clinical trial.&#xD;

      Population: Patients &gt;= 18 years hospitalized at Boston Medical Center (BMC) with a first&#xD;
      documented episode of CDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 30 FMT capsules administered orally under direct observation within 7 days of&#xD;
      completion of 10-14 day treatment of oral vancomycin for CDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize the microbial diversity in stool samples from subjects with a primary&#xD;
           episode of CDI before and after oral vancomycin and determine the impact of FMT after&#xD;
           completion of oral vancomycin course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the feasibility and tolerability of FMT after completion of a course of&#xD;
           oral vancomycin therapy for primary CDI, and to describe 30-day hospital readmission and&#xD;
           gastrointestinal symptomatology and/or CDI recurrence during 60-day follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design/Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 subjects will be enrolled who are hospitalized at BMC for a primary episode of CDI. A&#xD;
      discard aliquot from baseline stool samples obtained clinically for diagnosis will be frozen.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive the standard of care treatment (oral vancomycin for 10-14 days) and&#xD;
      within 7 days following completion will receive oral FMT during a 2 hour visit in the&#xD;
      Infectious Disease (ID) Clinical Trials Unit. An additional 5 subjects will be enrolled as&#xD;
      controls. Stool samples will be collected at time of CDI diagnosis and again 3 weeks after&#xD;
      FMT for intervention group and 4 weeks after completion of oral vancomycin treatment for&#xD;
      control subjects. The post-treatment samples will be obtained by the patient using special&#xD;
      stool sample collection kits known as RNAlater kits (ribonucleic acid stabilization). These&#xD;
      contain a liquid nontoxic tissue storage reagent known as RNAlater and helps preserve the&#xD;
      stool sample. The subjects will mail this stool sample to the BMC Clinical Trials Unit (CTU)&#xD;
      where it will aliquoted, centrifuged and frozen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be processed at a collaborating lab at Tufts to characterize the fecal&#xD;
      microbiome pre- and post oral FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study personnel will contact participants via telephone 60 days after FMT dosing to&#xD;
      administer a follow-up survey (including questions on residual symptoms. CDI recurrence,&#xD;
      re-hospitalization, adverse events and FMT acceptability).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Study Duration: Anticipated time: 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Participation Duration: The researchers anticipate a period of 1-2 hours while an&#xD;
      inpatient for the screening and consent process, 2 hours for the CTU visit for FMT and 20-30&#xD;
      minutes responding to a follow up telephone survey. Total time in the study from enrollment&#xD;
      to completion of follow-up will be approximately 3 months and will include 10-14 days of CDI&#xD;
      treatment with oral vancomycin (per standard of care treatment), the FMT administration and a&#xD;
      60 day follow up.&#xD;
