      Our study evaluated and compared the postoperative sensitivity of the placement technique&#xD;
      (incremental and bulk fill) in class II posterior composite resin restorations bonded with&#xD;
      two different adhesive strategies (self-etch and etch-and-rinse).Sixty patients were randomly&#xD;
      selected, their age range from 25 to 40 years old. They were divided into 2 main groups&#xD;
      according to the packing technique of composite material; incremental Tetric Evoceram and&#xD;
      Tetric Evoceram bulk fill composite.30 patients (n=30) were selected for incremental Tetric&#xD;
      Evoceram composite restorations and they were equally divided according to the adhesive&#xD;
      systems used (etch and rinse or self-etch adhesive strategy) (n=15 teeth).30 patients (n=30)&#xD;
      were selected for Tetric Evoceram bulk fill composite restorations and they were equally&#xD;
      divided according to the adhesive systems used (etch and rinse or self-etch adhesive&#xD;
      strategy) (n=15 teeth).Post-operative pain assessed at 24 hours, 1 week and 1 month using the&#xD;
      visual Analog Scale Score (VAS).Each patient was instructed to place a vertical mark on the&#xD;
      VAS line at home to indicate the intensity of pain at each assessment period.&#xD;

      Our results revealed that when the two composite types using self-etch adhesive system &amp;&#xD;
      total-etch adhesive system were evaluated; there was no statistically significant difference&#xD;
      between the two composite types after 1 day, 1 week as well as 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the two adhesive systems were compared using Bulk Fill composite &amp; incremental Nano&#xD;
      resin composite there was no statistically significant difference between the two adhesive&#xD;
      systems after 1 day, 1 week as well as 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using Bulk Fill composite with self-etch adhesive; there was a statistically significant&#xD;
      decrease in prevalence of hypersensitivity after 1 week. There were no cases with&#xD;
      hypersensitivity after 1 week as well as 1 month. Using Bulk Fill composite with Total etch&#xD;
      adhesive; there was a statistically significant decrease in prevalence of hypersensitivity&#xD;
      after 1 week as well as from 1 week to 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using Incremental Nano resin composite with self-etch adhesive; there was a statistically&#xD;
      significant decrease in prevalence of hypersensitivity after 1 week as well as from 1 week to&#xD;
      1 month. Using Incremental Nano resin composite with Total etch adhesive; there was a&#xD;
      statistically significant decrease in prevalence of hypersensitivity after 1 week as well as&#xD;
      from 1 week to 1 month.&#xD;
