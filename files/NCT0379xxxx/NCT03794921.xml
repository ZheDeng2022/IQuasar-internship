  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with COPD have significant functional disability but cannot access rehabilitative&#xD;
      treatment at hospital-based conventional pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs. This project&#xD;
      will determine whether an Internet-mediated, pedometer-based walking program can increase&#xD;
      physical activity in persons with COPD who cannot access PR, compared to usual care. This&#xD;
      proposal has high potential to deliver an immediate solution to a pressing clinical need. The&#xD;
      proposed research addresses Rehabilitation R&amp;D Service's current priority area of improving&#xD;
      disabled Veterans' health-related quality of life by reducing disease burden and maximizing&#xD;
      functional recovery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs are highly effective and the standard of&#xD;
      care in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). PR faces two significant&#xD;
      problems: (1) most patients with COPD who would benefit from PR cannot access it, and 2)&#xD;
      there is no effective long-term strategy to maintain physical activity (PA) and benefits&#xD;
      after completing PR. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test&#xD;
      the efficacy of a technology-mediated intervention to increase PA in persons with COPD who&#xD;
      cannot access conventional, hospital-based PR. The investigators also propose a&#xD;
      non-randomized study to explore the ability of the PA intervention to maintain PA and&#xD;
      exercise adherence, extending the benefits of PR, in persons with COPD who complete a&#xD;
      conventional PR program. COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States; an&#xD;
      estimated 16 million Americans have COPD. Despite maximal medical therapy, patients with COPD&#xD;
      characteristically experience breathlessness, which leads to a downward spiral of sedentary&#xD;
      behavior, physical inactivity, deconditioning, and functional disability. Low physical&#xD;
      activity is associated with poor outcomes in COPD--increased risk of acute exacerbations,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and death, independent of lung function. The Global Initiative for Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines recommend regular PA for all patients with COPD.&#xD;
      Conventional, supervised PR programs clearly reduce breathlessness, and improve&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQL) and exercise capacity. However, PR programs face&#xD;
      significant challenges of access and adherence. The investigators developed Every Step Counts&#xD;
      (ESC), a technology-mediated intervention based on the Behavioral Theory of Self-Regulation,&#xD;
      to target sedentary behavior, promote PA, and alleviate deconditioning. ESC couples a website&#xD;
      with a pedometer to directly monitor step counts. The website provides individualized&#xD;
      step-count goals, iterative feedback, education on disease self-management, motivation, and&#xD;
      an online community of social support. In two randomized studies in Veterans with COPD, the&#xD;
      investigators demonstrated ESC's safety, feasibility, and efficacy to increase PA. Accessible&#xD;
      via the internet and available at any time from home, ESC could be an ideal low-cost platform&#xD;
      to address the limitations of conventional PR. The investigators hypothesize that ESC may be&#xD;
      an efficacious strategy to promote PA in the many patients who cannot attend a PR program,&#xD;
      and may be an option to maintain engagement in PA after patients complete a conventional PR&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of a web-based intervention, ESC, to increase PA&#xD;
      (measured directly with an accelerometer and a questionnaire that assesses intensity),&#xD;
      compared to usual care, in persons with COPD who are referred to or eligible for conventional&#xD;
      PR but who cannot access it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 2: Estimate the effect of the ESC intervention on (a) exercise adherence, (b)&#xD;
      exercise self-efficacy, (c) HRQL, (d) dyspnea, (e) anxiety and depression, and (f) risk of&#xD;
      acute exacerbations and COPD-related hospitalizations, compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 3: Assess the ability of ESC to maintain PA and exercise adherence, and&#xD;
      extend the benefits of PR, in participants with COPD who have completed conventional PR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study visits are performed virtually starting August 2020.&#xD;

    <description>Patients referred to conventional PR or eligible for PR but declined. Using a standardized script at the randomization phone call, study staff will deliver verbal instructions to slowly and steadily increase one's walking and exercise each week. Participants will be asked to perform exercise of moderate intensity for at least 30 minutes on most days of the week, defined as a dyspnea level of 4-5 on the Borg scale and taking 1-2 minutes to recover. Use of the Borg rating scale for dyspnea will be reviewed with each participant. Exercise is defined as planned PA, outside of activities performed as part of one's daily routine. Exercise can be walking in the community or using exercise equipment at a local gym. Adapted written materials reinforce the verbal instructions. Participants will receive this 45-page spiral-bound book with information about aerobic and strength training exercises.</description>

    <description>Patients referred to conventional PR or eligible for PR but declined. After randomization to ESC, participants will be mailed detailed instructions about the website. They will be asked to wear the lightweight, unobtrusive pedometer every day, except while asleep or showering/bathing, during the 12-week intervention period. Subjects will be instructed to upload their date and time-stamped step-count data to the study website as often as they wish, but at least weekly. Each week, the study computer will run the goal calculation algorithm and provide each participant with his/her daily step-count goal for the week. The week's step-count goal will be prominently displayed on each subject's personal study web page. Participants will be instructed to exercise and reach their individualized step-count goals with walking of moderate intensity for at least 30 minutes on most days of the week, defined as a dyspnea level of 4-5 on the Borg scale and taking 1-2 minutes to recover.</description>
