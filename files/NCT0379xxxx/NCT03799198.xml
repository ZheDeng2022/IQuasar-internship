  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are doing this study to compare the effects of drugs approved for long-term&#xD;
      weight loss combined with an employer-based weight management program with the effects of the&#xD;
      weight management program without drugs for weight loss. If participants agree to be in this&#xD;
      study, they will join the Cleveland Clinic Integrated Medical Weight Management Program&#xD;
      (WMP). Participants will be assigned by chance (like flipping a coin) to one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups: A) Group 1: Cleveland Clinic Integrated Medical WMP + medication for long-term weight&#xD;
      loss. B) Group 2: Cleveland Clinic Integrated Medical WMP without medication for weight loss.&#xD;
      Participants have an equal chance of being in either of the treatment groups. The total study&#xD;
      duration for the individual participants will be approximately one year.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in 'At-Work Productivity Loss Index' as Measured by Work Limitations Questionnaire Self-administered Short-Form (WLQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0, month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The WLQ-8 questionnaire assesses the degree to which participants have difficulty related to time management, physical tasks, mental/interpersonal tasks, and output tasks due to their physical and/or emotional health. The WLQ-8 produces subscale scores as well as an index of overall at-work productivity loss. WLQ-8 outcomes are expressed as proportion time with difficulty, with higher scores indicating greater limitations, i.e., worse outcomes. The score ranges from 1 to 5 where '1' represents none of the time and, '5' represents all of the time. Change in 'At-Work Productivity Loss Index' from month 0 to month 12 is presented.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 0, month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI:SHP questionnaire assesses both work productivity through absenteeism (i.e., work time missed), presenteeism (i.e., impairment at work or reduced on-the-job effectiveness), and work productivity loss, as well as daily activity impairment (e.g., work around the house, shopping, exercising, childcare, studying) attributable to excess weight. Results of WPAI are expressed as a percentage of impairment from 0 to 100, with higher percentages indicating greater impairment and less productivity.

        <title>Change in 'At-Work Productivity Loss Index' as Measured by Work Limitations Questionnaire Self-administered Short-Form (WLQ-8)</title>
        <description>The WLQ-8 questionnaire assesses the degree to which participants have difficulty related to time management, physical tasks, mental/interpersonal tasks, and output tasks due to their physical and/or emotional health. The WLQ-8 produces subscale scores as well as an index of overall at-work productivity loss. WLQ-8 outcomes are expressed as proportion time with difficulty, with higher scores indicating greater limitations, i.e., worse outcomes. The score ranges from 1 to 5 where '1' represents none of the time and, '5' represents all of the time. Change in 'At-Work Productivity Loss Index' from month 0 to month 12 is presented.</description>

        <title>Change in 'Output Tasks' as Measured by WLQ-8</title>
        <description>The WLQ-8 questionnaire assesses the degree to which participants have difficulty related to time management, physical tasks, mental/interpersonal tasks, and output tasks due to their physical and/or emotional health. WLQ-8 outcomes are expressed as proportion time with difficulty, with higher scores indicating greater limitations, i.e., worse outcomes. The score ranges from 1 to 5 where '1' represents none of the time and, '5' represents all of the time. Change in 'output tasks' from month 0 to month 12 is presented.</description>

        <description>The WPAI:SHP questionnaire assesses both work productivity through absenteeism (i.e., work time missed), presenteeism (i.e., impairment at work or reduced on-the-job effectiveness), and work productivity loss, as well as daily activity impairment (e.g., work around the house, shopping, exercising, childcare, studying) attributable to excess weight. Results of WPAI are expressed as a percentage of impairment from 0 to 100, with higher percentages indicating greater impairment and less productivity. Negative numbers indicate improvement from baseline.</description>
