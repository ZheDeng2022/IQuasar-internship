      The investigation product Nimodipine Injection (II) was supplied by Shenyang Dongxing&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd.And Nimodipine injection (trade name: Nimotop)&#xD;
      manufactured by Bayer Pharma AG was used as the reference preparation.The volunteers were&#xD;
      administered with Nimodipine injection for intravenous infusion (containing nimodipine 11 mg)&#xD;
      for 12 consecutive hours, respectively.The Venous blood was collected at 0 hours before the&#xD;
      administration (ie, 1 hour before the administration) and 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes,&#xD;
      45 minutes, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, 12 h (Administration was over) and 12.5 h, 13&#xD;
