  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      POISE is a two arm interventional trial nested within a cohort (Trials Within Cohorts or&#xD;
      TWiCs design). This tests less aggressive early therapy in patients newly diagnosed with low&#xD;
      impact oligoarticular PsA. Arm 1 will receive standard step up therapy in the cohort and act&#xD;
      as the control group. Arm 2 will receive local steroid injections to active joints and will&#xD;
      be able to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) only&#xD;

      Arm 1: Control 'step-up' therapy in the cohort (MONITOR-PsA study). Therapy for the cohort is&#xD;
      defined by standard practice in these PsA clinics following current international&#xD;
      recommendations and National requirements for the prescription of biologic therapy. Whilst&#xD;
      physician discretion is used, most commonly Initial therapy will be with methotrexate alone&#xD;
      (15mg/week rising to 25mg/week as tolerated by week 8 of therapy) unless this is&#xD;
      contraindicated. In cases of non-response or intolerance to methotrexate, participants will&#xD;
      have an alternative DMARD (most commonly sulfasalazine or leflunomide) added or switched to&#xD;
      at the discretion of the rheumatologist. In cases of failure of two DMARDs, treatment can be&#xD;
      escalated to biologic therapy as per National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&#xD;
      (NICE) recommendations usually with a TNF inhibitor as first line. If the requisite disease&#xD;
      activity is not met or if there are contraindications to biologics, alternative DMARD&#xD;
      combinations will be used. Further details are available in the PsA clinic treatment protocol&#xD;
      which is Appendix D in the MONITOR-PsA protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Symptomatic therapy arm. The intervention will delay standard treatment with&#xD;
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and use local glucocorticoid injections to&#xD;
      affected joints instead. Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will also be&#xD;
      allowed as concomitant medication as indicated for individuals. Local glucocorticoid&#xD;
      injections will include injections with methylprednisolone or triamcinolone. All active&#xD;
      joints will be treated with glucocorticoid injections. Glucocorticoid injections can be&#xD;
      either be given as an intra-articular injection to an inflamed joint or as an intra-muscular&#xD;
      injection if multiple joints are involved. If any joint requires more than 2 local injections&#xD;
      of glucocorticoid within a 6 month period, then the patient is deemed to have failed&#xD;
      symptomatic therapy and will be withdrawn from the treatment protocol and be treated as per&#xD;
      usual care (in most cases with DMARD therapy). If Participants require DMARD therapy, they&#xD;
      will be offered rescue therapy as per usual clinical care but will be asked to continue with&#xD;
      data collection for the trial. This is to ensure that sufficient data is collected for the&#xD;
      trial but risks in delaying treatment to the individual are mitigated.&#xD;

    <description>To establish acceptability of this treatment approach assessing proportion of patients who are eligible, consent and complete the 48 week study. We will examine how many patients in the MONITOR cohort are eligible per year. All eligible patients in the MONITOR cohort will be approached and invited to join the study. We will then review how many patients complete the 48 week study period attending all visits from baseline to 48 weeks (0, 12, 24, 36 and 48).</description>

    <description>A composite measure of PsA disease activity. This score is a composite measure of disease activity in PsA. There is only one total score which ranges from 0-10 with higher numbers indicating more active disease. Low disease activity is defined as &lt;3.2.</description>

Grey scale synovitis is scored at each site 0-3 and power doppler is also scored 0-3 at each site where higher scores indicate more severe disease. These scores are then summed to give a final score. Score range is 0-276</description>

Power doppler is scored 0-3 at each site where higher scores indicate more severe disease activity. Calcifications, enthesophytes and grey scale abnormalities will each be score 0 (absent) or 1 (present) at each site. These scores are then summed to give a final score.

We will examine how many patients in the MONITOR cohort are eligible per year. All eligible patients in the MONITOR cohort will be approached and invited to join the study.

Commonly Initial therapy will be with methotrexate alone unless this is contraindicated. In cases of non-response or intolerance to methotrexate, participants will have an alternative DMARD (sulfasalazine or leflunomide). In cases of failure of two DMARDs, treatment can be escalated to biologic therapy as per National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommendations. If the requisite disease activity is not met or if there are contraindications to biologics, alternative DMARD combinations will be used.&#xD;

Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will also be allowed as concomitant medication. All active joints will be treated with injections. Injections can be either be given as an intra-articular injection or as an intra-muscular injection. If any joint requires more than 2 local injections of glucocorticoid within a 6 month period, then the patient is deemed to have failed symptomatic therapy and will be withdrawn from the treatment protocol and be treated as per usual care (in most cases with DMARD therapy).&#xD;

          <title>Ultrasound Score of Enthesitis</title>
          <description>A summary score of enthesitis measured at baseline. The score will comprise of 5 entheses bilaterally. Power doppler is scored 0-3 at each site where higher scores indicate more severe disease activity. Calcifications, enthesophytes and grey scale abnormalities will each be score 0 (absent) or 1 (present) at each site. These scores are then summed to give a final score. Score range is 0-30</description>
          <population>Only one patient was recruited and he was lost to follow up before 48 weeks thus these data are not available for analysis. The US was not performed as this was only for participants in the intervention group.</population>

          <title>Standard Care</title>
          <description>Control 'step-up' therapy in the cohort (MONITOR-PsA study). Therapy for the cohort is defined by standard NHS practice. Commonly Initial therapy will be with methotrexate alone unless this is contraindicated. In cases of non-response or intolerance to methotrexate, participants will have an alternative DMARD (sulfasalazine or leflunomide). In cases of failure of two DMARDs, treatment can be escalated to biologic therapy as per National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommendations. If the requisite disease activity is not met or if there are contraindications to biologics, alternative DMARD combinations will be used.&#xD;
Methotrexate: Methotrexate up to 25mg/week as tolerated po or sc&#xD;
Sulfasalazine: Sulfasalazine up to 3g daily po&#xD;
Leflunomide: Leflunomide 10-20mg daily po</description>

          <title>Local/IM Steroid Injections</title>
          <description>Symptomatic therapy arm. The intervention will delay standard treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and use local injections of methylprednisolone or triamcinolone to affected joints instead. Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will also be allowed as concomitant medication. All active joints will be treated with injections. Injections can be either be given as an intra-articular injection or as an intra-muscular injection. If any joint requires more than 2 local injections of glucocorticoid within a 6 month period, then the patient is deemed to have failed symptomatic therapy and will be withdrawn from the treatment protocol and be treated as per usual care (in most cases with DMARD therapy).&#xD;
