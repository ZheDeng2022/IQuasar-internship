  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, phase IB, multi-center study evaluating DM199 in subjects with Type 1 Diabetes&#xD;
      or Type 2 Diabetes and Stage 3 or 4 Chronic Kidney Disease. The primary objectives of this&#xD;
      study are to evaluate safety, tolerability, and PK profile of DM199 in these subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of DM199 in subjects with T1D or&#xD;
      T2D and with Stage 3 or Stage 4 CKD. Additionally, this study evaluates urine concentrations&#xD;
      of KLK1 pre and post dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Subjects with T1D or T2D and Stage 3 CKD will be administered one of three DM199&#xD;
      doses: 3.0 ug/kg or 5.0 ug/kg or 8.0 ug/kg single SC dose. Cohort 2: Subjects with T1D or T2D&#xD;
      and Stage 4 CKD will be administered a single 3.0 µg/kg single SC dose. Secondary and&#xD;
      exploratory study objectives include collection and analysis of vital signs, biomarkers,&#xD;
      eGFR, blood glucose, and ECG's.&#xD;
