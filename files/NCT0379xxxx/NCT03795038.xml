      The clinical Investigation will be performed to compare the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      CE certified and established lipoprotein apheresis systems MONET vs. DALI and DIAMED vs. DALI&#xD;
      for optimizing the individual therapy of patients with severe dyslipidemia using established&#xD;

      Comparison of the safety and effectiveness of the CE certified and established lipoprotein&#xD;
      apheresis systems MONET vs. DALI and DIAMED vs. DALI for optimizing the individual therapy of&#xD;
      patients with severe dyslipidemia using established and novel efficacy parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the whole blood lipoprotein apheresis system DALI with&#xD;
      the plasma lipoprotein apheresis systems MONET and DIAMED with regard to their efficacies in&#xD;
      removing total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides and&#xD;
      lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to compare the whole blood lipoprotein apheresis system DALI with&#xD;
      the plasma lipoprotein apheresis system MONET and DIAMED with regard to their efficacies in&#xD;
      removing other novel efficacy parameters.&#xD;
