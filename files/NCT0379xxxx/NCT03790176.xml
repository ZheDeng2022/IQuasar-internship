      CAZ/AVI is a new antibiotic drug that is meant to be used for various indications including&#xD;
      cIAI and nosocomial pneumonia. To date, limited data exists on PK of CAZ/AVI in patients&#xD;
      undergoing peritoneal dialysis as well as on penetration of CAZ/AVI in ELF of critically ill&#xD;
      patients. The present study is carried out to determine target site PK of CAZ/AVI in these&#xD;
      two populations, in order to contribute to a more complete understanding of the drug's&#xD;
      penetration to its site of action.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ceftazidime/Avibactam (CAZ/AVI) is a novel antibiotic drug that has recently become&#xD;
      available. It consists of a β-lactam/β-lactamase fixed drug combination with an almost&#xD;
      exclusively Gram-negative spectrum and is indicated for the treatment of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including pyelonephritis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hospital-acquired pneumonia including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in patients with limited treatment&#xD;
           options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is common knowledge that in anti-infective therapy, sufficient drug delivery to the target&#xD;
      site is essential for antimicrobial efficacy and prevention of bacterial resistance. Based on&#xD;
      this premise, the present exploratory trial will focus on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      CAZ/AVI in two patient populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART A will investigate PK of CAZ/AVI in plasma and peritoneal dialysis fluid of patients&#xD;
      undergoing automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). After a single intravenous dose of the drug&#xD;
      PK sampling of CAZ/AVI will be performed in plasma and in peritoneal dialysis fluid,&#xD;
      respectively. On the one hand, this will help to assess intraperitoneal exposure to CAZ/AVI&#xD;
      after intravenous administration. This information might be of crucial importance for&#xD;
      patients with infections localized in the peritoneal space. On the other hand, this study&#xD;
      will show whether and to which extent CAZ/AVI is cleared from the bloodstream after&#xD;
      intravenous administration in patients undergoing APD and receiving CAZ/AVI as treatment of&#xD;
      other systemic infections, e.g. nosocomial pneumonia. Both aspects will improve current&#xD;
      information on CAZ/AVI PK in peritoneal dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART B will determine steady-state plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentrations of&#xD;
      CAZ/AVI in critically ill patients receiving the drug for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia&#xD;
      (including VAP) at the discretion of their treating physicians. Penetration of CAZ/AVI into&#xD;
      ELF has already been assessed in healthy volunteers and amounted roughly to 30% of plasma&#xD;
      exposure. However, several physiological factors determining the amount of drug eventually&#xD;
      recovered in ELF might be altered in critical illness (hemodynamics, binding to plasma and/or&#xD;
      tissue proteins, local inflammation processes etc). Thus, PK of CAZ/AVI in lungs of&#xD;
      critically ill patients might significantly differ from healthy volunteers, and deriving ELF&#xD;
      exposure solely from plasma pharmacokinetics might not be entirely reliable in this&#xD;
      circumstance. Still, considering the premise mentioned above, this issue is of crucial&#xD;
      importance. The present study will help to assess whether CAZ/AVI reaches its target site&#xD;
      (for the indication of nosocomial pneumonia) in critically ill patients to a sufficient&#xD;
      degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, the information retrieved by this study will contribute to a better&#xD;
      understanding of CAZ/AVI's disposition in target compartments of two patient populations and&#xD;
      corroborate (or challenge) current dosing recommendations.&#xD;
