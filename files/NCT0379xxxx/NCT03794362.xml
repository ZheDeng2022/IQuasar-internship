  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is generally recognized that pain assessment and management especially in newborns,&#xD;
      children and other nonverbal populations is an unmet need. According to the American Medical&#xD;
      Association, &quot;the pediatric population is at risk of inadequate pain management, with&#xD;
      age-related factors affecting pain management in children. Children are often given minimal&#xD;
      or no analgesia for procedures that would routinely be treated aggressively in adults.&#xD;
      Although much is now known about pain management in children, it has not been widely or&#xD;
      effectively translated into routine clinical practice&quot;. These two factors combine to&#xD;
      emphasize the necessity for an objective tool to quantify pain and monitor the effectiveness&#xD;
      of analgesia, especially during treatments. Further, it is reported that many patients&#xD;
      require a combination of treatments, and it is often necessary to test a variety of&#xD;
      treatments before the personal match for treatment is found. The method in place to change&#xD;
      the care on a subjective basis is difficult, time consuming, and not easily individualized.&#xD;
      This pilot study is part of an ongoing effort to develop a method to objectively assess&#xD;
      response to specific analgesic interventions. It specifically aims to discern the impact of&#xD;
      analgesic interventions on sensory nerve fiber sensitivity in a diverse patient population.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. The subject is 7 to 21 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject is receiving an analgesic intervention in the Children's National Medical&#xD;
             Center Pain Clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject is willing and able to provide written informed assent/parental consent to&#xD;
             the study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Eye pathology precluding pupillometry&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are actively using opioids (history of use acceptable). Rationale:&#xD;
             opioids constrict the pupil, and therefore concomitant opioid use would bias our&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who are or may be pregnant&#xD;
