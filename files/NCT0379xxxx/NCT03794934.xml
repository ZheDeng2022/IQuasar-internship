  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pump, a new medical device, have been proved&#xD;
      and highly recommended in the treatment of type 1 diabetes patients worldwide, and related&#xD;
      technology development and market are growing rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to maximize the medical and socioeconomic effects of the latest blood glucose&#xD;
      devices including CGM and insulin pump, structured education is necessary. In this study, we&#xD;
      will develop patient-oriented structured education for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      when applying CGM, and we will assess the efficacy of this education protocol for patients&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes using CGM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 50 patients with type 1 diabetes with over 7% of glycated hemoglobin, whose blood glucose&#xD;
      level is not well controlled, and who are undergoing multiple daily insulin injection therapy&#xD;
      or insulin pump therapy, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is applied to obtain basal&#xD;
      continuous glucose levels for 1 week (window period of 2 week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These 50 patients are 1:1 randomly assigned to 2 groups including control group and&#xD;
      intervention group. Control group (n=25) applied CGM without structured education and after 3&#xD;
      months of applying CGM, continuous glucose data for 2 consecutive weeks and HbA1c level, and&#xD;
      other glycometabolic parameters are collected. As a sequential extension clinical trial,&#xD;
      those 25 patients in control group are provided structured education, followed by applying&#xD;
      CGM for 3 months. Continuous glucose levels for 2 consecutive weeks and HbA1c level, and&#xD;
      other glycometabolic parameters are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Intervention group (n=25), structured education program is provided for each patient from&#xD;
      the time of enrollment, followed by applying CGM for 3 months. Continuous glucose levels for&#xD;
      2 consecutive weeks and HbA1c level and other blood tests are performed after the 3 months.&#xD;
