  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to decrease the rate of visits to the Emergency Department (ED)&#xD;
      and Acute Care Clinics (ACC) for dehydration for head &amp; neck (H&amp;N) and esophageal cancer&#xD;
      patients that are given Gatorade while receiving radiation therapy with or without&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among patients with cancer of the H&amp;N or esophagus, complications related to dehydration are&#xD;
      fairly common, and can result in requiring IV fluid support in an ACC setting, ED or even&#xD;
      inpatient admission. By instructing participants to drink a reasonable amount of a common&#xD;
      electrolyte-rich energy drink from the initiation of treatment through its completion, the&#xD;
      hypothesis will be tested that this inexpensive and easily administered preventative strategy&#xD;
      can significantly decrease the rate of ACC and ED visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to decrease the frequency of ACC visits during the course of&#xD;
      radiation therapy and decrease the frequency of ED visits during the course of radiation&#xD;
      therapy. The study team also seeks to decrease the incidence of orthostatic vital signs&#xD;
      during the course of radiation therapy and decrease the number of days of missed treatments&#xD;
      due to radiation toxicity during the course of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pilot cohort, participants will be given Gatorade G2 to drink daily during the course&#xD;
      of radiation, along with standard of care nutritional support from dietitians. The randomized&#xD;
      Phase 2 cohort has two study groups. Group 1 will receive standard of care nutritional&#xD;
      support. Group 2 will receive standard of care nutritional support plus the study agent,&#xD;
      Gatorade G2.&#xD;
