  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to a healthy dietary pattern is part of the self-care of patients with&#xD;
      hypertension, and may contribute substantially to therapeutic target goals as well as to a&#xD;
      better quality of life. However, not all nutritional recommendations aimed at these patients&#xD;
      are easily applicable in clinical practice. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a nutritional strategy for blood pressure control in patients with&#xD;
      hypertension users of a Public Health System after 6 months of follow-up. As secondary&#xD;
      objectives, we will evaluate the impact of the proposed strategy on self-care and on the&#xD;
      quality of life of the patients. In this multicenter open-label randomized trial, 408&#xD;
      patients ≥21 years old with hypertension, systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140mmHg at the&#xD;
      moment of the screening and who have not received or received nutritional counseling for at&#xD;
      least 06 months will be enrolled. Patients allocated to the control group will receive&#xD;
      individualized dietary prescription according to the guidelines of the Brazilian Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology. Nutritional counseling in the intervention group will be performed based on the&#xD;
      quality of the diet, the Food Guide for the Brazilian Population and concepts of mindfulness&#xD;
      and mindful eating; all dietary guidance will be based on feasible goals built together&#xD;
      (patient and nutritionist), and no diet will be prescribed for intervention group. In both&#xD;
      groups, patients will receive automatic monitors for residential self-monitoring blood&#xD;
      pressure. On-site follow-up visits will be carried out at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days (final&#xD;
      consultation). At 120 and 150 days, participants in the intervention group will receive&#xD;
      motivational messages via e-mail or SMS (for these patients, consultation of 30 days will be&#xD;
      a group meeting). Laboratory tests (lipid and glycemic profile, serum creatinine, serum&#xD;
      sodium, urinary sodium, serum potassium, urinary potassium and albuminuria) will be performed&#xD;
      at baseline and 180 days; anthropometric indexes and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) will be&#xD;
      also evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life evaluated by the Brazilian version of the Mini-cuestionario de calidad de vida en la hipertensión arterial. In this tool, ten items are related to the &quot;mental status&quot; domain and six items to &quot;somatic manifestations&quot;. Questions refer to the past seven days. The score scale is a likert-type scale with four possible answers (0=absolutely no; 1=yes, a little; 2=yes, fairly; 3=yes, a lot). The points range from 0 (best health level) to 30 (worst health level) for the &quot;mental status&quot; dimension, and from 0 (best health level) to 18 (worst health level) for the &quot;somatic manifestations&quot; dimension.</description>

    <description>Self-care evaluated by the Brazilian version of the Self-care of Hypertension Inventory Questionaire. This tool includes 23 items divided across 3 scales: Self-care Maintenance (11 items), Self-care Management (6 items), and Self-care Confidence (6 items). Items in the instrument are scored on a Likert-type scale. In the Self-care Maintenance domain, scores range from 1 to 5 (''never'' to ''always''). In the Self-care Management domain, 2 items range from 0 to 5 to capture a fully negative response, and other item options are scored 1 to 5. The remaining items are scored from 1 to 5 (''not likely'' to ''very likely''). In the self-care confidence scale, items are scored from 1 to 5. Scores are calculated for each scale individually. Each scale is standardized to range from 0 to 100. Self-care is considered adequate if the score is 70 or greater.</description>
