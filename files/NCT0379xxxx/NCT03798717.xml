  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterised by chronic high blood sugar concentration&#xD;
      (hyperglycaemia) and insulin resistance leading to a reduction in insulin sensitivity. These&#xD;
      hyperglycaemic excursions can seriously impact metabolic, micro and macrovascular health. The&#xD;
      total cost of the direct and indirect care of individuals with diabetes (~90% T2DM) in the UK&#xD;
      (United Kingdom) is £23.7 billion, equating to ~20% of the annual national health service&#xD;
      (NHS) budget, with this projected to become unsustainable. Low-cost interventions to improve&#xD;
      glycaemic control in these individuals are therefore warranted. Current interventions include&#xD;
      pharmaceuticals, exercise and calorie restrictive diets. Pharmaceutical interventions carry a&#xD;
      high financial cost, while exercise and diet programmes have a low adherence rate in&#xD;
      individuals with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heat therapy offers one potential low cost therapy. Immersion in a hot tub for 30 mins.day-1&#xD;
      for 10 days has been shown to reduce fasting plasma [glucose] and HbA1c in individuals with&#xD;
      T2DM, which may be explained by acute (e.g. muscle) and chronic (e.g. reduced inflammatory&#xD;
      status and increased heat shock proteins (HSP)) adaptations, although experimental evidence&#xD;
      for these hypothesis are sparse. Other potential benefits include improved glycaemic control,&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, elevated resting metabolic rate and improved micro- and macrovascular&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to determine whether acute hot water immersion can improve&#xD;
      glucose tolerance in individuals with T2DM and whether it is more beneficial to undertake&#xD;
      this before or after a OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Visit 1 (consent, screening and familiarisation) During visit 1, participants will give their&#xD;
      informed consent, followed by a health screening questionnaire. In addition to the health&#xD;
      screening questionnaire, medical history and a blood sample will be collected and analysed&#xD;
      for a full blood count, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), liver and kidney function. Finally, a&#xD;
      resting electrocardiogram (ECG) will also be recorded and then examined for irregularities,&#xD;
      where a clinical decision will be made on further participation to the study by consultants&#xD;
      at QA (Queen Alexandra) hospital. Participants will then be shown the rest of the equipment&#xD;
      and taken through the procedure for the next 3 visits and, if the participant is happy to&#xD;
      continue the study, the next visit will be organised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2, 3 and 4 Participants will arrive at the laboratory at ~9 am for conditions 1 and 2&#xD;
      and 8 am for condition 3. Prior to a 15 min resting period (supine) before any measures are&#xD;
      taken participants will be asked to insert a rectal thermistor (participants will be given&#xD;
      clear instructions using the investigator's SoPs (standard operating procedure)). Condition&#xD;
      1, 2 and 3 will be balanced and participants randomly allocated to begin the study in either&#xD;
      visit 2, 3 or 4 using a blinded member of the team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all visits (see figure 2), participants will lie in a semi recumbent position in minimal&#xD;
      clothing (bathing shorts and a t-shirt) for the entirety of the visit. Initially,&#xD;
      participants will be cannulated (Versatus winged and ported IV cannula, Terumo, Japan) and&#xD;
      blood samples drawn for analysis of osmolality (Lithium Heparin (LH) tubes BD (Becton,&#xD;
      Dickinson and Company), USA) plasma [glucose] (Fluoride/Oxalate tubes, BD, USA), [insulin]&#xD;
      (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) K2, BD, USA), and [eHSP70 (extracellular heat shock&#xD;
      protein 70)] (EDTA K2, BD, USA) at baseline and every 30 min of each experimental visit.&#xD;
      Following cannulation an 180 min OGTT (75g) (Rapilose OGTT solution, Penlan healthcare,&#xD;
      Japan) will commence in a thermoneutral room (~ 23oC). A maximum of 18 mL of blood being&#xD;
      drawn at each time point (max 126 mL per visit). To maintain the patency of the cannula and&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of infection, after every sample is taken, 5 mL of saline will be flushed&#xD;
      through the cannula. Then before every sample is taken, 2.5 mL of blood will be drawn out of&#xD;
      the cannula to ensure any remaining saline will not interfere with the samples and data&#xD;
      interpretation (additional 17.5mL per visit). During the OGTT, HR (heart rate) (via&#xD;
      electrocardiogram) will be measured continuously, whilst blood pressure (M5-1, Omron, Japan),&#xD;
      deep body temperature (rectal probe) and resting metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry) (Quark&#xD;
      CPET (cardiopulmonary exercise test), Cosmed, Italy) will be assessed every 30 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition 2 will employ identical procedures to condition 1, except thirty minutes into the&#xD;
      OGTT, the participant will be immersed into an immersion tank (~39oC) for 60 min. Water&#xD;
      temperature will be manipulated as required to achieve and maintain a target Trec at 38.5 oC&#xD;
      using water between 37.5 and 39oC, and then participants will be removed horizontally back&#xD;
      into the thermoneutral room for the reminder of the OGTT. Participants will be towel dried&#xD;
      and given a towelled robe to wear. Condition 3 will employ identical procedures to condition&#xD;
      2, with the exception that the heating via immersion will start as soon as the participant is&#xD;
      instrumented (and following a 15 min rest period) and the OGTT will commence 30 min after the&#xD;
      60 min immersion time for a further 180 min (see figure 2 for a schematic).&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>440 individuals were screened for eligibility (200 clinical letters, 40 from day events and 200 from local diabetes education group). 420 declined and 0 were excluded. Once participants were randomly allocated to arm sequence 5 withdrew before starting. Three in-between experimental visits. Twelve completed the study and data analysed.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were excluded from the study before assignment to groups if they did not pass screening criteria. Balanced randomisation of order in which individuals completed each arm (cross-over) was carried out. Therefore there was an equal number of individuals completing all combinations of arms.</pre_assignment_details>

Initially, participants will be cannulated and blood samples drawn every 30 min of each experimental visit. Following cannulation an 180 min OGTT (75g) will commence in a thermoneutral room (~ 23C). During the OGTT, HR (heart rate) will be measured continuously, whilst blood pressure, deep body temperature (rectal probe) and resting metabolic rate will be assessed every 30 min.</description>

      <time_frame>3h for the OGTT plus the 1 h of passive heating in the passive heating arms at Visit 2, 3 and 4. 3 times in total, until study completion, up to approximately 8 weeks.</time_frame>
      <desc>Safety population included all participants who underwent the OGTT and passive heating.</desc>

        <group group_id="E1">
          <title>Control</title>
          <description>Participants will lie in a semi recumbent position in minimal clothing for the entirety of the visit. Initially, participants will be cannulated and blood samples drawn.every 30 min of each experimental visit. Following cannulation an 180 min OGTT (75g) will commence in a thermoneutral room (~ 23C). During the OGTT, HR will be measured continuously, whilst blood pressure, deep body temperature (rectal probe) and resting metabolic rate will be assessed every 30 min.</description>

        <group group_id="E2">
          <title>Pre OGTT</title>
          <description>Condition 2 will employ identical procedures to condition 1, except thirty minutes into the OGTT, the participant will be immersed into an immersion tank (~39oC) for 60 min. Water temperature will be manipulated as required to achieve and maintain a target Trec at 38.5 oC using water between 37.5 and 39oC, and then participants will be removed horizontally back into the thermoneutral room for the reminder of the OGTT. Participants will be towel dried and given a towelled robe to wear.&#xD;

          <title>Post OGTT</title>
          <description>Condition 3 will employ identical procedures to condition 2, with the exception that the heating via immersion will start as soon as the participant is instrumented (and following a 15 min rest period) and the OGTT will commence 30 min after the 60 min immersion time for a further 180 min.&#xD;
