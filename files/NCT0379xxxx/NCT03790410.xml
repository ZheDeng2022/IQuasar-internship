  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficits in postural control are increasingly recognized among the important secondary&#xD;
      impairments in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are&#xD;
      conflicting results regarding the effect of inspiratory muscle training in improvement of&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle strength, endurance, and dyspnea in stable COPD patients. The main&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle, the diaphragm has also a stabilizing function of the trunk. The aim of&#xD;
      this study to enhance postural control of COPD patients with improving the stability of the&#xD;
      trunk by using inspiratory muscle training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial in patients with stable COPD. The participants are&#xD;
      divided into two groups. Patients in the inspiratory muscle training (IMT) group take part in&#xD;
      a complex pulmonary rehabilitation program containing breathing exercises, bicycle ergometer&#xD;
      conditionings, relaxations, strength and endurance trainings completed by inspiratory muscle&#xD;
      training. The members of the IMT group use the POWERbreathe Medic device. The control group&#xD;
      perform the complex pulmonary rehabilitation program without IMT. The program is divided into&#xD;
      3 weeks inpatient period and 3 weeks home period. Before, between and after the 3 weeks&#xD;
      period all subjects are measured. 60 patients are planned to take part in the investigation.&#xD;
      The inspiratory muscle strength is measured by POWERbreathe K1 device. Balance is assessed by&#xD;
      functional balance tests: Timed Up and Go Test, Four Square Step Test, Modified Functional&#xD;
      Reach Test, Modified Lateral Reach Test, Stand Up Test. Body Sway is measured by HR Mat&#xD;
      VersaTek System. The diameter of the diaphragm muscle is assessed by B-mode ultrasound&#xD;
      examination using Zonare Z. One Ultrasound System. Arterial stiffness parameters measured by&#xD;
      Arteriograph.&#xD;
