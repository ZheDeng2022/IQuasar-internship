  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a feasibility study. It will assess areas of uncertainty relating to the&#xD;
      implementation of an individualised exercise programme for patients with a recent kneecap&#xD;
      dislocation. This will help determine if a future larger study is feasible, and inform the&#xD;
      design and conduct of future research that would aim to optimise outcomes after a kneecap&#xD;
      dislocation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to recruit 15 adult participants with a recent, first-time or recurrent&#xD;
      kneecap dislocation, from an acute hospital. Participants will receive up to 6 physiotherapy&#xD;
      sessions over 3 months. The investigator's exercise programme aims to improve leg muscle&#xD;
      strength and facilitate a return to the participant's usual activities. This may include&#xD;
      activities such as hopping and changing direction which differentiates it from other&#xD;
      programmes. Participants will be required to perform the exercise programme 3 times a week&#xD;
      independently. Strategies to increase adherence to the exercise programme will also be used.&#xD;
      This study is part of a Masters in Clinical Research funded by the National Institute for&#xD;
      Health Research&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will be comprised of up to 6, one-to-one physiotherapy sessions, over a maximum duration of 3 months. 1 or 2 extra sessions are allowed if deemed essential by the participant's physiotherapist. Less than 6 physiotherapy sessions can be agreed with the participant if they have achieved their goals. Throughout this time participants will be required to perform an exercise programme a minimum of 3 times per week. The exercise programme aims to increase leg muscle strength and facilitate a return to the participant's usual activities. It may include hopping and change of direction tasks if these are activities the participant would normally do. Behavioural change techniques to increase participant adherence to the exercise programme will also be used.</description>

Participants received up to six, one-to-one, face-to-face physiotherapy sessions, over a maximum duration of 3 months. Less than six physiotherapy sessions were used if participants achieved their goals, were self-managing effectively, and their physiotherapist agreed. Participants had to perform prescribed exercises a minimum of 3 times per week. Prescribed exercise aimed to restore leg muscle strength through intense leg strengthening exercises, and restore activity levels by prescribing dynamic exercises related to the activities participants wished to resume. Behavioural change techniques to increase participant adherence to the exercise programme were also used.</description>

This will measure several domains of of intervention acceptability: satisfaction with treatment, self-efficacy, burden of treatment, and intention to adhere. 6 questions will assess satisfaction with treatment, 3 questions will assess self-efficacy,1 question will assess burden of treatment and 1 question will assess intention to adhere. Each question will use a 5 point likert scale (0-4) with lower scores indicating higher satisfaction, self-efficacy, and intention to adhere.

Participants received up to six, one-to-one, face-to-face physiotherapy sessions, over a maximum duration of 3 months. Less than six physiotherapy sessions were used if participants achieved their goals, were self-managing effectively, and their physiotherapist agreed. Participants had to perform prescribed exercises a minimum of 3 times per week. Prescribed exercise aimed to restore leg muscle strength through intense leg strengthening exercises, and restore activity levels by prescribing dynamic exercises related to the activities participants wished to resume. Behavioural change techniques to increase participant adherence to the exercise programme were also used.</description>

            <description>Participants after a lateral kneecap dislocation will be enrolled into an individualized exercise intervention supervised by a physiotherapist&#xD;
Individualised exercise: The intervention will be comprised of up to 6, one-to-one physiotherapy sessions, over a maximum duration of 3 months. 1 or 2 extra sessions are allowed if deemed essential by the participant's physiotherapist. Less than 6 physiotherapy sessions can be agreed with the participant if they have achieved their goals. Throughout this time participants will be required to perform an exercise programme a minimum of 3 times per week. The exercise programme aims to increase leg muscle strength and facilitate a return to the participant's usual activities. It may include hopping and change of direction tasks if these are activities the participant would normally do. Behavioural change techniques to increase participant adherence to the exercise programme will also be used.</description>

Participants received up to six, one-to-one, face-to-face physiotherapy sessions, over a maximum duration of 3 months. Less than six physiotherapy sessions were used if participants achieved their goals, were self-managing effectively, and their physiotherapist agreed. Participants had to perform prescribed exercises a minimum of 3 times per week. Prescribed exercise aimed to restore leg muscle strength through intense leg strengthening exercises, and restore activity levels by prescribing dynamic exercises related to the activities participants wished to resume. Behavioural change techniques to increase participant adherence to the exercise programme were also used.</description>

Participants received up to six, one-to-one, face-to-face physiotherapy sessions, over a maximum duration of 3 months. Less than six physiotherapy sessions were used if participants achieved their goals, were self-managing effectively, and their physiotherapist agreed. Participants had to perform prescribed exercises a minimum of 3 times per week. Prescribed exercise aimed to restore leg muscle strength through intense leg strengthening exercises, and restore activity levels by prescribing dynamic exercises related to the activities participants wished to resume. Behavioural change techniques to increase participant adherence to the exercise programme were also used.</description>

          <title>Individualized Exercise</title>
          <description>Participants after a lateral kneecap dislocation were enrolled into an individualized exercise intervention supervised by a physiotherapist&#xD;
Participants received up to six, one-to-one, face-to-face physiotherapy sessions, over a maximum duration of 3 months. Less than six physiotherapy sessions were used if participants achieved their goals, were self-managing effectively, and their physiotherapist agreed. Participants had to perform prescribed exercises a minimum of 3 times per week. Prescribed exercise aimed to restore leg muscle strength through intense leg strengthening exercises, and restore activity levels by prescribing dynamic exercises related to the activities participants wished to resume. Behavioural change techniques to increase participant adherence to the exercise programme were also used.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>This study was conducted at one centre and the sample size was small. Therefore, further larger-scale feasibility testing is required to determine if a full-scale randomised controlled trial comparing physiotherapy treatments for patients after acute patellar dislocation is viable</limitations_and_caveats>
