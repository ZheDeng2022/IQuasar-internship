  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent works highlight the B cells involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology but their&#xD;
      role remains poorly understood. It was previously described that activated memory B cells&#xD;
      called 4BL due to the increased expression of 4-1BBL, an activation marker, induce&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory response by activating T CD8+ lymphocytes. Those 4BL cells are also&#xD;
      described in systemic inflammation in 80 years old people explaining the poor efficiency of&#xD;
      vaccination in that sub population. Those 4BL cells can also induce anti-tumoral T cell&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesize is that 4BL may induce a pathogenic inflammatory response in MS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the aim to compare the proportion of peripheral (blood) 4 BL cells but also 4-BL cells in&#xD;
      cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) in MS compared to healthy controls and to other inflammatory&#xD;
      neurological disease but also non inflammatory neurological disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all groups of patients and controls it will collect blood and CSF only once (at diagnosis&#xD;
      time for patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collect from healthy controls will come from transfusion volunteers and we won't have&#xD;
      CSF from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients from the MS group, the blood collect will be sequential at diagnosis, 3, 6, 12&#xD;
      and 24 months after during the follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the blood and CSF we will evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  percentage of 4 BL cells. 4 BL cells are found using cytometric parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  capacity of 4 BL cells to induce inflammatory response in vitro: percentage of induced&#xD;
           activated TCD8 proliferation after cell culture using extracellular and intracellular&#xD;
           cytometric parameters&#xD;
