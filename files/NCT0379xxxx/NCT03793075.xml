  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Host systemic responses to vigorous stimuli as trauma, surgical tissue injury, anesthesia and&#xD;
      post-operative pain, leads to release a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines including&#xD;
      interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mainly from monocytes and macrophages Thus, the&#xD;
      rise of IL-6 is regarded as an early marker of tissue damage and its rise proportional to the&#xD;
      degree of tissue damage .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that systemic responses to stress may be modified by the anesthetic&#xD;
      technique used . Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) especially propofol based greatly&#xD;
      suppresses the stress response induced by surgery when compared to inhalation by lowering&#xD;
      cortisol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine has the ability to modulate (modify) inflammation . Even the sub-anesthetic doses of&#xD;
      ketamine in animal models were even provided to have an effect on the inflammatory response&#xD;
      system in the central nervous system&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The release a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α&#xD;
      (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mainly from monocytes and macrophages&#xD;
      due to surgical trauma or anesthesia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-6 is constantly found in the peripheral blood and rapidly within few minutes unlike other&#xD;
      pro inflammatory mediators. Thus, the rise of IL-6 is regarded as an early marker of tissue&#xD;
      damage and IL-6 levels are proportional to the degree of tissue damage . The two major&#xD;
      actions of IL-6 are having a key role in regulating stress responses by activating the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis and synthesizing fibrinogen (which is necessary&#xD;
      for the acute-phase response) serving as a growth factor for activated B-cells .&#xD;
&#xD;
      While appropriate inflammatory reactions are advantageous and essential for wound healing and&#xD;
      host defense against microorganisms, excessive immune responses can be detrimental. The&#xD;
      released mediators prompt systemic endocrine, immunological and metabolic responses result in&#xD;
      increased pain sensitivity, altered metabolism, hyperthermia and greater secretion of liver&#xD;
      acute phase proteins and stress hormones, so yields unstable patient's hemodynamic status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol was documented to have an advantage in terms of inflammatory and immunomodulatory&#xD;
      effects through significant effect on TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 release .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine has the ability to modulate (modify) inflammation and this is why it is recommended&#xD;
      in patients with sepsis undergoing surgery . This may be possibly related with the variations&#xD;
      in TNF-α and nuclear factor-κB expression . Even the sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine in&#xD;
      animal models were even provided to have an effect on the inflammatory response system in the&#xD;
      central nervous system which is involved in its therapeutic effect on depression (Yang-2 et&#xD;
      al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted to compare between the intravenous infusion of ketamine against&#xD;
      the intravenous infusion of propofol during general anesthesia in patients undergoing major&#xD;
      abdominal surgeries.&#xD;
