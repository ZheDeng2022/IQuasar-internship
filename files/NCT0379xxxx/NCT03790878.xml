  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Ability to Perceive Negative and Positive Emotional Expressions, as Measured by a Behavioral Computer-based Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>During the laboratory experiment (week 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Emotion perception is measured by a computer-based behavioral assessment during the laboratory session. Scores for negative emotional expressions range from 0-100%, with higher scores indicating greater emotion perception accuracy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Emotion Perception, as Measured by a Phone-based Behavioral Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>After the one week of phone-based intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Perception of positive emotional expressions and negative emotional expressions are measured by a behavioral phone-based assessment, delivered multiple times over one week via mobile phones. Scores for ratings of emotional valence range from 0-9, with higher scores as more positive emotional valence and lower scores as more negative emotional valence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Emotional Distress, as Measured by Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Beginning of Week one laboratory experiment, End of Week one laboratory experiment</time_frame>
    <description>SUDS are measured on a 10-point Likert self-report scale of Subjective Units of Distress, ranging from 0-9. Scores are changes in SUDS ratings from before hearing the tone to after the tone, with greater scores indicating greater reductions in distress (positive outcomes). SUDS score was evaluated at the beginning of the laboratory experiment, and then at the very end of the lab experiment. The change score was calculated by subtracting the beginning score from the end score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Emotional Arousal, as Measured by Skin Conductance Response (SCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Laboratory assessment, up to one week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in emotional arousal are measured physiologically with electrodermal activity. Skin conductance response measures phasic changes in electrical conductivity of skin, with a minimum threshold of 0.01Î¼S with higher values indicating greater changes in emotional arousal.</description>

        <title>Change in Emotional Distress, as Measured by Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS)</title>
        <description>SUDS are measured on a 10-point Likert self-report scale of Subjective Units of Distress, ranging from 0-9. Scores are changes in SUDS ratings from before hearing the tone to after the tone, with greater scores indicating greater reductions in distress (positive outcomes). SUDS score was evaluated at the beginning of the laboratory experiment, and then at the very end of the lab experiment. The change score was calculated by subtracting the beginning score from the end score.</description>
