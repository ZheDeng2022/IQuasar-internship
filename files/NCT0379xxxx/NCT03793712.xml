    <measure>Change in Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BNSS is a brief clinician rating scale, intended to measure negative symptoms. It consists of 13 items organized into 6 subscales: anhedonia, distress, asociality, avolition, blunted affect and alogia. The items score the impairment. Items 1 to 4 are rated from 0 (Normal) to 6 (Extremely severe) and items 5 to 13 are rated from 0 (No impairment) to 6 (Severe deficit). The BNSS total score is calculated by summing the 13 individual items; subscale scores are calculated by summing the individual items within each subscale. Users of the BNSS should have training in psychiatric interview techniques and have clinical experience working with patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. The BNSS total scores ranges from 0 to 78.</description>

    <measure>Change in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) score</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP is a clinician-rated scale designed and validated to measure a patient's current level of social functioning. The PSP consists of 4 items: socially useful activities (including work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviours. The 4 items are assessed on a 6-point scale, from absent to very severe. Based on these assessments and their combination, individual scores are converted into a global score ranging from 1 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression - Schizophrenia (CGI-SCH-S) negative symptoms score</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-SCH is a clinician-rated scale to assess global illness severity and degree of change in patients with schizophrenia. For both the global illness severity and degree of change, the CGI-SCH consists of four different groups of symptoms (positive, negative, cognitive and depressive) and the overall severity of the disorder. The CGI-SCH-S severity of illness category symptoms and overall severity are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal - not ill) to 7 (Among the most severely ill). For the first four ratings (positive, negative, depressive, and cognitive symptoms), the assessment should focus on the severity of symptoms only. Additionally, for 'overall severity' rating, both severity of symptoms and interference with functioning should be considered.</description>

For both the global illness severity and degree of change, the CGI-SCH consists of four different groups of symptoms (positive, negative, cognitive and depressive) and the overall severity of the disorder. In the CGI-SCH-DC degree of change category symptoms and overall severity are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Each single rating (conditions of severity and degree of improvement) and overall ratings of severity and improvement are scored independently and no total score is derived.</description>
