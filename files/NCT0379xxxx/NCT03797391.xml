  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, Phase I/II study of EMB-01, a bispecific&#xD;
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (cMet)&#xD;
      antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed on available standard&#xD;
      therapies or for which no standard therapy exists. The study consists of two parts: Phase I&#xD;
      (dose escalation) and Phase II (cohort expansion). The study is planning to recruit&#xD;
      tentatively 33-66 subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors in phase I and approximately&#xD;
      42-120 subjects with EGFR mutant and/or cMET aberrated NSCLC who have progressed on or are&#xD;
      intolerant to standard treatment(s) (including platinum-based therapy) will be enrolled at&#xD;
      the RP2D(s) in phase II part of the study. In phase II, patients will be assigned to five&#xD;
      groups according to their molecular status at baseline. The trial will consist of molecular&#xD;
      pre-screening period (Phase II only), clinical screening period (-28 to -1 days), treatment&#xD;
      cycles (each cycle is 28 days, maximum up to 2 years), and safety follow-up period (30 days&#xD;
      after the last dose).&#xD;

             therapy) or are intolerant to standard treatment. Additionally, patients with T790M&#xD;
             mutation have received FDA/Health Authority approved therapies (if accessible) for&#xD;
             this indication (i.e., osimertinib) and have progressed or became intolerant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A patient who has refused all currently available therapy is allowed to enroll, but&#xD;
             must be documented in the source record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must have adequate organ function.&#xD;

             one or more contraceptive methods for contraception starting from screening period and&#xD;
             continue throughout the study treatment and for 3 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Life expectancy &lt; 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject with primacy central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or symptomatic CNS&#xD;
             (leptomeningeal or brain) metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant or nursing females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who have had major surgery within 28 days prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Serious underlying medical conditions, including but not limited to un-controlled&#xD;
             hypertension, other cardiovascular disease or diabetes, ongoing or active infection,&#xD;
             psychiatric, psychological, familial or geographical condition that, in the judgment&#xD;
