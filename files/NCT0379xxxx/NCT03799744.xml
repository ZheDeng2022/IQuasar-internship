  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of VCN-01 in&#xD;
      Combination With Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Subjects With Recurrent/Metastatic Squamous Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma of the Head and Neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VCN-01 is a genetically modified oncolytic adenovirus characterized by the presence of four&#xD;
      independent genetic modifications on the backbone of the wild-type HAd5 adenovirus genome,&#xD;
      encoding human PH20, that confer tumor selectivity and anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa&#xD;
      subclass that inhibits binding of PD-L1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed mechanism of action (MOA) for durvalumab is interference in the interaction of&#xD;
      PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases&#xD;
      the inhibition of immune responses, including those that may result in tumor elimination.&#xD;

      -  Research Hypothesis The presence of VCN-01 into the tumor after systemic administration&#xD;
           will help to overcome the observed resistance to durvalumab and other PD1/PD-L1&#xD;
           checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objectives To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous&#xD;
           injection of VCN-01 combined with durvalumab in two administration regimens (concomitant&#xD;
           or durvalumab starting two weeks later &quot;sequential schedule&quot;), and to determine the&#xD;
           recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design This is a phase I trial, multicenter, open label, and dose escalation&#xD;
           study. Patients will be entered at each dose level, according to a planned dose&#xD;
           escalation schedule. Absence of unacceptable toxicity at the previous dose is required&#xD;
           for entering a patient in the subsequent level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of Centers: up to 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of Patients: 15-20 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Population: Patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck&#xD;
           who have progressed during or after treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase I trial, multicenter, open label, and dose escalation study. Patients will be entered at each dose level, according to a planned dose escalation schedule. Absence of unacceptable toxicity at the previous dose is required for entering a patient in the subsequent level.&#xD;
The investigational treatment will be a single i.v. VCN-01 dose combined with concomitant i.v. durvalumab (MEDI4736) 1500 mg Q4W (Arm I) or durvalumab starting two weeks after VCN-01 administration, &quot;sequential schedule&quot; (Arm II). Patient recruitment in Arm I and Arm II will be performed in parallel based on slot availability. Only one single dose of VCN-01 will be administered to each patient during the trial. Durvalumab will be administered Q4W until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion.</intervention_model_description>

          7. Any unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 from previous anticancer therapy with the&#xD;
             exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values considered not clinically&#xD;
             significant or correctable by the investigator. The eligibility of patients who are&#xD;
             still experiencing irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be&#xD;
             exacerbated by the study drugs in this study (eg, hearing loss) must be reviewed and&#xD;
             approved by the Study Physician. Patients with Grade ≥2 neuropathy or hearing loss&#xD;

          9. Has an active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorder (including but&#xD;
             not limited to inflammatory bowel disease [e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease],&#xD;
             diverticulitis [with the exception of diverticulosis], systemic lupus erythematosus,&#xD;
             Sarcoidosis syndrome, or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves'&#xD;
             disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc]). (See section 4.2 for&#xD;
             details and exceptions.)&#xD;

             replacement therapy) is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Radiotherapy treatment to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of&#xD;
             radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of IP. Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent or&#xD;
             other minor procedures are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of allogenic organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;

             cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic gastrointestinal&#xD;
             conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of&#xD;
             incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed&#xD;
             consent. Exception: patients who are finalizing their antibiotic treatment (for&#xD;
             example 3 days left of a total of 7 or 10) for a respiratory tract infection are&#xD;
             allowed to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases identified either on the&#xD;

             signing the ICF. Patients whose brain metastases have been treated may participate&#xD;
             provided they show radiographic stability (defined as 2 brain images, both of which&#xD;
             are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases. These imaging scans should both&#xD;
             be obtained at least four weeks apart and show no evidence of intracranial&#xD;
             progression). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either as a result&#xD;
             of the brain metastases or their treatment must have resolved or be stable either,&#xD;
             without the use of steroids, or with stable doses of anticonvulsants and/or steroids.&#xD;
             Steroid dose must be ≤10mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent (and anticonvulsants)&#xD;
             for at least 14 days prior to the start of treatment.&#xD;

             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with&#xD;
             local practice), hepatitis B (positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result), hepatitis&#xD;
             C (positive HCV RNA), or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;

             core antibody [HBcAb] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. HBV DNA must be obtained in&#xD;
             these patients prior to treatment. HBV carriers of those patients requiring antiviral&#xD;
             therapy treatment of hepatitis B virus or Hepatitis C are not eligible to participate.&#xD;
             Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain&#xD;
             reaction is negative for HCV RNA. Patients with past or resolved tuberculosis are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note:&#xD;
             Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to&#xD;

&#xD;
         23. Patients receiving full-dose anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Patients with Li Fraumeni syndrome or with previous known retinoblastoma protein&#xD;
             pathway germinal deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Judgment by the investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the&#xD;
             study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
