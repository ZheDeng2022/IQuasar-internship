  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the inherent limitations of coronary angiography to depict the presence of functionally&#xD;
      significant epicardial coronary stenosis and discrepancy between angiographic stenosis&#xD;
      severity and the presence of myocardial ischemia, invasive physiologic indices such as&#xD;
      fractional flow reserve (FFR) or instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) has been a standard&#xD;
      method to guide decision of revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are an intracoronary&#xD;
      imaging method able to provide information about lumen area, vessel area, plaque burden, and&#xD;
      plaque characteristics that can be used for the guidance of revascularization procedure.&#xD;
      Several previous studies explored the diagnostic performance of intravascular imaging-defined&#xD;
      quantitative parameters to predict functional significance defined by FFR, however,&#xD;
      quantitative parameter derived from intravascular imaging showed only moderate diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy and the optimal cut-off value of intravascular imaging-derived minimal lumen area&#xD;
      (MLA) or minimal lumen diameter (MLD) were varied according to the patient population,&#xD;
      interrogated vessels, and the location of target lesions, suggesting limited clinical&#xD;
      relevance of judging functional significance of target stenosis using intravascular imaging&#xD;
      alone. Nevertheless, the adoption rate of FFR-guided decision has been limited due to various&#xD;
      reasons and intravascular image-guided decision has been still used in substantial proportion&#xD;
      of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, new resting pressure-derived indices including resting full-cycle ratio (RFR) or&#xD;
      diastolic pressure ratio (dPR) have been introduced as other substitutes for iFR, which does&#xD;
      not require administration of hyperemic agents, therefore, possess more convenient in daily&#xD;
      practice. Recent study with the largest sample size demonstrated identical diagnostic&#xD;
      property and prognostic implication among iFR, RFR, and dPR. As those resting&#xD;
      pressure-derived indices might have more generalizability for daily practice, it is expected&#xD;
      to raise the adoption rate of physiologic interrogation. Therefore, understanding the&#xD;
      association between all the available physiologic indices and intravascular imaging-derived&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative parameters might be important in clinical decision for patient&#xD;
      who underwent invasive coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, the investigators sought to evaluate diagnostic accuracy and performance of&#xD;
      intravascular imaging-derived quantitative parameters to predict functional significance of&#xD;
      stenosis defined using all the available physiologic indices and further explores the&#xD;
      association between IVUS and OCT-derived plaque characteristics and invasive physiologic&#xD;
      indices.&#xD;
