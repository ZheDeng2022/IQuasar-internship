  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low frequency pulsed current (PC) and medium frequency alternating current (Russian current -&#xD;
      RC, 2.5 kHz) have been largely studied due to their clinical use. However, it is not clear&#xD;
      which current is the most efficient due to the existente literature conflicts.Therefore, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to compare the neuromuscular efficiency, evoked torque, current&#xD;
      intensity, fatigability and level of discomfort between the PC and the RC in healthy young.&#xD;
      The current types will be tested in the same participant by the intervention sequences&#xD;
      randomization. On the first, second, third and fourth days, the maximum voluntary isometric&#xD;
      contraction (MVIC), the current intensity level, discomfort level, evoked torque, and&#xD;
      clinical and neuromuscular efficiency of each current will be evaluated. Anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements will also be assessed on the first day. In addition, the current intensity&#xD;
      required to produce a torque level of 20% of the MVIC, the current intensity required to&#xD;
      generate a torque of 40 Nm and the maximum intensity tolerated by the participant will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Three contractions will be recorded in each condition, and the level of discomfort&#xD;
      will be assessed during the evoked contractions. Evoked torque will be evaluated at the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated intensity level using the isokinetic dynamometer. Clinical and&#xD;
      neuromuscular efficiency will be evaluated (1) at the current intensity necessary to evoke&#xD;
      20% MVIC, (2) at the current intensity necessary to generate 40 Nm, and (3) at the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated current intensity. On the fifth and sixth days, muscle fatigue induced by the&#xD;
      diferente current types will be evaluated. Fatigue will be evaluated with sufficient current&#xD;
      intensity to generate 20% of the MVIC. MVIC will be performed before and after the fatigue&#xD;
      protocol, and the fatigue will be determined by the relative variation of the MVIC before and&#xD;
      after the fatigue protocol. Fatigue will also be evaluated through the evoked torque&#xD;
      variation between the first and the last minute of the fatigue protocol, as well as by the&#xD;
      total work generated in each protocol. Neuromuscular efficiency will be evaluated before and&#xD;
      immediately after the protocol through (1) the ratio between input NMES current intensity and&#xD;
      output evoked torque, (2) total work (area under the evoked force by time curves) generated&#xD;
      during the fatigue protocol, and (3) by the changes in muscle architecture from rest to&#xD;
      evoked contraction at the maximal current intensity.&#xD;

      This study is characterized by a quantitative approach, with a randomized crossover clinical&#xD;
      study design, blinded to evaluators and participants. The objective is to compare the&#xD;
      neuromuscular and clinical efficiency, evoked torque, current intensity, fatigue and&#xD;
      discomfort level between the low frequency biphasic pulsed current (PC) and the median&#xD;
      frequency sinusoidal alternating Russian current (RC) in healthy young participants. The&#xD;
      effect of the two neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) current types on the cited&#xD;
      variables will be evaluated in the same participant, by means of the randomization of the&#xD;
      interventions sequences for each participant. The evaluation protocols will be performed by 2&#xD;
      blinded raters for the current type and for the outcome variables. A blinded evaluator to the&#xD;
      study will randomize the current type, which will be applied on the different evaluation&#xD;
      days, through a lottery using opaque envelopes. A researcher blinded to the study groups will&#xD;
      analyze the data. Participants will be blinded to the current type will be receiving. The&#xD;
      evaluations will be performed in six days, and a minimum interval of 7 days will be observed&#xD;
      between the evaluation days. On the first, second, third and fourth days, characterized as&#xD;
      Stage 1, the currents' intensity levels, discomfort level, evoked torque, and neuromuscular&#xD;
      and clinical efficiency of each randomized current will be evaluated. On the fifth and sixth&#xD;
      days, characterized as Stage 2, the muscle fatigue level induced by the two electrical&#xD;
      currents will be evaluated. The first evaluation day will be divided into two phases. Phase 1&#xD;
      corresponds to the initial evaluation, anthropometric data collection and physical activity&#xD;
      level evaluation. In Phase 2, the quadriceps femoris motor point will be located with a&#xD;
      pen-shaped electrode and a neuromuscular electrical stimulation unit, and the subcutaneous&#xD;
      adipose layer thickness covering the motor point will be evaluated by means of&#xD;
      ultrasonography. Subsequently, the ultrasound probe will be maintained on the vastus&#xD;
      lateralis muscle (VL) to obtain muscle architecture data at rest, during the maximal&#xD;
      voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) and during the evoked contractions. Next, a warming&#xD;
      up protocol will be performed and the participants will perform three MVICs at the knee joint&#xD;
      angles of 60° and 90° of knee flexion (0° = full knee extension) on the isokinetic&#xD;
      dynamometer. Subsequently, the investigators will evaluate (1) the current intensity required&#xD;
      to produce a torque equivalent to 20% MVIC, (2) the current intensity required to produce a&#xD;
      40 Nm torque, the maximum current intensity (mA) tolerated by the subject (3) at an angle of&#xD;
      60° of knee flexion, and (4) at 90° of knee flexion. From these evaluations, the&#xD;
      investigators will analyze the neuromuscular efficiency (ratio between current intensity and&#xD;
      evoked torque). After each NMES test, participants will indicate, on the visual-analog scale,&#xD;
      the discomfort level perceived with each NMES current type. Clinical efficiency will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the ratio between the discomfort level and the evoked torque in the&#xD;
      above-described situations. On the second, third and fourth evaluation day, participants will&#xD;
      perform all the evaluations described in Phase 2 of the first evaluation day, but with&#xD;
      different configurations of the type of current randomized being applied. On the fifth day,&#xD;
      the fatigue protocol will be applied with appropriated parameters according to the randomized&#xD;
      current type, and sufficient current intensity to generate 20% of the MVIC. The discomfort&#xD;
      level during the fatigue protocol will be recorded immediately after the end of the fatigue&#xD;
      test. Participants will conduct three pre- and post-fatigue protocol MVICs in order to assess&#xD;
      the fatigue level. For the sixth evaluation day, the same evaluations reported for the fifth&#xD;
      day will be carried out, but with the second randomized current.&#xD;
