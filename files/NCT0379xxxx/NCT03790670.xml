      First, the investigators will determine the safety of a 24 month regimen of Leukine&#xD;
      administered as a weight-based dose at 3 µg/kg/day for 5 days (week), followed by a 2-day&#xD;
      holiday (weekend). This 24 month (n=10) pilot study will extend the prior 2 month observation&#xD;
      tests towards the goal of assessing the safety of Leukine for treatment of Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD). Clinical signs and symptoms will be measured by personal well-being, physical,&#xD;
      and neurological examinations (UPDRS Parts I, II, III, and IV assessments) and blood tests&#xD;
      (CBC with differential, total T cell count, and a comprehensive metabolic sera panel).&#xD;
      Second, we will assess regimen tolerability administered in a dose reduction, from 6&#xD;
      µg/kg/day without interruption, to 3 µg/kg/day with 2 day drug holidays. The investigators&#xD;
      will examine over a time of 24 months, effects of treatment on defined adaptive immune&#xD;
      deficits in PD as measured by analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected&#xD;
      before, during, and after cessation of Leukine administration. Individual T cell parameters&#xD;
      will be assessed and will include links between T cell function and subset analyses and&#xD;
      clinical neurological signs and symptoms. In addition, the functional stability of the immune&#xD;
      deficits will be assess in PD by examining T cell subsets in PD patients in this study&#xD;
      against prior results. The investigators will also determine whether the immune deficits of&#xD;
      PD are consistent during baseline data collection, and the potential Leukine-induced motor&#xD;
      control and mobility improvements will be determined by UPDRS part I, II, III, and IV scores&#xD;
      off treatment and on treatment.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives: There are three study goals. First, the investigators will determine the&#xD;
      safety of a 24 month regimen of Leukine administered as a weight-based dose at 3 µg/kg/day&#xD;
      for 5 days (week), followed by a 2-day holiday (weekend). This 24 month (n=10) pilot study&#xD;
      will extend the prior 2 month observation tests towards the goal of assessing the safety of&#xD;
      Leukine for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinical signs and symptoms will be&#xD;
      measured by personal well-being, physical, and neurological examinations (UPDRS Parts I, II,&#xD;
      III, and IV assessments) and blood tests (CBC with differential, total T cell count, and a&#xD;
      comprehensive metabolic sera panel). Second, the investigators will assess regimen&#xD;
      tolerability administered in a dose reduction, from 6 µg/kg/day without interruption, to 3&#xD;
      µg/kg/day with 2 day drug holidays. The lowered dose was chosen based on known tolerability&#xD;
      and parallel-linked immune reconstitution seen in cancer-associated disease treatments. Due&#xD;
      to fragility of the patient population and prior recorded adverse events the proposed dose&#xD;
      reductions are justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a course of 24 months, the effects of treatment on defined adaptive immune deficits in&#xD;
      PD as measured by analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected before, during,&#xD;
      and after cessation of Leukine administration will be examined. Individual T cell parameters&#xD;
      that include links between T cell function and subset analyses and clinical neurological&#xD;
      signs and symptoms will be examined. These immune parameters will be serially examined as&#xD;
      they may contribute to the immune deficits in PD. Thus, timed analyses of changes in T cell&#xD;
      phenotypes and/or function will be completed. In addition, the investigators will assess the&#xD;
      functional stability of the immune deficits in PD and will determine whether the immune&#xD;
      deficits of PD are consistent during baseline data collection. The potential Leukine-induced&#xD;
      motor control and mobility improvements will be determined by assessing UPDRS part I, II,&#xD;
      III, and IV scores off treatment and on treatment. Specifically, over the course of this&#xD;
      six-month treatment study, various biomarkers will be assessed including: T cell markers of&#xD;
      immune activation, DNA methylation status, and B cell and bone marrow progenitor cell&#xD;
      markers. We hope to uncover the time course of Treg induction, as well as link the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of Leukine treatment (not previously recorded) to changes in specific&#xD;
      biomarkers. Additionally, changes in the humoral response following extended Leukine&#xD;
      treatment will be assessed by measuring the presence of antibodies against Leukine and&#xD;
      alterations in B cell frequencies.&#xD;
