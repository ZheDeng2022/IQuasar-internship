      This study will be a prospective, non-randomized study of low-vision individuals diagnosed&#xD;
      with either age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or diabetic macular edema with ETDRS&#xD;
      visual acuity from 20/60 to 20/400 in both eyes from the University of Texas - Southwestern&#xD;
      (UTSW) Medical Center at Dallas. Specifically, the primary objective of this testing is to&#xD;
      establish the benefits of a wide field-of-view (FOV) monocular head-mounted visual&#xD;
      enhancement device display (HMD), aiding the most degraded eye, as compared to best corrected&#xD;
      visual acuity with glasses. It should be noted that in this approach, the HMD incorporates a&#xD;
      camera, mounted coaxially with the visual axis of the eye with worse vision, and also&#xD;
      image-enhancing or correction algorithms. Following review and execution of the informed&#xD;
      consent, each subject will undergo an examination of their eyes, including: 1) ETDRS&#xD;
      Best-corrected distance visual acuity; 2) Best-corrected near visual acuity; 3) Tests based&#xD;
      on questions 5,6,7 and 11 of the National Eye Institute 25-item visual function questionnaire&#xD;
      (NEI VFQ-25).&#xD;

      A single visit, prospective, non-randomized study of low vision individuals diagnosed with&#xD;
      Age Related Macular Degeneration or Diabetic macular edema research project is designed to&#xD;
      last about 1.5 hours. All testing will be used for research purposes. There will be an 1)&#xD;
      Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity test, 2) near vision test, 3)&#xD;
      Testing based on questions 5,6,7, and 11 of the National Eye Institute 25 item visual&#xD;
      function questionnaire, (NEI VFQ-25) which includes a speed reading test, identifying&#xD;
      objects, physically taking them and returning the items to correct original placement, once&#xD;
      with glasses only, once with the head mounted visual device placed over the worst eye&#xD;
      visually. There will also be an video tracks showing a conversation between 2 individuals -&#xD;
      Subjects will be queried about the facial expressions of the actors during the conversation.&#xD;
      The device is a wide field of view (FOV) monocular head-mounted visual enhancement device&#xD;
      (HMD). The HMD has a camera mounted coaxially with the visual axis of the worse vision eye,&#xD;
      and also image enhancing or correction algorithms. There are breaks planned between testing&#xD;
      on the visual function exam portion of the NEI-25.&#xD;

          <title>Use of Head Mounted Device</title>
          <description>Evergaze has developed a head-mounted visual enhancement device for low-vision patients. Patients will be non-randomized individuals diagnosed with either Retinal Degeneration or diabetic macular edema with ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) VA 20/60 to 20/400.&#xD;
The device will be placed over the most degraded eye incorporating a camera, mounted coaxially with the visual axis of the eye with the worse vision. Incorporation of a video recording of head and eye movement with the head mounted device is being included for any functionality improvements to be made. Then each subject will undergo complete examination of their eyes, including ETDRS VA, distance and near along with Questions 5,6,7,and 11 of the NEI (National Eye Institute) 25 item visual function questionnaire (NEI VFQ 25)</description>

          <title>Use of Head Mounted Device</title>
          <description>Evergaze has developed a head-mounted visual enhancement device for low-vision patients. Patients will be non-randomized individuals diagnosed with either Retinal Degeneration or diabetic macular edema with ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) VA 20/60 to 20/400.&#xD;
The device will be placed over the most degraded eye incorporating a camera, mounted coaxially with the visual axis of the eye with the worse vision. Incorporation of a video recording of head and eye movement with the head mounted device is being included for any functionality improvements to be made. Then each subject will undergo complete examination of their eyes, including ETDRS VA, distance and near along with Questions 5,6,7,and 11 of the NEI (National Eye Institute) 25 item visual function questionnaire (NEI VFQ 25)</description>
