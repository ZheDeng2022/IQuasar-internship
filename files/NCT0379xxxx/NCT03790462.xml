  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In India, music is predominantly used as entertainment. Despite ample vedic literature&#xD;
      available on the beneficial effects of ragas in Indian music on human mind and body,&#xD;
      scientific evidence for the same is extremely meager. This initial systematic study of 6&#xD;
      ragas, is an attempt to provide scientific evidence and validate the use of Indian classical&#xD;
      music &amp; thus present the scientific community with a new complementary therapy / non-&#xD;
      pharmacological mode of treatment which could be used in prevention of various&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases. In our previous study on prehypertensives and hypertensives, blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) reduced significantly after listening to Indian music [raga 'bhimpalas' (raga&#xD;
      that normalizes BP)], daily for 3 months. Heart rate variability (HRV) recorded once on&#xD;
      recruitment and end of study failed to show any change. On retrospection, we realised that&#xD;
      the effect of only a single raga had been tested and the acute effects had not been&#xD;
      elucidated. Specifically, EEG waves &amp; cognitive ERPs were not studied. Hence a study&#xD;
      encompassing all the 6 ragas that are known to normalize BP as given in literatures such as&#xD;
      Gandharva Veda (Sama Veda) &amp; Raga Chikitsa was planned. Among these, 3 ragas are now being&#xD;
      studied &amp; data analysis is in line. This proposal is to study the immediate&#xD;
      electrophysiological changes with remaining 3 ragas. Music can be prescribed as a cheap and&#xD;
      effective adjuvant in the treatment of hypertension along with other lifestyle modifications.&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, there is scanty literature testing Indian ragas. Thus there is&#xD;
      a great need to address this issue.&#xD;

      INDIAN MUSIC: 'Raga' (musical scale) is a set of musical notes presented in an orderly manner&#xD;
      in order to generate a melody out of the same. Matanga (9-10th century AD) in his work&#xD;
      'Brihaddeshi' was the earliest to define raga as &quot;raga is that kind of sound composition&#xD;
      consisting of melodic movements which has the effect of colouring the hearts of men&quot;.&#xD;
      However, there have been very few studies which have used Indian classical music as an&#xD;
      intervention for studying their health benefits. Gandharvaveda, a part of Sama veda, has&#xD;
      mentioned various ragas to have myriad health benefits.Dr. Burnell has mentioned a manuscript&#xD;
      named raga chikistsa in the collections of Saraswati Mahal Library in Tanjore which deals&#xD;
      with the various ragas that can be used for curing various ailments. For example raga&#xD;
      Malkauns is said to help in curing hypotension. Insomnic patients are said to benefit by&#xD;
      usage of raga Behag. 'Heart Rate Variability' has become the conventionally accepted term to&#xD;
      describe beat-to-beat alteration in HR, and RR intervals in ECG. The cause of HRV is&#xD;
      considered to be respiratory sinus arrhythmia as well as low-frequency oscillations (0.1 Hz)&#xD;
      associated with Traube-Hering-Mayer waves of BP . It was found that a decrease in HRV was a&#xD;
      strong predictor of mortality after acute myocardial infarction . HRV is assessed by either&#xD;
      time or frequency domain methods. EFFECT OF MUSIC ON BLOOD PRESSURE:Many studies have shown&#xD;
      that there is a modification of cardiorespiratory parameters on repeated rhythymic recitation&#xD;
      of a prayer, poetry or yoga mantra . So it is not surprising that music (rhythmic repetition&#xD;
      of notes and tones) can also have similar effects. A number of studies have reported that&#xD;
      listening to sedative music (slow tempo, legato phrasing, and minimal dynamic contrasts) can&#xD;
      lead to decreased HR and BP. BP was shown to be proportional to the crescendo present in&#xD;
      music, where as music with uniform emphasis reduced the BP .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive listening to music on a daily basis helped in reducing BP of 12 elderly subjects. The&#xD;
      experimental group listened to selected songs for 25 minutes every day, for four weeks. BP&#xD;
      was measured twice a week. There was a significant decrease in the mean BP: 11.8 mmHg in the&#xD;
      SBP and 4.7 mmHg in the DBP . Elderly subjects have shown statistically significant reduction&#xD;
      in SBP and DBP after 12-minute audio relaxation program . STUDIES ON EFFECT OF MUSIC ON HRV:&#xD;
      Whether music causes an increase or decrease in HR, remains a mystery . Several studies&#xD;
      reported that under various conditions music decreases sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and&#xD;
      increases parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity as measured by HR and HRV, indicating&#xD;
      physiological relaxation . No difference in HR or HRV was observed by a few investigators .&#xD;
      However, an increase in HR has also been reported by some . SALIVARY STRESS MARKERS: The&#xD;
      salivary glands receive sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations. The major enzyme that&#xD;
      is released on sympathetic stimulation is alpha (α) amylase. Thus it is presumed that,&#xD;
      changes in salivary alpha amylase indicate the activity of the SM system during stress.&#xD;
      Further, both salivary cortisol and alpha amylase have been used by number of researchers&#xD;
      recently to quantify stress or as biomarkers of stress. Nevertheless, it has also been put&#xD;
      forth that salivary amylase activity is an index of plasma norepinephrine levels under a&#xD;
      variety of stressful conditions. STUDIES ON EFFECT OF MUSIC ON EEG: In one study where EEG&#xD;
      was recorded after giving alpha music to about ten subjects, it was observed that increase in&#xD;
      the maximum amplitudes of Alpha waves either after 6 minutes or after 12 minutes of alpha&#xD;
      music. However, the maximum amplitude of beta waves showed a decline of up to 40% from the&#xD;
      initial value. These results, namely, the increase in Alpha activity and decrease in Beta&#xD;
      activity indicate that subjects experience 'relaxed alertness'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Medical college and Tertiary care hospital Case group (totally 3 groups) = 35&#xD;
      subjects in each group; a total sample of 105 Control group = 35 subjects Basis for sample&#xD;
      size:Based on the study conducted by Okada et al, it was found that RMSSD (root mean square&#xD;
      standard deviation of NN intervals on ECG) was 17.4±7.2 ms and 24.1±15.5 ms before and after&#xD;
      music therapy with an effect size of 0.59 and power of 90% and confidence interval of 95%,&#xD;
      the minimum sample size required for the present study was estimated to be 32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and materials: The effect of at least 3 different Indian classical music ragas on the&#xD;
      autonomic functions and brain waves of subjects will be studied. Healthy subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited from M S Ramaiah Instituitions. Selection bias will be avoided by randomization&#xD;
      using computer generated random numbers. All numbers generated will be kept in an opaque and&#xD;
      sealed envelope. The envelope will be opened by the research assistant after the baseline&#xD;
      assessment of each participant and assigned to each of the seven groups randomly, into all&#xD;
      intervention and control categories. Each group will randomly be assigned to listen to a&#xD;
      particular raga using block randomization. The control group, the seventh group, will not&#xD;
      receive any raga, but HRV,BP, EEG and saliva will be recorded and collected. Literature given&#xD;
      in Gandharva veda and raga chikitsa will be used to choose ragas which have varied health&#xD;
      benefits especially on the cardiovascular system. The ragas which have been said to normalize&#xD;
      the BP are ahir bhairav, bhimpalas, hindol, puriya, kausikanada and todi. Ahir Bhairav, Kausi&#xD;
      Kanada &amp; Bhimpalas will be used for the present study. Detailed methodology: The&#xD;
      investigators will include a few questions inquiring the subjects' preference of type of&#xD;
      music, previous experience with music instrumental or vocal training and note the same. A&#xD;
      general health check up will be done for all subjects. The BMI, waist hip ratio and BP in&#xD;
      sitting position measured twice after five minutes rest (Sphygmomanometry) in between will be&#xD;
      noted. A stress questionnaire (State Trait Anxiety Inventory) will be administered prior to&#xD;
      and after intervention to assess the baseline level of stress and the change in stress levels&#xD;
      after music intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be made to lie supine and relax for ten minutes. EEG electrodes will be applied&#xD;
      according to 10-20 system. A baseline EEG (Galileo NT) and ECG in lead II for 10 minutes&#xD;
      (Power lab 15 T Labchart by AD instruments) will be recorded. Baseline digital measurement of&#xD;
      BP will be done. Saliva for baseline stress markers (cortisol and amylase) will be collected.&#xD;
      All the subjects will be instructed to breathe at a rate of 6 breaths per minute, throughout&#xD;
      the procedure that will be monitored by the software. After this, a raga from Indian&#xD;
      classical music will be played for 10 minutes duration via earplugs connected to the laptop,&#xD;
      during which time the recording of ECG and EEG will continue. The time of start of music will&#xD;
      be marked using an event marker in the software. Post ten minutes, the music will be stopped&#xD;
      and BP will be recorded and saliva will be collected. ECG and EEG recording will continue for&#xD;
      another ten minutes to study any residual effects of music on the heart after which BP will&#xD;
      be recorded and saliva will be collected again (end of 30 minutes procedure). Stress&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered at the end of the procedure. For those in control group&#xD;
      baseline BP, ECG and EEG will be recorded for ten minutes under resting conditions. Saliva&#xD;
      will be collected and stored. EEG will be analyzed using Galileo NT software. HRV will be&#xD;
      analyzed using the software provided. The saliva samples will be centrifuged at 3000 rpm for&#xD;
      15 minutes and supernatant saliva stored at -20° C until further analysis for cortisol and&#xD;
      amylase (ELISA).&#xD;

The STAI-T scale consists of 20 statements that ask people to describe how they generally feel. The STAI-S scale also consists of 20 statements. Each question is rated on a 4-point scale (not at all, somewhat, moderately so, very much so). The range of possible scores for form Y of the STAI varies from a minimum score of 20 to a maximum score of 80 on both the STAI-T and STAI-S subscales. STAI scores are commonly classified as &quot;no or low anxiety&quot; (20-37), &quot;moderate anxiety&quot; (38-44), and &quot;high anxiety&quot; (45-80).</description>
