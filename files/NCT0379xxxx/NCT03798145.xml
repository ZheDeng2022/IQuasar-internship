  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. It is caused by persistently elevated&#xD;
      intraocular pressure causing progressive visual field loss. While a number of conventional&#xD;
      medical and surgical therapies exist, a significant number of patients fail to respond&#xD;
      resulting in persistently elevated intraocular pressure and eventual blindness. While outflow&#xD;
      from the eye primarily occurs through the front of the eye, there is an often overlooked&#xD;
      pathway to remove fluid that is beneath the retina. Surgical removal of retina to create&#xD;
      paths for outflow (surgical retinotomy) in areas damaged by glaucoma can provide access to&#xD;
      this alternative outflow pathway thereby reducing intraocular pressure and halting the vision&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to demonstrate that focal surgical retinotomies (holes in the&#xD;
      retina) can result in predictable and lasting reduction in intraocular pressure while&#xD;
      eliminating the risks associated with surgical retinectomy (broad areas of retinal removal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Joussen et al pioneered a technique to lower intraocular&#xD;
      pressure in patients with advanced untreatable glaucoma. All patients had intraocular&#xD;
      pressures on average above 40 that were unresponsive to any available treatments. Forty-four&#xD;
      patients underwent broad areas of retinal removal (retinectomy). All patients exhibited&#xD;
      dramatic reductions in intraocular pressure which were maintained for 5 years (Joussen 2003).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the technique carried significant risks. 1) a subset of patients had&#xD;
      excessively low intraocular pressure reductions. 2) a subset of patients had secondary&#xD;
      proliferative vitreoretinopathy (a scarring response) that resulting in retinal deatchment.&#xD;
      Despite its incredible effectiveness, these risks made clinicians hesitant to adopt the&#xD;
      technique. Additionally, glaucoma specialists are unable to perform the technical procedures&#xD;
      required creating a chasm between diagnosing physician (glaucoma specialist) and the treating&#xD;
      physician (retina specialist). Finally, surgical microtools tools at the time were still in&#xD;
      their infancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposal attempts to make critical modifications to the technique used by Joussen&#xD;
      et al. (2003). First and foremost, we plan to use surgical retinotomies (holes in the retina)&#xD;
      in lieu of a broad surgical retinectomy (broad peripheral retinal removal). This is a&#xD;
      critical difference. Removal of the peripheral retina to the ora serrata carries significant&#xD;
      risk of postoperative proliferative vitreoretinopathy. This is largely due to residual&#xD;
      vitreous which cannot be removed from the far peripheral retina. This residual vitreous&#xD;
      contracts in the postoperative period causing elevation of the retinectomy edges allowing for&#xD;
      retinal detachment. Surgical retinotomies (holes in the retina), that do not involve the&#xD;
      vitreous base are commonly used in retina surgery and do not carry anywhere close to the risk&#xD;
      of retinal detachment that surgical retinectomy carries. As an example, the majority of&#xD;
      retinal detachments are repaired by draining fluid through an iatrogenic surgical retinotomy&#xD;
      (a hole created by the surgeon in the retina). These holes are created in the posterior&#xD;
      retina and yet are virtually always undetectable by the patient. (Of note, a peripheral&#xD;
      retinotomy is even harder to detect). More recently, there has been an upsurge of free-flap&#xD;
      autologous retinal transplantation for macular holes (Grewal 2016) and macular degeneration&#xD;
      (Parolini 2018). In these surgical procedures, an area of peripheral retina is removed and&#xD;
      transplanted to the macula. The site of removal leaves a hole in the retina. In these studies&#xD;
      the rate of redetachment in patients in whom a retinotomy was created is no higher than that&#xD;
      of other standard retina surgeries. It is therefore clear that creation of retinal holes&#xD;
      (retinotomy) is far different in terms of long-term risks than broad retinal removal to the&#xD;
      ora serrata (retinectomy). Additionally, this increase in retina transplantation has been&#xD;
      made possible by the microsurgical surgical tools that are now available. However, in the&#xD;
      case of both the retinal detachment repair and autologous transplantation, the retinotomy&#xD;
      size is not sufficient to induce intraocular pressure lowering effects. We therefore seek to&#xD;
      build upon the original work from Joussen et al (2003) which showed that retina removal can&#xD;
      have dramatic intraocular pressure lowering effects, but seek to use surgical retinotomies&#xD;
      (holes in the retina) to achieve this retinal removal thereby avoiding his surgical&#xD;
      complications while capitalizing on the long-term efficacy. By varying the size and number of&#xD;
      surgical retinotomy, we will be able to provide a normogram for effective prediction of&#xD;
      intraocular pressure lowering effects. By effectively predicting the magnitude of this&#xD;
      surgical procedure, ophthalmologists will have a predictable and reliable method for treating&#xD;
      glaucoma. Furthermore, because a surgical retinotomy does not close, it is predicted to&#xD;
      provide a life-long effect.&#xD;
