  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects an estimated 185 million individuals worldwide and 3.4&#xD;
      million to 4.4 million people in the United States. Approximately 80% of acutely infected HCV&#xD;
      patients progress to chronic infection, 20% of whom develop cirrhosis within 25 years, with&#xD;
      25% of patients with cirrhosis developing hepatocellular carcinoma and/or decompensated liver&#xD;
      disease. Hepatitis C virus is the primary cause of liver transplantation in the United&#xD;
      States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 6 known genotypes of HCV. The most common genotypes in the United States are&#xD;
      genotype 1 (subtypes 1a and 1b), 2, and 3, which together comprise 97% of all infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, the prevalence of HCV infection is higher than in&#xD;
      the general population. Patients with impaired kidney function have limited therapeutic&#xD;
      options. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved Elbasvir/Grazopevir for&#xD;
      treatment of genotype 1 and 4 infection in CKD patients including those on hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At our institution, the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C&#xD;
      (MATCH) Initiative is a program which was first implemented to increase screening, diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of HCV by actively incorporating primary care providers (PCP) at every step of&#xD;
      the HCV care process. Following implementation of MATCH, early data indicates, marked&#xD;
      increase in screening high risk and baby-boomer cohorts, as well as safe and effective&#xD;
      treatment of HCV cases at the primary provider setting. The initiative proved that active&#xD;
      participation of PCPs in the care of HCV reduced the treatment lag by 71% compared to&#xD;
      traditional care of referring HCV cases to specialized care (Gastroenterology or Hepatology)&#xD;
      while keeping similar SVR. We intend to expand the program to improve quality of care for HCV&#xD;
      patients in dialysis center. We propose active involvement of dialysis clinical staff&#xD;
      including nephrologist, to increase HCV screening rate, promote timely diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of CHC in patient with end-stage renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted to evaluate real-world effectiveness of HCV DAA therapy in CHC&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients when the DAA-treatment is managed and monitored by the clinical staff&#xD;
      of hemodialysis center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine sustained virologic response (SVR) rates attained with&#xD;
      open-label Zepatier administered through hemodialysis center under the supervision of a&#xD;
      nephrologist in chronic hepatitis C infected (CHC) patient currently on hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate prevalence of HCV infection, severity of fibrosis (using non-invasive&#xD;
           measures), and HCV detection rate in patients with End stage renal disease on&#xD;
           hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To calculate the average treatment-lag time (time from HCV diagnosis to submission of&#xD;
           treatment approval).&#xD;

      This study is being conducted to evaluate real-world effectiveness of HCV DAA therapy in CHC&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients when the DAA-treatment is managed and monitored by the nephrologist of&#xD;
      hemodialysis center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects an estimated 185 million individuals worldwide (1) and 3.4&#xD;
      million to 4.4 million people in the United States.(2) Approximately 80% of acutely infected&#xD;
      HCV patients progress to chronic infection, 20% of whom develop cirrhosis within 25 years,&#xD;
      with 25% of patients with cirrhosis developing hepatocellular carcinoma and/or decompensated&#xD;
      liver disease.(3) Hepatitis C virus is the primary cause of liver transplantation in the&#xD;
      United States.(4) There are 6 known genotypes of HCV. The most common genotypes in the United&#xD;
      States are genotype 1 (subtypes 1a and 1b), 2, and 3, which together comprise 97% of all&#xD;
      infections.(5) Since the discovery of HCV in 1989 (6) strategies to cure the infection have&#xD;
      evolved dramatically. A cure is defined as a sustained virologic response (SVR) and consists&#xD;
      of undetectable levels of plasma HCV RNA 12 or 24 weeks after therapy completion.(7)&#xD;
      Treatment of HCV has evolved rapidly and has led to improved rates of SVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these highly effective therapies for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have&#xD;
      revolutionized treatment, only a few patients are able to receive treatment.(8) Barriers&#xD;
      arising at multiple levels, from diagnosis to specialist referral, that still need to be&#xD;
      overcome to move toward disease eradication.(9) In chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, the&#xD;
      prevalence of HCV infection is higher than in the general population. Testing for HCV in&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients should be repeated every 6 months.(10) The national study on&#xD;
      dialysis-associated diseases was published in 2002 and represents the infection statistics&#xD;
      from dialysis center nationwide.(11) The overall estimated prevalence of HCV antibody in this&#xD;
      study was 7.8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients with impaired kidney function have limited therapeutic options. The US&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved Elbasvir/Grazopevir for treatment of&#xD;
      genotype 1 and 4 infection in CKD patients including those on hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At our institution, the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C&#xD;
      (MATCH) Initiative is a program which was first implemented to increase screening, diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of HCV by actively incorporating primary care providers (PCP) at every step of&#xD;
      the HCV care process. Following implementation of MATCH, early data indicates, marked&#xD;
      increase in screening high risk and baby-boomer cohorts, as well as safe and effective&#xD;
      treatment of HCV cases at the primary provider setting. The initiative proved that active&#xD;
      participation of PCPs in the care of HCV reduced the treatment lag by 71% compared to&#xD;
      traditional care of referring HCV cases to specialized care (Gastroenterology or Hepatology)&#xD;
      while keeping similar SVR. (13) We intend to expand the program to improve quality of care&#xD;
      for HCV patients in dialysis center. We propose active involvement of dialysis clinical staff&#xD;
      including nephrologist, to increase HCV screening rate, promote timely diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of CHC in patient with end-stage renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the study- We will perform a phase IV study to prove real world effectiveness of&#xD;
      Zepatier in successful treatment of CHC in patients on chronic hemodialysis at hemodialysis&#xD;
      centers, when administered under the supervision of a nephrologist. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in the selected collaborative hemodialysis centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zepatier Open-label Zepatier (grazoprevir 100 mg and elbasvir 50 mg) will be administered in&#xD;
      this study.(14, 15) Zepatier is a fixed-dose combination tablet without ribavirin. GZR is an&#xD;
      HCV NS3/4a inhibitor while EBR is an HCV NS5A inhibitor. Both grazoprevir and elbasvir are&#xD;
      direct-acting antivirals, which together form an effective therapy for HCV and reduce the&#xD;
      likelihood and effects of long-term liver-related HCV complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zepatier has been evaluated globally in multiple phase I, II, and III trials to treat HCV.&#xD;
      (14, 15) Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have been carried out, which led to FDA&#xD;
      approval for Zepatier as a treatment for genotype 1 and 4 HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of July 1, 2015, a diverse population of over 1000 HCV patients has been exposed to&#xD;
      Zepatier either as a single agent or in combination with ribavirin or sofosbuvir in phase&#xD;
      I/II/III studies. Zepatier has been generally well tolerated at doses of 50-100 mg GZR and 50&#xD;
      mg EBR orally once daily. It has been comparably effective across all subgroups it has been&#xD;
      tested in, including non-cirrhotic and/or treatment-naïve subjects. (14, 15) Headaches,&#xD;
      fatigue, and nausea represent the most common adverse drug reactions with Zepatier.3,4 Other&#xD;
      drug-related adverse events have included arthralgia, insomnia, diarrhea, dizziness, pyrexia,&#xD;
      and asthenia. (14, 15) Drug-related serious adverse events are uncommon, but include allergic&#xD;
      reactions, possible adverse interactions with other medications, or elevated liver enzymes.&#xD;
      In past Zepatier trials, the majority of the adverse events were reversible. These adverse&#xD;
      events are usually mild or moderate events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage in our study (100/50 mg daily) is a commonly attainable dose in clinical practice.&#xD;
      Zepatier has shown to be safe for subjects with chronic kidney disease or who are on&#xD;
      hemodialysis. Less than 1% of Zepatier is excreted renally. In Merck's C-SURFER, a phase 1&#xD;
      randomized, controlled Zepatier trial, subjects with advanced kidney disease tolerated the&#xD;
      drug well for the required 12 weeks without dose adjustments. (16) Zepatier trials have&#xD;
      demonstrated a 94-100% success rate achieving HCV RNA levels of &lt;15 IU/ml after 12 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment (SVR-12) among genotype 1 HCV patients. (14, 15) This is a prospective cohort phase&#xD;
      IV study using multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of hepatitis C in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients. Hemodialysis centers will be used to deliver all HCV related care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the selected collaborative hemodialysis centers in&#xD;
      Philadelphia. In addition to the standard of care (SOC), all subjects with CHC will be&#xD;
      evaluated for HCV DAA therapy: review of clinical records, assessment of the degree of liver&#xD;
      fibrosis using FibroScan, baseline HCV virological tests, HIV and HBV screening, etc.&#xD;
      Baseline and follow-up laboratory tests and FibroScan imaging will be performed at the&#xD;
      Einstein lab or an alternative laboratory if requested by the patient. Baseline clinical&#xD;
      evaluation and follow up focused H/P will be done by the nephrologist at the dialysis unit..&#xD;
      The study coordinator is a MATCH-D navigator and is responsible for compiling supporting&#xD;
      documents for HCV DAA treatment request and fax it to a designated fax number (to mimic&#xD;
      faxing to the payers in real world scenario). Local specialty pharmacy pharmacist (also a&#xD;
      part of the MATCH-D group) will be responsible for providing hepatitis C treatment education&#xD;
      to approved patients, ensure delivery of DAA therapy and monitoring for any drug related&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATCH-D group will comprise of a study coordinator, study investigators, nephrologist,&#xD;
      specialty pharmacy pharmacist, and dialysis unit . The group will meet weekly to review cases&#xD;
      and provide recommendations on diagnosis, DAA selection and assist with HCV treatment This&#xD;
      study will be divided to 3 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Training study team, dialysis center clinical staff (Quarterly refresher)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identifying hepatitis C patient and evaluation for treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment and follow up Phase 1: Training study team and dialysis center clinical staff&#xD;
           education All collaborative hemodialysis centers coordinator and the study team will be&#xD;
           educated for HCV screening, work-up, treatment and study protocol in the first month of&#xD;
           study. There will be refresher course every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Identifying hepatitis C patient and evaluation for treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient Screening a. Every dialysis patient will be offered HCV screening every 6 months&#xD;
           as standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. HCV Ab with reflex HCV viral load will be ordered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient Identification&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients will be assessed for positive HCV Ab and detectable viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Nephrologist will notifythe patient with the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Nephrologist will have the patient complete and sign HIPAA form.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Nephrologist will email patient information to the study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Study coordinator is expected to keep composite record (including the above&#xD;
                results) of all identified patients until enrollment. This record will be utilized&#xD;
                at the Multidisciplinary Meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Informed consent will be obtained by the study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Basic demographic information will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient evaluation for treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Complete blood work and FibroScan imaging will be conducted at Einstein lab or an&#xD;
                alternative laboratory if requested by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Study coordinator is expected to ensure patients have all testing completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Study coordinator will ensure all patients are tested for FibroScan imaging using&#xD;
                the portable FibroScan® 530 Compact system. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will enroll approximately 71 compensated cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic, Genotype 1&#xD;
      and 4, HCV patients who are currently on hemodialysis. Non-invasive test will be used to&#xD;
      determine the presence or absence of cirrhosis. All excluded CHC patients will receive&#xD;
      standard of care. Patients who have decompensated cirrhosis or hepatoma will be referred to&#xD;
      the hepatology clinic and receive care by the hepatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits There will be 4 study visits in our study. Subjects may be asked to come early&#xD;
      before dialysis session to have physical examination or Fibroscan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      During screening period, the following procedures and activities will be performed at&#xD;
      hemodialysis center after the informed consent is signed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review medication list&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review laboratory data Baseline study • First laboratory tests will be performed at the&#xD;
           Einstein lab or an alternative laboratory if requested by the patientand include: • CBC,&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  FibroScan&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test at screening visit.&#xD;
                Phase 3: Treatment and follow up 1. Treatment a. MATCH-D group will review and&#xD;
                discuss identified CHC patients and determine those appropriate for DAA therapy&#xD;
                through the dialysis center, and those who require referral to Liver Center based&#xD;
                on work-up (e.g. decompensated cirrhosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
                i. Patients appropriate for dialysis center treatment and agreeable to treatment&#xD;
                will be enrolled in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                b. Meeting to occur weekly c. Study coordinator will notify the nephrologist, who&#xD;
                saw patient, by email of the meeting decision. Subsequently, the nephrologist&#xD;
                should notify patient of the decision and a) refer to hepatology if needed or b)&#xD;
                explain need for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                d. Prescription along with pertinent information (e.g. lab results, fibrosis stage,&#xD;
                etc.) will be compiled and sent to local specialty pharmacy by the study&#xD;
                coordinator for all enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
                e. Specialty pharmacy will:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Provide education to patients about prescribed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Identify potential drug interactions and notify team.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Oversee delivery of medications. Provide refill reminders to patients or&#xD;
                     dialysis center staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Monitor medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. Keep &quot;database&quot; that is accessible to study coordinator and MATCH-D study&#xD;
                     group Specialty pharmacy will be the investigational pharmacy who is&#xD;
                     expertised in HCV care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiation treatment with Zepatier All subjects will be provided with a 28-day supply of the&#xD;
      study drug and instructed to begin treatment once all tests are done. The study coordinator&#xD;
      will call the patient to ensure treatment has begun for HCV with Zepatier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with any scientific protocol, safety will be considered before treating the patients. The&#xD;
      MATCH-D team will evaluate the patient's overall condition and make a judgment on whether&#xD;
      initiating treatment is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zepatier for 12 weeks or 16 weeks ± Ribavirin will be used to treat HCV genotype 1, 4 in our&#xD;
      patients and will be supplied by Merck &amp; Co.Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods The data will be collected using an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed with&#xD;
      Stata 14.0 (Statacorp., College Town, TX). Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize&#xD;
      the demographic characteristics. Screening rates, treatment rates, and treatment lag (time&#xD;
      from detection to treatment submission) will be calculated. Categorical variables will be&#xD;
      compared using chi square or fischer's exact test whereas continuous variables will be&#xD;
      compared using student's t-test. SVR rates will also be compared with historical controls. P&#xD;
      value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power/Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power of 0.8 with a p-value of 0.05 were used a priori for sample size calculation. As was&#xD;
      shown in C-SURFER trial recently, SVR of 99% was attained in chronic kidney disease patients&#xD;
      including those on dialysis. Accepting a non-inferiority margin of 5% and similar expected&#xD;
      SVR in our cohort, the sample size was calculated to be 71 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits The subjects will get clinical benefits as the HCV treatment can prevent&#xD;
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the future. This study also has a potential to&#xD;
      speed up treatment evaluation and the subjects may get the treatment faster.&#xD;
