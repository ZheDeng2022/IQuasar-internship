      Introduction: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common endocrine malignancy. It&#xD;
      presents low recurrence rates (2-5%) and the consensus of DTC recommends long-term follow-up,&#xD;
      without a definition of maximum follow-up time. The use of Telehealth is a strategy that aims&#xD;
      to optimize the transition of care for patients from tertiary care to primary health care,&#xD;
      helping to follow up these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the impact of the care transition between specialized care and primary&#xD;
      health care of patients with DTC using telemedicine solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design / Patients: Randomized clinical trial. Patients with DTC with excellent response&#xD;
      (without evidence of disease) after initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions / Outcomes: Patients will be randomized to follow-up in face-to-face&#xD;
      consultations in tertiary care or transfer of care to primary care with support from the&#xD;
      Telehealth Center of Rio Grande do Sul. After 18 months, all patients will be evaluated, the&#xD;
      primary outcome being DTC recurrence rate. Outcomes related to quality of life and use of the&#xD;
      health system will also be evaluated. Both follow-up strategies are expected to be&#xD;
      equivalent, making it possible to optimize the use of the health system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most frequent malignant neoplasm of the endocrine&#xD;
      system, accounting for approximately 95% of the cases of carcinomas in this system. DTC is&#xD;
      considered to be an indolent behavioral neoplasm with low rates of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      (mean survival in 10 years from 93 to 98%), being one of the malignancies with a greater&#xD;
      chance of cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the use of the initial treatment response, called &quot;dynamic risk&#xD;
      classification&quot;, has been advocated in order to better estimate the risk of unfavorable&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with DTC. Using this classification, the recurrence rate in the&#xD;
      contemporary CDT cohorts has been shown to be very low, at a household of 1-5%. In a cohort&#xD;
      of our center, which evaluated 786 patients, the recurrence rate in the group of 357 patients&#xD;
      classified as excellent response after the initial treatment was 2.8%, and none of these&#xD;
      patients presented structural relapse (median follow-up of 4 years). Thus, it is possible to&#xD;
      affirm that most of the patients classified as having an excellent response after initial&#xD;
      treatment are permanently free of disease. However, the main consensus on the management of&#xD;
      DTC recommends long-term follow-up, not defining the maximum follow-up time. This follow-up&#xD;
      consists of consultations in specialized centers (preferably with endocrinologists),&#xD;
      laboratory tests (TSH, thyroglobulin and antithyroglobulin antibody) and imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Brazil, the health network is characterized by the heterogeneity of hospital structures&#xD;
      regarding the incorporation of technologies and service complexity, with a concentration of&#xD;
      financial resources and specialized personnel in large cities and regional imbalance. Within&#xD;
      this context, specialized outpatients with high complexity face overcrowding (of patients&#xD;
      already under follow-up) and restricted access (to patients in need of follow-up). In this&#xD;
      sense, transferring the care of follow-up patients in specialized hospitals to primary care&#xD;
      level in their place of origin to maintain follow-up brings benefits to individuals and the&#xD;
      system as a whole. The structure of referral of patients to the different levels of care in&#xD;
      the Brazilian public health system occurs through the reference and counter-referral system,&#xD;
      a fundamental point to guarantee the accessibility, universality, and integrality of care. It&#xD;
      is understood as a counter-referral to a primary care level, with a lower degree of&#xD;
      complexity, and should be the health unit closest to the patient's home. Facilitating&#xD;
      mechanisms of reference and counter-reference processes are fundamental to guarantee the&#xD;
      principle of integrality, adequate patient care and rational use of resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the formats for developing health care support and continuing education activities are&#xD;
      teleconsulting, which are consultations recorded and performed among workers, health&#xD;
      professionals and managers, through telecommunication instruments, with the purpose of&#xD;
      clarifying doubts about clinical procedures, health actions and issues related to the work&#xD;
      process. It is known that this type of systematic intervention based on practice is one of&#xD;
      the most effective ways to promote permanent health education. The use of telehealth, through&#xD;
      teleconsulting, for cases referred by primary care physicians to tertiary services is a&#xD;
      strategy that aims to qualify and reduce referral lists for other medical professionals.&#xD;
      Likewise, the use of telehealth emerges as a counter-referral strategy for patients already&#xD;
      served by tertiary care for primary care units, ensuring patient and physician security of&#xD;
      adequate management and assisted return for tertiary care, when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 472 patients with a diagnosis of DTC consecutively attended at the thyroid&#xD;
      clinic of the Hospital de Clínicas of Porto Alegre and who presented excellent response to&#xD;
      the initial treatment will be invited to participate in the study, and then randomized to two&#xD;
      follow-up strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group: patients will remain in care at the HCPA thyroid disease outpatient&#xD;
           clinic;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention group: outpatient discharge with telehealth support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with definitive postoperative hypoparathyroidism and/or postoperative vocal cord&#xD;
      paralysis requiring tracheostomy will be excluded. All patients will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      study team after completing 18 of follow-up. Clinical, laboratory (TSH, thyroglobulin and&#xD;
      antithyroglobulin antibody) and imaging (cervical ultrasonography) for DTC relapse will be&#xD;
      evaluated in this follow-up visit. The primary endpoint will be the DTC recurrence rate. This&#xD;
      will be divided into biochemistry (when there are only signs of disease in laboratory tests)&#xD;
      and structural (when demonstrated by clinical or imaging examination). Outcomes related to&#xD;
      quality of life and use of the health system will also be evaluated. Both follow-up&#xD;
      strategies are expected to be equivalent in relation to DTC recurrences, potentially enabling&#xD;
      optimization of the use of the health system.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will be evaluated by the study team after completing 18 months of follow-up for this outcome. The presence of recurrence may be identified as a structural disease (evaluated by clinical examination and cervical ultrasound) or biochemical (evaluated by laboratory tests -thyroglobulin and antithyroglobulin antibody levels measurement). Both types of recurrence will be classified as an outcome.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life evaluated by SF-36 questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be evaluated by SF-36 questionnaire. The Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) is a 36-item scale constructed to survey health status and quality of life and taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health.&#xD;
The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
