    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate if patients' personality could be considerate as&#xD;
      predictive factor of quality of life after the establishment of continuous infusion of&#xD;
      dopaminergic treatments to observe if there are predictive personality's profiles of specific&#xD;
      therapeutic response (Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or&#xD;
      continuous infusion).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease leads to quality of life degradation, especially at level of motor&#xD;
      complications. Second line treatment can be proposed to patients. There are deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation and two treatments by continuous perfusion: subcutaneous apomorphine infusion and&#xD;
      intrajejunal infusion of levodopa-carbidopa. These treatments allow improvement of&#xD;
      end-of-dose akinesia, dyskinesia, and a diminution of treatments per os. Nonetheless, they&#xD;
      also lead to some side effects and complications. Currently, there are no scientific data to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of these two techniques on motor and non-motor symptoms. Choice is made&#xD;
      according to the profile of the patient mainly based on side effects risks, and&#xD;
      practitioner's habits. There are still no predictive factors clearly defined to judge of the&#xD;
      best efficacy of these treatments according to the patients. Moreover, in an additional study&#xD;
      named PSYCHO-STIM, the investigator have discovered that personality can be a predictive&#xD;
      factor of quality of life amelioration 1 year after deep brain stimulation. It's why the&#xD;
      investigator would like to test personality as a predictive factor of therapeutic response&#xD;
      after both continuous perfusions that are available for the patients. Thus, patients&#xD;
      beginning a treatment by subcutaneous apomorphine infusion or intrajejunal infusion of&#xD;
      levodopa-carbidopa will be included. The investigator will evaluate their personality with&#xD;
      the questionnaire &quot;TCI&quot; (Temperament and Character Inventory) and the investigator will&#xD;
      assess their quality of life (PDQ-39), looking for the percentage of amelioration 6 months&#xD;
      after the treatment by continuous infusion started. As secondary criteria, depression (HAMD),&#xD;
      anxiety (HAMA), apathy (LARS), motility (MDS-UPDRS) and clinic severity (CGIS) will also be&#xD;
      accessed before the treatment change and six months later.&#xD;
