  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary aspergillomas are a common cause of recurrent hemoptysis which may be moderate to&#xD;
      severe in 2 to 50 % of cases and may be life threatening. Surgical resection, though&#xD;
      curative, may not be feasible in significant number of patients and also associated&#xD;
      significant post op complications. Bronchial artery embolisation (BAE) is effective for acute&#xD;
      control of hemoptysis, however recurrences may occur in upto a quarter of subjects over a 1&#xD;
      year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspergilloma is caused by a fungus hence systemic antifungals seem appropriate choice.&#xD;
      However the fungus only partially touch the walls of the cavities containing them and rarely&#xD;
      come into contact with the bloodstream. This is the major reason why the systemic&#xD;
      administration of antifungal agents is ineffective in eradicating the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If surgical resection is not a treatment option to control recurrent hemoptysis, instillation&#xD;
      of antifungal agents in an aspergilloma cavity could be considered(QoE II).The instillation&#xD;
      of antifungal directly into the cavity (intra-cavitatory) containing aspergilloma brings the&#xD;
      drug in contact with the fungus. Thus may lead to antifungal action and shrinkage or complete&#xD;
      disappearance of aspergilloma. This can be achieved either by percutaneous route or&#xD;
      bronchoscopically. Percutaneous approaches have been investigated however they can sometimes&#xD;
      cause fungal spread in thoracic space resulting in fungal empyema which should be carefully&#xD;
      avoided. Endobronchial instillation of antifungals have been investigated and found to be&#xD;
      safe and effective in controlling hemoptysis, however published data comprise of case reports&#xD;
      or small case series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently we have published our experience of intrabronchial voriconazole in aspergilloma&#xD;
      among 82 patients and found to be safe and effective in hemoptysis control, with transient&#xD;
      post procedure cough as an adverse effect with no major serious adverse events. Multiple&#xD;
      small studies and case reports have published the safety and efficacy of voriconazole.&#xD;
      However, a quality data in the form of randomized controlled trial (RCT) is not there.&#xD;
      Therefore, we planned this RCT to assess the efficacy of intrabronchial voriconazole in&#xD;
      inoperable aspergilloma.&#xD;

      Primary Objective : To compare the percentage of patients achieving reduction in hemoptysis&#xD;
      in intrabronchial voriconazole with standard medical therapy group vs standard medical&#xD;
      therapy alone for inoperable symptomatic pulmonary aspergilloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the percentage of patients who have complete cessation of hemoptysis after 3&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the percentage of patients having recurrence of hemoptysis during 3 months&#xD;
           follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the severity of hemoptysis during recurrence in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the change in size of aspergilloma after 3 - 6 months following last&#xD;
           intrabronchial voriconazole instillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare the percentage of patients who need BAE during anytime till 3 - 6months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To compare the percentage of patients with symptomatic improvement in Dyspnea On&#xD;
           Exertion, Cough and recurrent respiratory infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients: 30 patients in each arm (Intrabronchial voriconazole with Standard&#xD;
      medical therapy vs Standard medical therapy alone)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design : Prospective Randomized control study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosages of drug - 400 mg iv preparation of Voriconazole every week for 4 sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of follow-up - 3-6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Methodology: Patients with aspergilloma who presented with hemoptysis will be screened&#xD;
      for inclusion in the study. Diagnosis of aspergilloma will be based on characteristic&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) features with microbiological or serological evidence of Aspergillus&#xD;
      (Aspergillus specific Ig G). The patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be taken&#xD;
      informed consent and randomized into one of the two arms of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Will receive 400 mg of Intrabronchial Voriconazole every week for 4 weeks along with&#xD;
      standard medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Will receive standard medical therapy alone (hemostatics, anti-tussive and others as&#xD;
      deemed appropriate by treating physician)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in arm 1 will undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) following standard protocol&#xD;
      under local anesthesia with supplemental oxygen and continuous hemodynamic monitoring. After&#xD;
      identifying the segmental/sub-segmental bronchus of interest (as identified by CT) or cavity&#xD;
      (if visible) the study drug voriconazole, will be instilled. The bronchoscope will be kept&#xD;
      wedged for 60 seconds to prevent back leakage of the solution and then slowly withdrawn&#xD;
      without applying suction. The patient will be kept in right or left lateral position&#xD;
      (depending on the side of involvement) for the next 20 minutes. Following this patients will&#xD;
      be observed for 48 hours for cessation of hemoptysis before discharge. The procedure will be&#xD;
      done on day 1 of each week for 4 weeks in arm 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standard medical treatment for hemoptysis including appropriate&#xD;
      positioning, airway protection, blood product transfusions, antitussives, tranexamic acid,&#xD;
      and antimicrobial therapy as clinically indicated. BAE shall be offered to all patients if&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild hemoptysis shall be defined as &lt; 50 ml in 24 hrs, moderate hemoptysis as 50-200 ml in 24&#xD;
      hrs and massive hemoptysis as 200-600 ml in 24 hrs or any amount causing hemodynamic&#xD;
      compromise/threatening ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records will be reviewed regarding demographics, primary etiology leading to fibrocavitary&#xD;
      disease, duration and severity of hemoptysis/ other constitutional symptoms, extent of&#xD;
      disease (unilateral, bilateral, associated pleural or parenchymal changes), simple vs complex&#xD;
      aspergilloma. Size of index aspergilloma. The number of patients requiring emergency or&#xD;
      hospital admission due to recurrent hemoptysis, and subsequent treatment details will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up for 3-6 months. During follow up patients will be assessed&#xD;
      for symptoms and severity, successful cessation of hemoptysis, requirement of BAE due to&#xD;
      persistent or increased hemoptysis, number of sessions required for symptomatic&#xD;
      improvement/cessation of hemoptysis, hemoptysis-free interval, recurrence of hemoptysis will&#xD;
      be noted. Pre and post procedure CT scans (low dose limited CT through aspergilloma) will be&#xD;
      compared by an independent radiologist blinded to the clinical outcome. Size of index&#xD;
      aspergilloma shall be determined by addition of maximum diameter of largest length and width&#xD;
      of the visible lesion. CTs shall be compared for documenting change in the size of index&#xD;
      aspergilloma and decrease/disappearance of the cavity. On the basis of these parameters,&#xD;
      aspergillomas will be described as no interval change, increased or decreased aspergilloma&#xD;
      size, or disappearance and emptying of the cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes in the form of reduction/cessation of hemoptysis, decrease in size of aspergilloma,&#xD;
      overall symptomatic improvement and mortality shall be recorded.&#xD;
