  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a hospice&#xD;
      decision aid among a diverse population of older adults at multiple stages of illness (Aim 1)&#xD;
      and to determine the preliminary efficacy of the hospice decision aid on decision quality,&#xD;
      hospice knowledge, and values-concordance (Aim 2). By testing the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of a novel hospice PtDA in a diverse population of older adults,&#xD;
      additionally the study will simultaneously explore barriers to PtDA implementation in both an&#xD;
      outpatient primary care and inpatient palliative care setting. The study will also gather&#xD;
      sufficient pilot data to support a subsequent effectiveness/implementation trial and thus&#xD;
      address the absence of quality of SDM interventions for end-of-life care decision-making.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Ottawa Acceptability Scale (OAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability will be measured using the Ottawa Acceptability Scale (OAS). PtDA acceptability evaluates the comprehensibility of components of a PtDA including: its length, pace, amount of information, balance in presentation of information about options, and overall suitability for decision making. The OAS scale consists of 8 questions on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from poor to excellent) with additional yes/no questions. The OAS will be assessed at 2 time points.</description>

    <measure>Decision Aid Feasibility Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week FU Only</time_frame>
    <description>This survey will evaluate how the patients used the PtDAs, including when they used the PtDA and whether they used of the video, paper or both. These are opened questions:&#xD;
After you received the decision aids, when did you view them?&#xD;
Did you view the paper version, the video version or both?&#xD;
Which did you prefer? Why?&#xD;
Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the decision aids?</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hospice Knowledge Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Hospice Knowledge Scale is a 23-item true/false scale. Each question is worth 1 point with 23 being the highest score. Hospice Knowledge will be assessed at 2 time points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Decision Conflict Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Decision Conflict Scale is a 16-item with statements answered on a 5-point likert scale (ranging from not at all confident to very confident). DCS will be measured at 2 time points</description>
