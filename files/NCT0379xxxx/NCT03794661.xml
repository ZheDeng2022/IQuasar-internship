  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to characterize the clinical performance of&#xD;
      Abbott's Clinician Programmer Electrode Screening Mode tool (InformityTM tool) in programming&#xD;
      InfinityTM deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or&#xD;
      essential tremor (ET).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multi-center, post-market clinical&#xD;
      investigation designed to evaluate Abbott's Informity tool for Infinity DBS systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical investigation will be conducted at up to 5 centers in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 patients will be enrolled in the study. Of these subjects, up to 20 will have PD and&#xD;
      up to 20 will have ET. All patients will have received Infinity DBS systems prior to&#xD;
      enrolling in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects participating in this clinical investigation will be followed for 6 months. The&#xD;
      expected duration of enrollment is 6 months. The total duration of the clinical investigation&#xD;
      is expected to be 18 months. The primary and secondary endpoints will be evaluated when all&#xD;
      subjects have completed their 6 month follow-up visits&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Therapeutic window size between side effect amplitude and therapeutic benefit amplitude</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Change in therapeutic window size at the informity programming visit compared to baseline. The therapeutic window measures the difference between the stimulation amplitude that generates side effects and the stimulation amplitude that generates therapeutic benefit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Therapeutic electrical energy delivered (TEED)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Change in therapeutic electrical energy delivered (TEED) at the informity programming visit compared to baseline. TEED measures the total energy delivered by the deep brain stimulation system over an arbitrary period of time, and is determined by the programmed stimulation parameters and measured system impedance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor symptom evaluation for PD or ET subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 3 and 6-month follow-up visits</time_frame>
    <description>Change in UPDRS III for PD subjects or Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale for ET subjects at 3- and 6-month follow-up visits compared to baseline. UPDRS III scores range from 0 to 56, and lower scores indicate less severe motor symptoms. Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale scores are expressed as a percentage of the total score possible (range of 0% to 100%), and lower scores indicate less severe motor symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life assessment for PD subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 3 and 6-month follow-up visits</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life measurement as measured by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)-39 for PD subjects or QUEST for ET subjects at the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits compared to baseline. PDQ-39 scores range from 0 to 100, and lower scores reflect a better quality of life.</description>
