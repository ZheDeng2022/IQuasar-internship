  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present trial will consist of the treatment of 20 pediatric and adult Hematopoietic Stem&#xD;
      Cell Transplantation (HSCT) recipients or immunocompromised participants diagnosed with&#xD;
      opportunistic Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections with virus-specific, antigen-selected T-cells.&#xD;
      CMV-specific T-cells will be isolated from donor leukapheresis products using the CliniMACS®&#xD;
      Prodigy. Prior studies on transfer of CMV specific T-cells have been shown to be safe and&#xD;
      efficacious in the treatment of CMV infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main trial objective is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of CMV-specific T-cell&#xD;
      transfer in adult and pediatric participants suffering from CMV infections or reactivation&#xD;
      following HSCT or due to other immunocompromised states (e.g.; primary immunodeficiency,&#xD;
      cytotoxic therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for one year.&#xD;

        Donor Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The original donor will be the first choice as source of T cells. If the original donor is&#xD;
        not available for donation (such as NMDP donor, cord blood unit, or related donor not&#xD;
        available) of peripheral mononuclear cells or does not meet all donor eligibility criteria&#xD;
        (including donor selection criteria based on University of Wisconsin - Madison Standard&#xD;
        Operating Procedures for the selection of allogeneic donors), alternative related donors&#xD;
        will be selected, with preference for those who have full HLA matching in 6/6 loci over&#xD;
        those with partial HLA matching (≥ 3/6 HLA loci).&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All donors must be ≥ 18 years old, available, CMV IgG positive, eligible and capable&#xD;
             of undergoing a single standard 2 blood volume leukapheresis. If original HSCT donor&#xD;
             is not available, CMV IgG negative or ineligible, a CMV IgG positive fully matched or&#xD;
             haploidentical family donor will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Related donors must be at least partially HLA compatible, matching with recipient in&#xD;
             at least 3/6 HLA loci (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 will be considered for this).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Donors must be CMV IgG seropositive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Donors must show CMV T-cell activation after incubation with MACS GMP PepTivator&#xD;
             Peptide Pools of CMV pp65 before undergoing leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Donor must meet the criteria for donor selection defined in the Standard Operating&#xD;
             Procedures of the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics Stem Cell Transplant&#xD;
             Program and in FACT standards.&#xD;
