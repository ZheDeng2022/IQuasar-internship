      The objective of this study is to ascertain the safety, tolerability and performance of the&#xD;
      RaniPill capsule in healthy volunteers&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RaniPill device is capsule-like ingestible device, which injects a microneedle containing&#xD;
      a microtablet (payload/drug) into the intestinal wall. This is a phase I (first-in-human)&#xD;
      open-label study in healthy volunteers. In 6 subjects, 100 mcg of octreotide (Sandostatin®)&#xD;
      will be injected intravenously. Three versions of the RaniPill (A, B and C) will be tested in&#xD;
      additional three groups of healthy volunteers (N=20 each). All devices will contain 100 mcg&#xD;
      of octreotide. The bioavailability of octreotide will be determined by serial blood sampling&#xD;
      in Groups A and B. Performance of the RaniPill will be evaluated in all groups.&#xD;
