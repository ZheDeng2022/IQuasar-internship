  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, Hispanic Spanish-speaking individuals are not receiving culturally appropriate&#xD;
      diabetes care. Lack of knowledge impacts several areas of type 2 diabetes (T2D) management,&#xD;
      including healthy eating and being physically active in Hispanic Spanish-speaking&#xD;
      individuals. Use of diabetes technology is on the rise, however, many technologies do not&#xD;
      provide Spanish-language options. A flash glucose monitoring (FGM) system is now available in&#xD;
      both English and Spanish. Research suggests that use of FGM results in improved clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. Furthermore, increased number of FGM scans are associated with improved clinical&#xD;
      outcomes such as decreased A1C and improvements in BG time in range. Our preliminary work&#xD;
      indicates that Hispanics (1) are willing to use diabetes technology, such as FGM, if it&#xD;
      supports Spanish language and (2) in English-speaking populations, but not specific to the&#xD;
      Hispanic Spanish-speaking population, FGM supports biobehavioral change. Further, our work,&#xD;
      and the work of others, indicate Hispanic individuals desire for peer interactions to relate&#xD;
      and understand the variables that impact T2D. Interaction with online peer support&#xD;
      communities is associated with increased knowledge, receipt of emotional support, and&#xD;
      improved glycemic levels. These results suggest that education and support to increase use&#xD;
      and understanding of FGM will lead to improved clinical and behavioral outcomes.&#xD;

      Currently, Hispanic Spanish-speaking individuals are not receiving culturally appropriate&#xD;
      diabetes care. Lack of knowledge impacts several areas of type 2 diabetes (T2D) management,&#xD;
      including healthy eating and being physically active in Hispanic Spanish-speaking&#xD;
      individuals. Use of diabetes technology is on the rise, however, many technologies do not&#xD;
      provide Spanish-language options. A flash glucose monitoring (FGM) system is now available in&#xD;
      both English and Spanish. FGM involves wearing an interstitial glucose sensor that is placed&#xD;
      on the upper arm and a reader. When an individual wants to check their glucose level, they&#xD;
      waive or scan the reader over their sensor and a glucose history, current glucose level, and&#xD;
      projected glucose trend is displayed. Research suggests that use of FGM results in improved&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. Furthermore, increased number of FGM scans are associated with improved&#xD;
      clinical outcomes such as decreased A1C and improvements in BG time in range. Our preliminary&#xD;
      work indicates that Hispanics (1) are willing to use diabetes technology, such as FGM, if it&#xD;
      supports Spanish language and (2) in English-speaking populations, but not specific to the&#xD;
      Hispanic Spanish-speaking population, FGM supports biobehavioral change. Further, our work,&#xD;
      and the work of others, indicate Hispanic individuals desire for peer interactions to relate&#xD;
      and understand the variables that impact T2D. Interaction with online peer support&#xD;
      communities is associated with increased knowledge, receipt of emotional support, and&#xD;
      improved glycemic levels. These results suggest that education and support to increase use&#xD;
      and understanding of FGM will lead to improved clinical and behavioral outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the uses, benefits, and limitations of online peer support in the&#xD;
      context of learning how to use diabetes technology, such as FGM. Hispanic, Spanish speaking&#xD;
      individuals are at high risk for T2D and associated morbidity and mortality. Hispanics are&#xD;
      more likely to die from diabetes compared to Caucasian counterparts. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to address gaps in diabetes care for Hispanic individuals by conducting a pilot trial&#xD;
      of an online peer support intervention using an online peer facilitator to augment the use of&#xD;
      FGM. The online peer facilitator will be Hispanic and bilingual in English and Spanish with&#xD;
      substantial knowledge of diabetes and FGM. Our intervention is culturally appropriate to&#xD;
      address the biobehavioral and biopsychosocial needs of Hispanic individuals. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate the additional support provided by the online peer facilitator will&#xD;
      encourage healthy eating habits and physical activity behaviors in Hispanic individuals with&#xD;
      T2D. Our research team is experienced with community-based participatory research in both&#xD;
      diabetes online peer support communities and Hispanic populations using technology to support&#xD;
      T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examining online peer support communities to augment diabetes care in Hispanic Spanish&#xD;
      speaking individuals is a promising, exciting, and innovative area of research that has not&#xD;
      yet been explored. This proposed study contains several novel components. First, using online&#xD;
      peer support communities is low-cost and easily accessible, making this intervention more&#xD;
      translatable in the clinical setting while adding to the toolkit that already exists for&#xD;
      diabetes care. Second, using FGM in a population not using insulin is forward thinking.&#xD;
      Empowering people with their own glucose data, early in the course of their diabetes, may&#xD;
      change the trajectory of diabetes management. The research team received PCORI&#xD;
      pipeline-to-proposal funding (tiers I-III) to develop a research question via a community&#xD;
      advisory board (CAB) in partnership with the diabetes online peer support community. The CAB&#xD;
      included researchers, clinicians, and people with diabetes, both English and Spanish&#xD;
      speaking. This study will address important questions identified by people affected by&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 Explore the relationship between engagement in an online peer support intervention with&#xD;
      clinical and behavioral outcomes in Hispanic, Spanish speaking individuals with T2D using&#xD;
      flash glucose monitoring for 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method. A one group, pre-post evaluation of Hispanic, Spanish speaking individuals (N=43)&#xD;
      recruited from a health center in Utah.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Time-in-range (average glucose level and number of minutes in&#xD;
      70mg/dl-180mg/dl in last 10 days of the study minus average glucose level and number of&#xD;
      minutes in 70mg/dl-180mg/dl for 10 days baseline) between baseline and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Change in A1C from baseline to 12 weeks. Online peer support engagement&#xD;
      (measured by survey and Facebook activity), Frequency of FGM scans. Change in self-reported&#xD;
      self-management behaviors, self-efficacy and quality of life between baseline and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. Increased engagement in the online peer support intervention will be associated&#xD;
      with improved clinical, behavioral and psychosocial outcomes after 12 weeks of FGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of an online peer support intervention for&#xD;
      Hispanic Spanish speaking individuals with T2D to learn how to use flash glucose monitoring&#xD;
      to make changes to meal and activity choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method. Qualitative and quantitative analysis for measures of use of and satisfaction with&#xD;
      flash glucose sensors, eligible participant acceptance of flash glucose sensors, and dropout&#xD;
      rates, including causes for drop out, and online peer support engagement through platform&#xD;
      analytics. A semi-structured interview will be conducted with participants at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention explore their experiences during engagement with the online peer support&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. Online peer support engagement will be associated with satisfaction with FGM and&#xD;
      number of daily scans.&#xD;
