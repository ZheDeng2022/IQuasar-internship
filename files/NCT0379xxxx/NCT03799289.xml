  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine two approaches for improving long-term weight loss&#xD;
      success. All participants will receive a 12-week, in-person standard behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      program followed by either 12 weeks of yoga instruction or 12 weeks of cooking/dietary&#xD;
      education instruction (determined via randomization procedures). Assessments of weight,&#xD;
      physical activity, dietary behaviors, and psychosocial factors will occur at baseline, 3, and&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral weight loss (WL) programs result in clinically significant weight losses; however&#xD;
      rates of long-term WL maintenance are poor. Previous studies suggest that long-term WL&#xD;
      success may require an enhanced ability to overcome physiological and hedonic urges to eat&#xD;
      and an improved capacity for dealing with life stressors, negative mood states, and food&#xD;
      cravings. Thus interventions which target stress reduction and reduce the tendency to use&#xD;
      food as a coping strategy for aversive experiences may offer a protective effect against&#xD;
      dietary lapses; thereby improving long-term WL outcomes. Yoga is a mind-body intervention&#xD;
      which reduces stress and improves overall physical and psychological well-being and offers&#xD;
      promise for strengthening the psychological skill set needed for maintaining important&#xD;
      weight-related behaviors long-term. The physical and cognitive skills practiced within yoga&#xD;
      target multiple underlying psychological processes (e.g., mindfulness, distress tolerance)&#xD;
      which could reduce emotional eating, improve dietary choices, and enhance one's ability to&#xD;
      tolerate food cravings or hedonic urges to eat. While yoga is an effective treatment approach&#xD;
      for other chronic health conditions, it has not been examined as a potential intervention for&#xD;
      improving long-term WL outcomes. Within the context of the obesity field, yoga has been&#xD;
      viewed as a mode of exercise and not necessarily as a mind-body intervention approach (as is&#xD;
      the case in other fields). Thus, given the lower caloric expenditure of yoga in comparison to&#xD;
      many forms of aerobic exercise, the effect of yoga on important weight- related processes and&#xD;
      behaviors has not been examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of this study are to examine the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      implementing yoga within a weight management program. Secondary aims focus on examining the&#xD;
      impact of yoga, relative to a cooking/dietary education intervention (matched for contact&#xD;
      time) on important psychological constructs (perceived stress, mindfulness, and distress&#xD;
      tolerance) and weight. Sixty women with overweight or obesity will be randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      12-week standard behavioral WL program, followed by either 12 weeks of group-based yoga or 12&#xD;
      weeks of cooking/dietary information classes. Both groups will be instructed to self-monitor&#xD;
      and achieve the dietary and aerobic exercise goals throughout the 24-week program. Primary&#xD;
      assessments will occur at baseline and weeks 12 and 24.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Perceived Stress (Measured Via the Perceived Stress Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from 12 to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived stress scores range from 0-40, with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Change in perceived stress was calculated as follows: 24-week perceived stress score minus 12-week perceived stress score. Negative change scores indicate that perceived stress was reduced as a result of the yoga or cooking/dietary education intervention whereas positive scores indicate that perceived stress increased.</description>

    <description>The Distress Tolerance Scale is a 15-item measure designed to assess one's perceived ability to tolerate emotional distress. Total scores range from 15-75 with higher scores on the scale indicate greater levels of distress tolerance. Change in distress tolerance was calculated as follows: 24-week distress tolerance score minus 12-week distress tolerance score.

        <description>Perceived stress scores range from 0-40, with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Change in perceived stress was calculated as follows: 24-week perceived stress score minus 12-week perceived stress score. Negative change scores indicate that perceived stress was reduced as a result of the yoga or cooking/dietary education intervention whereas positive scores indicate that perceived stress increased.</description>

        <description>The observation subscale assesses the ways we use our sensory awareness. It involves how we see, feel, and perceive the internal and external world around us and select the stimuli that require our attention and focus. Mindfulness subscale scores range from 8-40, with higher scores indicating greater mindfulness. Change in mindfulness subscale was calculated as follows: 24-week mindfulness subscale score minus 12-week mindfulness subscale score. Negative change scores indicate that mindfulness was reduced as a result of the yoga or cooking/dietary education intervention whereas positive scores indicate that mindfulness increased.</description>

        <title>Change in Distress Tolerance (Assessed Via the Distress Tolerance Scale)</title>
        <description>The Distress Tolerance Scale is a 15-item measure designed to assess one's perceived ability to tolerate emotional distress. Total scores range from 15-75 with higher scores on the scale indicate greater levels of distress tolerance. Change in distress tolerance was calculated as follows: 24-week distress tolerance score minus 12-week distress tolerance score. Negative change scores indicate that distress tolerance decreased as a result of the yoga or cooking/dietary education intervention whereas positive scores indicate that distress tolerance increased.</description>
