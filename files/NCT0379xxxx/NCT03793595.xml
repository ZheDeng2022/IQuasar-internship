  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare energy expenditure and metabolic outcomes of a novel&#xD;
      seated battle rope protocol to seated maximal ramped upper extremity ergometry protocol in&#xD;
      subjects with spinal cord injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Subjects will be scheduled for the first testing session after informed consent is&#xD;
           obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects will fill out PAR-Q+ to determine readiness for exercise testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects will fill out additional Questionnaire to determine exclusion based on medical&#xD;
           history&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prior to the physical performance tests, each participant will be fitted with a mask&#xD;
           that covers their face. This mask will be attached to a portable metabolic analyzer&#xD;
           (Cosmed k5b). This device collects the air expired which allows for energy expenditure&#xD;
           to be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Each participant will be fitted with the proper sized mask that is connected to a small&#xD;
           computer and power source supported at their upper back.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A polar heart rate strap monitor will be worn around the chest. As the participant&#xD;
           performs the physical performance tests, the Cosmed K5b measures the amount of carbon&#xD;
           dioxide and oxygen from each breath to estimate the amount of energy expended during&#xD;
           this task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session one:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to beginning the testing, testing procedure will be explained to participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects blood pressure will be measured, and if a subject's average systolic or&#xD;
           diastolic blood pressure exceeds 140 or 90 mmHg, respectively, the subject will be asked&#xD;
           to return another day to perform the study procedures. If the blood pressure remains&#xD;
           elevated on either one of these measures, the subject will be excused from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects will then perform either the upper extremity cycling protocol or battle ropes&#xD;
           protocol first. The other will be performed on the subsequent testing date&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If the subject is performing the upper extremity arm cycle test:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each subject will perform a modified version of the ramped YMCA cycle test using a Upper&#xD;
           Extremity Cycle Ergometer and a portable metabolic cart&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The ramped version of the YMCA cycle test will begin with the subject cycling at a&#xD;
                workload of 25 watts at a rate of 60 revolutions per minute (rpm) using a metronome&#xD;
                set at 120 beats per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each subject will pedal for 3-minute warm-up period at the 10 watts with the 60 rpm&#xD;
                rate. After the 3-minute warm-up, the workload will increase by 10 watts each&#xD;
                minute starting at 25 watts at pedal rate of 60 rpm until the subjects meets the&#xD;
                termination criteria as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The portable metabolic cart is an instrument that measures levels of expired gases from&#xD;
           the subject as he or she exercises that will be analyzed and displayed on a computer&#xD;
           monitor. The subject will wear a face mask during the test. A PolarÂ® heart rate monitor&#xD;
           will be worn on the chest, directly on the skin of each subject to obtain heart rate&#xD;
           measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The goal is for the participant to perform the ramped exercise test using the protocol&#xD;
           described above and below until one or more of the following occurs, at which time the&#xD;
           test will be terminated: the participant requests the test to be stopped, a respiratory&#xD;
           exchange ratio of &gt;1.0 is achieved, or one of the following physiologic and/or&#xD;
           subjective signs/symptoms are present:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  i. A drop in systolic blood pressure &gt;10 mmHg with the increasing work load&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ii.An increase in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt;250 mmHg or 115 mmHg,&#xD;
                respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  iii.Reported chest or arm pain (angina)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  iv.Severe shortness of breath, cyanosis, pallor, lightheadedness, dizziness or&#xD;
                confusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  v.No increase in heart rate despite increase in work load&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  vi.Complaints of severe fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  vii.The subject is unable to maintain a pedal rate of 50 rpm&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  viii.Borg 6-20 Perceived exertion scale score &gt;=20&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The subjects heart rate will be recorded at the last 15-30 seconds of each minute during&#xD;
           the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Each subject's blood pressure will be taken before the test commences, every three&#xD;
           minutes during the test and once the test procedure is terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The Borg 6-20 perceived exertion scale will be used to monitor the participant's rating&#xD;
           of perceived exertion every three minutes during the test. If at any time during the&#xD;
           test, the subject rates his or her perceived level of exertion at a level of 20, the&#xD;
           test will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Session two: will occur at least three days after session one.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. If the subject is performing the sitting battling rope:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a. A 10 to 15-minute demonstration will be provided to each subject on the proper&#xD;
                use of the battling ropes using the double arm swing technique&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  b. A 30 foot,1.5-inch diameter rope that will be anchored to a large weight&#xD;
&#xD;
                c. Each subject will position him/herself in their manual wheelchair with feet flat&#xD;
                on the floor or foot rests at shoulder width apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  d. The subject's manual wheelchair will be secured using dumbbells and weights as&#xD;
                pictured below&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  e. A 3-minute warm up period will be given to each subject prior to the exercise&#xD;
                protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
                f. The subject will be fitted with a face mask attached to the metabolic cart as&#xD;
                described previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
                g. On command, each subject will begin swinging the rope as previously described in&#xD;
                the seated position using the double arm swing technique for 15 seconds at a&#xD;
                cadence of 100 beats/ minutes with a 45 second rest break repeated 10 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
                h. At each rest break, the subject will be asked to rate his/her levels of exertion&#xD;
                using the Borg 6-20 as described previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  i. If a subject cannot complete the double arm rope swing at the required cadence&#xD;
                or if the rope does not undulate through the entire length of the rope towards the&#xD;
                anchor point, or if the subject requests to stop, the protocol will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Reusable Mask cleaning procedure, performed following each participant&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a. the following parts must be 1) rinsed with warm soapy water, 2) soaked in&#xD;
                CITADEX solution 15 minutes, 3) rinsed with cool running water again, 4) laid out&#xD;
