  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventral hernia repair may be associated with significant postoperative pain. Pain is&#xD;
      typically managed with intravenous (IV) and oral medications that come with their own risks,&#xD;
      such as nausea, constipation, sedation, respiratory depression, increased bleeding, and/or&#xD;
      kidney or liver dysfunction. The quadratus lumborum peripheral nerve block has been shown to&#xD;
      produce anesthesia of the anterior abdominal wall in the T7 to L1 distribution. This study&#xD;
      aims to evaluate if the addition of the quadratus lumborum peripheral nerve block (QLB) can&#xD;
      improve pain scores, decrease the need for IV and oral pain medications, and/or speed the&#xD;
      patients' return to normal activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current trends in perioperative pain management stress the importance of multimodal analgesia&#xD;
      in an effort to reduce the dependence on opioid pain medications. Adverse effects of opioids&#xD;
      include sedation, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, constipation, itching, and, most&#xD;
      importantly, the potential for tolerance and abuse. Multimodal analgesia attempts to utilize&#xD;
      multiple techniques, including medications and nerve block procedures, to improve&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia. Improved postoperative pain control can enable an earlier return to&#xD;
      normal activities for patients, not only improving patient satisfaction, but also reducing&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and adverse effects of opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 350,000 to 500,000 ventral hernia repairs are performed each year in the United&#xD;
      States. Surgeries completed laparoscopically are typically performed on an outpatient basis,&#xD;
      allowing patients to return home the same day of surgery and treat their pain independently&#xD;
      with prescribed pain medications. Utilization of a regional anesthesia technique may allow&#xD;
      prolonged numbing of the nerves postoperatively and decrease the reliance on oral pain&#xD;
      medications. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks have been shown to decrease pain scores&#xD;
      and opioid consumption following ventral hernia repair. Quadratus lumborum (QL) blocks are&#xD;
      newer iterations of the TAP block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently three types of the QL block, all targeting the thoracolumbar fascia&#xD;
      surrounding the quadratus lumborum muscle. Injection within this fascial plane may allow&#xD;
      local anesthetic spread into the paravertebral space, possibly explaining why QL blocks have&#xD;
      been mapped from the T7 to T12/L1 dermatomes, covering the entire abdomen. Conversely, TAP&#xD;
      blocks have been mapped from the T10 to T12/L1 dermatomes, only covering the abdomen below&#xD;
      the umbilicus. In the first, the Quadratus lumborum 1 block (QL1), the local anesthetic is&#xD;
      injected within the fascial plane lateral to the QL muscle. In the second, the Quadratus&#xD;
      lumborum 2 block (QL2), the needle trajectory is more superficial, and the local anesthetic&#xD;
      is injected along the posterior border of the QL muscle. The third iteration, the Quadratus&#xD;
      lumborum 3 block (QL3), involves a deeper, transmuscular approach with injection along the&#xD;
      anterior border of the QL muscle. Our study would utilize the QL2 approach as the dermatomal&#xD;
      distribution of the QL1 and QL2 blocks appear to be more widespread than the QL3 block, and&#xD;
      the QL2 block may be a safer approach due to the more superficial angle of the needle 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the QL block has been shown to have a longer duration of analgesia when&#xD;
      directly compared to the TAP block. A study of pediatric lower abdominal surgery revealed&#xD;
      improved pain scores and parent satisfaction with care in the QL group compared to TAP block.&#xD;
      This improvement persisted to the 24 hour mark. In a study of postoperative pain following&#xD;
      cesarean delivery, pain scores were improved and opioid consumption decreased with the QL&#xD;
      block compared to the TAP block. The differences were not significant at the 1 and 6 hour&#xD;
      marks, but were significant at the 12, 24 and 48 hour marks, highlighting the analgesic&#xD;
      duration of the QL block 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the QL block using the QL2 approach on recovery&#xD;
      profile after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, a commonly performed surgery, as well as&#xD;
      contribute to the understanding of the block and its distribution of anesthesia.&#xD;
