  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the how well linaclotide works in treating patients with stages&#xD;
      0-3 colorectal cancer. Linaclotide is a very small protein that binds to receptors on&#xD;
      intestinal cells and makes them secrete water and salt.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether, compared to placebo, linaclotide administered as a single oral daily&#xD;
      dose x 7 days, induces a pharmacodynamics (PD) effect on cGMP levels, based on biopsy samples&#xD;
      of adenomas or resected colorectal adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare Ki-67, guanylin levels and GUCY2C expression in adenomas and cancers versus&#xD;
      normal tissue after exposure to linaclotide or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To confirm the safety and tolerability of linaclotide in sporadic adenoma and cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of linaclotide on pathway-specific biomarkers&#xD;
      relevant to GUCY2C signaling (i.e. VASP phosphorylation), markers of mutant APC-beta-catenin&#xD;
      signaling (beta-catenin levels, beta-catenin nuclear localization, axin levels, c-Myc levels,&#xD;
      guanylin levels, PCNA expression), based on adenoma/cancer and normal mucosa biopsy samples&#xD;
      obtained by endoscopy following linaclotide or placebo exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive linaclotide orally (PO) daily on days 1-7 and undergo standard of&#xD;
      care colonoscopy or surgery on day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II. Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-7 and undergo standard of care colonoscopy&#xD;
      or surgery on day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 14.&#xD;
