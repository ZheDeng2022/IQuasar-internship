    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a non-invasive communication&#xD;
      aid for BPAP/CPAP masks. This study also looks to determine the potential impact of the&#xD;
      device on patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the individuals that interact with&#xD;
      the device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a crucial tool used to treat respiratory&#xD;
      distress and failure, especially when patients have acute worsening (also called&#xD;
      exacerbations) of emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study will&#xD;
      randomize patients who use Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to a control&#xD;
      (non-functioning) and intervention (functioning) device to determine how well speech can be&#xD;
      understood while wearing the device.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Mask on-communicator on-20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be collected using audio recording - accuracy of single word selection (spoken by patient -&gt; selected by partner). The communicator will be attached to the BPAP/CPAP mask. A list of single words will be provided to the patient. Each single word may be read aloud by patient up to two times. The partner must then select the read word out of a list of twelve possible words.</description>

    <time_frame>Mask on-communicator on-20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be collected using audio recording - accuracy of sentence selection (spoken by patient -&gt; transcribed by partner). The communicator will be attached to the BPAP/CPAP mask. A list of 5-word through 15-word sentences will be provided to the patient. Each sentence may be read aloud by patient up to two times. The partner must transcribe each sentence on a standardized form.</description>

    <measure>Speech Transmission Index (STI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Mask on with communicator on (20 min)</time_frame>
    <description>STI is a numeric representation measure of communication channel characteristics whose value varies from 0 = bad to 1 = excellent.On this scale, an STI of at least 0.5 is desirable for most applications.</description>

    <description>Number of subjects that found that the device significantly improved noninvasive ventilation (NIV) comfort was calculated and reported. Assessment of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) comfort was conducted using Likert Scale Score on clarity of communication on a symmetric seven-level agree-disagree scale.</description>
