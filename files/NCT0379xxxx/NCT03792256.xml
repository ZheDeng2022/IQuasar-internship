    <textblock>
      AINV18P1 is a Phase 1 study where palbociclib will be administrated in combination with a&#xD;
      standard re-induction platform in pediatric relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and&#xD;
      lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL). LL patients are included because the patient population is rare&#xD;
      and these patients are most commonly treated with ALL regimens. The proposed palbociclib&#xD;
      starting dose for this study will be 50 mg/m^2/day for 21 days.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      palbociclib administered in combination with re-induction chemotherapy in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with relapsed B- or T-lineage ALL/LL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and describe the toxicities of palbociclib administered on this schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib in pediatric patients with relapsed&#xD;
      B- or T-lineage ALL/LL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of palbociclib in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy for children with relapsed ALL/LL within the confines of a Phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the biologic activity of palbociclib in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Palbociclib PO (or via NG-tube) once daily on Days 1-21; Intrathecal&#xD;
      cytarabine (IT ARAC) on Day 1, Doxorubicin IV push or infusion over 1-15 min on Day 4;&#xD;
      Prednisone or prednisolone PO on days 4-31; Vincristine IV push or mini-bag per institutional&#xD;
      policy on Days 4, 11, 18, and 25; and Pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on Days 5, and 18. If&#xD;
      CNS3 leukemia is present, patients receive Intrathecal Triple Therapy (ITT) on days 4, 11,18,&#xD;
      and 25. If CNS1 or 2 disease status, patients receive Methotrexate (IT MTX) on Days 18 and&#xD;
      32. Patients known to be CNS3 at study entry may receive ITT on Day 1 rather than IT ARAC.&#xD;
      Treatment will be given for one cycle, 32 days, in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients and/or their parents or legally authorized representatives must sign a&#xD;
             written informed consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to&#xD;
             institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to risks of&#xD;
             fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal/human studies. Based on the&#xD;
             mechanism of action, palbociclib may be expected to cause fetal harm if used during&#xD;
             pregnancy. Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarche. Males or&#xD;
             females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use&#xD;
             an effective contraceptive method for the duration of study therapy. Women of&#xD;
             reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at&#xD;
             least 3 weeks after the last dose of palbociclib. Males with female partners of&#xD;
             reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 3&#xD;
             months after the last dose of palbociclib. Animal data suggests that palbociclib may&#xD;
             affect male fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prednisone or methylprednisolone for ≤ 120 hours (5 days) may be administered for&#xD;
             cytoreduction up to 24 hours prior to the start of protocol therapy and as treatment&#xD;
             for allergic reactions or for physiologic replacement/stress dosing of hydrocortisone&#xD;
             for documented adrenal insufficiency. Corticosteroids are not allowed for other&#xD;
             indications. If used to modify immune adverse events related to prior therapy, ≥ 14&#xD;
             days must have elapsed since last dose of corticosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents are not eligible [except&#xD;
             patients receiving hydroxyurea, which may be continued until 24 hours prior to start&#xD;
             of protocol therapy].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently receiving drugs that are strong inhibitors and/or inducers&#xD;
             of CYP3A4 or sensitive CYP3A4 substrates and CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow&#xD;
             therapeutic range are not eligible. Strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 are&#xD;
             prohibited from 14 days prior to enrollment to the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving cyclosporine, tacrolimus or other agents to prevent&#xD;
             graft-versus-host disease post bone marrow transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to swallow intact capsules or liquid. Patients that are unable&#xD;
             to swallow oral medications may receive palbociclib through an NG tube. G tube&#xD;
             administration is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have an uncontrolled infection defined as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fever above 38.2°C within 48 hours of study enrollment with clinical signs of&#xD;
                  infection. Fever that is determined to be due to tumor burden is allowed if&#xD;
                  patients have documented negative blood cultures for at least 48 hours prior to&#xD;
                  enrollment and no concurrent signs or symptoms of active infection or hemodynamic&#xD;
                  instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A positive fungal culture within 30 days of study enrollment or active therapy&#xD;
                  for presumed invasive fungal infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients may be receiving IV or oral antibiotics to complete a course of therapy&#xD;
                  for a prior documented infection as long as cultures have been negative for at&#xD;
                  least 48 hours and signs or symptoms of active infection have resolved. For&#xD;
                  patients with c. difficile diarrhea, at least 72 hours of antibacterial therapy&#xD;
                  must have elapsed and stools must have normalized to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active viral or protozoal infection requiring IV treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to have one of the following concomitant genetic syndromes: Down&#xD;
             syndrome, Bloom syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, Fanconi anemia, Kostmann syndrome,&#xD;
             Shwachmann syndrome or any other known bone marrow failure syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the&#xD;
             safety monitoring requirements of the study.&#xD;
