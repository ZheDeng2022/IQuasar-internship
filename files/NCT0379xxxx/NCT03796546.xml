  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-site, study to evaluate the diagnosis rate of DNA and RNA sequencing of&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid for identification of pathogens directly in patients who have already had&#xD;
      a spinal tap to evaluate for infection and were found to have a pleocytosis. Diagnostic rate&#xD;
      and clinical utility of concurrent standard testing will be compared to diagnostic rate and&#xD;
      clinical utility of DNA and RNA sequencing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IDbyDNA, Inc. has developed a robust sequencing reference database for viruses, bacteria,&#xD;
      fungi and parasites and developed novel analysis methods to analyze next-generation (NGS)&#xD;
      sequencing data to rapidly identify infectious agents. This technology suite, known as the&#xD;
      Explify™ platform, holds the promise to improve patient care and efficiently guide provider&#xD;
      treatment planning for those suffering from infectious disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PIPSEC trial, developed by pediatric physicians specializing in genomic medicine, is&#xD;
      intended to facilitate the acquisition of high quality and clinically annotated biospecimens&#xD;
      for the purpose of research discovery. This project intends to advance metagenomics,&#xD;
      microbial genetics, bioinformatics and data analytics, for pathogen detection utilizing&#xD;
      cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) specimens to contribute to the diagnosis of infectious agents&#xD;
      impacting the central nervous system among pediatric patients. Clinically annotated specimens&#xD;
      will facilitate continued development and validation of the Explify test and its clinical&#xD;
      utility for providers treating central nervous system (CNS) infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess clinical utility of the Explify test compared to&#xD;
      concurrent standard of care testing to identify pathogens from CSF fluid within a pediatric&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;

        This project will enroll children who are having an evaluation for central nervous system&#xD;
        (CNS) infection and have already had a lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
        to evaluate for infection and host immune response. As such enrolled patients will be&#xD;
        undergoing an evaluation for suspected meningitis, encephalitis, ventriculitis and VP shunt&#xD;
        infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients in whom there is CSF remaining after standard testing has been obtained and who&#xD;
        meet the other inclusion criteria will be approached for enrollment in the study.&#xD;
