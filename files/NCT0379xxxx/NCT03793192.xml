  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled pilot study involving patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) recently discharged from the hospital will evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of a home-based mobile-health supported physical activity promotion program.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deconditioning is common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and&#xD;
      has been associated with poor outcomes (e.g. difficulty breathing). Pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      (PR) initiated shortly after hospital discharge following a COPD exacerbation has been shown&#xD;
      to improve some of these outcomes. However, for many patients, access to PR programs is&#xD;
      limited due to environmental, physical, and psycho-social reasons. Home-based physical&#xD;
      activity promotion, combined with education and social support, could help to overcome some&#xD;
      barriers to access and have been shown to be effective in populations with mild to moderate&#xD;
      COPD. However, home-based interventions have not been tested in patients recovering from COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations, a group for whom solutions to safely promote physical activity are urgently&#xD;
      needed. In PACE2 up to 64 adult participants with a physician diagnosis of COPD will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomized to one of two groups: physical activity promotion intervention or&#xD;
      enhanced usual care. Participants will be enrolled while hospitalized and randomization will&#xD;
      occur approximately 7 days after hospital discharge. All participants will be provided&#xD;
      self-management educational materials and community resources both prior to hospital&#xD;
      discharge and during a home visit shortly after hospital discharge. For the participants&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention group, physical activity promotion will start following&#xD;
      randomization and continue for 12 weeks. These participants will also receive a personalized&#xD;
      plan to attend pulmonary rehabilitation, a guideline-recommended program for patients with&#xD;
      COPD recovering from exacerbations. The primary endpoint will be the change in physical&#xD;
      activity (mean daily step counts over 1 week) over time using repeated measures over the 12&#xD;
      weeks of the study.&#xD;
