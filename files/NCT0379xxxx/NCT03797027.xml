  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the first choice for the treatment of ≥ 2cm renal&#xD;
      stones. The positions of PCNL includes supine, prone and lateral. PCNL has been performed in&#xD;
      my center for nearly twenty years. The prone position is routinely used. Generally speaking,&#xD;
      an abdominal cushion is used to raise the abdominal in the prone position, in order to&#xD;
      provide an adequate exposure of kidney, increase the intercostal space, decrease the mobility&#xD;
      of kidney and lower the risk of pleura injury. However, there is no consensus and criterion&#xD;
      on the height of abdominal cushion. With largely increased PCNL procedures and various BMI,&#xD;
      precise evaluation of abdominal cushion is needed. In the preliminary work, the investigators&#xD;
      measured the sunken height of waist of 100 patients in the prone position without a abdominal&#xD;
      cushion. The results showed that the mean BMI of 100 patients was 23.45 (16.79-36.98) and the&#xD;
      range of sunken height of waist was 2-7 cm. Therefore, the investigators are planning to&#xD;
      conduct a randomized controlled study to compare the safety and efficacy among no cushion&#xD;
      group, 5 cm cushion group and 10 cm cushion group. To clarify the relationship between height&#xD;
      of abdominal cushion and BMI, the nurse could prepare the appropriate cushion the day before&#xD;
      surgery, which would decrease operating time and accelerate postoperative recovery.&#xD;

      1. Background Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the first choice for the treatment of&#xD;
           ≥ 2cm renal stones.The positions of PCNL includes supine, prone and lateral. PCNL has&#xD;
           been performed in my center for nearly twenty years. The prone position is routinely&#xD;
           used. Generally speaking, an abdominal cushion is used to raise the abdominal in the&#xD;
           prone position, in order to provide an adequate exposure of kidney, increase the&#xD;
           intercostal space, decrease the mobility of kidney and lower the risk of pleura injury.&#xD;
           However, there is no consensus and criterion on the height of abdominal cushion. With&#xD;
           largely increased PCNL procedures and various BMI, precise evaluation of abdominal&#xD;
           cushion is needed. In the preliminary work, the investigators measured the sunken height&#xD;
           of waist of 100 patients in the prone position without a abdominal cushion. The results&#xD;
           showed that the mean BMI of 100 patients was 23.45 (16.79-36.98) and the range of sunken&#xD;
           height of waist was 2-7 cm. Therefore, the investigators are planning to conduct a&#xD;
           randomized controlled study to compare the safety and efficacy among no cushion group, 5&#xD;
           cm cushion group and 10 cm cushion group. To clarify the relationship between height of&#xD;
           abdominal cushion and BMI, the nurse could prepare the appropriate cushion the day&#xD;
           before surgery, which would decrease operating time and accelerate postoperative&#xD;
           recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Purpose To investigate effects of different height of abdominal cushion on prone PCNL,&#xD;
           in terms of intraoperative parameters. Our study could provide high quality of evidences&#xD;
           on making criteria of perioperative nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Design 3.1 Participant： A single randomized controlled study 3.2 Number of cases： 180&#xD;
           patients who are candidates for PCNL will be enrolled in this study. By 1:2 simple&#xD;
           random sampling technique, patients will be assigned to 60-patient no cushion PCNL and&#xD;
           120-patient cushion PCNL (60-patient for 5 cm cushion and 60-patient for 10 cm cushion).&#xD;
&#xD;
           *(Assuming SFR (1 month after procedure) with cushion PCNL of 90% and expected rate of&#xD;
           70% with no cushion PCNL, the sample size for each group are calculated as 120 and 60&#xD;
           [power &gt; 0.90 with a type I error rate &lt; 0.05.]&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Candidate:&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Included criterion：&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Willing to receive PCNL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Aged 18-70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Normal renal function&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ASA scoreⅠ to Ⅱ 4.2 Excluded criterion：&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Uncorrected coagulopathy and active urinary tract infection (UTI)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who underwent transplant or urinary diversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Congenital abnormalities. 4.3 Excluded from the study after inclusion Patients will&#xD;
                be excluded from the study if the undergoing standard PNL/mini-perc have purulent&#xD;
                fluid in the initial puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with positive preoperative urine culture should be treated with suitable&#xD;
           antibiotics based on the culture sensitivity result for at least 72 h before PCNL.&#xD;
           Patients who have negative urine culture should receive a single dose of broad spectrum&#xD;
           antibiotic prophylaxis just prior to the procedure. Patients who are going to receive&#xD;
           PCNL would get a envelope including a randomized number and consent letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Surgical technique&#xD;
&#xD;
           Under general anaesthesia, each patient is initially placed in the lithotomy position,&#xD;
           and a 5 Fr or 6Fr ureteral catheter is inserted to the kidney and fixed with a 16 Fr&#xD;
           Foley catheter. Then the patient is turned to the prone position. An abdominal cushion&#xD;
           is used according to the randomized number. The choice of using C-arm fluoroscopic or&#xD;
           ultrasonography guidance or a combination fashion for the percutaneous access was made&#xD;
           at the discretion of the treating urologist. The length of the needle from skin to the&#xD;
           collecting system is measured to ensure that the length of dilator is appropriate. No&#xD;
           patient underwent bilateral simultaneous PCNL and patients with bilateral stones&#xD;
           underwent surgery 4 weeks apart. The access tract is dilated with a fascial dilator from&#xD;
           8F up to 18F. The investigators defined access to the collecting system as gaining entry&#xD;
           to the targeted urinary system and desired calix. For some complex cases, when indicated&#xD;
           requiring multiple tracts, additional tracts were created in the same session. The stone&#xD;
           was fragmented by pneumatic lithotripsy or Holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy through 8/9.8F&#xD;
           semirigid ureteroscope (Richard Wolf, Germany). The large fragments were extracted with&#xD;
           a forceps and small fragments were flushed out with an endoscopic pulsed perfusion pump.&#xD;
           A silastic nephrostomy tube was placed at the end of procedure and a 4-6Fr double&#xD;
           pigtail ureteral stent was left for 2 weeks after operation. X-ray check for residual&#xD;
           stone fragments is also performed at the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients were candidates for the tubeless procedure only when the following strict&#xD;
           conditions were met: single percutaneous tract, absence of major perforation of&#xD;
           collecting system and bleeding, complete stone clearance assessed by intraoperative&#xD;
           nephroscopy and fluoroscopy at the end of the procedure. For a tubeless procedure, the&#xD;
           flank was compressed for 5 min. Patient was monitored for postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for the 2 groups -demographic characteristics, time of puncture and dilation, site of&#xD;
      target calix, site of access, S.T.O.N.E score, hemoglobin drop, postoperative pain, duration&#xD;
      of procedure, hospital stay, cases of tubeless, complications (modified Clavin system), stone&#xD;
      clearance (SFR of postoperative day 1 and 1 month follow-up) and the need for auxiliary&#xD;
      treatment (for example, re-PCNL, RIRS and ESWL) - are compared.&#xD;
