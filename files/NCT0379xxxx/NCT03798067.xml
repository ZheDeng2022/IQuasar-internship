    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of cardiac surgery, which seriously&#xD;
      affects the postoperative complication rate and mortality of patients.Acute kidney injury&#xD;
      occurs in 5-30% of patients after cardiac surgery, but severe acute kidney injury requiring&#xD;
      dialysis is relatively rare.At present, the diagnosis of AKI is based on serum creatinine&#xD;
      (Scr) or urine volume. However, the changes of serum creatinine value have hysteresis, and&#xD;
      the increase of serum creatinine level lags behind kidney injury for 48 ~ 72 h.Some drugs can&#xD;
      also affect creatinine levels.Urine volume is also affected by many factors.Due to the lack&#xD;
      of sensitivity and specificity of SCr, it is very important to find and adopt new early AKI&#xD;
      markers.Kidney is an important metabolic organ of human body. Different from cerebrovascular&#xD;
      system, kidney lacks automatic regulation ability and is easily affected by perfusion&#xD;
      flow.Previous experiments have shown that placing a multi-plane esophageal probe into the&#xD;
      human stomach through the esophagus can monitor the changes of left renal blood flow before,&#xD;
      during and after cardiovascular surgery extracorporeal circulation, and has good&#xD;
      repeatability, which may become an effective means to monitor renal blood flow during&#xD;
      cardiovascular surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, this study intends to use esophageal ultrasound as a means to monitor renal&#xD;
      blood flow, observe the changes of intraoperative renal hemodynamic indexes, and use KDIGO (&#xD;
      Kidney Disease:Improving Global Outcomes)as the standard of renal injury to explore the&#xD;
      correlation between intraoperative hemodynamic changes and postoperative AKI, providing a new&#xD;
      perspective for the pathophysiological study of AKI after cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;

      The mechanism of acute kidney injury after CPB has not been fully elucidated, and current&#xD;
      studies suggest that the main mechanisms are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) endogenous/exogenous nephrotoxic substances;(2) metabolic factors: mainly reflected in&#xD;
      the preoperative status of patients, such as obesity, low body weight, etc.;(3) hemodynamic&#xD;
      factors: hemodynamic instability is an important mechanism for further renal injury process&#xD;
      such as ischemia reperfusion, which is mainly reflected in: a.preoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      hypotension: cardiogenic shock caused by cardiac insufficiency and low cardiac&#xD;
      displacement;Non-cardiogenic shock (vasoactive drugs/allergies/postoperative bleeding);b.&#xD;
      hemodynamic instability of intraoperative intervention: deep anesthesia, intraoperative blood&#xD;
      loss, CPB-related intraoperative low perfusion (long CPB time, low circulation flow, low mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure in CPB), embolic release (atherosclerotic emboli/air emboli), aorta and&#xD;
      distal arteriotomy;(4) neurohumoral system factors: hormones such as epinephrine,&#xD;
      norepinephrine, renin and thyroxine change to varying degrees during cardiac surgery and CPB,&#xD;
      thus affecting the body state and systemic blood vessels;(5) inflammation and oxidative&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney is an important metabolic organ of human body. Different from cerebrovascular system,&#xD;
      kidney lacks automatic regulation ability and is easily affected by perfusion flow.For&#xD;
      patients at high risk of postoperative acute kidney injury, appropriate intraoperative&#xD;
      perfusion may reduce the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal ultrasound was used as a means of monitoring renal blood flow to observe the&#xD;
      changes in intraoperative renal hemodynamic indexes. Meanwhile, KDIGO was used as the&#xD;
      standard for renal injury. AKI was divided into two groups according to whether postoperative&#xD;
      AKI occurred, and the correlation between intraoperative hemodynamic changes and&#xD;
      postoperative AKI in the two groups was discussed.It provides new ideas for the early&#xD;
      diagnosis of postoperative acute kidney injury.&#xD;
