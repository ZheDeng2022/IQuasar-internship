      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effects of additional oral nutritional supplement containing&#xD;
      β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) on thigh muscle mass in elderly subjects with pre-frail&#xD;
      status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effects of additional oral nutritional supplement containing&#xD;
           β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate on physical performance, nutrition status, and quality of&#xD;
           life in elderly subjects with pre-frail status&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the safety profile of additional oral nutritional supplement containing&#xD;
           β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate in elderly subjects with pre-frail status&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a controlled, open-label, parallel-group, randomized, investigator initiated study to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of oral nutritional supplement containing&#xD;
      β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (Ensure® Plus Advance) on thigh muscle mass and physical&#xD;
      performance in elderly subjects with pre-frail status. The study is planned to enroll a total&#xD;
      of 70 elderly subjects with pre-frail status defined by Fried's criteria with modified cutoff&#xD;
      values as suggested by Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) for Asian population. The&#xD;
      subject to be enrolled will meet the phenotypic definition of pre-frail for one or two of&#xD;
      five phenotypic criteria: weakness as measured by grip strength, slow walking speed, low&#xD;
      level of physical activity, self-reported exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent and the confirmation of eligibility, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized into the HMB or control group in a 1:1 ratio. All enrolled subjects will be under&#xD;
      standard care, which is mainly dietary consultation for healthy aging by dietitians to assure&#xD;
      sufficient dietary protein intake in all subjects. Subjects assigned to the HMB group will&#xD;
      consume 2 bottles of Ensure® Plus Advance per day for 12 weeks additionally, while subjects&#xD;
      assigned to the control group will not receive any placebo or active control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, subjects will be requested for a total of 4 visits at the clinical site,&#xD;
      including screening visit, Visit 1 for randomization, Visit 2 at Week 6, and Visit 3 at Week&#xD;
      12 (end of study/EOS). The telephone visit will be scheduled at Week 3 and Week 9 to&#xD;
      follow-up with subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thigh muscle mass of all subjects will be evaluated by MRI. The physical performance of&#xD;
      subjects will be determined by short physical performance battery (SPPB) and handgrip&#xD;
      strength. The nutrition status of subjects will be measured by MNA® -SF and nutrition&#xD;
      biomarkers, including serum albumin, pre-albumin, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, vitamin B12, and&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP). SF-36v2™ Health Survey will be used to evaluate the quality of life&#xD;
      of subjects. The safety profile of Ensure® Plus Advance will be determined by monitoring the&#xD;
      adverse event (AE/SAE) during the study period. Blood samples of each subject will be&#xD;
      collected at Visits 1, 2 and 3 for analysis of nutrition biomarkers. There will be a total of&#xD;
      approximately 30 mL of blood to be collected from each subject during the study period.&#xD;

    <description>Thigh muscle mass (kg) will be measured by MRI and be further analyzed at Visits 1 and 3 (EOS/ET). The data assessed at Visit 1 will be the baseline. The summary results of thigh muscle mass (kg) at the baseline and subsequent visits, and the change from baseline will be summarized descriptively by groups.&#xD;
Changes from baseline within each group will be tested by paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a significance level of 0.05. The change from baseline between groups will be analyzed by two sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</description>

    <description>Previous studies suggest that protein supplementation is an effective dietary strategy to decrease frailty by positively influence the weight loss or sarcopenia in elderly.&#xD;
Lean body mass includes all body tissue except fat and is well recognized to be associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Oral nutrition supplements have been shown to increase food intake and body weight, but not lean body mass. In previous studies, β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, which is leucine metabolite, has been shown to enhance protein synthesis and decrease protein degradation leading to increase lean body mass. It showed that β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate supplement with exercise increased lean body mass in health elderly population and improved the physical performance in elderly women.</description>
