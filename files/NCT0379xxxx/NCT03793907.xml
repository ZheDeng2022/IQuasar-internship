    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well strength training works in improving bone health, pain, and&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma. Weekly physical activity may improve bone&#xD;
      recovery, reduce pain, and increase quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I. To assess the feasibility of a 6 month, twice weekly supervised strength training&#xD;
           intervention in patients with multiple myeloma. (Cohort 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  II. To assess the feasibility of a 6 month behavioral intervention to prompt an increase&#xD;
           in weekly physical activity in patient with multiple myeloma. (Cohort 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the adherence rate of patients during a 6 month intervention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the eligibility and recruitment rate for the trial among patients with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Comparison of disease activity parameters, physical activity level, clinical symptoms,&#xD;
      medication, psycho-oncological parameters before, during and after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine factors that may influence a persons' willingness to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Investigate &quot;immune fitness&quot; by frequencies and function of immune cell subsets in&#xD;
      peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHRT 1 (STRENGTH TRAINING): Patients receive a Fitbit to track their physical activity, and&#xD;
      complete an in-person personalized and supervised full-body strength training program over 1&#xD;
      hour twice weekly (BID) up to 52 sessions for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 2 (BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION): Patients receive a Fitbit to track their physical&#xD;
      activity, and complete an unsupervised walking program daily at home, increasing physical&#xD;
      activity stepwise weekly, for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.&#xD;
