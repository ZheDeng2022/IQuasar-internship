      560 patients with non-resectable locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous cell&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomly divided into two groups (SCT510 group and&#xD;
      bevacizumab group) at a 1:1 ratio, and the treatment included combination chemotherapy and&#xD;
      maintenance treatment, followed by follow-up.&#xD;
