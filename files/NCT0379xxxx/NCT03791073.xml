      The investigators recently engineered a novel biomarker discovery approach that is&#xD;
      non-destructive and fully compatible with OMICS profiling as well as routine clinical&#xD;
      procedures (5). The latter approach - termed EXPEL - mines the interstitial tissue fluid that&#xD;
      is the richest source of soluble, undiluted and uncontaminated biomarkers. The method notably&#xD;
      gives access to proteins, metabolites, RNA, DNA and exosomes, thus enabling holistic&#xD;
      biomarker discovery. Owing to its non-destructive nature, EXPEL provides for the first time&#xD;
      both clinicians and researchers with the opportunity to analyze identical material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the conservation liquid used to collect cells and biopsy&#xD;
      after endoscopic ultrasound for pancreatic biopsy could contain the tissue secretome and&#xD;
      permit a comprehensive OMICS analysis of PDAC (all stages confounded) by using a &quot;modified&#xD;
      EXPEL&quot; procedure. These are ideal conditions for EXPEL approach that will additionally to&#xD;
      finding novel biomarkers also shed light on complex network of cancer cell-stroma&#xD;
      interactions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biomarkers that are readily detectable in fluid biopsies are of outmost importance for&#xD;
      diagnosis and prediction of therapeutic response in all cancer patients. Pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an example of a deadly malignancy that is diagnosed very late due to&#xD;
      lack of sensitive and reliable markers [1]. The incidence and mortality of PDAC will double&#xD;
      in the next 15 years, which is unprecedented among all cancer types [2]. Secondary cancer&#xD;
      prevention through early diagnosis of PDAC will therefore be an essential preparedness asset&#xD;
      for facing the immense healthcare burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discovery of diagnostic biomarkers depends essentially on the availability of patient&#xD;
      material ideally collected at different time points during the disease progression (e.g.&#xD;
      early lesion, before treatment and after recurrence). Unfortunately, it is very difficult to&#xD;
      access fresh biopsies from pre-malignant lesions for research purposes. These are needed in&#xD;
      their entirety for histo-pathological evaluation and diagnosis. The ability to use liquid&#xD;
      biopsies (e.g. serum, urine, saliva) brought the promise to circumvent this problem, opening&#xD;
      access to many different biomolecules such as circulating DNA and proteins. However, upon&#xD;
      their release from the tumor, these molecules are diluted up to several billion-fold in blood&#xD;
      with molecular species originating from healthy tissues [3-4]. This hampers de novo discovery&#xD;
      of biomarkers for diagnosing and understanding the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To circumvent these limitations, the investigators recently engineered a novel biomarker&#xD;
      discovery approach that is non-destructive and fully compatible with OMICS profiling as well&#xD;
      as routine clinical procedures (5). The latter approach - termed EXPEL - mines the&#xD;
      interstitial tissue fluid that is the richest source of soluble, undiluted and uncontaminated&#xD;
      biomarkers. The method notably gives access to proteins, metabolites, RNA, DNA and exosomes,&#xD;
      thus enabling holistic biomarker discovery. Owing to its non-destructive nature, EXPEL&#xD;
      provides for the first time both clinicians and researchers with the opportunity to analyze&#xD;
      identical material, while having virtually no disadvantage in their respective tasks. The&#xD;
      investigators have recently shown the ability of our methodology to find new markers in the&#xD;
      context of precious human colorectal cancer samples. Thus, the investigators are convinced&#xD;
      that EXPEL can be successfully applied to pancreatic cancer. In addition, knowing the&#xD;
      important proportion of stroma in PDAC (usually 2/3 of tumor mass), the secretome of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer is expected to be much richer in soluble &quot;communication factors&quot; exchanged&#xD;
      between cancer cells and host tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, most of patients undergo endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration/biopsy of the pancreatic mass to confirm the diagnosis of PDAC. The needle is&#xD;
      rinsed in a conservation liquid Cytolyt® (Methanol 30% et water 50%) and sent to the&#xD;
      pathologists. Microbiopsy are fixed in paraffin then analyzed and liquid is cytofiltrated to&#xD;
      keep potential tumor cells. The remnant Cytolyt® liquid is systematically trashed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is based on the hypothesis that this liquid, previously in contact with&#xD;
      tumoral tissue, could contain the tissue secretome and permit a comprehensive OMICS analysis&#xD;
      of PDAC (all stages confounded) by using a &quot;modified EXPEL&quot; procedure. These are ideal&#xD;
      conditions for EXPEL approach that will additionally to finding novel biomarkers also shed&#xD;
      light on complex network of cancer cell - stroma interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the investigators aim to perform proteomic analysis on the conservation&#xD;
      liquid (Cytolyt) in patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration/biopsy for suspicious pancreatic mass at the CHU de Montpellier between Jan 2018&#xD;
      and Jan 2019.&#xD;
