  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This national Australian study will validate and implement an effective approach to real-time&#xD;
      electronic surveillance of fungal infections in patients with blood cancers using technology&#xD;
      based on artificial intelligence. It will establish metrics for antifungal stewardship&#xD;
      allowing benchmarking of these programs; provide decision support for radiologist&#xD;
      interpretation of chest imaging and improve reporting, audit and feedback practices in&#xD;
      hospitals where these infections are managed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal diseases (IFD) are rare infections that cause a life-threatening pneumonia in&#xD;
      patients with weakened immune systems usually due to cancer chemotherapy and transplantation.&#xD;
      Fungal spores are found in air, water and soil making exposure unavoidable in vulnerable&#xD;
      patients. In developed countries, molds like Aspergillus are the most challenging type of IFD&#xD;
      to diagnose and treat. These infections usually manifest as a culture-negative fungal&#xD;
      pneumonia and account for approximately 300K of the 1.9M cases of IFD globally, but estimates&#xD;
      are not accurate due to an absence of surveillance systems in hospitals where these&#xD;
      infections are managed. Hospitals spend millions on antifungal drugs but are unaware of their&#xD;
      patients affected, the effectiveness of their prevention efforts and hospital outbreaks may&#xD;
      go unnoticed because surveillance, audit and feedback of fungal infections is not occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimising patient outcomes through timely diagnosis and appropriate prescribing of&#xD;
      antifungal drugs is the goal of antifungal stewardship programs. Antifungal stewardship is of&#xD;
      growing importance to hospitals world-wide because antifungal drugs are few in number,&#xD;
      expensive to use and are associated with significant side-effects and drug interactions.&#xD;
      Surveillance, audit and feedback are the cornerstones of antifungal stewardship programs that&#xD;
      ensure patient care is meeting high standards. However, currently hospitals do not have the&#xD;
      mechanisms to detect rare events like fungal infections because it usually presents as a&#xD;
      pneumonia buried among hundreds of imaging scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;fungalAiâ„¢&quot; (fungalAi.com) is a technology based on artificial intelligence (Ai) that uses&#xD;
      existing data in hospitals to make real time surveillance of fungal infections possible and&#xD;
      assist radiologist interpretation of diagnostic imaging. fungalAi does this through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Natural language processing, a computational method of understanding human language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Deep learning based image analysis of diagnostic imaging and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An expert system that integrates clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What will be the impact?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will provide hospitals with the mechanisms for performing real-time surveillance&#xD;
      and audit of fungal infections in blood cancer patients through the innovative use of Ai.&#xD;
      Strengthening antifungal stewardship through real-time surveillance of fungal diseases will&#xD;
      improve patient care by revealing gaps in practice, new patient groups at risk for fungal&#xD;
      infections and reduce inappropriate prescribing of antifungal medications through timely&#xD;
      audit and feedback. The impact of this project will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improved diagnosis and recognition of fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enhanced prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. More appropriate use of antifungal medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FungalAi is a scalable technology that will be validated against active manual surveillance&#xD;
      of fungal infections in a multi-centre Australian clinical trial. The inclusive approach of&#xD;
      fungalAi means that it is of value to many vulnerable patients including neglected groups&#xD;
      like children who are included in this project. FungalAi is tuned for detection of fungal&#xD;
      pneumonia caused by molds because these infections are more diagnostically challenging than&#xD;
      other types of fungal infections. As a result, fungalAi leverages chest computed tomography&#xD;
      imaging because it is a critical diagnostic test that is widely available and performed more&#xD;
      frequently than invasive tests like lung washings or biopsy. Hence fungalAi natural language&#xD;
      processing may miss very rare manifestations like brain infections. Nevertheless, automating&#xD;
      detection of fungal pneumonia and improving radiologist recognition of a rare disease using a&#xD;
      self-improving system based on neural networks is an important step towards improving the&#xD;
      supportive care of patients with cancer. Improving outcomes in cancer is not only about&#xD;
      finding a cure. Reducing the impact of infectious threats like fungal diseases is just as&#xD;
      important and this can now be achieved by integrating artificial intelligence into patient&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
