  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 3 clinical trial has been completed and demonstrated the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      allogeneic islet transplantation in improving glycemic control in Type 1 diabetic patients&#xD;
      using the UIC protocol.The objective in offering expanded access to donislecel (allogeneic&#xD;
      islets of Langerhans for transplant; IND BB-11807) for the treatment of brittle T1D is to&#xD;
      bridge the gap between completed clinical trials and marketing (i.e. approval by the FDA of a&#xD;
      biological license application). Expanded access will allow clinical trial subjects, as well&#xD;
      as patients outside a clinical trial, to receive treatment. New patients participating in the&#xD;
      expanded access protocol are required to meet exclusion and inclusion criteria.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Expanded access to donislecel (allogeneic islets of Langerhans for transplant; IND BB-11807)&#xD;
      is for the treatment of brittle T1D. Brittle T1D is a distinct subset of T1D, representing&#xD;
      the most severe and difficult to manage manifestation of the disease. Standard therapies&#xD;
      (i.e. exogenous insulin injections and insulin pumps) are not sufficient to regulate blood&#xD;
      glucose levels for this subset of patients. Thus, the severity of disease and the lack of&#xD;
      metabolic control that occur despite intensive insulin therapy in brittle T1D patients&#xD;
      defines a patient population whose risk-benefit profile makes them suitable for islet&#xD;
      transplantation. Eligible patients may receive one or several allogeneic pancreatic islet&#xD;
      transplants. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), composed of 3 members who have&#xD;
      training in medicine and/or organ transplantation, will review eligibility and safety data&#xD;
      within 2 weeks after each islet transplantation and every two months thereafter. An&#xD;
      independent monitor, who is knowledgeable about Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and&#xD;
      regulations, monitors the study for compliance with 21 CFR and according to ICH GCP&#xD;
      Guidelines. The UIC Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews safety data annually and on&#xD;
      occurrence of serious adverse events. The principal investigator also reports serious adverse&#xD;
      events to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Success, partial success, and failure&#xD;
      criteria will be the same as indicated in the Phase III clinical trial. Patients will be&#xD;
      closely monitored post-transplant by the UIC clinical team and/or their primary care&#xD;
      physician for safety and efficacy.&#xD;
