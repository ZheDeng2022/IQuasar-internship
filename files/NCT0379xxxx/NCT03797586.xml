  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 70-80% of patients with advanced disease will be affected by moderate to severe&#xD;
      pain. Opioid analgesics represented by morphine and oxycodone are the cornerstone of&#xD;
      cancer-pain management, and recommended for use in the management of moderate to severe&#xD;
      cancer pain according to WHO Cancer Pain Relief Guidelines. One view is that a trial of&#xD;
      systemic opioid therapy should be administered to all cancer patients with pain of moderate&#xD;
      or greater severity regardless of the pain mechanism. Although opioids analgesics do work&#xD;
      well as relieving pain and improving quality of life via their action at opioid receptors in&#xD;
      the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system, they also have powerful&#xD;
      adverse effects. The overall occurrence of opioid-related adverse drug events has ranged&#xD;
      from1.8% to 13.6%. Opioid-induced constipation (OIC), one of the most prevalent adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) in patients receiving opioid analgesics, defined as a change in baseline bowel&#xD;
      habits or defecatory patterns following initiation, alteration, or increase in opioid&#xD;
      therapy. The prevalence of OIC has been estimated to affect 41% of patients with chronic&#xD;
      noncancer pain taking opioids and 94% of cancer patients taking opioids for pain. Unlike many&#xD;
      other opioid-related AEs, OIC is persistent and rarely tolerated. OIC impacts pain control,&#xD;
      patients' quality of life and may cause patients to reduce the dose or discontinue opioid&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to treat gastrointestinal disease&#xD;
      including constipation for thousands of years. Two systematic reviews concluded that&#xD;
      acupuncture can improve spontaneous bowel movements for functional constipation, and our&#xD;
      recent study indicated that electroacupuncture(EA) could increase complete spontaneous bowel&#xD;
      movements and is safe for chronic severe functional constipation. Acupuncture could improve&#xD;
      gastrointestinal function via facilitating gastrointestinal motility. Currently, there is&#xD;
      little detailed information available regarding the acupuncture use for OIC. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of EA for OIC in patients with cancer.&#xD;
