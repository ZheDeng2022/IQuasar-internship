  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial&#xD;
      in subjects with established T1D.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 216 male or female subjects aged 12 to 35 years diagnosed with T1D, as&#xD;
      defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria and meeting enrollment criteria&#xD;
      as follows. Initial enrollment will be restricted to subjects aged 18-35 until an analysis of&#xD;
      data from subjects with 3 months' exposure to drug confirms safety. Upon completion of this&#xD;
      assessment, enrollment will be open without further restrictions for subjects aged 12-35.&#xD;
