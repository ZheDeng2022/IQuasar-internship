    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, single-center, single-dose, two-treatment, two-sequence,&#xD;
      two-period, crossover, comparative study, where each subject was randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      reference or the test formulation in each period of the study (sequences RT or TR), in order&#xD;
      to evaluate if both formulations are bioequivalent.The study was conducted in multiple&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to establish if two formulations of sotalol are bioequivalent.&#xD;
      The test formulation is Sotalol Tablets, 160 mg (Pharmtechnology LLC, Belarus). The reference&#xD;
      formulation is Sotalex®, Tablets, 160 mg (Bristol-Myers Squibb GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Germany). 36&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers of both genders with age ranging from 18 to 55 years old will&#xD;
      receive a single tablet (160 mg of sotalol) of the test and the reference products with 200&#xD;
      ml of water after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, according to the pre-defined&#xD;
      randomization list. In the first period, 18 subjects will receive the test product and 18&#xD;
      subjects the reference product.In the second period subjects will receive the products in the&#xD;
      opposite order. Subjects will fast 4 hours after administration of the study drugs during&#xD;
      each study period. Standardized meals will be provided in each study period. Water will not&#xD;
      be accessible to the subjects 1 hour prior to administration of the study drugs and 2 hours&#xD;
      after administration of the study drugs in each period. In each period blood samples were&#xD;
      collected before dosing and 0,5 ; 1; 1,5; 2 ; 2,5; 3; 3,5; 4; 4,5; 5; 6; 8; 10; 12; 16; 24;&#xD;
      36; 48; 72 hours after dosing (total number: 19). The washout period will be 14 days. A&#xD;
      validated HPLC/MS/MS method will be used to determine plasma concentrations of analyte&#xD;
      (sotalol). ANOVA will be performed on log transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t&#xD;
      and 90% confidence interval will be constructed for the ratio of geometric least square means&#xD;
      of the test and the reference products, obtained from the log-transformed data.&#xD;
      Bioequivalence will be concluded if the ratio estimate as well as its 90% confidence interval&#xD;
      for the analyte, both falls within the acceptable range of 80.00% to 125.00% for Cmax and&#xD;
      AUC0-t.&#xD;
