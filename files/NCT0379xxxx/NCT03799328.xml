  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a food allergy treatment where small amounts of the food a child&#xD;
      is allergic to is eaten and gradually increased over time with the aim to be able to eat a&#xD;
      certain amount of the allergen without experiencing an allergic reaction. While this process&#xD;
      works in many children there are concerns about safety, feasibility and drop-outs and how to&#xD;
      adapt protocols for multiple allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many OIT trials have targeted approximately 4000mg of single food/day. In these trials up to&#xD;
      40% drop-out. There is evidence much lower doses can have beneficial effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate if low doses of foods can allow for OIT to multiple foods.&#xD;
      This approach may have efficacy against accidental exposure and be able to demonstrate immune&#xD;
      changes. This approach may have a low burden of treatment and a low rate of allergic&#xD;
      reactions and&#xD;

      This is a single-arm, open label, study of the intervention of low dose multiple-nut OIT in&#xD;
      nut allergic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After meeting eligibility criteria, participants will have a food challenge to 2-5 nuts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the oral food challenge is positive, participants will be enrolled in the study to&#xD;
      multiple nut OIT. A blood draw and quality of life (QOL) survey will occur at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have dose escalation visits of the multiple nut OIT every 2 months to a&#xD;
      target dose of 30mg of each nut protein. A blood draw and QOL survey will occur at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then continue with daily ingestion of the 30mg of each nut protein for 1&#xD;
      year with visits every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 18 months from the start of the study, another oral food challenge will be given to&#xD;
      participants to assess the change in the maximum tolerated dose of nuts. A blood draw will&#xD;
      assess changes in the immune parameters. A QOL survey will occur at 18 months to assess&#xD;
      changes in QOL.&#xD;
