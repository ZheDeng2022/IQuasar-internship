  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end stage of liver disease or cirrhosis can develop confusion due to high&#xD;
      ammonia and inflammation. This confusion is brought upon by changes in the bacteria in the&#xD;
      bowels and may not respond to current standard of care treatments. Repeated episodes of&#xD;
      confusion can make it difficult for patients to function and may result in multiple&#xD;
      admissions to the hospital and burden on the family. The investigators have studied using a&#xD;
      healthy person's stool to replace the bowel bacteria, called fecal microbial transplant, in&#xD;
      small studies with good results. In this trial the investigators propose to perform these&#xD;
      procedures using an upper and lower route in Veterans who suffer from this condition and&#xD;
      follow them for safety and hospitalizations over 6 months. The investigators will compare&#xD;
      this to placebo treatments and hope that this intervention can improve the health and daily&#xD;
      functioning of affected patients.&#xD;

      Indication: Cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of fecal transplant in patients&#xD;
      with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale and Supporting Evidence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic encephalopathy affects 30-45% of patients with cirrhosis and adversely affects&#xD;
      survival in these patients. The mainstay of treatment for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has&#xD;
      long been the manipulation of the gut flora through antibiotics, prebiotics or probiotics.&#xD;
      The current first and second line therapies for HE in the US are lactulose and rifaximin&#xD;
      respectively that uniquely act within the confines of the gut lumen with encouraging clinical&#xD;
      results. However, there is a subset of patients with HE that continues to recur despite being&#xD;
      on both treatments. This patient group is at a higher risk of poor outcomes because HE has&#xD;
      now been removed from liver transplant priority and multiple episodes of HE can result in&#xD;
      cumulative brain injury which may be irreversible. Therefore, the prevention of recurrent HE&#xD;
      is an important therapeutic goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' group and other reports have shown that patients with HE and cirrhosis are&#xD;
      more likely to have overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacterial taxa such as&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae and reduction of autochthonous species such as Lachnospiraceae and&#xD;
      Ruminococcaceae in the stool and the colonic mucosa. This has been linked to poor performance&#xD;
      on cognitive tests that are a hallmark of HE and with increased systemic inflammation in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a gut-based therapeutic option that can potentially improve the recurrence rate&#xD;
      and the overall prognosis is needed. Fecal transplant has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      conditions with predominant gut-bacterial overgrowth or alteration such as recurrent&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile and inflammatory bowel disease. Safe protocols have been developed&#xD;
      across the world and studies are being performed in the US under FDA-monitored INDs.&#xD;
      Limitations to performing fecal transplant include identifying and screening appropriate&#xD;
      donors, which is time consuming and costly, with the cost typically falling to the patient or&#xD;
      donor as the required screening is generally not covered by insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' preliminary data suggest that a one-time administration of an FMT-enema&#xD;
      using a rationally-selected donor is safe in patients with cirrhosis and recurrent HE.&#xD;
      However, given the small bowel overgrowth and the predominantly small bowel location for&#xD;
      bacterial translocation in cirrhosis, which is out of the reach of an enema, an upper GI&#xD;
      route for FMT needs to be explored. In the investigators' published experience, a single&#xD;
      enema from a rationally-derived donor was associated with significantly lower total and&#xD;
      HE-related hospitalizations compared to patients who were randomized to standard of care,&#xD;
      with a stable long-term course over &gt;1 year. The investigators' data show that FMT was&#xD;
      associated with favorable changes in fecal bile acid (BA) profile with a decrease in&#xD;
      proportions of fecal secondary BAs, conjugated BAs and increase in sulfated BAs, indicating a&#xD;
      healthier milieu. The investigators also have preliminary data defining the safety of oral&#xD;
      FMT capsules in patients with cirrhosis and HE in a current trial led by us. The use of&#xD;
      combined oral and rectal routes of FMT, which can potentially alleviate both small bowel and&#xD;
      colonic translocation are likely to be better than either alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall aim: To determine the effect of dual oral and rectal administration of FMT from a&#xD;
      rational donor on clinical outcomes (hospitalizations, brain function, quality of life) and&#xD;
      host-microbiota interactions (microbial composition and bile acid composition with systemic&#xD;
      and intestinal inflammation), compared to single route of administration and placebo, along&#xD;
      with a second oral capsular FMT vs placebo administration in cirrhotic patients with HE using&#xD;
      a randomized, phase II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design overview: Four groups of outpatients with cirrhosis will be randomized using random&#xD;
      sequence generator into placebo and FMT groups and followed for 6 months under an FDA IND&#xD;
      double-blind clinical trial.&#xD;
