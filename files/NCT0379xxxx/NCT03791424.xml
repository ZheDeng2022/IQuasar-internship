    <textblock>
      It has been described that sympathetic activity, measured as changes in electrical skin&#xD;
      resistance (SR), may be used to assess the adequacy of general anaesthesia. Our prospective&#xD;
      study investigated how far measurements of skin resistance can help determine level of&#xD;
      sedation. The secondary aim was to investigate if changes in skin resistance can be used for&#xD;
      assessing recovery from anaesthesia.&#xD;

      Introduction Before anaesthesia, benzodiazepines are routinely used to reduce anxiety before&#xD;
      anaesthesia and surgery. Usually anxiolysis is preferable to sedation, which may interfere&#xD;
      with recovery after short procedures. Unfortunately, although anxiolytic sedatives are widely&#xD;
      used in clinical practice, the methodology for assessing treatment effect of these compounds&#xD;
      has not been well developed. Psychologic tests like the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS),&#xD;
      the Wang Anxiety Rating Scale (WARS), or Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were used to&#xD;
      assess changes in anxiety were developed for measuring effect of long-term therapy and are&#xD;
      rather cumbersome and difficult to use in routine anaesthetic praxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More commonly used test in clinical perioperative use are the Ramsay sedation scale (RSS),&#xD;
      the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) and the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and&#xD;
      Sedation scale (OAASS), but they focus mainly on level of sedation and not the level of&#xD;
      anxiolysis. There are several reports demonstrating that there is a correlation between level&#xD;
      of anxiety and changes in skin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes of skin resistance (SI) were first used in criminology in 1897 and in 1921 the method&#xD;
      was used in criminology by August Larson together with changes of heart rate, respiratory&#xD;
      rate and blood pressure for construction of polygraph. This method was many times validated&#xD;
      and polygraph is still used as a &quot;lie detector&quot;. More recently sever studies appeared&#xD;
      demonstrating correlation between changes of skin resistance and sedation grade, bispectral&#xD;
      index, reaction to stimulation, pain and motor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present double-blinded study was designed to refine methodology for objective evaluating&#xD;
      effect of sedative and anxiolytic agents. The primary aim of our study was to examine if of&#xD;
      changes in skin resistance after placebo pre-screening can be used for objective assessment&#xD;
      of an anxiolytic effect of drugs compared to commonly used subjective scales like Ramsay&#xD;
      sedation scale (RSS), or The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) and Observer's&#xD;
      Assessment of Alertness and Sedation scale(OAASS). The secondary aim was to evaluate if&#xD;
      changes of skin resistance can be used for assessing recovery from anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients The study was performed in adult patients scheduled for knee arthroscopy or minor&#xD;
      plastic surgery under general anaesthesia. Consent was obtained the day before surgery during&#xD;
      pre-anaesthetic visit. Exclusion criteria were previous history of taking drugs affecting&#xD;
      mental functions, history of psychic illness, implanted electrical device, know allergy to&#xD;
      benzodiazepines, myasthenia gravis, ASA classification ASA 3 and more. All patients consented&#xD;
      not to use any medication for sedation or anxiety, opioid analgesics, ethanol and illicit&#xD;
      drugs 24 hours before surgery. Patients were instructed that they will be administered by a&#xD;
      random order first sedative agent or placebo and will be observed for their level of&#xD;
      sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements After arrival at the operating theatre, and venepuncture two standard AgCl ECG&#xD;
      electrodes (Medico Electrodes International ltd.) size 32 mm x 52 mm (27x35) were attached to&#xD;
      the palm side of the second and third finger of the non-dominating hand. Multimeter DM 3900&#xD;
      (Mastech) was used for measurements of SR. The device was controlled and approved for use in&#xD;
      humans by the Department of Medical Biophysics and Informatics of the 3rd Medical Faculty of&#xD;
      Charles University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS) scale was used as a standard tool for&#xD;
      measurements of sedation level at the same intervals as measurements of SR. The person&#xD;
      providing OAAS assessment was blinded to the order of midazolam and placebo injection and&#xD;
      only the anaesthetist administering both injections knew the order of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recording Ten min. rest break was given to participants in order that they adapt to the&#xD;
      test situation. The rest value of SR was noticed and next all patients were administered&#xD;
      placebo first and after 5 min period midazolam 2 mg i.v. After next 5 minutes patients were&#xD;
      administered standard general anaesthesia with propofol, oxygen, nitrous oxide 60 % and&#xD;
      isoflurane 1 MAC via laryngeal mask and sufentanil as needed. Monitoring was standard for&#xD;
      this type of surgery (ECG, non-invasive blood pressure - NIBP, capnography and pulse&#xD;
      oximetry). SR and OASS were recorded again after stop of volatile anaesthetic agent till&#xD;
      opening eyes of the patient and obtaining verbal contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis SR values before placebo administration, 5 minutes after placebo, 5&#xD;
      minutes after midazolam, 5 min. after induction, at the end of surgery, 0 isoflurane level&#xD;
      after anaesthesia with closed eyes and after eyes opening were recorded. Changes in SR values&#xD;
      compared to baseline data were used for analyses by paired t-test. These relative changes&#xD;
      enabled to compare only the course of changes independently of different absolute values.&#xD;
      PearsonÂ´s correlation coefficients were used to analyse relationship between OASS and SR&#xD;
      values. P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of our study was to assess if SR can be used as an objective measurement of&#xD;
      level of sedation compared to much or less subjective OAAS. OASS was chosen because scoring&#xD;
      was originally introduced to assess sedation with benzodiazepines, which was used in our&#xD;
      study, too. The categories were responsiveness, speech, facial expression and eye appearance&#xD;
      and each category was originally scored in 5 dimensions. The OAAS scale was found to have a&#xD;
      high discriminatory power for the different levels of sedation (3), but may vary between&#xD;
      observers. There is a limited number of methods for assessment onset and intensity of&#xD;
      sedation. Commonly used Bispectral Index Score (BIS) monitoring is not dependent on a person&#xD;
      and is used mainly during general anaesthesia. On the other hand the authors of a large&#xD;
      meta-analysis concluded that its use for sedation in largely unreliable.&#xD;
