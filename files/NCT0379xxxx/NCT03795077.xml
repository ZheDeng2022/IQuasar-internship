  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a higher education programme based on&#xD;
      professional ethics in physiotherapy students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple-blind clinical trial was performed. A three-months program based in professional&#xD;
      ethics was carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators compared a control group (traditonal lectures) with an intervention group&#xD;
      (syllabus, activities, face to face techniques). StudentsÂ´ attitudes, knowledge, professional&#xD;
      values, and opinions towards professional ethics were evaluated before and after the&#xD;
      programme, in both groups. All participants were informed about the study and procedures, and&#xD;
      provided written informed consent.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants. Second-year degree students of Physiotherapy Degree at the University, aged&#xD;
      between 20 and 30 years, were recruited voluntarily from January 2019 to April 2019 . All&#xD;
      enrolled participants were informed of the purpose of the study and procedures, and provided&#xD;
      written informed consent. The study was carried out at the institution where the authors&#xD;
      belong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design. A prospective simple-blind trial was performed. After baseline assessment,&#xD;
      participants were allocated to one of the two groups (control group and experimental group).&#xD;
      An external assistant not involved in the study performed assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. A Physiotherapy professor with over-10-year experience in Ethics and&#xD;
      Physiotherapy performed the teaching methodology and opened the allocation envelopes and&#xD;
      applied the teaching methodology to the EG according to the group assignment. The&#xD;
      intervention consisted of a three-month program based in professional ethics, including two&#xD;
      phases: A) syllabus and activities; and B) face to face group sessions including techniques&#xD;
      such as concept maps, glossaries, brainstorming, four corners activity, aquarium, philip 6-6,&#xD;
      kahoot, Realm Individual-Process Situation, reduced groups, guided debates, and discussion&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

    <measure>Knowledge of Professional Ethicss</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>measured with an ad-hoc retention test. The students were not previously informed about retention exams to avoid any preparation for the test.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perception of knowledge regarding professional Ethics</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A self-reported questionnaire of 19 items (the Perceptions about Knowledge regarding Professional Ethics in Physiotherapy, PKPEPT, Cronbach's alpha=0.760) was previously described.27,28 The higher score indicated the best perception of knowlegde. The questionnaires' items included basic professional ethics concepts that physiotherapy students are required to know. Therefore, questions assessed participants' perception about knowledge regarding basic concepts in Professional Ethics and their application in physiotherapy care. Items were created in order to be important and to be clearly related with perception of knowledge.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It was assessed for both groups by the Teaching evaluation of the Center for Quality of the University of Valencia. This center offers the students online surveys with different items evaluating the teaching methodologies, materials and general satisfaction by a Likert scale (1 totally disagree to 5 totally agree) in undergraduate degree, through the Virtual Office of the University.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For the Cooperative Learning group, an ad-hoc satisfaction questionnaire was carried out, using the Kahoot application. The satisfaction questionnaire included 16 questions in total: 5 dichotomous questions about opinion about the methodology, 5 dichotomous questions about the themes; 3 Likert-type questions (not at all / little / quite / a lot) about interest and usefulness of the content / contents, and 3 questions about satisfaction, usefulness and fun with respect to the techniques used, Likert-type: from 0 to 5 points.
