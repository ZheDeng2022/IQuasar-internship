  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In autoimmune adrenal insufficiency, or Addison's disease (AD), the immune system attacks the&#xD;
      adrenal cortex. As a result, the adrenal cells producing hormones such as cortisol and&#xD;
      aldosterone are destroyed, leaving the body with insufficient levels to meet its needs. The&#xD;
      common perception is that upon diagnosis of Addison's disease, basically all adrenal hormone&#xD;
      production has ceased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have, however, been found a few individuals who preserve some residual secretion of&#xD;
      cortisol even years after diagnosis. The objectives of this study is to find out how common&#xD;
      it is, and to explore if residual function have impact on patient outcome. That is, do&#xD;
      patients with and without residual function differ when it comes to quality of life, working&#xD;
      ability, medication dosages, and risk of adrenal crisis?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex is the main cause of primary adrenal&#xD;
      insufficiency (Addison's disease, AD). Autoimmune AD (AAD) becomes clinically manifest when&#xD;
      90 % of cortex of adrenal gland is destroyed. Current dogma says that adrenal insufficiency&#xD;
      ultimately is complete, that is the adrenal cortex stops producing steroids altogether.&#xD;
      However, several case reports indicate that there might be a subgroup of patients that retain&#xD;
      some steroid production, even years after the diagnosis. This ability could be beneficial as&#xD;
      it could protect against adrenal crises, ease medication, and leave the patient with better&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to systematically assess to what extent patients with AAD have&#xD;
      residual adrenocortical function, and to characterize this subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be an open non-randomized three-stage multicenter clinical trial comprising&#xD;
      patients from the Norwegian Registry for organ-specific autoimmune disease (ROAS), the&#xD;
      Swedish Addison registry, and Germany. In stage 1, patients will be asked to fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires and deliver medication-fasting samples for analyses of adrenal steroids. In&#xD;
      addition, patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and bilaterally adrenalectomized&#xD;
      will serve as negative controls for adrenal steroids. In stage 2, AAD patients with residual&#xD;
      steroid production will be invited to a cosyntropin stimulation test to estimate the maximum&#xD;
      steroid output from the adrenal glands. Twenty patients with no sign of residual function&#xD;
      will also be tested as a control group. In stage 3, AAD patients with confirmed residual&#xD;
      function will be invited to go through a 30-hour ambulatory sampling of interstitial fluid&#xD;
      for investigation of diurnal variation in adrenocortical hormone levels. Also, newly&#xD;
      diagnosed AAD patients will be invited to repeated cosyntropin testing as a means of&#xD;
      delineating the natural progression of adrenocortical failure.&#xD;
