    <textblock>
      An open-label study with a single treatment arm involving 20 participants with progressive MS&#xD;
      at multiple investigational study sites. After providing informed consent, participants&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized and approximately 4 weeks&#xD;
      later will undergo a bone-marrow aspiration (BMA). Each participants will receive three&#xD;
      Intrathecal cell transplantations within 16 weeks and will be followed for 12 weeks for&#xD;
      safety and efficacy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females ages 18 to 65 years old, inclusive, at the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical diagnosis of Progressive MS (Primary and Secondary) based on the 2017 revised&#xD;
             MacDonald Criteria and confirmation by the Investigator that the disease has entered&#xD;
             the progressive stage for at least 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No evidence of clinical MS relapse or high dose pulse corticosteroid treatment within&#xD;
             6 months prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Disability status at screening with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)&#xD;
             3.0-6.5, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able to walk 25 feet in 60 seconds or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Stable dose of non-excluded MS Disease Modifying Therapy for at least 6 months prior&#xD;
             to Screening Visit (Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior stem cell therapy of any kind.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active participation in any other MS interventional study or use of unapproved MS&#xD;
             investigational therapy within 90 days prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Inability to lie flat for the duration of intrathecal cell transplantation and/or bone&#xD;
             marrow biopsy, or inability to tolerate study procedures for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of clinically significant autoimmune disease (excluding thyroid disease) that&#xD;
             may confound study results, myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative disorder, leukemia&#xD;
             or lymphoma, whole body irradiation, hip fracture, or severe scoliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any unstable clinically significant medical condition other than multiple sclerosis&#xD;
             (e.g., within six months of Screening Visit (Visit 1), had myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             angina pectoris, and/or congestive heart failure), treatment with anticoagulants that,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the safety of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any history of malignancy within the previous 5 years, except for non-melanoma&#xD;
             localized skin cancers (with no evidence of metastasis, significant invasion, or&#xD;
             reoccurrence within three years of Screening Visit (Visit 1)).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value &gt;3.0&#xD;

             antigen (IgG and IgM anti-HBc)), Hepatitis C (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV) 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Current use of immunosuppressant medication or use of such medication within 6 months&#xD;
             of study enrollment (aside from Rituximab or other approved B-cell immunotherapy).&#xD;
             Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), Cladribine (NDA submitted), Natalizumab (Tysabri), S1P&#xD;
             modulators (Gilenya) are excluded for safety reasons due to the known risk of systemic&#xD;
             autoimmune disease, malignancy, opportunistic infections, and cardiovascular toxicity&#xD;
             associated with these therapies, as well as theoretical effects on MSC-NTF cell homing&#xD;
             and migration, that may be associated with Natalizumab and/or S1P modulators&#xD;
             (Gilenya).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any history of acquired or inherited immune deficiency syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any history of either substance abuse within the past year, or unstable psychiatric&#xD;
             disease according to the Investigator's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Pregnant women or women currently breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects for whom MRI is contraindicated (i.e., have a pacemaker or other metallic&#xD;
             implanted device, or are unable to remain in the machine for period of time needed to&#xD;
             acquire a scan.&#xD;
