      Study Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage regimen: Patients of CHB with advanced fibrosis and partial virological response to&#xD;
      NUCs will be considered eligible for the present study. The enrollment will be up to the&#xD;
      physician's discretion. The drug will be administered 1 pill (25 mg) per day orally, per&#xD;
      manufacturers' instructions, and can be taken with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance: Enrolled patients must be monitored according to the protocol, GCP, and clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Approximately 80 adult CHB patients with advanced fibrosis (including&#xD;
      fibrosis stage 3 and cirrhosis), who are currently on NUCs (except TAF) therapy with&#xD;
      detectable HBV DNA after 52 weeks of therapy will switch prior NUCs to TAF 25 mg/day for 96&#xD;
      weeks. For patients of fibrosis stage 3, the numbers of enrolled patients will be no more&#xD;
      than 40% of total enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To describe the improvement of rate of viral suppression with TAF in patients of partial&#xD;
      virological response with previous anti-HBV NUCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the persistence or improvement of rate of ALT normalization (local and AASLD&#xD;
           criteria) with TAF in patients of partial virological response with previous anti-HBV&#xD;
           NUCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the trends in serum creatinine, calculated creatinine clearance, and renal&#xD;
           tubular function with TAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the trends in bone mineral density with TAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the progression/regression of liver fibrosis with TAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the prespecified factors associated with viral suppression and/or ALT&#xD;
           normalization after switching to TAF, including viral resistance profiles, HBsAg levels&#xD;
           and HBV viral loads at the initiation of prior NUC and at the time of TAF switching, HBV&#xD;
           genotype, hepatic fibrosis, age, sex, prior preparations of NUCs, and host&#xD;
           immunogenetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Screening: Patients who are currently under HBV NUC, except TAF therapy, with liver&#xD;
      fibrosis stage 3 or 4 at the initiation of NUC, and with detectable HBV DNA after week 52 of&#xD;
      therapy will be considered eligible in this prospective interventional cohort study. If the&#xD;
      patient is deemed eligible to participate, the site will evaluate the potential patient using&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria and fill out the CRF for the screening visit. The local&#xD;
      coordinator will transmit the pre-screening data to the central coordinator prior to the&#xD;
      actual screening/baseline visit. If the patient is deemed eligible by the Primary&#xD;
      Investigator, the patient will be given a study ID and allowed to enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/Baseline: Written and informed consent will be obtained prior to any study&#xD;
      protocol-related procedures or data abstraction. If the patient has been pre-screened&#xD;
      approved and all lab data are available, the participant will begin the study TAF treatment&#xD;
      on the screening/baseline visit. The screening/baseline visit consists of obtaining written&#xD;
      and informed consent, reviewing the inclusion/exclusion criteria, confirming medical history,&#xD;
      completing a physical examination with vital signs and body weight, reviewing any concomitant&#xD;
      medications and study drug dispensing. HCV, HDV, and HIV antibody test will be performed&#xD;
      after written informed consent is obtained. The samples of HDV antibody test will be&#xD;
      collected at local site and sent to KMUH, tested by central lab. Baseline resistance testing&#xD;
      will also be performed by direct sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: laboratory tests including CBC (complete blood count) panel, Serum Bilirubin&#xD;
      (total/direct), AST, ALT, GGT, Albumin, BUN, Creatinine, Na, K, Phosphate, Prothrombin time&#xD;
      (INR), and Urine routine/creatinine/phosphate will be done every visit. Pregnant test (only&#xD;
      for women of child-bearing potential), Child-Pugh score, and FIB-4 score should also be done&#xD;
      every visit. AFP (alpha-fetoprotein), and Abdominal ultrasound should also be done every 3 to&#xD;
      6 months for HCC surveillance. HBV serological markers including HBeAg/HBeAb, HBV DNA&#xD;
      quantification (by central lab.) will be done every visit and HBsAg quantification (by&#xD;
      central lab.) every 6 months. Bone Density Scan (DEXA) will be done at week 24, 48, and 96.&#xD;
      Fibroscan/CAP will be performed at week 48, and 96 to determine regression of fibrosis. Blood&#xD;
      will be drawn at the site at which the participant was recruited, and processed by a lab&#xD;
      technician in the clinical laboratory at that respective site, except HDV antibody test and&#xD;
      HBsAg/HBV DNA quantification which will be performed by the central lab. at KMUH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visits: Treatment will consist of TAF 25 mg daily with food for 96 weeks. Treatment&#xD;
      visits will occur at week 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 as per routine clinical care, except&#xD;
      for those who developed virological breakthrough, SAE, or others judged by the investigators.&#xD;
      At every visit, the patient must bring all study drugs (including empty bottles), so that the&#xD;
      study coordinator can count compliance using the number of remaining pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This schedule of clinic visits and laboratory tests are routine and standard practice for&#xD;
      investigators in their treatment of similar patients with CHB. Patients will be encouraged to&#xD;
      adhere to these recommendations. Results of these laboratory tests and clinical evaluations&#xD;
      will be recorded as well as any additional evaluations that are done as part of the patient's&#xD;
      clinical care that is pertinent to the objective of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation criteria: The study can be terminated at any time for any reasons by Primary&#xD;
      Investigator. Though there is no formal treatment stopping rules in this study, patients&#xD;
      might be asked to stop if there are any adverse events that the investigator feels make it&#xD;
      the patient's best interest to stop treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure to follow study instructions or protocol violation that in the judgment of the&#xD;
           investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious Adverse Events that in the judgment of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of virological breakthrough (defined as reappearance of HBV DNA or at least&#xD;
           one log10 elevation of HBV DNA from nadir in 2 consecutive measurements one month apart.&#xD;
           further treatment plans are at the discretion of the treating physician and patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any medical, psychosocial or administrative or other reasons that in the judgment of the&#xD;
           investigator, be detrimental to the patient's well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events and Toxicity Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of safety: Safety assessments will include monitoring of laboratory results, vital&#xD;
      signs, treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, etc. Safety assessments&#xD;
      will be performed at every clinic visit as part of clinical care and during follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, in Primary Investigator's judgment, a clinical significant worsening from baseline is&#xD;
      observed in any laboratory or other test parameters, physical exam finding, or vital sign, a&#xD;
      corresponding clinical adverse event should be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a specific medical diagnosis has been made, that diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded&#xD;
      as the adverse event, whenever possible. However, a complete description of the signs,&#xD;
      symptoms, and investigations which led to the diagnosis should be provided. For example, if&#xD;
      clinically significant elevations of liver function tests are known to be secondary to&#xD;
      hepatitis, &quot;hepatitis&quot; and not &quot;elevated liver function tests&quot; should be recorded. If the&#xD;
      cause is not known, the abnormal test or finding should be recorded as an adverse event,&#xD;
      using appropriate medical terminology (e/g/ thrombocytopenia, peripheral edema).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of Safety Information: Safety information will be maintained in a clinical&#xD;
      database/repository in a retrievable format. At a minimum, at the end of the treatment phase&#xD;
      (=&quot;last patient off treatment&quot;) as well as the end of the follow-up phase (=&quot;last patient&#xD;
      out&quot;) of the study, Primary Investigator shall provide all adverse events, both serious and&#xD;
      non-serious, in report format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis will be performed at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size to be used in the analysis: We calculated that a sample size of 80 patients with&#xD;
      a 10% dropout rate would provide 85% power to show increased to 30% of virologic response&#xD;
      (HBV DNA &lt;LLOQ) rate after 52 weeks of TAF therapy, compared to 15% of continuing prior NUC&#xD;
      therapy with a type I error rate of 0.05 for the one-tailed analyses of the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods to be employed: Descriptive and comparative statistics will be performed&#xD;
      for all demographic and clinical variables that are outcome endpoints for this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of significance: A 95% confidence interval will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Termination of trial: Termination of the trial will be upon completion of follow-up of all 80&#xD;
      subjects enrolled and/or up to the discretion of the primary investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for missing, unused, spurious data: Data that is missing, unused or spurious data&#xD;
      will all be treated as missing data. This data will be marked as an empty field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deviation from the original statistical plan: Any deviation from the original statistical&#xD;
      plan will be up to the discretion of the primary investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of subjects to be included in analyses: All eligible subjects that have not been&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study will be included in analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis An interim analysis will be performed at Week 24 after all the 80 patients&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
