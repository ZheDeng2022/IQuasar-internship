      The study aim to Evaluate the combination of ididilimumab and docetaxel alone in the&#xD;
      treatment of previous platinum-containing double-drug chemotherapy according to RECIST&#xD;
      1.1Objective remission rate of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with&#xD;
      negative, driving gene negative (EGFR, ALK, ROS1); (ORR).&#xD;

      This study is a single case of syndilizumab plus docetaxel monotherapy in a Chinese-negative&#xD;
      late-stage or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) failed platinum-containing&#xD;
      dual-drug chemotherapy. Center, single arm phase II study. In this study, 30 patients with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had failed platinum-containing&#xD;
      dual-drug chemotherapy were treated with rituximab plus docetaxel every 3 weeks until disease&#xD;
      progression and intolerance. Toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, death or other&#xD;
      cessation of treatment as prescribed by the program, whichever occurs first. The primary end&#xD;
      point was the ORR based on RECIS 1.1, which was evaluated by the Independent Imaging Review&#xD;
      Board (IRRC). The longest treatment time for ididibizumab is 24 months. An interim analysis&#xD;
      will be conducted during the course of the study. The results and reports will be provided to&#xD;
      the Independent Data Audit Committee (IDMC), which determines whether the trial is valid&#xD;
      based on the valid cut-off value of the trial and whether the study data can be submitted in&#xD;
      advance. Make recommendations to the sponsor. Prior to the interim analysis, the IDMC charter&#xD;
      will be finalized and approved by IDMC and the sponsor. The responsibilities and related&#xD;
      procedures of IDMC members will be defined in the IDMC charter.&#xD;
