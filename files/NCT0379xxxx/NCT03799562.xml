      This study seeks to determine if pregnenolone can improve symptoms of PTSD and other symptoms&#xD;
      that commonly occur with PTSD in Iraq/Afghanistan-era Veterans. The total study duration is&#xD;
      10 weeks. Eligible Veterans with PTSD will receive either pregnenolone or placebo throughout&#xD;
      the study duration and will complete mental and physical health assessments at each study&#xD;
      visit. Eligible participants will attend 6 in-person study visits and receive several short&#xD;
      &quot;check-in&quot; phone calls.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: There is an acute and urgent need to develop new and effective posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD) pharmacotherapies, as there are currently only two FDA-approved&#xD;
      medications for the treatment of PTSD (both of which are from the same drug class and have&#xD;
      shown only moderate effect sizes in FDA registration trials). Many Veterans with PTSD thus&#xD;
      remain symptomatic despite the availability of these treatments, increasing the likelihood of&#xD;
      receiving pharmacological treatment interventions for which there is little or no empirical&#xD;
      evidence. Multiple national and VA working groups focusing on PTSD have identified the&#xD;
      critical need to address the paucity of PTSD pharmacotherapies, and have strongly recommended&#xD;
      more randomized clinical trials to evaluate possible effective pharmacological treatments.&#xD;
      Both preclinical and clinical data suggest that reductions in neurosteroids are involved in&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of PTSD, and that ameliorating these deficits could potentially be&#xD;
      clinically therapeutic - the proposed investigation targeting a neurosteroid intervention for&#xD;
      the treatment of PTSD could thus be a promising research avenue. The investigators therefore&#xD;
      propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to determine the efficacy of a&#xD;
      neurosteroid intervention (pregnenolone) for PTSD and commonly co-occurring disorders in&#xD;
      Iraq/Afghanistan-era Veterans, an understudied cohort that may be less treatment-refractory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This study will be a 10-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical&#xD;
      trial of pregnenolone or matching placebo in Veterans with PTSD. The trial will include a&#xD;
      2-week single-blind placebo lead-in phase followed by 8 weeks of study medication (placebo or&#xD;
      pregnenolone). Forty-five subjects meeting DSM-5 criteria for PTSD (as measured by a CAPS-5&#xD;
      score of 30) will be randomized to receive pregnenolone, and 45 subjects meeting DSM-5&#xD;
      criteria for PTSD will be randomized to receive placebo. The primary outcome for this RCT&#xD;
      will be changes in total CAPS-5 score at Visit 6 for this modified intent-to-treat sample.&#xD;
      Secondary clinical outcomes for this RCT include changes in pain intensity and functional&#xD;
      interference, as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form (BPI-SF) and depression&#xD;
      symptoms by the Hamilton-Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Blood samples will be collected for&#xD;
      serum analysis at all study visits and frozen in a -80 degree freezer. Upon completion of the&#xD;
      study, samples will be thawed and analyzed using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry for&#xD;
      neurosteroid analyses and inflammatory markers will be quantified. Genetic analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted to determine therapeutic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREDICTED RESULTS: The investigators hypothesize that treatment with pregnenolone will be&#xD;
      efficacious in Iraq/Afghanistan-era Veterans with PTSD, and will significantly reduce PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms as assessed by the CAPS-5 (primary endpoint) compared to placebo. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will include the assessment of conditions that frequently co-occur with PTSD;&#xD;
      specifically, the investigators hypothesize that pregnenolone will also demonstrate efficacy&#xD;
      for co-occurring chronic pain symptoms and depression symptoms. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that increases in pregnenolone and other neurosteroids (and decreases in inflammatory&#xD;
      markers) will predict improvements in PTSD, depression, and chronic pain symptoms. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that neurosteroids are dysregulated in PTSD, and that specific&#xD;
      SNPs of genes coding for neurosteroidogenic enzymes will be associated with therapeutic&#xD;
      response.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS is the gold standard in PTSD assessment. The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview that can be used to make a diagnosis of PTSD and assess PTSD symptoms. It assesses the intensity and frequency of PTSD symptoms. Scores range from 0-80; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form (Visit 6-Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form (BPI-SF) is a self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain and the interference of pain on function. The scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). There are 4 questions assessing worst pain, least pain, average pain in the past 24 hours, and the pain right now. The Interference scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). There are 7 questions assessing the interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life.</description>

    <description>The HAM-D measures the severity of depressive symptoms. It is a checklist of 17 items that are ranked on a scale of 0-4 or 0-2. The range for the total score (which is the sum of the scores of all 17 items) is 0-52; a higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms.</description>
