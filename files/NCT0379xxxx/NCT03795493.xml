      Fifty patients with metastatic breast cancer will be randomly assigned to an acute&#xD;
      intervention consisting of both aerobic exercise and caloric restriction administered acutely&#xD;
      prior to each of six chemotherapy cycles, or to usual care. The aerobic exercise intervention&#xD;
      will consist of a single supervised recumbent cycle ergometer session performed concurrent to&#xD;
      each chemotherapy infusion. The diet intervention consists of provision of meals freshly&#xD;
      prepared in a metabolic kitchen with caloric content equivalent to 50% of measured energy&#xD;
      requirements and low carbohydrate content for 48-72 hours prior to each chemotherapy&#xD;
      infusion. Tumor outcomes will be assessed via CT scan (tumor size) and MRI (novel marker of&#xD;
      tumor regression), while treatment side effects will be assessed by MRI and treatment&#xD;
      symptoms and quality of life will be assessed via questionnaire before, during and after up&#xD;
      to six chemotherapy cycles of a consistent treatment protocol. Progression-free and overall&#xD;
      survival will be tracked for two years after diagnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite major advances in recent decades in treatment for early stage breast cancer leading&#xD;
      to an 89% 5-year survival rate, metastatic breast cancer is still considered incurable due to&#xD;
      resistance to most available treatments. As such, 5-year survival rate for metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer is only 22%. One mechanism for resistance to cancer therapies and promotion of&#xD;
      metastasis in solid tumors is that their vascular system is impaired causing diminished&#xD;
      delivery of systemic therapy and oxygen. Furthermore, toxicity can be quite high with&#xD;
      metastatic regimens, which can limit the dose received. Both diet and exercise have been used&#xD;
      to attenuate treatment toxicity, but the promising preclinical evidence showing their&#xD;
      potential to enhance chemotherapy efficacy and survival has not been studied in humans. For&#xD;
      example, a single bout of aerobic exercise substantially increased tumor blood flow and&#xD;
      oxygen delivery, suggesting that chemotherapy delivery to the tumor would be enhanced. Short&#xD;
      periods of fasting or caloric restriction also appear to be safe and effective strategies to&#xD;
      inhibit tumor growth and enhance chemotherapy efficacy, while also promoting resistance to&#xD;
      chemotherapy in healthy cells. Furthermore, combining aerobic exercise and caloric&#xD;
      restriction can elicit synergistic effects on outcomes relevant to cancer, including body&#xD;
      composition, aerobic fitness, fasting insulin and glucose, insulin-like growth factor, and&#xD;
      tumor promoter pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: With preclinical proof-of-principle and clinical safety and feasibility of each&#xD;
      intervention independently established, this study will be a phase II, two-arm, single blind,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. Fifty patients will be randomly assigned to an acute&#xD;
      intervention consisting of both caloric restriction administered acutely prior to and aerobic&#xD;
      exercise during each treatment of six chemotherapy cycles, or to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: Participants will include adults with metastatic breast cancer with measurable&#xD;
      metastases that will receive intravenous chemotherapy. The aerobic exercise intervention will&#xD;
      consist of a single supervised recumbent cycle ergometer session performed concurrent to each&#xD;
      chemotherapy infusion. The diet intervention consists of provision of meals freshly prepared&#xD;
      in a metabolic kitchen with caloric content equivalent to 50% of measured energy requirements&#xD;
      and low carbohydrate content for 48-72 hours prior to each chemotherapy infusion. The diet&#xD;
      period will be reduced from 72 to 48 hours when there are &lt;7 days between infusions (ie&#xD;
      weekly protocols) to avoid inducing a sustained caloric deficit leading to weight loss. This&#xD;
      acute intervention does not lead to long-term nutritional imbalances. Exercise intensity and&#xD;
      meals will be individualized to participant abilities and preferences. All participants,&#xD;
      regardless of group assignment, will receive a one-time phone consultation with a registered&#xD;
      dietitian and a certified exercise physiologist to enhance recruitment and retention. Tumor&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed via CT scan (tumor size) and MRI (novel marker of tumor&#xD;
      regression), while treatment side effects will be assessed by MRI and treatment symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life will be assessed via questionnaire before, during and after up to six&#xD;
      chemotherapy cycles of a consistent treatment protocol. Progression-free and overall survival&#xD;
      will be tracked for two years after diagnosis.&#xD;
