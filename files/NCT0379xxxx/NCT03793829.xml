      This interventional clinical study will examine the safety and efficacy of a degenerate&#xD;
      subdominant HER2 specific helper T cell epitope vaccine (H2NVAC) in patients with&#xD;
      HER2-expressing ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The ultimate goal of this vaccine is to&#xD;
      prevent future invasive breast cancer among patients who are diagnosed with DCIS. However,&#xD;
      the focus of this study is safety and efficacy.&#xD;

      This is an interventional clinical study examining the safety and efficacy of a degenerate&#xD;
      subdominant HER2 specific helper T cell epitope vaccine (H2NVAC) in patients with&#xD;
      HER2-expressing ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The ultimate goal of this vaccine is to&#xD;
      prevent future invasive breast cancer among patients who are diagnosed with DCIS. However,&#xD;
      the focus of this study is safety and efficacy. The vaccine consists of 4 peptide epitopes&#xD;
      (15-18 amino acids in length) derived from the HER2 protein. These peptides are derived from&#xD;
      HER2 and were selected based upon their recognition by lymphocytes from women with prior&#xD;
      HER-2 positive breast cancer. To enhance immunity, the peptides are admixed with the adjuvant&#xD;
      GM-CSF. Patients will receive four bi-monthly vaccinations followed by surgery as diagrammed&#xD;
      below; observation includes periodic blood draws to assess toxicity and immune responses, as&#xD;
      well as periodic echocardiography to assess left ventricular ejection fraction.&#xD;
