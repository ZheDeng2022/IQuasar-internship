  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 2-treatment, 2-period, single dose (200 mg, IM) cross-over study,&#xD;
      2-part design to evaluate the bioequivalence (BE) of a reformulated presentation (test) of&#xD;
      testosterone cypionate solution for injection relative to the currently approved marked&#xD;
      formulation (reference). In the first part of the study (Part 1), an estimate of the exposure&#xD;
      variability will be evaluated for both test and reference. This will help guide sample size&#xD;
      in Part 2. Part 2 will be powered to assess the BE of both test and reference formulations.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Hypogonadal male subjects who, at the time of screening, are otherwise healthy and&#xD;
             between the ages of 18 and 65 years, inclusive. Healthy is defined as no clinically&#xD;
             relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical&#xD;
             examination, including blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG), or clinical laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Hypogonadism is defined as serum testosterone levels below 2.5 ng/mL (250 ng/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 35 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that&#xD;
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or&#xD;
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,&#xD;
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who are currently being treated for hypogonadism. This is defined as either&#xD;
             patients who have received a testosterone injectable product within the past 3 months&#xD;
             or have used a transdermal or gel product within the past 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A positive urine drug test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week (1 drink = 5 ounces&#xD;
             [150 mL] of wine or 12 ounces [360 mL] of beer or 1.5 ounces [45 mL] of hard liquor)&#xD;
             within 6 months before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local&#xD;
             requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of investigational product&#xD;
             (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Screening supine BP greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg (systolic) or greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg (systolic) or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg&#xD;
             (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values&#xD;
             should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating a corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec or&#xD;
             a QRS interval &gt;120 msec. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG&#xD;
             should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be&#xD;
             used to determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at&#xD;
             screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single&#xD;
             repeat test, if deemed necessary:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level greater&#xD;
                  than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin level greater than or equal to 1.5 times the ULN; subject with a&#xD;
                  history of Gilbert's syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be&#xD;
                  eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin level is less than or equal&#xD;
                  to ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Fertile male subjects who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception as outlined in this protocol [Contraception (Section 4.3.4)] for the&#xD;
             duration of the study and for at least 45 days after the last dose of investigational&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or&#xD;
             5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of investigational product.&#xD;
             As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 1 g/day. Limited use of nonprescription medications that are not believed to&#xD;
             affect subject safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted on a case&#xD;
             by case basis following approval by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more&#xD;
             within 56 days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; positive&#xD;
             testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody&#xD;
             (HepBcAb), or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Requirements section&#xD;
             of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects who are investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of&#xD;
             the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the&#xD;
             investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their family members,&#xD;
             directly involved in the conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subjects with carcinoma of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subjects with known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate gland.&#xD;
