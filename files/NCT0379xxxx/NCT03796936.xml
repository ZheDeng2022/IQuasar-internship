    <textblock>
      Background and Purpose: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (mTBI) are persistent and frequently comorbid complications of recent combat. There is no&#xD;
      proven treatment for mTBI, and standard treatments for PTSD frequently achieve only&#xD;
      transient, modest impact. Motion-assisted, Multi-modular Memory Desensitization and&#xD;
      Reconsolidation (3MDR) is a novel treatment for PTSD combining aspects of virtual reality&#xD;
      exposure therapy (VRET) and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), within the&#xD;
      Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN). The added benefit of the eye movement&#xD;
      (EM) component of EMDR is controversial; the purpose of this pilot study is therefore to: 1)&#xD;
      obtain an initial estimate of the efficacy of 3MDR in service members with comorbid PTSD and&#xD;
      mTBI, and 2) determine the impact of EM on treatment response. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that 3MDR will significantly improve symptom severity, both with and without EM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Participants will be active or retired service members with a history of mTBI who&#xD;
      meet criteria for probable PTSD on the PCL5. It is anticipated that participants will be&#xD;
      recruited through the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM) Recruitment&#xD;
      Core and the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design type and procedures: This is a pilot, controlled clinical trial in which all 20&#xD;
      participants with comorbid PTSD and mTBI receive 10 sessions (3 preparatory, 6 3MDR&#xD;
      treatment, and 1 conclusion), but will be randomized to either include EM (EM+) or not (EM-).&#xD;
      In the preparatory sessions, the therapist will help each participant select 2 songs and 14&#xD;
      pictures to be used in their treatment sessions. The therapist will help the participant rate&#xD;
      the pictures from least to most impactful. Each 3MDR treatment session will start by playing&#xD;
      the first song, to bring them back to the time of their trauma. This will be done while the&#xD;
      participant walks on the CAREN's embedded treadmill through the 3MDR virtual environment (VE)&#xD;
      projected onto the system's curved screen. This is followed by a display of one of their&#xD;
      pictures, a manifestation of their trauma, which they directly face and walk down a hallway&#xD;
      toward, until the picture looms before them. The therapist, standing next to the participant&#xD;
      along the treadmill's edge, will query the participant about what the picture means to them,&#xD;
      how it makes them feel, etc., while the CAREN operator superimposes key words (said by the&#xD;
      participant) over the picture, which the therapist later asks the participant to read aloud.&#xD;
      Then, for ~60 seconds, the EM+ group will see a red ball &quot;bounce&quot; across the screen in front&#xD;
      of the picture, and a number appears on the ball as it touches the screen's edge. The&#xD;
      participant will be asked to recite each number aloud. This element is absent for EM-&#xD;
      participants. All participants repeats these procedures for 5-7 pictures in each 3MDR&#xD;
      treatment session; the pictures used will be agreed upon by therapist and participant,&#xD;
      targeting more impactful pictures, whether repeats or new, in later sessions. The pictures&#xD;
      are followed by playing the second song, chosen to bring the participant back to present day.&#xD;
      The participant will walk at a comfortable pace throughout the session, with each session&#xD;
      lasting typically ~60 minutes. The primary outcome measure will be change in PCL-5 score from&#xD;
      pre- to post-intervention, with additional measures at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot prospective, randomized, interventional controlled clinical trial. Our study&#xD;
      at the NICoE site will specifically target active or retired SMs who are OIF/OEF/OND veterans&#xD;
      of any age and either gender who meet criteria for PTSD and have a lifetime history of mTBI.&#xD;
      Comorbid PTSD and mTBI is highly prevalent in SMs and veterans of the recent wars in&#xD;
      Afghanistan and Iraq, and having both diagnoses is associated with significantly greater&#xD;
      symptom severity than either PTSD or mTBI alone (Brenner et al., 2010). TBI, the great&#xD;
      majority of which is mTBI, is one of the most challenging, significant, and costly problems&#xD;
      facing the DoD, and inhibiting readiness, whether in times of war or peace. Currently, no&#xD;
      therapy has yet been proven efficacious in reducing persistent symptoms after TBI. Many&#xD;
      patients with PTSD, particularly when it is combat-related, still suffer from substantial&#xD;
      residual symptoms even after undergoing evidence-based psychotherapy (Watts et al., 2013;&#xD;
      Bradley et al., 2001; Bison et al., 2007) and many even maintain their PTSD diagnosis&#xD;
      (Steenkamp et al., 2015). The novel elements of 3MDR may prove to be particularly beneficial&#xD;
      for those with both PTSD and a history of mTBI. If our approach is proven effective, there&#xD;
      will be a sizeable population for whom this treatment could be provided, translating into&#xD;
      both individual and DoD-wide benefit. Both TBI and PTSD have become signature wounds of the&#xD;
      wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and pose significant health concerns for many military&#xD;
      personnel. Currently, no intervention has yet been proven efficacious in reducing long-term&#xD;
      symptoms of TBI. Furthermore, individuals with PTSD often have persistent symptoms even after&#xD;
      completing validated treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research has the potential to have a significant positive impact on the care of&#xD;
      individuals with both PTSD and mTBI. As previously stated, 3MDR combines emotional exposure,&#xD;
      dual-task processing, attenuation of working memory resources, and physical activity.&#xD;
      Physical activity may be particularly beneficial in enhancing blood flow to the brain and&#xD;
      facilitating production of beneficial factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor&#xD;
      (BDNF). In addition, participants have the opportunity to demonstrate to themselves that they&#xD;
      can actively overcome their avoidance by approaching and walking toward, or deliberately&#xD;
      confronting, representations of their own traumatic memories. This approach may be&#xD;
      particularly useful or of interest to veterans and SMs, who are accustomed to being&#xD;
      physically active, may be less inclined to turn to pharmacotherapy than others with PTSD, and&#xD;
      also have had high dropout rates and greater resistance to established, more traditional&#xD;
      therapies. This relatively short treatment approach could have tremendous implications for&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms as well as quality of life in individuals with PTSD and mTBI. Prior&#xD;
      to any other study procedures, written informed consent will be obtained from each&#xD;
      participant by the principal investigator (PI) or another study staff member trained by the&#xD;
      PI to obtain informed consent. The PI will then complete a medical history and a series of&#xD;
      questionnaires, to include a review of inclusion and exclusion criteria, to ensure that each&#xD;
      participant is eligible to be enrolled in the study. A random number table will be used to&#xD;
      randomly assign participants to either the eye movement (EM+) or no eye movement (EM-) group.&#xD;

      X X&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention All participants will complete 10 treatment sessions (three preparatory&#xD;
      sessions, six 3MDR sessions and one concluding session; see Table 1), led by a therapist who&#xD;
      has been completed training in the conduct of this form of therapy, with the only difference&#xD;
      between the intervention groups being the presence (EM+) or absence (EM-) of the eye movement&#xD;
      component. Dr. Eric Vermetten, head of research at the Military Mental Health unit of the&#xD;
      Netherlands Ministry of Defense, and one of the developers of the 3MDR system, will conduct&#xD;
      the training of all study therapists, will ensure that they are fully prepared to carry out&#xD;
      the treatment protocol using the study manual he wrote, and he will provide regular&#xD;
      supervision for the study therapists throughout the conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparatory Session 1: Research personnel will explain the upcoming 3MDR therapy sessions.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to identify 14 photographs, as well as two songs. The photographs&#xD;
      may be digital, hard copy, or downloaded from the internet, and should be related to or&#xD;
      reminiscent of the participant's traumatic experience. Each of the two songs are selected for&#xD;
      specific purposes and will be played in their entirety during each of the 3MDR sessions. The&#xD;
      first song is intended to bring them back to the time in which the trauma occurred; for&#xD;
      example, for a service member with combat-related PTSD, this might be a song that they&#xD;
      listened to a lot during their deployment. This will be played at the start of the 3MDR&#xD;
      session while the participant walks at a comfortable pace through a virtual environment,&#xD;
      before any of their pictures are displayed. The second song, on the other hand, is&#xD;
      specifically chosen in order to bring them back to the present time, to remind them they are&#xD;
      safe and are in the present moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparatory Session 2: The participant will share their photographs and music selections with&#xD;
      the therapist. If the participant has difficulty identifying a sufficient number of&#xD;
      appropriate photographs, the therapist will work with the participant during this session to&#xD;
      identify why they may not have been able to come up with a sufficient number, and to help&#xD;
      them find suitable options. This could include conducting online searches for publicly&#xD;
      available pictures, including such options as Google Maps images of the area in which their&#xD;
      trauma occurred. Sometimes, difficulty in the selection of pictures is a manifestation of the&#xD;
      avoidance of any reminders of the traumatic, which is a cardinal feature of PTSD. The&#xD;
      therapist may at this time explore the avoidance, if it is perceived to be a significant&#xD;
      factor, and help the participant to work through and overcome it to a sufficient degree to&#xD;
      identify suitable pictures to use in the treatment sessions. While the selection of songs&#xD;
      does not usually pose as significant a challenge, the therapist will also review the&#xD;
      participant's song selections, discuss why they were chosen, and try to ensure that the songs&#xD;
      selected are suitable to take the participant back to the trauma, and then bring them back to&#xD;
      the present and help them differentiate past from present, respectively. The therapist will&#xD;
      then guide the participant to arrange their photographs according to their subjective units&#xD;
      of distress (SUDS; Wolp,1969). The SUDS is a verbal self-report rating of subjective distress&#xD;
      on a scale from 0-10, with 0 indicating no distress, and 10 representing maximum distress.&#xD;
      The SUDS scale will be explained verbally to the participant and is not given via pencil and&#xD;
      paper format. This will be used to rank the pictures for use during 3MDR treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparatory Session 3: Participants will be introduced to, and familiarized with, the CAREN&#xD;
      system (e.g., standing, shifting weight, and walking) located at the National Intrepid Center&#xD;
      of Excellence (NICoE). Participants will be fitted by the engineer with a safety harness that&#xD;
      will be worn for the entirety of each session that a participant is on the CAREN platform. In&#xD;
      this session, a series of introductory applications will be used to familiarize the&#xD;
      participant with the CAREN, which will take less than five minutes to perform. A short&#xD;
      practice 3MDR session with a non-affecting photograph (e.g., a flower) will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3MDR Sessions 1-6: A 3MDR trained therapist, as well as a CAREN engineer, will be present at&#xD;
      every 3MDR therapy session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since sessions only include level treadmill walking, the platform will be disengaged with the&#xD;
      bridge extended, as opposed to being separated from the main floor and set up to enable&#xD;
      left-right and forward-backward shifts from the horizontal. This will minimize equipment&#xD;
      noise and facilitate the communication between the therapist and participant. For participant&#xD;
      monitoring and objective data collection, heart rate and kinematic data will be collected. A&#xD;
      chest strap heart rate monitor will be worn by the participant throughout the session (Polar&#xD;
      Electro Inc., Woodbury, NY; Zephyr Performance Systems, Annapolis, MD). Reflective motion&#xD;
      capture markers will be placed on the participant's head, torso, and legs to measure&#xD;
      biomechanics collected via motion capture cameras (Motion Analysis Inc., Santa Rosa, CA) that&#xD;
      surround the CAREN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be fitted with an adjustable safety harness that fits comfortably over&#xD;
      the shoulders. There is a risk of skin chafing if there is a lot of movement and the harness&#xD;
      is not fitted properly. Each participant will be asked if they are comfortable throughout the&#xD;
      study to mitigate this risk. The safety harness will be slipped into the safety support on&#xD;
      the CAREN, which allows the participant to walk freely on the treadmill, but it does not&#xD;
      allow them to walk off the platform. There is also a safety bar in front of the participant.&#xD;
      The therapist will stand next to the participant during the session, on the edge of the&#xD;
      platform but not on the treadmill. Up to seven pictures will be selected based on the&#xD;
      participant's SUDS scores and/or themes agreed upon for each session. Pictures may be&#xD;
      repeated during a session, reducing the number of pictures used for some sessions; this will&#xD;
      be at the discretion of the treating therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session has three phases: warm-up, intervention, and cool-down. The participant's&#xD;
      preferred walking speed will be used to start the warm-up phase (2-5 min) and can be adjusted&#xD;
      as needed. During this phase, the participant will virtually walk along an outdoor pathway&#xD;
      toward a door while their chosen opening song plays to bring them back to a time of their&#xD;
      trigger, as verbal guidance from their therapist prepares them for the intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAREN system will be operated by a Biomedical Engineer, Sarah Kruger, who has been&#xD;
      operating CAREN systems since 2007, and is certified by Motekforce Link. Motekforce Link is&#xD;
      the manufacturer of the CAREN system. Motekforce Link provides CAREN operators with training&#xD;
      and also verifies competencies required for system operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During utilization, the system is operated by a certified CAREN Operator and per protocol, at&#xD;
      no time will the system be operated with less than two staff members in the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      System checks are run daily by the CAREN Operator. All equipment is calibrated and&#xD;
      maintained. Personnel from Motekforce Link visit annually to verify that everything is&#xD;
      working properly and make any changes that are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention phase (50-55 min), the participant passes through an initial hallway&#xD;
      leading to an open door that in turn leads them down a second hallway to approach their first&#xD;
      picture, while being guided by the therapist with regard to what to do at each stage. The&#xD;
      picture appears in the distance, but gradually becomes larger as they get closer to it, until&#xD;
      it fills their field of vision. As soon as the participant is able to see the picture&#xD;
      clearly, the therapist will request that they provide a detailed description of what the&#xD;
      picture represents to them, and will then go on to ask the participant about their related&#xD;
      memories and feelings. The therapist will verbally repeat key feelings and phrases that seem&#xD;
      to carry particular meaning and resonance for the participant, so the CAREN engineer can type&#xD;
      these words into the computer to have them appear superimposed over the picture (stage 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those in the EM+ intervention group, the EM component will start after the participant&#xD;
      has confirmed there are no more new feelings or words to be identified with the picture, and&#xD;
      the therapist has asked the participant to read each of these words aloud, after which the&#xD;
      engineer will remove the words from the screen but retain the picture. At this point a red&#xD;
      ball will start at the left edge of the screen, and will move across the screen fairly&#xD;
      rapidly from left to right, and upon reaching the right edge of the screen, a 2-digit number&#xD;
      will appear superimposed on the red ball in white font (stage 2). The ball will then reverse&#xD;
      course, passing from right to left, and the number will change as the ball meets the opposite&#xD;
      edge of the screen. The ball will continue to move back and forth and the number will change&#xD;
      every time the ball meets either edge of the screen. The participant will be asked to track&#xD;
      the ball and call out the numbers displayed on the ball. After approximately 60 seconds, the&#xD;
      distractor stimulus (ball image) is removed and a SUDS score is reported by the participant&#xD;
      and recorded by the CAREN operator (stage 3). The participant will then walk out of the&#xD;
      virtual hallway and onto an outdoor pathway that will lead them to another set of hallways,&#xD;
      leading in turn to another picture, and the stages are repeated. There will be no exposure to&#xD;
      the distractor stimulus (red ball) for those in the EM- intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last picture, the final phase of treatment (cool-down) begins (2-5 min). The&#xD;
      session concludes with a piece of music, chosen by the participant to bring them back to the&#xD;
      present time, typically a current favorite song of theirs. This music will be used to assist&#xD;
      the participant in returning back to the present moment, while the therapist simultaneously&#xD;
      provides them with positive feedback regarding their performance during the session, with a&#xD;
      goal of achieving a significantly reduced SUDS score, which is reassessed at the end of the&#xD;
      song.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the session, the CAREN operator will remove the safety harness from the&#xD;
      participant. Participants will also be able to stop the session at any time if they feel ill&#xD;
      or any motion sickness. A therapist-led discussion (approximately 15 minutes) with the&#xD;
      participant will then occur in a private room; open questions will be used to elicit how the&#xD;
      session was for the participant, and to discuss the purpose of re-experiencing to the&#xD;
      participant in this setting. Notes made by the therapist will be stored, identified by study&#xD;
      code and session number only, stored in password-protected files on a CAC-requiring computer.&#xD;
      The study therapist will ensure the participant has completely returned to the present&#xD;
      moment, has a reduced SUDS, and has ideally been able to attach a positive meaning to the&#xD;
      3MDR session. Participants will be asked to write their experiences and reflections down&#xD;
      following each session in a diary format. All sessions will be recorded and a report&#xD;
      summarizing the behavioral response to the intervention will be produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concluding Session: Participants will provide their perception of how beneficial the&#xD;
      treatment was, and if the current state of their symptoms will be discussed, with a focus on&#xD;
      to what degree they have or have not improved compared to prior to their participation in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the laboratory to complete follow-up assessments at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months. If participants are unable to return to the laboratory (i.e., no longer in the area),&#xD;
      they will be contacted via phone, and the study questionnaires will be completed&#xD;
      telephonically.&#xD;
