  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab, nivolumab, and&#xD;
      radiation therapy and how well they work in treating patients with advanced human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system&#xD;
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving&#xD;
      ipilimumab, nivolumab, and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with HPV&#xD;
      positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety, tolerability and feasibility of ipilimumab and nivolumab when&#xD;
      administered concurrently with reduced-field radiotherapy (intensity-modulated radiation&#xD;
      therapy [IMRT]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the clinical complete response rate to ipilimumab, nivolumab and IMRT with&#xD;
      reduced field at six months as indicated by fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission&#xD;
      tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) post completion of radiation therapy (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of subjects with&#xD;
      low-intermediate volume, local-regionally advanced, human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with ipilimumab, nivolumab and&#xD;
      reduced-field IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate overall response rate to six weeks of induction immunotherapy (IO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the frequency of pharyngeal dysphasia as measured by Dynamic Imaging (Dynamic&#xD;
      Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity [DIGEST]) grade on modified barium swallow (MBS) and&#xD;
      patient-reported symptoms (MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory [MDADI]) at 6 month, 1 and 2 years&#xD;
      after radiotherapy ([IMRT].&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure acute and chronic toxicities per Patient-Reported Outcomes Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE PRO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To measure acute toxicity profiles at the end of radiation therapy and IO and at 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To measure late toxicity profiles at 1 and 2 years. VI. To determine local and regional&#xD;
      control at 6 and 12 months. VII. To determine patterns of failure (local-regional relapse vs.&#xD;
      distant) at 1 and 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To determine overall survival (OS) at 1 and 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate associations between total mutational load, interferon (INF) gamma score, T&#xD;
      cell clonality at diagnosis with clinical response to induction, combination CTLA-4 PD-1&#xD;
      checkpoint blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate changes in the tumor immune microenvironment (CD8 + INF gamma score, T cell&#xD;
      clonality, in tumor biopsy specimens pre and post induction immunotherapy (IO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate dynamic changes in and clearance of oral HPV and cell-free deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (cfDNA) viral load during therapy and to investigate associations with PFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotypes and serum cytokine profiles&#xD;
      before and after induction IO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate changes in the T cell receptor repertoire in tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte&#xD;
      (TIL) and the peripheral blood in tumor biopsy specimens pre and post induction IO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV) of FDG-PET/CT&#xD;
      12-14 weeks after end of RT for 1 year and 2 year PFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and&#xD;
      ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every for 6 weeks for 2 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 1 of cycle 2,&#xD;
      patients also undergo IMRT 5 days a week (Monday-Friday) for 6 weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, every 3 months for&#xD;
      2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
