      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety, tolerability and activity of SXC-2023&#xD;
      when dosed for 6 weeks versus placebo in adult patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      Trichotillomania.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study&#xD;
      consisting of a screening period of up to 40 days, a 6 week randomized double-blind treatment&#xD;
      period, followed by an up to 2 week safety follow-up period after the last dose of study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of four treatment groups. Patients will participate for a&#xD;
      total of up to 10 weeks, including screening, the 6-week treatment period and follow-up.&#xD;
