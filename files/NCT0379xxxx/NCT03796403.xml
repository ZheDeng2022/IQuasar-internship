      The primary objective is to compare the postoperative pain between Bupivacaine peritoneal&#xD;
      Infiltration plus immediately postoperative intramuscular Diclofenac and Bupivacaine&#xD;
      peritoneal infiltration alone by using visual analogue score (VAS). The secondary objective&#xD;
      is to evaluate the time to first dose and the total amount of morphine requirement after the&#xD;
      operation in both groups.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Diclofenac is no longer recommend for intramuscular administration by the Medical Council of&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>randomized into two groups by simple random. In bupivacaine and diclofenac group (n=70), Twenty ml of bupivacaine was infiltrated into surgical-site peritoneum and diclofenac 75 mg was intramuscularly injected immediately after complete the procedure and the operative field was covered with sterile adhesive wound dressing. In the bupivacaine alone group (n=70), 20 ml of bupivacaine was infiltrated into surgical-site peritoneum before closure and a 3 ml of sterile water was intramuscularly injected immediately after complete the procedure. Intravenous morphine injection was given if the pain score was more than 6 in the first 24 hours. Post-operation; time to first request of pain medication, doses, side effects, and vital signs were recorded. VAS was recorded at 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours post-operation and patients' satisfied score was recorded after 24 hours post-operation.</intervention_model_description>
