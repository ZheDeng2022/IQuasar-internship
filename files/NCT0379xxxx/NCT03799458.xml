      Aim 1: To use magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in Veterans&#xD;
      and civilians with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and sensory postconcussive symptoms&#xD;
      (PCS) to demonstrate the mechanism of therapeutic benefit of HD-tDCS for sensory symptoms, as&#xD;
      shown by reliable changes in the activity of the cognitive control network (CCN) and sensory&#xD;
      system network (SSN) following stimulation; Aim 2: this intervention will result in long-term&#xD;
      improvements in measures of executive function, depression/anxiety, and quality of life.&#xD;

      Experimental Design and Methods Participants: 120 subjects will be recruited for this study&#xD;
      from the NM VA Health Care System and community, 40 healthy controls subjects for an&#xD;
      imaging-only group, and 80 mTBI subjects for the stimulation arm who have suffered injury at&#xD;
      least 3 months prior to study enrollment, but not more than 15 years prior to enrollment. All&#xD;
      participants will be 18-59 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Human participants (ages 18-59) will be invited to come to the University of New&#xD;
      Mexico (UNM) to ask questions prior to providing consent. They will be provided with consent&#xD;
      forms that describe the study procedures and potential risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed consent is obtained and the appropriate forms signed, the participant will be&#xD;
      assigned a unique research subject identifier (URSI) number, and from that point forward all&#xD;
      research data will only be labeled with the URSI number. The key linking identifiers of&#xD;
      participants to the URSI will be maintained on a separate database that will be stored behind&#xD;
      locked doors, in a locked filing cabinet in a secure area. All participants may then undergo&#xD;
      demographic data collection, neuropsychological assessments sensory evaluation, at UNM. They&#xD;
      may also undergo MEG and MRI at the Mind Research Network (MRN), located in the same&#xD;
      building.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic Data: As part of the initial assessment, basic demographic data regarding the&#xD;
      subject may be noted down, including age, gender, socioeconomic status, educational&#xD;
      attainment, handedness, use of common stimulants such as caffeine, and brain injury severity.&#xD;
      They may also be asked if they are willing to allow their medical record to be accessed, for&#xD;
      the purposes of confirming details about any traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well as&#xD;
      obtaining results of neuroimaging studies done at the time of injury or afterward. This will&#xD;
      include medical, surgical, neurological and psychiatric history, results of lab tests, brain&#xD;
      scans, electroencephalography tests, medication lists, information from doctor's visits and&#xD;
      hospital visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological testing procedures: All neuropsychological testing will be administered in&#xD;
      the Center for Brain Recovery and Repair Core by trained study personnel under direct&#xD;
      supervision of core directors. The following domains and tests will be administered:&#xD;
      Executive Abilities: Measures and Instruments for Neurobehavioral Evaluation and Research&#xD;
      (Examiner); Digit Span; Delis-Kaplan Executive Function Systems (DKEFS) Trail-making Test&#xD;
      Conditions 2 and 4; Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT); Frontal Systems Behavior Scale&#xD;
      (FrSBe); Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM); Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR); Digit&#xD;
      Symbol Coding; Handedness; Socioeconomic Status (SES); Patient's Global Impression of Change&#xD;
      (PGIC); Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory Assessment: Hearing, balance, and vision will be assessed using Common Data Element&#xD;
      (CDE) instruments, including the Hearing Handicap Assessment, the Test for Visual Discomfort,&#xD;
      the modified Balance Error Scoring System. Oculomotor control will be assessed using virtual&#xD;
      reality goggles (Oculus) with implanted eye trackers (iScan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetoencephalography: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) may be done after neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing. The participant will sit in the MEG scanner to record brain magnetic fields. MEG&#xD;
      setup takes between 10 and 30 minutes, and subsequent recording takes one hour. During MEG&#xD;
      assessments participants will complete numerous tasks. Each task is designed to parse&#xD;
      different cognitive mechanisms that contribute to sensory performance. In perceptual tasks,&#xD;
      participants will discriminate tone pitches amongst novel distracting tones (Auditory&#xD;
      Orienting Task; AOT). For eye movement tasks, participants are asked look either towards or&#xD;
      away from a visual stimulus (Pro- and Anti-saccades).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI scan(s) will be obtained for integration with MEG, as&#xD;
      needed for analyses. Total scan time, including participant setup and removal, is expected to&#xD;
      take 1 hour. Participants may lie down on a table and be placed into a long donut-shaped&#xD;
      magnet. During the scan, participants will be asked to rest quietly or to fixate on a dot on&#xD;
      a screen in front of them, or to perform a memory task. No contrast will be used. Any female&#xD;
      over 18 who thinks she may be pregnant will complete a urine pregnancy screen before the MRI&#xD;
      scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following initial testing, the participants in the stimulation arm of the study will receive&#xD;
      10 consecutive weekday sessions of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation. 2&#xD;
      milliamperes active or sham anodal current will be delivered to the left dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex for 30 minutes. During this time, participants will perform vision therapy&#xD;
      tasks through a virtual reality headset, or a computer-based working memory task. Skin&#xD;
      sensations will be assessed every 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post stimulation testing: the next available weekday following completion of the study&#xD;
      protocol, subjects will return to UNM to repeat the demographic, neuropsychological, sensory,&#xD;
      and imaging assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term followup: At 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after stimulation, subjects will be&#xD;
      contacted via telephone or meet in person, and will be administered the Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory (BDI-II), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Military (PCL-M), the&#xD;
      Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI), and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)&#xD;
      quality of life assessment tools utilized before and immediately after, after stimulation.&#xD;
      Veterans will undergo these study followup visits at NMVAHCS, and civilians at UNM.&#xD;
