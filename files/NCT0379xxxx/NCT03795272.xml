      To evaluate the efficacy of PARP inhibitor, rucaparib as maintenance therapy for locally&#xD;
      advanced cervical cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of concomitant cisplatin-based chemo-radiation for cervical cancer has improved&#xD;
      survival of locally advanced cervical cancer patients and has become the standard of care. A&#xD;
      meta-analysis revealed that the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radiation increased&#xD;
      the 5-year overall survival rate by 6% (HR 0.81: 60 vs 66%), and 5-year disease-free survival&#xD;
      rate by 8%, though there is still considerable need for improvement as most patients who&#xD;
      relapse are incurable. The unmet need is particularly higher in patients that are at high&#xD;
      risk of recurrence. The main negative prognostic factors are higher FIGO stage as well as the&#xD;
      presence of positive lymph nodes. Current studies are evaluating role of adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy following chemo-radiation in locally advanced disease and will possibly improve&#xD;
      survival by reducing risk of distant metastases, however at the cost of excessive toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARP inhibitors have shown considerable clinical benefit especially in platinum-sensitive&#xD;
      relapsed ovarian cancer. Several PARP inhibitors have been evaluated in other gynaecological&#xD;
      malignancies and three PARP inhibitors (olaparib, rucaparib &amp; niraparib) are approved by&#xD;
      European Medicines Agency and Food &amp; Drug Administration for treatment or as maintenance&#xD;
      therapy in ovarian cancer. Human papillomavirus causes oxidative stress that may result in&#xD;
      DNA single-strand breaks. In cervical cancer PARP-1 expression/activity may be up-regulated&#xD;
      in response to the ongoing oxidative stress (HPV and inflammation), and this may promote&#xD;
      progression. This may create a vicious circle of inflammation, PARP activation, NAD+&#xD;
      consumption, adenosine triphosphate consumption, necrosis, and inflammation. PARPi may limit&#xD;
      the role of PARP-1 in promoting inflammation and oxidative stress. There is theoretical&#xD;
      plausibility that PARPi may have a role in the treatment of cervical carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase II randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study will evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of rucaparib as adjuvant treatment for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer&#xD;
      who are responding to chemo-radiation. This investigator-initiated study will be performed&#xD;
      within the GCIG/ENGOT collaboration&#xD;
