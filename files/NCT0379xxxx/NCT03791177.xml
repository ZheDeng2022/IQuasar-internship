  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today music acts as an analgesic and anxiolytic in a safe, cheap and simple way. Several&#xD;
      trials have confirmed its potential administration and benefits in urology practice. We aimed&#xD;
      to assess the influence of music therapy on perceived anxiety and pain during outpatient&#xD;
      urodynamic study (UDS) using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the State-Trait Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory (STAI) in a prospective, randomized fashion&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urodynamic study (UDS) is often used to help urologists to evaluate the functions of bladder&#xD;
      and urethra in outpatient clinic.1 Although a UDS is a reliable tool for accurate diagnosis,&#xD;
      the process itself can be accompanied by discomfort and pain as it includes the positioning&#xD;
      the catheters urethral and rectally, and the bladder filling. Reports of having such invasive&#xD;
      outpatient process whilst awake may demonstrate pain and disquiet that result in incomplete&#xD;
      examinations and patient noncompliance2,3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various pharmacologic options including lidocaine gel and catheter tip lubrication for&#xD;
      urethral catheterization were used to relieve pain and anxiety during UDS. Besides, there are&#xD;
      some non-pharmalogical methods such as patient education, heating pad, music, distraction and&#xD;
      relaxation4-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music has been considered complementary treatment modality as cheap, safe and effective. In&#xD;
      various urological procedures including cystoscopy, transrectal prostate biopsy and&#xD;
      extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) music has been proven helpful on pain and&#xD;
      anxiety levels 7-10. However, current literature presents limited and controversial data&#xD;
      evaluating the influence of music on pain and anxiety perspective of the patient during UDS.&#xD;
      We, therefore, aimed to assess the effect of music on patient satisfaction in a analgesic and&#xD;
      anxiolytic way during UDS.&#xD;

    <description>A total of 70 patients were included in the study. Using simple randomization method, the patients were acknowledged about the aim of the study and the cards with letters C (control) and S (study) were placed in closed envelopes and the patients were asked to draw a random envelope. After the draw, two groups were formed according to the letter as group I consisted of patients with C letter and group II consisted of patients with S letter.</description>

    <description>Patients in the study group were exposed to flute music therapy (Sufi musical recital - Huseyni mode) at low tempo (60-80 rhythm / min) with weak beats and calm rhythms during the UDS.&#xD;
This audition involves both vocal and instrumental music performed by a reed flute called 'Ney'. A competent lecturer who was specialized in music suggested all the musical compositions during the therapy</description>
