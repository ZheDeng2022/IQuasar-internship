  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth most important cause of death&#xD;
      worldwide and is one of the commonest non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Nepal. The presence&#xD;
      of risk factors like indoor and outdoor air pollution, the high prevalence of smoking and&#xD;
      lack of general awareness of COPD makes it a serious public health concern. However, no&#xD;
      attempt has been made in Nepal to estimate its burden and address the disease at the&#xD;
      community level. This community-based cluster randomized controlled study aims to fulfil that&#xD;
      gap through mobilization of Female Community Health Workers (FCHVs) who will be trained to&#xD;
      perform a certain set of health promotion activities aimed at prevention of the disease and&#xD;
      its progression. Baseline and follow-up surveys will be conducted to compare the intervention&#xD;
      and control groups. This study has the potential to generate evidence in helping address NCDs&#xD;
      in Nepal and also other similar resource-limited countries.&#xD;
