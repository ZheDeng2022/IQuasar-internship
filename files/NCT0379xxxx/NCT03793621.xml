  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI 730357&#xD;
      in Japanese healthy male subjects following oral administration of single rising doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the explorations of the pharmacokinetic(s) (PK), including dose&#xD;
      proportionality as well as investigation of linearity of BI 730357 after single dose&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
