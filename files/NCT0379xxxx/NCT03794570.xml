  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized control trial examining the effect of&#xD;
      blood flow restriction (BFR) therapy on reducing post-operative quadriceps atrophy in&#xD;
      patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Following ACLR,&#xD;
      patients will undergo a rehabilitation protocol either w/ BFR therapy or sham BFR therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to either BFR therapy or no BFR therapy. Randomization will be&#xD;
      carried out using block randomization with blocks of 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those undergoing BFR therapy will have a Delfi Personalized Tourniquet System (PTS) cuff&#xD;
      applied to the proximal thigh of their operative leg and inflated to 80% limb occlusive&#xD;
      pressure (LOP) calculated by the Delfi PTS device during physical therapy (PT) sessions from&#xD;
      day 2 after surgery through day 7 after surgery. Those in the no BFR group will have the&#xD;
      Delfi PTS cuff applied to their proximal thigh with inflation of the tourniquet to minimal&#xD;
      pressure only. BFR therapy will be administered by health care providers who have undergone&#xD;
      training and certification for BFR therapy with the Delfi PTS device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will undergo the following PT regimen two times daily beginning on the day after&#xD;
      the surgical procedure and lasting for 6 weeks post-operatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quad sets = x1 min isometric hold, 30 sec off, 3 sets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Terminal knee extensions = 3x15, 30 sec rest or short arc quads sitting 1 x 30 + 3 x 15,&#xD;
           30 sec rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once range of motion (ROM) allows: Bike 10 mins, low to no resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each physical therapy visit will last approximately 60 minutes. During that time, there will&#xD;
      be a total estimated time of 5-7 minutes during which the tourniquet cuff will be on the&#xD;
      thigh, and the tourniquet will be inflated for a similar time period. The tourniquet will&#xD;
      inflate for about 1 minute in order to find out the specific pressure for the patient's leg&#xD;
      and then will remain inflated until exercises are completed, which should take 4-6 minutes.&#xD;
      The cuff will then be deflated and is removed from the leg within about 30 seconds of being&#xD;
      deflated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have MRI performed pre-operatively and at 6 weeks post-operatively with axial&#xD;
      cuts to 50% femoral length above joint line. Quadriceps cross-sectional area will be measured&#xD;
      by a blinded observer using MRI. Patients will have clinical measurements including thigh&#xD;
      girth, Lachman test, knee joint range of motion, and knee joint swelling performed&#xD;
      pre-operatively, at post-op day 1, post-op day 14, and 6 weeks post-operatively. All clinical&#xD;
      measurements will be performed by a blinded observer. Additionally, patient reported pain&#xD;
      level will be obtained at the same timepoints in which clinical measurements are performed&#xD;
      using visual analog scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure there are no nerve injuries present in patients prior to undergoing&#xD;
      application and inflation of thigh tourniquet, all patients in the study will have single&#xD;
      shot adductor and/or sciatic nerve blocks to ensure 24 hour period without nerve block prior&#xD;
      to initiation of BFR therapy. Patients included in the study cannot have a nerve block&#xD;
      lasting longer than the day of surgery. To ensure no new nerve deficits are present, the&#xD;
      patients will undergo a physical examination during morning rounding on post-operative day 1&#xD;
      to assess for new nerve deficits.&#xD;
