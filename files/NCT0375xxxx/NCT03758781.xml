  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the safety of IRX-2 Regimen combined with Nivolumab in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent metastatic solid tumors. Researchers believe that this combination will have a&#xD;
      tolerable safety profile and will increase the response rate in comparison to Nivolumab&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first phase of this trial is to establish the safety of IRX-2 Regimen combined with&#xD;
      Nivolumab. The IRX-2 Regimen is a 21-day regimen of cyclophosophamide on Day 1 and&#xD;
      subcutaneous IRX-2 injections for 10 days between Days 4 and 18. If no dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs) are observed during the first 4 weeks of treatment, the enrollment will&#xD;
      continue in a dose expansion phase. If there is a study treatment related DLT in 1 of 6&#xD;
      patients, the same dose will be investigated at the dose expansion cohorts. If study&#xD;
      treatment related DLT is observed in 2 of 6 patients, accrual will be stopped and new dose&#xD;
      levels or treatment sequences will be considered.&#xD;
