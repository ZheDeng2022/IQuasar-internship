    <textblock>
      The research is a collaborative project by HKU and Yan Chai Hospital, funded by Social&#xD;
      Welfare Development Fund of HKSAR. The study is designed as a prospective randomized control&#xD;
      trial with the primary objective to investigate the efficacy of pediatric tuina (massage) on&#xD;
      the functional constipation of pre-school aged children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is a pragmatic research comparing the pediatrictuina(massage)treatment with care as&#xD;
      usual, with the objectives of investigating&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. if a non-invasive, easy to learn pediatrictuina (massage) protocol could improve the&#xD;
           constipation and related symptoms experienced by the pre-school age children&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. if there is a positive impact on the caregiver-children relationship and the children's&#xD;
           behaviour (a sub-group analysis) when the constipation symptoms improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects of this study are pre-school age children (age 2-6) who are serviced by Yan Chai&#xD;
      Hospital Social Service Department (YCHSS).The subjects will be openly recruited through the&#xD;
      service units serving pre-school aged children under YCHSS. Rome IV criteria will be used to&#xD;
      identify the children who suffer from constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Trial Design This is a multicentre, pragmatic randomized control trial (PRCT) with a&#xD;
      prospective design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applying regular pediatrictuina (massage) (3 times a week, for 4 weeks ) on pre-school aged&#xD;
      children with functional constipation will improve one or more of the following symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of defecations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Episode of incontinence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Excessive stool retention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Painful or hard bowel movements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum that may obstruct the toilet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stress level of the caregiver of the study subjects improve as the constipation syndrome&#xD;
      of the subjects improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children with behavior problem who suffered from constipation will have less behavior&#xD;
      issue when their functional constipation syndromes improved&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total 160 pre-school aged children with functional constipation and their caregiver will be&#xD;
      openly recruited from the institutions/service units operated by the pediatric service unit&#xD;
      of Yan Chai Hospital Social Service Department.The recruited children must suffer from&#xD;
      functional constipation symptoms (based on Rome IV criteria). All accepted subjects will be&#xD;
      in dyad. (i.e. 1 pre-school aged child and his designated caregiver, who commits bring the&#xD;
      child to attend all treatment and assessment sessions, respond to all caregivers' assessment&#xD;
      and fill in the daily logbook).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All applications will be screened by the social workers in the centres based on the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria. Qualified applicants will be invited for a health assessment&#xD;
      conducted by registered TCM practitioner in the research team to confirm their suitability&#xD;
      and invite them to sign the consent form. The consented dyad will be allocated randomly into&#xD;
      treatment group and waitlist control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Intervention A 10 minutes structured pediatric massage protocol with specific&#xD;
      applications technique will be performed on the children allocated to the treatment group&#xD;
      three times a week for 4 consecutive weeks by trained TCM practitioners in the service units&#xD;
      of YCHSS. The caregivers of the children need to participate in all assessment sessions and&#xD;
      fill in the log book provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1st 4 weeks, the children in the waitlist control group will not receive any&#xD;
      pediatrictuina (massage). After the dyad completed the assessment sessions at baseline and&#xD;
      week 4 ,(served as Treatment-as-Usual Control), children in the control group will receive&#xD;
      the same 4 weeks of pediatric massage as the treatment group. The data collected before the&#xD;
      treatment begins at week 4 will serve as the 2nd baseline for the waitlist control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment protocol involve 8 steps.The massage area focuses on the abdomen and lower back&#xD;
      of the recipients. All the movements/steps selected are well established and commonly used in&#xD;
      the TCM practices. Any movement that demand professional training or involve potential risk&#xD;
      is excluded from the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Measurement of efficacy Efficacy of the treatments will be measured in multi dimensions&#xD;
      before and after the treatment for both groups. The main outcome measures are defecation&#xD;
      frequency per week, fecal incontinence frequency per week, and overall treatment success&#xD;
      after 4 weeks intervention, 8 weeks intervention and 12 weeks (4 weeks after intervention&#xD;
      stopped) Secondary outcome measures included&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  abdominal pain and painful defecation based on bowel diary,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the children's subjective level of pain during bowel movement,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  score of child behavior questionnaire and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  score of caregiver impact and burden&#xD;
