  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute rejection (AR) is still one of the major complications after kidney transplantation.&#xD;
      The current diagnosis measure for AR is primarily pathological puncture test and hematuria&#xD;
      biomarker detection, yet due to their inferior performance on timeliness, the allograft&#xD;
      kidneys usually have been in severe conditions when the diagnoses take place. Donor derived&#xD;
      cell free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is utilized as a measure for &quot;liquid biopsy&quot;, it can predict acute&#xD;
      rejection at very early periods, and it is easy to operate, with fewer invasive injuries, and&#xD;
      can reflect related conditions in a timely manner, etc.. This study plans to utilize&#xD;
      second-generation sequencing technology to systematically evaluate the abundance variations&#xD;
      of nuclear genome and mitocondria derived dd-cfDNA in the kidney transplant recipients' blood&#xD;
      and urine, thus it can assist in accumulating more proof for the clinical utilization of&#xD;
      dd-cfDNA from different sources at the early stages of AR in evidence-based medicine, and lay&#xD;
      foundation for the development of dd-cfDNA based early-stage rejection detection tools&#xD;
      afterkidney transplantation surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With the growing development of kidney transplant technologies and immunosuppressive&#xD;
      therapies, the number of end-stage renal disease patients receiving kidney transplant has&#xD;
      been increasing. Acute rejection (AR) is one of the main complications for kidney&#xD;
      transplantation, and AR is the major reason for lowering graft survival rate and for graft&#xD;
      malfunction, thus the timely detection of AR and early interventions are crucial. The current&#xD;
      clinical measures for the detection of AR include pathological puncture test and hematuria&#xD;
      biomarker detection. Yet pathological tests are invasive, limited to sampling errors and the&#xD;
      existing perception differences among observants, and with other disadvantages such as&#xD;
      expensiveness, poor patient compliance, and related complications. Hematuria biomarker&#xD;
      detection is slow in response and low in the sensitivity and specificity for reflecting the&#xD;
      organs' metabolic index in the diagnosis of acute rejection injury. Though the monitoring of&#xD;
      immunosuppressant drugs, immune molecules and cytokines in the blood circulation can both&#xD;
      provide certain value for the evaluation of patients' immune status after organ transplant,&#xD;
      these factors are not good indicators for the early-stage diagnosis of allograft injury.&#xD;
      Donor derived cell free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is utilized as a measure for &quot;liquid biopsy&quot;, it is&#xD;
      easy to operate, with less invasiveness, and it can reflect related conditions in a timely&#xD;
      manner, etc.. This measure can detect the injury degree for allograft, and the index will&#xD;
      rise before fluctuation reflection of the syndrome and related laboratory indexes, which is&#xD;
      crucial for the very early-stage diagnosis of allograft acute rejection, and the further&#xD;
      prevention of allograft injury. In the mean time, dd-cfDNA assumes high utilization value for&#xD;
      the monitoring of immunosuppressive conditions, and therefore providing instructions for the&#xD;
      optimization of the immunosuppressive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

      peripheral blood from the recipients using cfDNA blood collection tubes, and 10 to 15 ml of&#xD;
      midstream urine are collected respectively.&#xD;

           visits, 8 to 10 ml of EDTA anticoagulant, 10 to 15 ml of midstream urine, 5 ml of saliva&#xD;
           are collected before the treatment, 1 week and 2 weeks after the adjustment of the&#xD;
           anti-rejection treatment, 8 to 10 ml of blood using cfDNA blood collection tubes, 10 to&#xD;
           15 ml of midstream urine, 5 ml of saliva are collected respectively.&#xD;
