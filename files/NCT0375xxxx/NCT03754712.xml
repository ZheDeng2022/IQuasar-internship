    <textblock>
      Several studies suggested low serum levels of vitamin D have been associated with depression.&#xD;
      So, the present study is designed to investigate the effect of vitamin D administration along&#xD;
      with SSRIs in patients with MDD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a major global health problem. Major depression was ranked as the third leading&#xD;
      cause of the global burden of diseases in 2004 and is supposed to occupy the first place by&#xD;
      2030. Major depression is a complex and multifactorial symptom-complex while dysfunctions in&#xD;
      various endocrine axes may be independent risk factors in the development of the affective&#xD;
      illness. Some recent observations indicate a significant role of vitamin D regarding mood.&#xD;
      Vitamin D3 receptors have been found in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and the limbic system.&#xD;
      The active form of vitamin D on the nervous system is associated with modifying the&#xD;
      production and release of neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) which is&#xD;
      essential for neuron differentiation, as well as increasing the levels of glial cell line&#xD;
      derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Vitamin D influence the expression of genes associated&#xD;
      GABA-ergic neurotransmission. It also stimulates the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase which&#xD;
      is responsible for catecholamines biosynthesis. Lately, positive influences of vitamin D upon&#xD;
      patients suffering from MDD have been suggested. This area require further attention and&#xD;
      confirmation as little work has been carried out in this field. So, the present study is an&#xD;
      attempt to investigate the effect of vitamin D administration along with SSRIs in patients&#xD;
      with MDD. The study would be a interventional one to be conducted in the department of&#xD;
      Pharmacology and in the department of psychiatry, BSMMU. A total of 90 patients suffering&#xD;
      from major depression will be selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of patients suffering from major depression and the selection of SSRIs would be&#xD;
      performed by medical officer of the Psychiatry department. After completing necessary&#xD;
      formalities including informed consent of the patients, patient's data will be collected to&#xD;
      measure baseline complaints of depression. The patients would be divided into two groups:&#xD;
      group A and B. Group A would consist of 45 patients who will receive only SSRIs and Group B&#xD;
      would consist of 45 patients who will receive SSRIs plus vitamin D (2000IU) orally once&#xD;
      daily. Blood sample will be collected to measure serum vitamin D and calcium level at&#xD;
      baseline. Then again blood sample will be collected to measure serum vitamin D level after 8&#xD;
      weeks of vitamin D administration. Regularity of medicine intake will be ensured over&#xD;
      telephone, pill count, and from the patient's compliance sheet. The study has entails almost&#xD;
      no potential risk to the patients. Patients would have every right to quit the experimental&#xD;
      procedure any time during the experimentations if they desire each. However, it will be&#xD;
      explained to them that the results of the present study may offer better prospects for&#xD;
      similar patients in future, and that the present experimentations would carry no potential&#xD;
      risk towards their health or their lives provided they strictly follow the instructions&#xD;
      conducted to them.&#xD;
