      Objective of this protocol will be to evaluate the parameters related to the function of the&#xD;
      musculoskeletal and cardiorespiratory system, through a rehabilitation and training program&#xD;
      for people with acquired central nervous system and multiple sclerosis. The study will&#xD;
      consist of volunteers with acquired CNS lesions and multiple sclerosis of both sexes, between&#xD;
      18 and 85 years old, and who wander with or without aid devices, randomly divided into 3&#xD;
      groups: Group 1 (cardiopulmonary treatment), Group 2 (cardiopulmonary treatment and&#xD;
      transcranial photobiomodulation application) and Group 3 (cardiopulmonary treatment and&#xD;
      placebo laser). All groups will receive aerobic training on a treadmill (Moviment®) with the&#xD;
      aid of a suspension equipment (BrainMov® Physical Activity Station). The transcranial&#xD;
      photobiomodulation (laser diode, λ = 810 nm, beam area 0.028 cm², power of 100 mW, power&#xD;
      density of 3.5 mW / cm², energy of 3 Joules / point and energy density of 107.1 J / cm2) will&#xD;
      be applied on the skin / scalp and the International System 10-20 at points F7, F8 and AFz&#xD;
      will be used as reference for irradiation. Muscular activation, heart rate variability, lung&#xD;
      volumes and capacities, fatigability, exercise tolerance, cognition and quality of life will&#xD;
      be evaluated before, during, at the end and after two months of rehabilitation. The treatment&#xD;
      proposed in this study, using transcranial photobiomodulation, is expected to improve muscle,&#xD;
      sensory, cardiorespiratory, cognitive functions and to interfere positively in the quality of&#xD;
      life of the volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central nervous system (CNS) diseases can be acquired (such as stroke, spinal cord injury,&#xD;
      and traumatic brain injury) or non-acquired (such as multiple sclerosis). Many diseases that&#xD;
      affect the CNS can be fatal or cause sequelae, which affect the sensorimotor,&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory and the quality of life of the individual. Subjects with neurological&#xD;
      lesions present low resistance to exercise, a factor that can be attributed to decreased&#xD;
      muscle recruitment, oxidative and metabolic capacity reduction, low aerobic resistance and&#xD;
      increased energy expenditure. With that in mind, treatment proposals such as aerobic training&#xD;
      and gait training with or without weight loss can maximize and restore the individual's&#xD;
      functional abilities through active learning. Cardiorespiratory fitness in this patient&#xD;
      profile has benefits in terms of fatigue retardation, gait improvement and regulation of the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system. Aerobic exercises change the heart rhythm, increase vascularity and&#xD;
      provide oxygen. The association of these factors promote cerebral neuroprotective effect,&#xD;
      stimulate the production of endogenous neutrotransmitters related to general well-being and&#xD;
      favor neuroplasticity. Low-intensity laser therapy, especially transcranial&#xD;
      photobiomodulation, has shown benefits in animals and humans such as cognitive and memory&#xD;
      improvement, improvement in the behavioral picture, such as attenuation of depression and&#xD;
      anxiety, and cortical oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that will compare&#xD;
      the effect of cardiorespiratory rehabilitation, cardiorespiratory rehabilitation and&#xD;
      low-intensity laser therapy, cardiorespiratory rehabilitation and placebo laser. It is worth&#xD;
      mentioning that the use of a Placebo Therapy is restricted to Low Power Laser irradiation.&#xD;
      This means that the three experimental groups will effectively be treated with&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory rehabilitation, a therapy that improves physical fitness. The treatment&#xD;
      with transcranial photobiomodulation irradiation aims to verify the effects and aggregates&#xD;
      greater beneficial to the volunteers. In this case, the magnitude of the laser effect must be&#xD;
      calculated by the difference (if any) of the group treated with &quot;cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      rehabilitation + laser&quot; subtracted from the group treated with &quot;cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      rehabilitation + laser Placebo&quot;.&#xD;
