      The aim of this study is to compare three different modalities for treatment of symptomatic 2&#xD;
      ° to 3 ° haemorrhoids: open haemorrhoidectomy, intrahaemorrhoidal laser procedure and&#xD;
      haemorrhoidal pedicle ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess early outcomes (after one week and one month) of the procedures: pain, bleeding,&#xD;
      wound healing, return to work and quality of life; To assess late outcomes (after one year)&#xD;
      of the procedures: late functional results (continence) and recurrence of symptoms and&#xD;
      haemorrhoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a multi-center, double-blind, prospective RCT comparing three different&#xD;
      modalities for treatment of symptomatic 2 ° to 3 ° haemorrhoids: open haemorrhoidectomy,&#xD;

      Hemorrhoidal pedicle ligation vs laser hemorrhoidectomy vs open hemorrhoidectomy: randomized,&#xD;
      double blind, multicenter trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to compare three different modalities for&#xD;
      treatment of symptomatic 2 to 3 ° haemorrhoids: open haemorrhoidectomy, intrahaemorrhoidal&#xD;
      laser procedure and haemorrhoidal pedicle ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess early outcomes (after one week and one month) of the procedures: pain, bleeding,&#xD;
      wound healing, return to work and quality of life; To assess late outcomes (after one year)&#xD;
      of the procedures: late functional results (continence) and recurrence of symptoms and&#xD;
      haemorrhoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design This is a randomized, parallel group (1:1:1)&#xD;
      double-blinded single centre prospective study. No changes in methods of the study were&#xD;
      allowed after commen cement. This RCT compares three different modalities for treatment of&#xD;
      symptomatic 2 to 3 ° haemorrhoids: open haemorrhoidectomy, intrahaemorrhoidal laser&#xD;
      coagulation and haemorrhoidal artery ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients This prospective randomized study was performed at Vilnius University Hospital&#xD;
      Santara Clinics, Vilnius, Lithuania. It is a large tertiary University hospital with&#xD;
      dedicated outpatient clinic. A period of 3 year starting from April 2015 to November 2018. A&#xD;
      total of 121 patients are included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with symptomatic 2nd or 3rd ° hemorrhoids, in 1st or 2nd risk group of ASA (American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologists), who consented to participate in this study were included into&#xD;
      the study. Exclusion criteria were 1st or 4th °of hemorrhoids, pregnancy, patients with other&#xD;
      anorectal diseases (fistula, abscess, rectal carcinoma, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.),&#xD;
      patients after previous anal operations (except rubber band ligation, which should have&#xD;
      occurred more than 3 months before the inclusion in the trial) and ≥ 3rd risk group of ASA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative evaluation Detailed physical and anorectal examination was performed with&#xD;
      anoscopy and rigid proctoscopy in all cases, as well as colonoscopy if indicated. All&#xD;
      patients filled a dedicated symptom questionnaire, which included questions on intensity and&#xD;
      frequency of hemorrhoidal prolapse, bleeding, itching, pain and other symptoms. Every patient&#xD;
      completed Wexner incontinence score and SF-36 questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative examination, classification, operation technique, postoperative treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up are discussed at the introductory course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients preoperatively fill questionnaires on the quality of life and defecation function&#xD;
      (Patient symptoms scale, Cleveland clinic incontinence scale, Health survey - SF 36, Fecal&#xD;
      incontinence quality of life instrument - FIQol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient symptoms scale (appendix 1) - symptoms of haemorrhoids are assessed (rectal bleeding,&#xD;
      pain, pile prolapse, defecation disturbances, discomfort affecting normal life). Each symptom&#xD;
      gets a number from 1 - very intense to 5 - no complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cleveland clinic incontinence scale (appendix 2) - the sum of 5 parameters is determined that&#xD;
      are scored on a scale from 0 (=absent) to 4 (daily) frequency of incontinence to gas, liquid,&#xD;
      solid, of need to wear pad, and of lifestyle changes. A score of 0 means perfect control, a&#xD;
      score of 20 - complete incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health survey - SF 36 (appendix 3) - it measures eight domains: physical functioning, role&#xD;
      limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems,&#xD;
      energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, general health. For each of&#xD;
      the eight domains that the SF36 measures an aggregate percentage score is produced. The&#xD;
      percentage scores range from 0% (lowest or worst possible level of functioning) to 100%&#xD;
      (highest or best possible level of functioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal incontinence quality of life instrument - FIQol (appendix 4) -scale consists of 29&#xD;
      questions in 4 domains: lifestyle, coping/behavior, depression/self perception,&#xD;
      embarrassment. Category ranges: 1 to 4 for lifestyle, coping/behavior, and embarrassment; 1&#xD;
      to 6 for depression/self perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, blinding and concealment The patients were randomized into three groups.&#xD;
      Randomization sequence was computer-generated before the start of the trial. Every&#xD;
      consecutive case&#xD;
&#xD;
      -history was assigned a randomization number (1, 2 or 3). It was written and sealed within&#xD;
      the envelope and remained unknown neither to the patient, nor to the treating physician, to&#xD;
      avoid selection bias. In the operating room, after induction of anesthesia, operating room&#xD;
      junior staff was asked to unseal the envelope and the intervention was performed according to&#xD;
      the procedure assigned. Pre- and postoperative patient management was identical in all three&#xD;
      operations. The patient remained unaware of the procedure performed until the end of the&#xD;
      study 1 year after the operation. The case-notes and discharge summary of the patient&#xD;
      contained only the note, saying that the patient is included in the study of hemorrhoids with&#xD;
      D.Danys/T.Poskus as Principal Investigators, patient's number is X. This number was within&#xD;
      the locked and coded database and the staff, evaluating the result of the patients' treatment&#xD;
      remained unaware of the procedure allocated. The patients were followed-up by different&#xD;
      surgeons (E.P. and V.J.) than the ones, performing the operation. They had the access to the&#xD;
      patient notes but not to the coded database, and were not able to know, which procedure was&#xD;
      performed. In emergency situations, un-blinding of the patient and treating physicians was&#xD;
      possible but was not required in any of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative procedure Patients were started on lactulose the day before the operation, which&#xD;
      was continued after the operation to have regular bowel movements. Preoperative intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylaxis was given according to the hospital protocol, which was 1g of&#xD;
      Cephazolin (2g if patient was over 80 kg of weight), 240 mg of gentamycin and 500 mg of&#xD;
      metronidazole (Ciprofloxacin can be used if patient is allergic to cephalosporins). Each&#xD;
      surgeon performing operative procedures (T.P., D.D. and S.M.) had personal experience of at&#xD;
      least 50 operations of each modality. 1 hour seminar was conducted between all surgeons&#xD;
      before the start of the trial to unify the technique of operative procedures.All patients&#xD;
      were photographed after induction of anesthesia before the start of the procedure and&#xD;
      immediately after the procedure.LHP was performed using Ceralas diode laser of 1420 nm&#xD;
      wavelength (Biolitec). Disposable LHP kit (Biolitec) was used, which contains sharp-tipped&#xD;
      laser fiber and anoscope. Perianal skin immediately aboral to hemorrhoid was penetrated using&#xD;
      needle-tip cautery (Figure 2). Laser fiber was introduced into the opening until the level of&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal pedicle and coagulation was activated. 8 Watt 3 second pulses with 1 second&#xD;
      pulse-pauses were used to coagulate the area of hemorrhoids. 5 mm of hemorrhoidal tissue is&#xD;
      coagulated with one such pulse (experimental data). 250 Joules was the upper limit of energy&#xD;
      delivered per 1 hemorrhoidal quadrant. Smaller hemorrhoids were treated with less energy,&#xD;
      larger ones - with more energy. The procedure was repeated in three other quadrants, thus&#xD;
      treating all anal circumference. RAR was performed as described by Schurmann JP et al. For&#xD;
      these patients, the ligations were placed in the area of visible pathologic hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      tissue, and in patients with large prolapse mucopexy - lifting of prolapsing hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      tissue with sutures was performed. Standard EH was performed up to the level of hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      pedicle, with ligation or suture-ligation of the pedicle and meticulous hemostasis. Follow-up&#xD;
      was performed by different surgeons to those, performing the operations (E.P., V.J.). Each of&#xD;
      them has more than 25 years of experience of colorectal and hemorrhoidal surgery. 1 hour&#xD;
      seminar was conducted with them to unify the evaluation of the patients within the study.&#xD;
      Each patient was followed up at 1 and 6 weeks and after 1 year after the operation (Figure&#xD;
      1). Perianal examination with photographic documentation was performed during all the visits.&#xD;
      Anoscopy was performed during visits at 6 weeks and 1 year. Each patient was asked to fill in&#xD;
      the diary during each day of the first post-operative week and present it at the first visit&#xD;
      after 1 week. Symptom questionnaires were filled in during visits at 1 and 6 weeks and 1&#xD;
      year. Wexner incontinence score was filled during the visit at 6 weeks and 1 year. SF-36 QOL&#xD;
      questionnaire was filled during the final visit at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Sample size calculation was performed using R statistical software&#xD;
      package(©The R Foundation).Presuming the effect size of 0.3, power of 0.8 and alpha=0.05 the&#xD;
      sample size was calculated to be 108 patients. To compensate for possible follow-up losses&#xD;
      sample size was increased to 120 patients. Chi-square test and Anova tests were used to&#xD;
      compare differences between the groups.&#xD;
