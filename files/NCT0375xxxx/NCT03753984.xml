  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle fatigue is caused by biochemical changes that modify the mechanics of muscle&#xD;
      contraction, which result in negative changes in the performance of the contraction. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of LLLT on brachial biceps muscle fatigue&#xD;
      in healthy individuals and individuals with spastic hemiparesis. The study will consist of&#xD;
      three groups (Control Group, Placebo Group and LLLT Group) and all individuals will go&#xD;
      through all groups, following the criteria of randomization. The protocol consists of LLLT&#xD;
      application in the dominant side brachialis muscle in healthy subjects and on the hemiparetic&#xD;
      side of post-stroke individuals, prior to performing the Isometric Maximum Voluntary&#xD;
      Contraction (IMVC) for 50 seconds in the isokinetic dynamometer. Will be evaluated pain,&#xD;
      myoelectric activity associated with muscular torque, local temperature and blood lactate&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Muscle fatigue is caused by biochemical changes that modify the mechanics of muscle&#xD;
      contraction, which result in negative changes in the performance of the contraction. Several&#xD;
      resources are studied in order to mitigate this situation, among them we can mention the Low&#xD;
      Level-Laser Therapy (LLLT), which has demonstrated positive effects in the treatment of&#xD;
      muscle disorders and fatigue prevention. The effects of LLLT are being studied in healthy&#xD;
      individuals with fibromyalgia and athletes, currently studies are being performed on spastic&#xD;
      muscles with post-stroke patients (post-stroke). The objective of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of LLLT on brachial biceps muscle fatigue in healthy individuals and individuals&#xD;
      with spastic hemiparesis. A double-blind, cross-sectional, comparative, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind clinical trial will be conducted. Phase I will consist of 30 healthy individuals&#xD;
      and Phase II will be composed of 30 post-stroke individuals. The study will consist of three&#xD;
      groups (Control Group, Placebo Group and LLLT Group) and all individuals will go through all&#xD;
      groups, following the criteria of randomization. The protocol consists of LLLT application in&#xD;
      the dominant side brachialis muscle in healthy subjects and on the hemiparetic side of&#xD;
      post-stroke individuals, prior to performing the Isometric Maximum Voluntary Contraction&#xD;
      (IMVC) for 50 seconds in the isokinetic dynamometer. The pain intensity will be evaluated&#xD;
      through the Visual Analog Pain Scale, the myoelectric activity through the surface&#xD;
      electromyography associated with the evaluation of the muscular torque through the isokinetic&#xD;
      dynamometer. The local temperature will be evaluated by infrared thermography and blood&#xD;
      lactate concentration by means of the lactimeter, which will be measured at four different&#xD;
      times, prior to the application of the laser (basal collection) and 3, 15 and 25 minutes&#xD;
      after IMVC.&#xD;
