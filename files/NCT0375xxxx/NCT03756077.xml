  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the latest data from the China National Cancer Center, prostate cancer has&#xD;
      become the most common tumor in the urinary system since 2008. However, conventional imaging&#xD;
      techniques including transrectal ultrasound , computed tomography and bone scintigraphy are&#xD;
      not sensitive or specific. About 40% of resectable lesions cannot be detected by these&#xD;
      techniques. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) provides a valuable tool for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      staging of prostate cancer. Recently, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) as a new&#xD;
      novel positron tracer has shown to be effective to detect primary lesions, recurrent and&#xD;
      metastatic lesions of prostate cancer. In this prospective study, the investigators will use&#xD;
      the most advanced imaging equipments, integrated PET/MR, and PET/CT with prostate&#xD;
      cancer-specific imaging agent 68Ga-PSMA and conventional imaging agent&#xD;
      [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose to image patients with or suspected of prostate cancer, the aim is&#xD;
      to explore the value of hybrid PET/MR and PET/CT in prostate cancer.&#xD;

      prostate cancer, the investigators aim to evaluate the roles of integrated PET/MR and PET/CT&#xD;
      in differential diagnosis, detecting primary and metastatic lesions, guilding biopsy, staging&#xD;
      and determining treatment plan prior to treatment; for the patients with a history of&#xD;
      prostate cancer, the aim is to evaluate the value of integrated PET/MR and PET/CT for&#xD;
      treatment response assessment, detection of recurrences and metastatic lesions.&#xD;
