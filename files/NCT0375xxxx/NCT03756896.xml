  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone work in&#xD;
      treating patients with high-risk multiple myeloma. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as pomalidomide and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the ≥ complete response (CR) rates with carfilzomib, pomalidomide and&#xD;
      dexamethasone (CPd) maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the improved progression free survival (PFS) with CPd maintenance among&#xD;
      high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the best response rates (very good partial response rate [VGPR], stringent&#xD;
      complete response [sCR] rate) with CPd maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety of the CPd combination as maintenance regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize safety in subjects who receive CPd maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the duration of response (DOR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) in high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate the minimal residual disease (MRD) detection with CPd maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15,&#xD;
      pomalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21, and dexamethasone PO daily on days 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
