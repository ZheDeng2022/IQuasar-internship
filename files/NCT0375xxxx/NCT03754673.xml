      The aim of this work is to emphasize the role of non-contrast MR imaging in diagnosis of&#xD;
      acute pulmonary embolism in comparison to CTA and contrast enhanced MRA as gold standard&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious condition responsible for significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. PE is currently the third leading cause of cardiovascular death worldwide, so it&#xD;
      requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent potentially deadly consequences (1) .&#xD;
      Pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot-usually from the leg-travels to the lung and&#xD;
      blocks the pulmonary artery or one of its branches (2). The diagnosis of acute PE is&#xD;
      considered a clinical dilemma due to wide spectrum of multiple nonspecific signs and symptoms&#xD;
      (3) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The D-dimer results are of bad positive laboratory test being positive in other situations&#xD;
      rather than PE such as cancer and inflammation (4) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT pulmonary angiography (CTA) is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of PE and&#xD;
      has become the imaging method of choice in patients suspected of having PE. The multislice CT&#xD;
      offered high spatial and temporal resolution imaging in a short time scan. CTA has the&#xD;
      ability to assess the pulmonary tree down to the fifth and to eighth order branches in less&#xD;
      than 15 seconds due to high speed (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, Limitations of CTPA include exposure to ionizing radiation with its risk of cancer&#xD;
      induction and iodinated contrast agent, which carries a risk of allergic reactions and kidney&#xD;
      damage and failure in some patients (6) .Many patients with suspected PE, such as pregnant&#xD;
      women and patients with impaired renal function, have at least a relative contraindication to&#xD;
      contrast media irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI offers a potential alternative to CTPA in the evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature and&#xD;
      the diagnosis of PE [7]. To date, however, the majority of studies evaluating the use of MRI&#xD;
      in the diagnosis of PE have used gadolinium based intravenous contrast media, which is&#xD;
      contraindicated in pregnant patients and in those with renal failure [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, alternatively non contrast MRA improves diagnostic accuracy and simplify the acquisition&#xD;
      techniques remains an area of clinically important development. The non-contrast MRA produces&#xD;
      enhancing signal from the vessel wall, provides high contrast with no need for bolus timing&#xD;
      and provides motion-insensitivity to respiration (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study to evaluate the feasibility of detecting pulmonary emboli using non&#xD;
      contrast bright blood and dark blood MR imaging techniques.&#xD;
