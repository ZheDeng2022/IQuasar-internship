  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In thoracic surgery, postoperative pneumonia (POP) is the leading cause of&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and mortality. The clinical diagnosis of POP is difficult and&#xD;
      conventional microbiological diagnostic tests perform poorly. The contribution of molecular&#xD;
      diagnostic tests (multiplex PCR, mPCR) should be evaluated to optimize the diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic management of POP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The main objective is to describe the microbiological relationship between the&#xD;
      existence of pre- (if available) and intra-operative bronchial and pulmonary bacterial&#xD;
      colonization and the occurrence of POP. The secondary objectives are to analyze the&#xD;
      contribution of the mPCR for the diagnosis of POP and to validate the predictive factors of&#xD;
      POP described in the literature Material and methods: A monocentric prospective&#xD;
      non-interventional research with minimal risks and constraints. The study population is&#xD;
      represented by all the consecutive adult patients hospitalized for lung surgical resection&#xD;
      (except surgical resection indicated for infectious disease) during one year. The&#xD;
      preoperative respiratory samples within the 3 preceding months (date and type, pathogen and&#xD;
      threshold) are recorded, if available. Intra-operative bronchial aspirate is performed for&#xD;
      direct examination and culture (pathogen and threshold) and mPCR (PCR1). A mPCR is optionally&#xD;
      performed on the surgical specimen (PCR2). In case of postoperative clinical suspicion of&#xD;
      POP, invasive or non invasive samples of respiratory tract secretions are obtained for direct&#xD;
      examination and culture (pathogen, threshold) and mPCR (PCR3). A clinical pulmonary infection&#xD;
      score (CPIS) is calculated by integrating the results of conventional tests (CPIS1) and mPCR&#xD;
      (CPIS2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre / intra operative and postoperative microbiological relationship will be described&#xD;
      qualitatively and quantitatively and analyzed using correlation tests. Concordances and&#xD;
      discrepancies between conventional tests and mPCR will be studied to analyze the contribution&#xD;
      of molecular tests in this context.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Post operative pneumonia (POP) is a common and severe complication associated&#xD;
      with a high morbidity and mortality, regardless of the type of surgery. In thoracic surgery,&#xD;
      the global incidence of POP is estimated at 25%. Pre-operative bronchial and pulmonary&#xD;
      bacterial colonization appear as a major risk factor for the occurrence of POP, according to&#xD;
      the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of POP is challenging, because the usual diagnostic criteria are poorly&#xD;
      relevant and clinical diagnostic scores are not validated, which may explain the scarcity of&#xD;
      published data in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' fragility and comorbid conditions mainly due to smoking limit the opportunity to&#xD;
      perform invasive microbiological diagnostic tests, and those latter perform poorly.&#xD;
      Altogether, the pathogen(s) involved are identified in 14% to 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the diagnostic contribution of molecular diagnostic tests (mPCR) is&#xD;
      important in this context. Molecular diagnostic tests offer better performance (sensitivity&#xD;
      and sensibility) than conventional test, and the results are not affected by previous&#xD;
      exposure to antibiotics. These tests could be useful to analyze the microbiological&#xD;
      relationship between pre or per-operative bronchial and pulmonary colonization and&#xD;
      postoperative infection, to optimize the diagnostic and the management of POP after thoracic&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: In this study, The investigators aim to describe the microbiological&#xD;
      relationship between the existence of pre- (if available) and intra-operative bronchial and&#xD;
      pulmonary bacterial colonization and the occurrence of POP. The investigators also intend to&#xD;
      analyze the contribution of mPCR for the diagnosis of POP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For more precision, primary and secondary outcomes descriptions are fully detailed in the&#xD;
      corresponding section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators perform a monocentric prospective non-interventional research with minimal&#xD;
      risks and constraints. The study population is represented by all the consecutive adult&#xD;
      patients hospitalized for lung surgical resection (except surgical resection indicated for&#xD;
      infectious disease) during one year at Tenon Hospital, a University teaching hospital in&#xD;
      Paris, France. About 200 patients per year undergo a lung surgical resection. Depending on&#xD;
      the POP incidence, the number of patients suspected of POP may vary between 25 and 50 during&#xD;
      the study period. Study duration participation corresponds to the hospital length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR Film Array Pneumonia is the molecular test used in this study. It is designed to detect&#xD;
      the most common and critical pathogens of pneumonia (bacteria, virus). The results are&#xD;
      reported quantitatively. Patients' management is in line with recommendations and not&#xD;
      modified by the research. The expected risks are those of the usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practical progress of the study is defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative. Patients' clinical characteristics, respiratory status and expected&#xD;
           surgery data are collected. The preoperative respiratory samples (date and type,&#xD;
           pathogen and threshold) are recorded if available within the 3 preceding months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Per-operative. Intra-operative bronchial aspirate is performed for direct examination&#xD;
           and culture (pathogen and threshold) and mPCR (PCR1). Surgery characteristics are&#xD;
           collected. Per-operative antibioprophylaxis is in line with recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post operative. Identification of post operative complications (respiratory and extra&#xD;
           respiratory) including POP. POP diagnosis is based on clinical and microbiological data&#xD;
           (Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score). In case of clinical suspicion of POP, respiratory&#xD;
           samples are performed for direct examination and culture (pathogen and threshold) and&#xD;
           mPCR (PCR2). A CPIS score is calculated with conventional microbiological tests results&#xD;
           (CPIS 1) and PCR results (CPIS2). Hospital health care and vital status at discharge are&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes measures are fully detailed in the corresponding section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The statistical analysis will be performed at the end of the study. The&#xD;
      characteristics of the patients will be described and compared between two groups, i.e.&#xD;
      patients with POP and patients without POP. Qualitative variables will be described by size&#xD;
      and frequency, and quantitative variables by mean and standard deviation or median and&#xD;
      inter-quartile range. Between-groups comparisons will be performed using a Chi2 or a Fisher&#xD;
      exact test for qualitative variables, and a Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test for the&#xD;
      quantitative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcome, the proportion of patients for whom the intra operative colonization&#xD;
      strain and the postoperative infection strain are the same will be calculated (with their 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary outcomes, the overall concordance rate, and the qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative diagnostic discrepancies will be calculated with their 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      between conventional and molecular tests. The proportions of patients with appropriate&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy and with targeted antibiotic therapy will be estimated and compared&#xD;
      between conventional and molecular tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predictive factors for POP occurrence will be assessed by a logistic regression model.&#xD;
