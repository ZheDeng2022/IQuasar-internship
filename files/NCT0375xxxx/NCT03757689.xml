    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the rate of positive sentinel lymph nodes&#xD;
      (i.e. the closest draining lymph node(s) to the primary melanoma site) and to test whether&#xD;
      treatment with pembrolizumab before surgery to remove melanoma reduces the rate of positive&#xD;
      sentinel lymph nodes in patients with Stage IIB/C melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with stage II melanoma will receive one dose of pembrolizumab 200 mg, then undergo&#xD;
      standard definitive surgery with wide excision and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy&#xD;
      approximately 3 weeks after the initial dose of pembrolizumab. Post-operatively, subjects&#xD;
      will receive up to 1 year of adjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks.&#xD;
