    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of the Veinplicity device to improve the&#xD;
      visualization and palpability of difficult-to-access veins for intravenous cannulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled study that will assess ability of Veinplicity to&#xD;
      improve successful peripheral vein cannulation at the first stick in enrolled subjects.&#xD;
      Potential subjects will undergo a peripheral vein assessment by a study clinician, which is&#xD;
      standard of care prior to peripheral vein cannulation (PVC) for the establishment of&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) access. Adults who are assessed as having &quot;fair or poor&quot; vein quality will&#xD;
      be consented, enrolled and randomized into the study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to either (1) tourniquet alone (control group); or (2) Veinplicity with tourniquet&#xD;
      (treatment group). The primary endpoint is first-stick success. Clinicians will use an 18-,&#xD;
      20- or 22-gauge cannula. Clinician and subject satisfaction will be separately assessed using&#xD;
      surveys on Day 0. Subjects in both groups will be followed for one day (either phone or&#xD;
      in-hospital visit) after enrollment for safety. Qualified study clinicians must have at least&#xD;
      one year of experience inserting peripheral IVs and must perform an average of five PVCs per&#xD;
      week. The primary hypothesis to be tested is: Veinplicity with tourniquet is superior to&#xD;
      tourniquet alone for successful peripheral vein access at first stick when used to cannulate&#xD;
      subjects assessed as having a fair or poor level of vein quality. It is expected that this&#xD;
      study will enroll approximately 246 subjects; 123 per study group. It is expected that up to&#xD;
      five sites will be involved in this study. A planned interim analysis will be conducted to&#xD;
      reassess the study planned sample size when approximately 50% of subjects have been enrolled.&#xD;
      Enrollment will not stop during the interim analysis activities. Safety will be evaluated by&#xD;
      the collection and analysis of the incidence and severity of all procedure- and/or&#xD;
      device-related adverse events through the Day 1 phone call/visit.&#xD;
