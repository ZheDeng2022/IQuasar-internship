    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib, multi-center, open label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      CT053PTSA in combination with gefitinib in patients with EGFR mutation, T790M negative NSCLC&#xD;
      who have progressed after EGFR TKI treatment.&#xD;

      This study is being carried out in two parts, part 1 and part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: This is the dose-escalation part. The primary purpose of the part 1 portion is to&#xD;
      determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommend&#xD;
      the appropriate doses of CT053PTSA in combination with gefitinib for further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: This is the expansion part. The part 2 portion of this study will continue to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of CT053PTSA and gefitinib , at the&#xD;
      appropriate doses recommended in Part 1, in patients with EGFR mutation, T790M negative&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;
