  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Salt-sensitive hypertension affects nearly 50% of the hypertensive and 25% of the&#xD;
      normotensive population, and strong evidence indicates that reducing salt intake decreases&#xD;
      blood pressure and cardiovascular events. The precise mechanisms of how dietary salt&#xD;
      contributes to blood pressure elevation, renal injury, and cardiovascular disease remains&#xD;
      unclear. Our data indicated that monocytes exhibit salt sensitivity, and the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that of salt sensitivity of these and similar immune cells correlate with the&#xD;
      hypertensive response to salt intake. Currently, the research tools for diagnosing&#xD;
      salt-sensitivity are costly, time consuming and laborious. In this study the investigators&#xD;
      will identify monocyte salt-sensitivity as a marker of salt-sensitive hypertension.&#xD;

      The investigators will employ the Weinberger protocol in 20 patients as previously reported.&#xD;
      They will advise participants to maintain their usual diet and salt consumption until the&#xD;
      onset of the protocol and provide them with a container and appropriate instructions to&#xD;
      collect a 24-hour urine specimen the day before admission to the hospital. Admission will&#xD;
      take place two weeks later, for washout of the effect of the medications, and on an evening,&#xD;
      for the patient to rest overnight in the hospital before onset on the protocol. During these&#xD;
      two weeks, untreated blood pressure will be monitored either by the patients at home or in&#xD;
      interim scheduled visits, to assure that it does not exceed 180/110 mmHg, in which case the&#xD;
      protocol will be discontinued for safety. On admission, volume of the baseline urine will be&#xD;
      measured, and aliquots sent to the lab or frozen at -800C for research analytes. On the&#xD;
      morning after admission (6 am) an ambulatory blood pressure monitor (SpaceLabs 90207 or&#xD;
      90210) will be set up for continuous blood pressure recording throughout the study (every 15&#xD;
      minutes from 6 am until 10 pm and every 30 minutes from 10 pm to 6 am), body weight will be&#xD;
      recorded with the patient wearing a gown (same scale as future days), blood samples will be&#xD;
      obtained for the analytes of the study described below (baseline tests), and a new 24-hour&#xD;
      collection will be started for the period of salt loading at 8 am. Salt loading will be&#xD;
      achieved by the combination of a high-salt diet (isocaloric, with 160 mEq Na and 70 mEq K),&#xD;
      which the patient will consume in its entirety, and an infusion of 2L of saline (300 mEq&#xD;
      Na+). Patients will have free access to water but their food will be limited to that provided&#xD;
      by the protocol. They will retire to bed at 10 pm. On the following morning (6 am) body&#xD;
      weight and blood samples will again be obtained, and the 24-hr collection will be completed&#xD;
      with an intentional voiding at 8 am. These laboratory data will reflect the effect of salt&#xD;
      loading. At 8 am, subjects will be subjected to salt depletion. This is accomplished by&#xD;
      administering an isocaloric diet containing 10 mEq Na and 70 mEq K and continued unlimited&#xD;
      water intake. At 8 am, 12 noon and 4 pm, subjects will be given 40 mg of furosemide orally.&#xD;
      An additional 12-hour urine collection will be started at 8 am and ended with an intentional&#xD;
      void at 8 pm (reflecting the period of furosemide natriuresis). A new 12-hour collection will&#xD;
      start at 8 pm, to be closed with intentional voiding the next morning at 8 am (reflecting the&#xD;
      period of salt depletion). The next morning (6 am) the last recording of body weight and&#xD;
      drawing of blood samples will take place, and by 8 am the 12-hour urine collection for the&#xD;
      period of salt depletion will be completed. The patients will be given breakfast from a&#xD;
      regular hospital diet, which may be supplemented with salty food or fluids if the salt&#xD;
      depletion intervention produced dizziness or documented orthostasis. Once the patient is&#xD;
      stable and exhibits tolerance to the upright posture, he/she will be discharged home with&#xD;
      instructions to resume antihypertensive medications, unless the presence of orthostasis&#xD;
      requires a modification in the regimen, which will be advised by a physician member of the&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory blood measurements: Tests to be conducted in the 3 daily sets of blood samples&#xD;
      will include; CBCs and routine chemistries (including serum creatinine, Na+ and K+) at the&#xD;
      central laboratory of VUMC; Plasma renin activity by radio-immunoassay; Plasma aldosterone by&#xD;
      radio-immunoassay; Plasma eicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid&#xD;
      (20-HETE) at the eicosanoid core of VUMC by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinalysis: Tests to be conducted in the 4 urine specimens (24-hr baseline, 24-hr salt&#xD;
      loading, 12-hr furosemide natriuresis, and 12-hr salt depletion) will include; Na+, K+ and&#xD;
      creatinine concentration at the central laboratory of VUMC; Urine eicosatrienoic acids (EETs)&#xD;
      and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) at the eicosanoid core of VUMC by liquid&#xD;
      chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of salt sensitivity of blood pressure: Blood pressure data from the monitors will&#xD;
      be downloaded and the average of the systolic blood pressure of the day of salt loading, from&#xD;
      12 noon (end of the saline infusion) until 10 pm will be used as the BP for the salt-loading&#xD;
      period of study. The average of the systolic blood pressure of the day of salt depletion,&#xD;
      from 12 noon (second dose of furosemide) until 10 pm will be used as the BP for the&#xD;
      salt-depleted period of study. A fall in systolic BP ≥10 mm Hg from the salt-loading to the&#xD;
      salt-depletion periods will be used to classify a subject as salt sensitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium MRI imaging: The investigators will non-invasively detect Na+ storage in tissues of&#xD;
      humans at the Vanderbilt imaging institute. They will quantify Na+ content in the skin by&#xD;
      23Na MRI with rigorous adherence to previously reported approaches.6, 37, 38. Imaging is done&#xD;
      on a Philips Achieva 3.0T MR scanner (Philips Healthcare, Cleveland OH, USA) with a 23Na&#xD;
      quadrature knee coil (Rapid Biomedical GmbH, Rimpar, Germany). The investigators use&#xD;
      calibration phantoms (aqueous solutions with increasing NaCl concentrations) as reference&#xD;
      standards and scan them together with sections through the subject's calf muscles for quality&#xD;
      control. The left lower leg (the widest part of calf region) is scanned with the skin closely&#xD;
      in contact with the hard surface of the phantom holder for 3 minutes and 52 seconds. All&#xD;
      imaging data are processed off-line with custom MATLAB (R2013a) scripts. Na+ quantification&#xD;
      is performed by comparing signal intensities between tissue and calibration phantoms on the&#xD;
      Na+ image. A linear relationship (Na+ concentration vs signal intensity) is assessed based on&#xD;
      the phantom data, and results from a linear regression are applied to tissue regions to&#xD;
      quantify Na+ content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune Cell Activation Studies: The investigators will determine if salt sensitivity is&#xD;
      associated with the activation state of human monocytes. Heparinized blood samples (40 ml)&#xD;
      are obtained and PBMCs are isolated by Ficoll-gradient. Monocytes are isolated from the PBMC&#xD;
      by magnetic labeling and negative selection using the Miltenyi monocyte isolation kit and&#xD;
      analyzed using flow cytometry. They identify monocytes as CD45+/CD14+ cells and can further&#xD;
      examine intermediate (CD14+/CD16+ and non-classical monocytes (CD14-/CD16+). The CD14+/CD16+&#xD;
      cells which comprise about 10% of the circulation, are of particular interest they produce&#xD;
      increased levels of TNFalpha and promote T cell activation. These are increased in humans&#xD;
      with hypertension and in response to in vitro elevated Na+ exposure. Although subtypes of DCs&#xD;
      are relatively rare in number, the investigators will quantify them by measuring CD45+/CD1c+,&#xD;
      CD45+/CD141+, CD45+/CD209+, CD45+/CD83+ and the recently identified Axl/SICLEC6 cells. 7-AAD&#xD;
      is used to exclude dead cells. Intracellular staining with the single chain antibody D-11 to&#xD;
      detect IsoLG-protein adducts will be used. Surface expression of CD80 and CD86, which are&#xD;
      expressed on mature antigen-presenting cells allowing them to participate in T cell&#xD;
      co-stimulation will be measured. General characterization of peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells by flow cytometry for other inflammatory cells including total leukocytes (CD45+&#xD;
      cells), B cells (CD45+/CD19+), total T cells (CD45+/CD3+ cells), and the T cell subtype&#xD;
      (CD3+/CD8+ and CD4+) cells will also be performed. These experiments will be performed in&#xD;
      freshly-isolated cells and also in monocytes exposed to normal salt or high salt for 48 hours&#xD;
      to determine if salt-sensitivity is reflected in the monocytes as shown in Fig. 2. Medium&#xD;
      from monocytes cultured for 48 hours is analyzed for cytokine release including IL-1 beta,&#xD;
      TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-23 using luminex. The investigators will also obtain plasma to assess&#xD;
      for cytokines including GM-CSF, IL-4, and Flt3 ligand that are responsible for conversion of&#xD;
      monocytes to DCs. To ensure reproducibility, the samples will be submitted to the Vanderbilt&#xD;
      Endocrinology and Metabolism Core Facility to perform a blinded Luminex analysis.&#xD;
      Measurements of O2·- production and activation of NADPH oxidase including phosphorylation of&#xD;
      p47phox and association of p47phox with gp91phox by immunoprecipitation and western blot both&#xD;
      at baseline and in response elevated Na+ will be done previously described.&#xD;
