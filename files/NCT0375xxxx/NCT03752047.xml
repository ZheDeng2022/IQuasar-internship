  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine if the trend in Respiratory Rate measurements provided&#xD;
      by the device under investigation can be used to predict an increase in&#xD;
      Sequential/Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RR trend will be measured as the difference between the RR recorded by the device at a&#xD;
      point 15 minutes after commencement of treatment, as per the standard of care for patients&#xD;
      suspected of being septic, and a point 3 hours following this.&#xD;

      The primary objective is to determine if the trend in Respiratory Rate measurements provided&#xD;
      by the device under investigation can be used to predict an increase in&#xD;
      Sequential/Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RR trend will be measured as the difference between the RR recorded by the device at a&#xD;
      point 15 minutes after commencement of treatment, as per the standard of care for patients&#xD;
      suspected of being septic, and a point 3 hours following this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective The secondary objective is to test if Respiratory Rate can help identify&#xD;
      patients at increased risk of 30 day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null Hypotheses of the planned comparison is that there is no difference in the RR trend&#xD;
      in the 3 hours following commencement of treatment for sepsis in subjects who have an&#xD;
      increase in SOFA score by 2 or more points and those who have a change in SOFA score of +1 or&#xD;
      less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in SOFA score will be measured at point of commencement of treatment and at 6&#xD;
      hours following commencement of treatment, or nearest available SOFA score determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory Rate captured during admission could have a predictive course for cohort of&#xD;
      interest&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time points for reviewing the RR will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) The last measurement (ii) The trend over 3 hours following commencement of treatment as&#xD;
      per the standard of care for patients suspected of being septic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) The trend over the entire duration of admission&#xD;
