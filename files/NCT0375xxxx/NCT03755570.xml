  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of COGNI-CRT is to assess whether Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy&#xD;
      (CRT) can improve cognitive function in patients with systolic HF (LVEF ≤35%), when compared&#xD;
      to a control group of patients implanted with an Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD)&#xD;
      or a permanent pacemaker (PPM) with systolic HF (LVEF ≤35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical investigation is a prospective, single-centre cohort study. Each participant&#xD;
      will be followed for 6 months. The study will collect data over 3 years; 2.5 years for&#xD;
      enrolment and 6 months until the last participant completes the last 6-month follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N.B: COGNI-CRT does NOT affect the patient's care pathway - the patients who will be selected&#xD;
      for participation are those who have already been referred for the device implant. The ONLY&#xD;
      difference to the patient's care pathway caused by COGNI-CRT is the addition of a battery of&#xD;
      cognitive function tests, which involves asking the patient questions and asking them to&#xD;
      complete questionnaire-like cognitive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTpro-BNP levels, NYHA classification and LVEF will be measured prior to device implantation&#xD;
      and at 6-months post-implant to assess the device's impact on the participant's heart failure&#xD;
      (and CRT response). N.B: NT-proBNP, NYHA classification and LVEF are all parts of the&#xD;
      patient's standard care pathway, COGNI-CRT is just utilising the data collected as part of&#xD;
      the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study arm and control group allows COGNI-CRT to assess 3 potential outcomes for&#xD;
      patients with severe HF (LVEF &lt;35%):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cognitive function is not improved by CRT, ICDs or PPMs&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cognitive function can be improved by the assurance of rate control offered by CRT, ICDs&#xD;
           and PPMs&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cognitive function can be improved by the assurance of ventricular synchronisation and&#xD;
           rate control provided by the additional left ventricular lead in CRT devices.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to assess whether cardiac resynchronisation&#xD;
      therapy (CRT) can improve cognitive function in patients with systolic heart failure (Left&#xD;
      Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≤35%), when compared to a control group of patients&#xD;
      implanted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or permanent pacemaker (PPM)&#xD;
      with systolic heart failure (LVEF ≤35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical investigation is a prospective, single-centre cohort study. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted at the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust (RCHT) in Cornwall, England. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive performance will be assessed in patients pre- and post-CRT implant (Group A). An&#xD;
      ICD and PPM control group (Group B) will also be assessed using the same battery of cognitive&#xD;
      function tests to ensure any difference in cognitive function which is identified between&#xD;
      pre- and post- CRT implant is due to the CRT therapy, and not due to a placebo effect (which&#xD;
      can be especially powerful with implanted devices) or due to a learning effect (i.e. patients&#xD;
      tested on the second occasion might improve their scores because they have had more&#xD;
      practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      N.B: COGNI-CRT does NOT affect the patient's care pathway - the patients who will be selected&#xD;
      for participation are those who have already been referred for the device implant. The ONLY&#xD;
      difference to the patient's care pathway caused by COGNI-CRT is the addition of a battery of&#xD;
      cognitive function tests, which involves asking the patient questions and asking them to&#xD;
      complete questionnaire-like cognitive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LVEF, NT-proBNP and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification data which is collected&#xD;
      prior to device implantation and at 6-months post-implant will be utilised for analysis to&#xD;
      measure response to CRT and to assess difference between the main arm and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arms in the study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Participants implanted with a CRT who are eligible according to the inclusion/&#xD;
           exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Participants implanted with an ICD or a PPM who are eligible according to the&#xD;
           inclusion / exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To assess whether CRT can improve cognitive function in patients with&#xD;
      systolic heart failure (LVEF ≤35%), when compared to a control group of patients implanted&#xD;
      with an ICD or PPM with systolic heart failure (LVEF ≤35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether CRT can improve cognitive function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether ICD and PPM therapy can improve cognitive function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if the level of improvement in cognitive function correlates to LVEF&#xD;
           improvement / stability and/or NYHA improvement /stability and/or NT-proBNP level&#xD;
           reduction (CRT response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject population enrolled in this investigation will comprise of male and female&#xD;
      patients aged 20-89 years old. These subjects are patients who are willing to provide&#xD;
      informed consent and meet the specific eligibility criteria. A minimum of 198 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for this study will be collected at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-Assessment for CRT, ICD or PPM Implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device (CIED) Implant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-Implant 6-Week Device Check (For device optimisation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-Implant 6-Month Device Follow-Up Visit After completing the Post-Implant 6-Month&#xD;
           Device Follow-Up Visit, the patient will have completed his/her participation in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Devices Used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implanted CRT-P, CRT-D, ICD and PPM devices may include Biotronik, Boston Scientific,&#xD;
      Medtronic and St Jude Medical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are referred to RCHT for CRT, ICD or PPM implantation with systolic heart&#xD;
      failure (LVEF ≤35%) will be screened prior to Pre-Assessment by the clinical team.&#xD;
      Prospective patients will be afforded sufficient time to consider participation in COGNI-CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Tests Used to Evaluate Cognitive Function:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be Performed Only At Pre-Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF): TOPF provides the participant with a list of 70&#xD;
           words that have atypical grapheme to phoneme translations. The participant must attempt&#xD;
           to read the list aloud so pronunciation of the words can be assessed. This tests IQ and&#xD;
           memory as the participant must be familiar with the words, rather than being able to&#xD;
           spell out a word they do not know. It takes approximately 10 minutes to complete&#xD;
&#xD;
           To be Performed at Pre-Assessment and at the Post-Implant 6-Month Device Follow-Up&#xD;
           Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS): The test consists of 14 multiple-choice&#xD;
           questions, each attempting to ascertain about the frequency the participant has felt a&#xD;
           certain symptom within the last 7 days. There are 4 answers to choose from which range&#xD;
           from suffering from the symptom &quot;nearly all the time&quot; to &quot;not at all&quot; and are graded 0-3&#xD;
           depending on the participant's answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS): Consisting&#xD;
           of 12 sections, to evaluate 5 types of cognitive function: immediate memory;&#xD;
           visuospatial/ constructional; attention; language and delayed memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB): The test has 6 neuropsychological tasks which involve&#xD;
           asking the participant questions, for example &quot;In what way are a banana and an orange&#xD;
           alike?&quot;, and learning simple actions in response to hand taps or movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A &amp; B: Both parts of TMT involve circles dotted over a&#xD;
           piece of paper, the circles for Part A are marked with the numbers 1 - 25 and the&#xD;
           patient must draw a line connecting the numbers in ascending order, i.e. &quot;1-2-3-4-5-6…&quot;&#xD;
           etc. Part B involves numbers and letters dotted around the page, from 1-13 and from A-L.&#xD;
           The patient must connect the numbers and letters in ascending order, alternating between&#xD;
           numbers and letters, i.e. &quot;1-A-2-B-3-C…&quot; etc&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to CRT Measures will be measured prior to device implantation and at the 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up device follow-up clinic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LVEF: LVEF will be measured prior to device implant to assess the patient's heart function,&#xD;
      and at the Post-Implant 6-Month Device Follow-Up Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NT-proBNP: NT-proBNP levels from the patient's routine blood tests prior to device&#xD;
      implantation and at the Post-Implant 6-Month Device Follow-Up Visit where blood testing is&#xD;
      routine for heart failure patients every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NYHA: A NYHA scale assessment will be performed during the screening clinics prior to device&#xD;
      implant, and at the Post-Implant 6-Month Device Follow-Up Visit using the standardised NYHA&#xD;
      questions designed for the purpose of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N.B: The above 3 tests (LVEF, NT-proBNP and NYHA classification) are performed routinely as&#xD;
      part of the patient standard care pathway for heart failure, and this data will be utilised&#xD;
      for analysis in this trial. The tests are NOT performed for the purpose of COGNI-CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device Optimisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the post-implant 6-week device follow-up check, all efforts will be made to ensure the&#xD;
      device is optimised as much as is possible, and the patient listed for MDT if problems are&#xD;
      encountered to attempt to resolve problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be tested for normality. Tests for group differences will be used to compare&#xD;
      cognitive function between patients before and after CRT implant, and in the control group&#xD;
      before and after ICD or PPM implant. Tests for group differences will also be used in&#xD;
      comparison of the LVEF values, BNP results, NYHA classification, QRS duration, percentage&#xD;
      biventricular pacing and BP measurements. Sample size calculations have estimated the&#xD;
      required CRT sample size to power the study to be 99 participants (with a 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval and a 5% margin of error). The expectation is for 99 patients to sign the informed&#xD;
      consent and complete follow-up = 99 CRT participants. The control group will aim to enrol a&#xD;
      similar figure to the main study group, a further 99 ICD and PPM participants. 99 CRT&#xD;
      patients + 99 ICD or PPM patients = 198 patients are expected to be enrolled and complete the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
