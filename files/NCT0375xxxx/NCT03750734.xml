  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a long-term lung condition where the airways become abnormally enlarged,&#xD;
      leading to a build-up of mucus and inflammation that makes the lungs more susceptible to&#xD;
      recurrent infection. Patients with bronchiectasis have subtle abnormalities in the way their&#xD;
      airway cells respond to infection that are, in part, responsible for the development of their&#xD;
      condition. At present there are no licensed treatments for bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will aim to characterise in depth some of these abnormalities with a view to&#xD;
      future studies that will try to develop treatments that can directly target those&#xD;
      abnormalities at a molecular level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients known to have bronchiectasis who have provided written informed consent will be&#xD;
      enrolled alongside healthy volunteers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      and cystic fibrosis, for comparison. Participants will give a blood sample and have a&#xD;
      bronchoscopy. This is a thin telescopic tube, passed through the nose or mouth, under&#xD;
      sedation, into the airways that will allow a sample of bronchial epithelial cells to be&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to achieve a greater understanding of some of the key&#xD;
      biological processes/pathways and disease marker genes that play a role in the development of&#xD;
      bronchiectasis. This is important because, at present, little is known about the underlying&#xD;
      disease mechanisms and there are no licensed treatments for bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's hope this in-depth characterisation of specific bronchial epithelial cell&#xD;
      abnormalities in bronchiectasis will shed light on novel targets for future drug discovery.&#xD;
