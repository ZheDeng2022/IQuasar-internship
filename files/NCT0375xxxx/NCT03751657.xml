  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compares 2 medicines for people with type 2 diabetes: insulin 287 (a new medicine)&#xD;
      and insulin glargine (a medicine doctors can already prescribe). The study doctors will test&#xD;
      insulin 287 to see how well it works compared to insulin glargine. The study will also test&#xD;
      if insulin 287 is safe. The study participants will either get insulin 287 or insulin&#xD;
      glargine (100 units/mL) - which treatment the participants get is decided by chance. The&#xD;
      participants will need to inject their selves every day about the same time. Once a week the&#xD;
      participant will need to take 1 extra injection on the same day of the week. The participants&#xD;
      will have 16 clinic visits and 14 phone calls with the study doctor. During the study, the&#xD;
      doctors will ask you to: 1) measure your blood sugar every day with a blood glucose meter&#xD;
      using a finger prick, 2) write down different information in a paper diary daily and return&#xD;
      this to your doctor, 3) wear a medical device to measure your blood sugar all the time for 2&#xD;
      weeks 5 times during the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Cross-reactive Anti-human Insulin Antibody Status (Positive/Negative)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (Visit 2) to week 31 (Visit 30)</time_frame>
    <description>Anti-insulin 287 or glargine antibodies were classified as negative if % B/T was below a certain cut point. Samples positive for anti-insulin 287 or glargine antibodies were further tested for cross-reactivity to endogenous insulin. Samples not further tested are categorised as not applicable (NA). Unknown refers to samples with insufficient volume to perform analysis. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from in-trial period, starting at randomisation, and ending at the last direct participant-site contact, or when participant withdrew their informed consent, or the last participant-investigator contact for participants lost to follow-up, or death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anti-insulin 287 Antibody Level</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (Visit 2) to week 31 (Visit 30)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in anti-insulin 287 antibodies level is not assessed because change in anti-insulin 287 antibody titres is a more meaningful way of describing the change in antibody levels. The results for change in anti-insulin 287 antibody titres are reported as a separate endpoint.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 49 sites in Canada (7), Czech Republic (9), Greece (5), Poland (6), Slovakia (6),Slovenia (2) and United States (14). One site in the United States screened, but didn't randomise any participant.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Insulin-naïve participants with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled on metformin with or without dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4i) were randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive once weekly insulin 287 and once daily placebo or once weekly placebo and once daily insulin glargine subcutaneously (s.c).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Insulin 287</title>
          <description>Participants were to receive once weekly s.c. injection of insulin 287 using PDS290 prefilled pen-injector at a starting dose of 70 units (U) and once daily placebo for 26 weeks. The insulin dose was then adjusted once weekly to reach the glycaemic target of 3.9-6.0 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) based on 3 pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values measured on 2 previous days and on the day of the titration. If at least one pre-breakfast SMPG value was: &lt; 3.0 mmol/L- dose reduced by 28 U, and 3.0-3.8- dose reduced by 14 U. Otherwise, the dose adjustment was based on the mean of SMPG values. If the mean was: 3.9-6.0 mmol/L- no adjustment; 6.1-7.0 mmol/L- dose increased by 14U, and &gt;7.0 mmol/L- dose increased by 28U. All participants used metformin with or without DPP4i at the stable, pre-trial dose and at the same frequency unless due to safety concerns.</description>

          <description>Participants were to receive once daily s.c injection of Insulin glargine using 10 ml vial and syringe at a starting dose of 10 U and once weekly placebo for 26 weeks. The insulin dose was then adjusted to reach the glycaemic target of 3.9-6.0 mmol/L based on 3 pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on 2 previous days and on the day of the titration. If at least one pre-breakfast SMPG value was: &lt; 3.0 mmol/L- dose reduced by 4 U, and 3.0-3.8 dose reduced by 2 U. Otherwise, the dose adjustment was based on the mean of SMPG values. If the mean was: 3.9-6.0 mmol/L- no adjustment; 6.1-7.0 mmol/L- dose increased by 2 U, and &gt;7.0 mmol/L- dose increased by 4 U.

          <description>Participants were to receive once weekly s.c. injection of insulin 287 using PDS290 prefilled pen-injector at a starting dose of 70 units (U) and once daily placebo for 26 weeks. The insulin dose was then adjusted once weekly to reach the glycaemic target of 3.9-6.0 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) based on 3 pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values measured on 2 previous days and on the day of the titration. If at least one pre-breakfast SMPG value was: &lt; 3.0 mmol/L- dose reduced by 28 U, and 3.0-3.8- dose reduced by 14 U. Otherwise, the dose adjustment was based on the mean of SMPG values. If the mean was: 3.9-6.0 mmol/L- no adjustment; 6.1-7.0 mmol/L- dose increased by 14U, and &gt;7.0 mmol/L- dose increased by 28U.

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject administered or using a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or usage. A TEAE was defined as an event that had onset date (or increase in severity) during the on-treatment observation period. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from on-treatment period, starting at the date of first dose of trial product, and ending at follow-up visit, or the last date on trial product + 5 weeks for once daily insulin and + 6 weeks for once weekly insulin.</description>

        <title>Change in Cross-reactive Anti-human Insulin Antibody Status (Positive/Negative)</title>
        <description>Anti-insulin 287 or glargine antibodies were classified as negative if % B/T was below a certain cut point. Samples positive for anti-insulin 287 or glargine antibodies were further tested for cross-reactivity to endogenous insulin. Samples not further tested are categorised as not applicable (NA). Unknown refers to samples with insufficient volume to perform analysis. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from in-trial period, starting at randomisation, and ending at the last direct participant-site contact, or when participant withdrew their informed consent, or the last participant-investigator contact for participants lost to follow-up, or death.</description>

The insulin dose was then adjusted to reach the glycaemic target of 3.9-6.0 mmol/L based on 3 pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on 2 previous days and on the day of the titration. If at least one pre-breakfast SMPG value was: &lt; 3.0 mmol/L- dose reduced by 4 U, and 3.0-3.8 dose reduced by 2 U. Otherwise, the dose adjustment was based on the mean of SMPG values. If the mean was: 3.9-6.0 mmol/L- no adjustment; 6.1-7.0 mmol/L- dose increased by 2 U, and &gt;7.0 mmol/L- dose increased by 4 U. All participants used metformin with or without DPP4i at the stable, pre-trial dose and at the same frequency unless due to safety concerns.</description>
