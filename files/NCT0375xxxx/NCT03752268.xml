  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to understand how patients with chronic cancer pain take&#xD;
      their long-acting opioid medications, and to develop an intervention to enhance cancer pain&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-acting opioids are a common treatment for cancer pain. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      develop a program for patients who are taking a prescribed long-acting opioid for their&#xD;
      cancer pain. Participants will be enrolled in this study at the Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital Cancer Center. This 14-week study involves completing a set of questionnaires at&#xD;
      three different times during the study period. . During the study period, participants will&#xD;
      use electronic pill caps to monitor their pain medication taking. They also will attend a&#xD;
      series of three visits with one of the nurse practitioners on their care cancer team. The&#xD;
      visits will focus on learning and practicing skills for managing cancer pain. The information&#xD;
      that the investigators collect will help identify whether the sessions are feasible and&#xD;
      useful to patients during the course of treatment for cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will consist of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: This is a single-group prospective observational study. Investigators will use&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative methods to examine rates, predictors and outcomes of adherence&#xD;
      to LA opioids over a period of approximately eight weeks. This information will be used to&#xD;
      inform Part 2 intervention development and testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Investigators will test the behavioral intervention in a non-randomized open pilot,&#xD;
      over a period of approximately six weeks. Intervention process data, psychosocial and medical&#xD;
      data, and post-intervention feedback will be collected to assess feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability. In an iterative process, ongoing data from exit interviews and therapist&#xD;
      experience will be used to modify the intervention protocol.&#xD;

The 3 individual manualized sessions will be conducted (approximately 20 minutes each), led by a nurse practitioner, to provide sufficient dose for change in adherence behaviors.&#xD;
Learning and practicing skills for managing cancer-related pain and adhering to prescribed LA opioid regimens.&#xD;
Study staff will provide participants with MEMS caps and bottles at time of enrollment, to monitor LA opioid intake over approximately 14 weeks.</description>
