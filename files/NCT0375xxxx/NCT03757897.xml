      The primary goal is to quantify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, diffusion characteristics&#xD;
      and mechanical properties of brain tissue at two states of arousal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resting, awake state&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During sleep with low-dose intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine (titrated to a&#xD;
           Bispectral index (BIS) of 60-70)&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>CSF volume increase by 10%</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that CSF volume (as measured by T1 relaxation) will expand by 10% with DEXM- induced sleep compared to wakefulness. The increase in CSF volume during DEXM-induced sleep occurs because DEXM lowers central norepinephrine tone and sleep causes an increase in the interstitial fluid (ISF) volume (cell volume shrinks). MRI will take place 30 minutes after dexmedetomidine infusion.</description>
