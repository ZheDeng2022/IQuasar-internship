      This project will address a growing public health concern, namely, the health risks or&#xD;
      benefits of e-cig use relative to cigarette smoking. The investigators will use biomarkers of&#xD;
      early effects of relevance to cancer to determine the carcinogenic potential of e-cig use&#xD;
      relative to cigarette smoking in oral epithelium, which is a target tissue for&#xD;
      smoking-associated cancer. The study population will consist of one group of smokers who are&#xD;
      interested in switching to e-cig use (Grp 1), one group of smokers who do not intend to&#xD;
      change their smoking habits (Grp 2), and one group of non-users who would like to maintain&#xD;
      their nonsmoking non-vaping status (Grp 3); The total number of participants in this project&#xD;
      is 150 (n = 50, each group). The investigators will use an integrative 'multi-omics' approach&#xD;
      complemented with single-locus/gene validation analyses to detect temporal changes in the&#xD;
      genome, epigenome, and transcriptome relevant to cancer in the oral cells of the participants&#xD;
      as the intervention progresses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electronic cigarettes (e-cig) are increasingly popular among adult smokers and adolescent&#xD;
      never smokers. Chemical analyses of e-cig vapor and liquid have shown the presence of many of&#xD;
      the same carcinogens as those found in cigarette smoke, albeit in generally lower&#xD;
      concentrations. However, the carcinogenic potential of e-cig has not been investigated in&#xD;
      e-cig users (otherwise known as 'vapers'). The investigators will investigate the&#xD;
      cancer-causing potential of e-cig use as compared to cigarette smoking by quantifying&#xD;
      molecular changes linked to risk of cancer in smokers who switch to e-cig use vs. those who&#xD;
      maintain their smoking habits. Leveraging a source population for ongoing studies on e-cig,&#xD;
      the investigators will recruit smokers who are interested in switching to e-cig use, and two&#xD;
      control groups of non-vapers, including smokers and nonsmokers who do not intend to change&#xD;
      their smoking and nonsmoking status, respectively (n = 50, each group). Smokers consenting to&#xD;
      switch completely to e-cig will be assigned to a 3-month intervention with a standard e-cig&#xD;
      with fully described product characteristics. Control groups will maintain their&#xD;
      smoking/nonsmoking habits during the intervention. At weekly intervals, the investigators&#xD;
      will verify participants' compliance through personal interviews, CO breath tests, cotinine&#xD;
      quantification, and vaping/smoking topography measurements. The investigators will use a&#xD;
      non-invasive brushing technique to collect oral cells from the inside of the cheeks of all&#xD;
      participants at baseline and every 2 weeks, afterwards. The investigators will use an&#xD;
      integrative 'multi-omics' approach complemented with single-locus/gene validation analyses to&#xD;
      detect temporal changes in the genome, epigenome, and transcriptome relevant to cancer in the&#xD;
      oral cells of the participants as the intervention progresses.&#xD;
