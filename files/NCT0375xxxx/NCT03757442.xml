      Introduction Perioperative haemodynamic instability is associated with postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Macrocirculatory parameters, such as the conventionally obtained&#xD;
      mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output, may be uncoupled from the microcirculation&#xD;
      during sepsis and severe blood loss and may not necessarily be optimal resuscitation&#xD;
      parameters. The peripheral perfusion index (PPI) is derived from the pulse oximetry signal&#xD;
      and reflects perfusion. Reduced peripheral perfusion is associated with morbidity in&#xD;
      critically ill patients and in patients following acute surgery. We hypothesize that patients&#xD;
      with low intraoperative PPI demonstrate high frequency of postoperative complications and&#xD;
      mortality regardless of blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis We plan to conduct a prospective observational cohort study in patients&#xD;
      undergoing acute non-cardiac surgery (November 1st, 2017 to October 31st, 2018) at two&#xD;
      University Hospitals. Data will be collected prospectively from patient records including&#xD;
      patient demographics, comorbidity and intraoperative hemodynamic values, with PPI as the&#xD;
      primary exposure variable, and postoperative complications and mortality within 30 and 90&#xD;
      days as outcome variables. We primarily assess association between PPI and outcome in&#xD;
      multivariate regression models. Secondly, the predictive value of PPI for outcome, using area&#xD;
      under the receiver operating characteristics curve is assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination Data will be reported according to The Strengthening the Reporting&#xD;
      of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE). Results will be published in a peer&#xD;
      reviewed journal. The study is approved by the regional research ethics committee, storage&#xD;
      and management of data has been approved by the Regional Data Protection Agency, and access&#xD;
      to medical records is approved by the hospital board of directors at the involved hospitals&#xD;
      and departments.&#xD;

      Background Perioperative haemodynamic instability is associated with postoperative morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Patients undergoing acute major abdominal or hip fracture surgery have high&#xD;
      complication rates and account for a major part of overall postoperative mortality in&#xD;
      developed countries. These patients are often frail, with multiple comorbidities making them&#xD;
      vulnerable to anaesthesia and surgery. Despite the benefit of a multidisciplinary effort to&#xD;
      improve perioperative care, such patients demonstrate a high risk of complications and death.&#xD;
      Conventional perioperative haemodynamic monitoring is often based only on heart rate (HR) and&#xD;
      mean blood pressure (MAP). Although perioperative hypotension is associated with&#xD;
      complications in major surgery, blood pressure is often an inadequate marker of perioperative&#xD;
      organ perfusion, consequently leading to little precision in administration of fluid and&#xD;
      vasoactive medication. Minimally-invasive haemodynamic monitoring of cardiac output (CO), and&#xD;
      goal directed therapy based on stroke volume optimization, has been associated with improved&#xD;
      outcome in major elective surgery, but high quality evidence for the advantage of such&#xD;
      monitoring in emergency surgery is sparse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macrocirculatory parameters such as MAP and CO may be uncoupled from the microcirculation&#xD;
      during sepsis and severe blood loss due to sympathetic or medically induced vasoconstriction,&#xD;
      and as such, these parameters are not necessarily optimal for resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that blood flow is directed from peripheral tissue to vital organs during&#xD;
      progressive stages of circulatory impairment and shock, a non-invasive method to detect&#xD;
      impaired peripheral perfusion could be a relevant endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peripheral perfusion index (PPI) has the advantage that is derived from the photoelectric&#xD;
      plethysmographic pulse oximetry signal most likely obtained in all patients for evaluation of&#xD;
      arterial oxygen saturation (SAT) already in the emergency room and continued during and after&#xD;
      surgery as in wards and in the ICU. The PPI reflects the ratio between the pulsatile and&#xD;
      non-pulsatile component of the arterial waveform as assessed by light traversing the tissue&#xD;
      addressed, most often the finger, and it decreases in response to hypoperfusion.Thus, PPI&#xD;
      reflects changes in peripheral perfusion and blood volume and reduced peripheral perfusion is&#xD;
      associated with morbidity following acute surgery, in critically ill patients, and patients&#xD;
      presenting septic shock. However, it remains uncertain which threshold for PPI should trigger&#xD;
      intervention in patients undergoing acute surgery reflecting that evaluation is made only in&#xD;
      relatively small populations of mixed medical and surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that PPI reflects impaired peripheral circulation and that patients&#xD;
      with low intraoperative PPI, independent of MAP, have higher risk of postoperative&#xD;
      complications and mortality than patients with normal or high PPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The main objective of this study is to evaluate the association between&#xD;
      intraoperative PPI and outcome defined as severe postoperative complications and 30- and&#xD;
      90-days mortality. Secondly, we assess the predictive value of intraoperative PPI in relation&#xD;
      to outcome and evaluate whether PPI has better prediction of adverse outcome than the&#xD;
      commonly used MAP thresholds and try to establish intervention thresholds for PPI that in&#xD;
      acute non-cardiac surgical patients.&#xD;
