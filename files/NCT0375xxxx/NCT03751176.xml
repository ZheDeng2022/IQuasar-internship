    <textblock>
      To estimate progression-free-survival at 6 months in subjects treated in first-line with&#xD;
      panitumumab and FOLFOX and with wild type RAS mCRC (metastatic colorectal cancer) confirmed&#xD;
      in liquid biopsies before starting second line treatment will be screened for this trial and&#xD;
      who have interrupted panitumumab for &lt;3 months (panitumumab continuation). Control arm of&#xD;
      subjects treated with FOLFIRI alone will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combinations of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)are considered the&#xD;
      backbone chemotherapy for mCRC. Clinical trials have shown the benefit of adding monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies to subjects without mutations in RAS, directed against the epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (EGFR) (cetuximab and panitumumab) to conventional chemotherapy as first-line&#xD;
      treatment of mCRC. This trial purposes to study the treatment beyond progression with&#xD;
      panitumumab in subjects treated in first-line with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, or&#xD;
      rather,the re-introduction of the same targeted therapy after progression to first line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical hypothesis of this study is that the second-line regimen FOLFIRI + panitumumab,&#xD;
      is sufficiently active (defined as a 6-months PFS higher than 30% [based on prior results&#xD;
      with second-line FOLFIRI alone] and of at least 50%), justifying further study in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase II, multicentre, open-label, randomized two-arm study. Subjects treated in first-line&#xD;
      with panitumumab and FOLFOX and with wild type RAS mCRC confirmed in liquid biopsies before&#xD;
      starting second line treatment will be screened for this trial. Only subjects who have&#xD;
      interrupted panitumumab for &lt; 3 months (panitumumab continuation) will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will receive FOLFIRI + panitumumab until disease progression, onset of&#xD;
      unacceptable drug toxicities, or subject/physician's request to discontinue. A control arm of&#xD;
      subjects treated with FOLFIRI alone will be included. Subjects will be assigned in a 3:2&#xD;
      ratio to receive FOLFIRI + panitumumab (Group A) or FOLFIRI alone (Group B). Randomization&#xD;
      will be stratified by primary tumour location (left vs right). A blood sample will be&#xD;
      obtained at baseline and at disease progression in order to determine the mutational status&#xD;
      of RAS/BRAF and other biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour response assessment will be performed by the investigator according to Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria (version 1.1). Subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated for tumour response every 8 weeks until documentation of disease progression.&#xD;
      Responding disease will be confirmed no less than 28 days after the criteria for response are&#xD;
      first met. Subjects with symptoms suggestive of progressive disease should be evaluated for&#xD;
      tumour progression at the time the symptoms occur. After second-line treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation, information on subsequent lines of treatments at the physician discretion&#xD;
      and survival will be collected in follow-up visits carried out every 12 weeks (± 4 weeks)&#xD;
      until the end of the study (approximately 20 months after the inclusion of the last subject&#xD;
      in the study).&#xD;
