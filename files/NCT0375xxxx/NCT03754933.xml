      Primary Objective: The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of repeat&#xD;
      administration of a dose level of Ad/PNP plus fludarabine phosphate (F-araAMP) which&#xD;
      demonstrated anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced, locoregional head/neck cancer in&#xD;
      a completed phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: The secondary objective is to evaluate the antitumor activity of repeat&#xD;
      administration of Ad/PNP plus F-araAMP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Mechanism of action. The study drug, Ad/PNP-F-araAMP (Fludarabine phosphate) consists of&#xD;
           a nonreplicating adenoviral vector expressing the E. coli purine nucleoside&#xD;
           phosphorylase (PNP) injected intratumorally followed by intravenous administration of&#xD;
           F-araAMP. This combination generates 2-fluoroadenine (F-Ade) within the tumor resulting&#xD;
           in focal chemotherapeutic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           F-araAMP is an agent that is rapidly cleaved by plasma phosphatases to fludarabine,&#xD;
           which is the primary circulating form of the drug and has activity against certain&#xD;
           hematological malignancies, but not against solid tumors such as head and neck squamous&#xD;
           cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Fludarabine (F-araA) is an adenosine analog and substrate for E.&#xD;
           coli PNP, which cleaves the glycosidic bond of F-araA to generate F-Ade. The F-Ade&#xD;
           metabolite has shown pronounced activity against human tumor xenografts in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Many refractory tumors are refractory precisely because they have a very low growth&#xD;
           fraction, i.e., a relatively small percentage of tumor cells dividing at any particular&#xD;
           point in time. In nonclinical studies, significant in vivo antitumor activity has been&#xD;
           demonstrated by F-Ade generation from F-araAMP in tumors in which 2.5 to 10% of cells&#xD;
           express the E. coli PNP gene. In addition, anti-tumor effect was seen in patients with&#xD;
           advanced solid tumors (melanoma and head and neck cancer) in the higher dose cohorts&#xD;
           during a Phase 1 study (see next section).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tumor response with Ad/PNP-F-araAMP in Phase 1 Study. The safety and efficacy of&#xD;
           Ad/PNP-F-araAMP has been evaluated in a Phase 1 study, PNP-001. Four escalating dose&#xD;
           levels were evaluated in 10 subjects with head and neck cancer and 2 subjects with&#xD;
           melanoma; clinical activity was observed at the highest dose levels following 3&#xD;
           intratumoral injections of Ad/PNP over 2 days and IV F-araAMP phosphate over 3 days. The&#xD;
           overall response rate (CR+PR) was approximately 67% in the 2 highest dose cohorts,&#xD;
           Cohorts 3 and 4. Results suggest a dose response effect. The duration of response in the&#xD;
           injected tumor was limited, with 4 of 5 responding tumors having disease progression of&#xD;
           the injected lesion prior to last follow-up on Day 56, suggesting that repeat&#xD;
           administration should be evaluated. Ad/PNP + F-araAMP was well tolerated. No subject&#xD;
           experienced a dose-limiting toxicity and none of the subjects discontinued study&#xD;
           treatment. Overall, the activity and safety profile of Ad/PNP seen in the Phase 1 study&#xD;
           supports further clinical evaluation of repeat administration of Ad/PNP (IT) and&#xD;
           F-araAMP phosphate infusion for patients with HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Purpose of the Study. Based upon the tumor response seen with a single administration of&#xD;
           the two highest dose levels of Ad/PNP-F-araAMP in the Phase 1 study, PNP plans to&#xD;
           investigate the safety and assess anti-tumor activity of repeat cycles of injection of&#xD;
           Ad/PNP + F-araAMP in patients with advanced head and neck cancer. Subjects in the study&#xD;
           will have RECIST 1.1 measurable HNSCC which is amenable to local injection for which&#xD;
           there is no effective curative or palliative treatment option. This study population was&#xD;
           selected since results from this Phase 1/2 trial are intended to support the safety of&#xD;
           repeat dosing in further clinical investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Design. The trial is designed as a single-arm study to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
           repeat cycles of Ad/PNP and F-araAMP in patients with recurrent HNSCC with tumor(s)&#xD;
           accessible for injection. Ad/PNP will be injected intratumorally twice on Day 1 and once&#xD;
           on Day 2 followed by infusion of F-araAMP daily on Days 3, 4, and 5. Subjects will&#xD;
           receive repeat administration of Ad/PNP-F-araAMP every 4 weeks (i.e., each cycle) for 5&#xD;
           cycles or until injected tumor progresses, unacceptable toxicity occurs, no tumor is&#xD;
           present for injection, or patient death. Tumor response in the injected tumor(s) will be&#xD;
           assessed by physical examination as well as by radiographic imaging. All subjects will&#xD;
           be monitored for adverse events during study participation.&#xD;
