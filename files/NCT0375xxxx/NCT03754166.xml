  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of a constraint intervention combined with&#xD;
      visual-spatial cueing strategy in patients with acute stroke to improve their daily life&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of treatment in acute stroke (from D0 to D14), the investigators were able to observe&#xD;
      that despite motor recovery during physiotherapy sessions, it remained difficult for some&#xD;
      patients to use their affected arm (AA) during activities of daily life (ADL). This mechanism&#xD;
      of &quot;learned non-use&quot; would be due to a cognitive process decreasing the use of the AA and&#xD;
      could partly explain that 75% of patients maintain an upper limb deficit at 3-6 month&#xD;
      post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to combat this phenomenon, a bottom up method (sensorimotor action on the deficit)&#xD;
      of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has been developed and consists in immobilizing&#xD;
      the unaffected arm to force the use of the AA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique has proved its effectiveness in the chronic phase and has also recently been&#xD;
      proven to improve motor performance in the acute phase. Transposing progress on ADL, however,&#xD;
      remains difficult because CIMT does not contain adequate behavioral strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help the patient mobilize these strategies, coupling of CIMT with a top-down method&#xD;
      (conscious action on motor skills) has been successfully tested as an intervention of an&#xD;
      occupational therapist with the patient at least 1h / day. This intervention remains not&#xD;
      compatible with the investigators care organization because the caregiver can not spend that&#xD;
      amount of time with each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators therefore propose to associate CIMT with another top down technique:&#xD;
      visual-spatial cueing (use of panels and/or visual messages to encourage the conscious use of&#xD;
      the AA) and investigators want to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment on learning&#xD;
      transfer to ADL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study will be to test the feasibility of setting up such an&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
