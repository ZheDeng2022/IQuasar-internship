  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, wait-list controlled study examining the impact of&#xD;
      providing medically appropriate meals to patients discharged from Zuckerberg San Francisco&#xD;
      General Hospital after acute decompensated heart failure. Upon discharge, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the intervention or wait list control arm. The intervention is the&#xD;
      delivery of medically appropriate meals and groceries to patients' homes in a tapered manner&#xD;
      over five months (the equivalent of three meals a day for 60 days, then the equivalent of two&#xD;
      meals a day for 30 days, then the equivalent of one meal a day for 60 days) and monthly&#xD;
      assessments with a registered dietician (RD). All food and RD assessments are administered&#xD;
      via a community partner, Project Open Hand, as a modification of current offerings for&#xD;
      clients at Project Open Hand. Subjects randomized into the wait list control arm will receive&#xD;
      the food intervention five months after discharge. The study's primary aim is to examine the&#xD;
      impact of nutritional support on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores. In&#xD;
      addition, the study aims to examine the impact of nutritional support on healthcare&#xD;
      utilization (particularly readmission rates and emergency room utilization), dietary change,&#xD;
      medication adherence, and quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The San Francisco Department of Public Health, University of California at San Francisco&#xD;
      (UCSF), and Project Open Hand (POH), a community based organization in San Francisco which&#xD;
      provides meals and groceries to chronically ill clients in the Bay Area, have partnered to&#xD;
      conduct a prospective, randomized, wait-list controlled study examining the impact of&#xD;
      providing medically appropriate meals and registered dietician (RD) support to patients&#xD;
      discharged from Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital after acute decompensated heart&#xD;
      failure. Before discharge, patients will be randomized to either the intervention or wait&#xD;
      list control arm. The intervention consists of the delivery of medically appropriate meals&#xD;
      and/or groceries to participants' homes in a tapered manner over five months (the equivalent&#xD;
      of three meals a day for 60 days, then the equivalent of two meals a day for 30 days, then&#xD;
      the equivalent of one meal a day for 60 days) and monthly nutrition education with a&#xD;
      registered dietician (RD). All food and nutritional education are administered by POH staff&#xD;
      and RDs. Participants randomized into the wait list control arm will receive the food&#xD;
      intervention five months after discharge. The study's primary aim is to examine the impact of&#xD;
      nutritional support on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores. In addition, the&#xD;
      study aims to examine the impact of nutritional support on healthcare utilization&#xD;
      (particularly readmission rates and emergency room utilization), dietary change, medication&#xD;
      adherence, and quality of life. The investigators will assess outcomes at baseline while&#xD;
      patients are hospitalized, 2 months after discharge, and 5 months after discharge using&#xD;
      quantitative surveys. The investigators will call participants at 3 months and 4 months after&#xD;
      discharge with a shorter quantitative survey assessing a subset of outcome measures. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators will conduct a qualitative interview near the conclusion of the&#xD;
      intervention in a subset of participants to understand perceived impacts of the intervention&#xD;
      as well as barriers and facilitators to heart failure care.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Assessed at time of enrollment and 1 and 5 months after hospital discharge. A subset of questions are asked at 3 and 4 months post discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire is a 23-item instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. An overall summary score can be derived from the physical function, symptom (frequency and severity), social function and quality of life domains. Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status.</description>
