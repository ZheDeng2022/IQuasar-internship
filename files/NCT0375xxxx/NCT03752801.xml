      When a child is diagnosed with cancer the family's world is turned upside down. Parents have&#xD;
      high levels of stress because they must learn important information about their child's&#xD;
      diagnosis,medications and treatments. They must also learn how to care for their child once&#xD;
      they have left the safety of the hospital. Parents have voiced that during this time they&#xD;
      receive too much information, have paper overload, and hear and read different information&#xD;
      causing them to feel confused. Parents have shared that small amounts of information that can&#xD;
      be repeated when they want and as often as they want helps them to feel more confident to&#xD;
      care for their child. This study will ask parents if they like and can easily learn&#xD;
      information about how to care for their child with cancer from short videos that highlight&#xD;
      key points, have visual cues, and provide case examples. If parents find short videos useful&#xD;
      and helpful for learning, with the goal that they will feel more confident to care for their&#xD;
      child and have lower levels of anxiety.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A diagnosis of childhood cancer is overwhelming for both the child and family.&#xD;
      Parents/caregivers of newly diagnosed pediatric oncology patients need specialized education&#xD;
      to provide safe care for their child at home. Previous research and clinical experience have&#xD;
      highlighted that current strategies are not successful. Families report challenges with&#xD;
      paper, information overload and teaching provided at a time when they are unable to focus.&#xD;
      They describe inconsistent messages between different providers and sources of&#xD;
      information.Parents/caregivers have expressed that information that is concise, consistent,&#xD;
      with visual cues, and can be repeated, positively influences their ability to understand.&#xD;
      Poor quality of discharge teaching in pediatrics is associated with increased emergency room&#xD;
      visits and readmissions to hospital. Predictors of readmission include medical complexity and&#xD;
      4 or more medications prescribed at time of discharge. Pediatric oncology patients are&#xD;
      medically complex and at risk for significant life-threatening complications. Multiple home&#xD;
      medications are the standard for children receiving cancer therapy. Current parent/caregiver&#xD;
      education is often driven by checklists of content that health careproviders (HCP) believe&#xD;
      must be delivered prior to first hospital discharge. Timing of education is planned according&#xD;
      to HCP schedules and not consistently at a time chosen by and suitable for&#xD;
      parents/caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for providing parent/caregiver education currently include verbal discussion with&#xD;
      HCPs and written information. Evaluation of educational video strategies in pediatric&#xD;
      oncology has been limited to taped diagnostic discussions. It is reported that 90% of&#xD;
      parents/caregivers of pediatric cancer patients search the internet for information. Video&#xD;
      education developed by pediatric oncology experts has the advantage of providing consistent&#xD;
      information, being available for repeat viewing, and available at times chosen by the&#xD;
      parents/caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals and Objectives The overarching goal is to improve consistency and quality of education&#xD;
      provided to parents/caregivers of newly diagnosed pediatric oncology patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop two short video-based education modules for parents/caregivers of children with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed cancer which are acceptable and understandable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the feasibility of a trial of providing education in video modules as&#xD;
           demonstrated by the ability to recruit 20 parents/caregivers of newly diagnosed children&#xD;
           with cancer within 8 months and by having at least 90% of enrolled parents/caregivers&#xD;
           watch the two videos and answer 10 knowledge and confidence questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To obtain qualitative feedback about the videos&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe change in knowledge and confidence before and after viewing the two videos&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact and Relevance Statement This study is proposing a novel video-based education program&#xD;
      for parents/caregivers which hypothesize will lead to improved understanding and confidence&#xD;
      to care for their child newly diagnosed with cancer post first discharge from hospital.&#xD;
      Learning in this fashion can be conducted at a time best suited to each individual caregiver&#xD;
      and allow for repetition of the materials as often as desired. It ensures that different&#xD;
      caregivers for the same child receive the same information. The greatest impact will be on&#xD;
      the parents/caregivers with a goal to increase knowledge, preparedness and confidence and&#xD;
      minimize distress and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study the investigators plan to develop and evaluate two video modules focused&#xD;
      on two essential 'prior-to-first-discharge' topics: the approach to fever and giving&#xD;
      medications at home. The video modules will be short, concise and will include case-based&#xD;
      scenarios allowing parents/caregivers to review and consolidate teaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The content of the videos will be developed by pediatric oncology nurses, physicians and&#xD;
      pharmacists from across POGO centers. The review panel will consist of 8-12 HCPs with&#xD;
      representation by discipline and center. The script will be developed in a series of&#xD;
      teleconferences in which first the content will be developed and refined using a consensus&#xD;
      approach. Once the content is agreed upon, a script will be developed and refined among the&#xD;
      review panel. When finalized, the investigators will begin to test acceptability and&#xD;
      understandability with respondents. For this phase, eligible respondents will be any parent&#xD;
      or caregiver of a child with cancer irrespective of type or timing of diagnosis. The&#xD;
      investigators will exclude respondents who do not understand English. The investigators will&#xD;
      then test the script with consecutive parent/guardian respondents using one-on-one cognitive&#xD;
      interviews. The investigators will ask the respondent to read the script and the&#xD;
      investigators will ask them to rate acceptability and understandability on 5 Point Likert&#xD;
      scales which the investigators have used previously for instrument development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a semi-structured interview, the investigators will ask probing questions to clarify&#xD;
      their understanding of content. A second interviewer will be present who will rate&#xD;
      understandability on a 4 point Likert scale ranging from 1=completely incorrect to&#xD;
      4=completely correct. After every 5 interviews, the results will be shared with the review&#xD;
      panel who will decide whether to modify the script. Iterations will continue until at least 4&#xD;
      of the last 5 respondents are correct in their interpretation, state the script is&#xD;
      understandable and acceptable and further modifications are not required based upon&#xD;
      qualitative comments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The finalized scripts will be developed into short videos, less than 5 minutes in length. The&#xD;
      videos will be tested in new groups of 5 respondents and similarly evaluated for&#xD;
      acceptability and understandability using cognitive interviews. Respondents will be&#xD;
      specifically asked about length and clarity of information presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The videos will be considered satisfactory when at least 4 of the last 5 respondents are&#xD;
      correct in their interpretation, state the video is understandable and acceptable and further&#xD;
      modifications are not required based upon qualitative comments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidence and knowledge questions will be developed in a similar method with consensus among&#xD;
      the Pediatric Oncology HCPs and then with parents. This will allow both clinical expert&#xD;
      consensus and parent validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the investigators will test the feasibility of a trial of the educational video modules&#xD;
      by conduct of a pilot study based at SickKids. Eligible respondents will be parents or&#xD;
      caregivers of children newly diagnosed with cancer within the past 4 weeks. The investigators&#xD;
      will exclude parents who do not understand English. Only one parent per child will be&#xD;
      eligible. For eligible and consenting parents/caregivers, the investigators will ask them to&#xD;
      watch the two videos, summarize the content of the video and provide feedback similar to the&#xD;
      development phase. The investigators will also ask them to answer the confidence survey and&#xD;
      the knowledge questions which will measure their knowledge and confidence in different&#xD;
      domains of fever management and medication administration. The questions will be administered&#xD;
      before and after watching the videos.&#xD;
