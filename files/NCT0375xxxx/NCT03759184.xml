  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a blood cancer. Recombinant human interleukin 15&#xD;
      (IL-15) is a manmade protein. Obinutuzumab is a protein made to deactivate cancer cells.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if treating people with CLL with both proteins improves their&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find the safe dose of IL-15 with obinutuzumab. To identify its effects, including on the&#xD;
      immune system and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 18 years old who have certain CLL that standard therapy has failed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of ability to do daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, heart, and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small amount of bone marrow removed by needle in the hipbone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans of the body and/or brain&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be done in 28-day cycles for up to 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drugs through a catheter and pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1: Participants will stay in the clinic for week 1. They will get:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-15 as a continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours on days 1-5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obinutuzumab as an infusion on 4 days, over about 4 hours. The doses for this will&#xD;
           increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other cycles: Participants will come to the clinic days 1 5 and get IL-15 as in cycle 1. They&#xD;
      will get obinutuzumab on day 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will repeat screening tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will get standard medicines for side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  May give blood, saliva, and tumor samples for research&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, participants will have follow-up visits every 3 months for 1 year, then&#xD;
      every 6 months for up to 5 years. After that, participants may be called or emailed.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Of the several drugs and drug combinations approved for treatment of relapsed and&#xD;
           refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the reported complete response rates are&#xD;
           no greater than 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obinutuzumab is a glycoengineered, humanized type 2 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
           thought to engage the immune system by directly activating antibody-dependent,&#xD;
           cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); it is approved for treatment of chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
           leukemia in combination with chlorambucil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The key mediators of ADCC are polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes, and natural&#xD;
           killer (NK) cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) is a stimulatory cytokine that promotes the&#xD;
           differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes, and long-term CD8+ memory Tcells.&#xD;
           In a Phase I trial, administration of rhIL-15 as a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion&#xD;
           (civ) was associated with up to 45-fold increase in the number of NK cells at well&#xD;
           tolerated dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical murine lymphoid malignancy models have shown increased efficacy of&#xD;
           monoclonal antibodies when administered together with rhIL-15; BL/6 mice inoculated with&#xD;
           EL4-CD20 cells (a syngeneic lymphoma line); including significant prolongation of&#xD;
           survival with the IL-15/Rituximab combination compared to either drug given as single&#xD;
           agent (90% v. 30% alive at 75 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the safety, toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of civ rhIL-15 administration in combination with intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      obinutuzumab treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with greater than or equal to 50% of B&#xD;
           cells xpressing CD20&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have CLL that is refractory or relapsed following therapy with a Bruton s&#xD;
&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor OR have relapsed/refractory CLL and are intolerant to BTK&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy; patients with del(17p) must also be refractory or relapsed after, or&#xD;
      intolerant to, therapy with venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function parameters as defined within the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active disease requiring treatment, as defined within the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a single institution non-randomized Phase I dose escalation study evaluating&#xD;
           increasing doses of civ rhIL-15 in combination with obinutuzumab using a standard 3 + 3&#xD;
           dose escalation design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On days 1-5 of each 4-week cycle, rhIL-15 will be administered by civ at dose levels&#xD;
           0.5, 1, and 2 mcg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the first cycle, obinutuzumab will be administered at a dose of 100 mg by IV on&#xD;
           day 4, 900 mg on day 5, 1,000 mg on day 11, and 1,000 mg on day 18; then 1,000 mg on day&#xD;
           4 of each subsequent cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infusion reaction, antimicrobial, and tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis will be&#xD;
           administered per manufacturer s recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will continue up to 6 cycles, or until unacceptable toxicity or progressive&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 24 patients will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
