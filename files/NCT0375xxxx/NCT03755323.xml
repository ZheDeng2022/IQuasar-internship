  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a public health problem, given its prevalence (15% in France in 2012, Ob√©pi&#xD;
      survey) but also by the complications that it generates. We were firstly, intersted in bone&#xD;
      mineral density during obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We were able to confirm in an observational study that BMD (Z-score)was augmented. We also&#xD;
      showed, for the first time, that this increase in Z-score was dependent on sex, severity of&#xD;
      obesity and age but also bone site. If the increase in BMD at the level of the bearing zones&#xD;
      seems logically to be explained by the hypothesis that the mechanical stresses have an&#xD;
      osteogenic effect on the bone tissue, the latter can not in any way respond to the&#xD;
      concomitant increase in BMD at non-bearing areas such as the radius.These results suggest&#xD;
      that changes in certain systemic compounds induced by obesity may interfere with bone&#xD;
      metabolism. recent data also suggest a change in the concentration of pro-glucagon peptides&#xD;
      (GLP-1, glicentin, glucagon, etc.) in obese subjects and in bariatric surgery). Although body&#xD;
      composition and its variation after surgery could be largely involved in the modification of&#xD;
      these peptides, no data on these potential relationships is currently available. However, no&#xD;
      data are available for baseline body composition and weight loss data. Finally, 80% of&#xD;
      obesity is associated with insulin resistance, a key mechanism in the pathophysiology of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes. A metabolically healthy obesity phenotype is described, although the definition&#xD;
      criteria are not consensual.The evolution of this phenotype with aging and with the duration&#xD;
      of evolution of obesity is not well described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal is to create a database of weight-bearing patients in the care setting and to&#xD;
      determine the &quot;hormonal dialogue&quot; between peripheral (muscular and adipose) and bone tissues,&#xD;
      which may be associated with changes in body composition during obesity and aging, and that&#xD;
      according to sex.&#xD;
