  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This crossover randomized design study's objective is to see if mind body interventions can&#xD;
      help students on a college campus manage their chronic pain and/or PTSD. Participants will&#xD;
      attend 10 mind body skills group sessions that are 2 hours each. These group sessions teach a&#xD;
      variety of ways (skills) for people to express their feelings. A licensed doctor, who is&#xD;
      certified to teach mind-body skills group classes, will lead the skills group. Participants&#xD;
      will be assessed with an anxiety questionnaire, a chronic pain measure and a measure of heart&#xD;
      rate variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two groups. Group 1 will begin intervention after baseline testing and will&#xD;
      receive follow-up skill sessions once every month for 6 months. The first group will also&#xD;
      attend bonus classes during the next 6 months. The second group will do baseline testing and&#xD;
      no intervention for the first 10 weeks. They will then participate in the skills groups the&#xD;
      second 10 weeks. There will be 3,6 and 12 month follow up data also taken.&#xD;

      Students on campus will be made aware of the study through fliers posted on campus. If they&#xD;
      contact the study representatives to participate, they will fill out a screening&#xD;
      questionnaire that will determine their symptoms and care they are currently receiving. Those&#xD;
      that meet the inclusion criteria will be assigned to Group 1 or 2 randomly. The mind body&#xD;
      skills groups will be 10 weeks long. Group 1 will participate in mind body interventions&#xD;
      immediately, and Group 2 will continue with their usual care for the 10 weeks. After the&#xD;
      first session, Group 2 will complete the mind body intervention sessions. The research will&#xD;
      therefore be a crossover randomized design where each group will serve as its own control,&#xD;
      and also may be compared to the other group. Participants in either group will still be&#xD;
      allowed to participate in any care they are currently receiving outside of the mind body&#xD;
      intervention, including but not limited to counseling or a support group or therapy. Also,&#xD;
      after these groups are over, the first group will continue to have &quot;reunion groups&quot; once per&#xD;
      month for 6 months and the second group will not. Reunion groups will consist of&#xD;
      supplementary mind body skills group sessions that reinforce skills learned in the original&#xD;
      mind body skills groups and also work on retention of knowledge beyond the program. Outcome&#xD;
      measures will be taken pre and post mind body skills group, and then at 3, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
      after the 10 week mind body skills group ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The topics for each session is based upon the Centers for Mind Body Medicine model. Both&#xD;
      groups will follow this same weekly topic schedule.&#xD;
