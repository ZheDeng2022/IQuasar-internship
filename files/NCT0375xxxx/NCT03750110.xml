  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer rates are higher in Yorkshire than the rest of the UK, and this is due to higher&#xD;
      rates of smoking. Deaths from lung cancer can be reduced using regular lung scans (screening)&#xD;
      and by helping people stop smoking. As well as detecting cancers, scans can also show&#xD;
      evidence of damage to lungs (emphysema) and heart arteries (calcification). This study will&#xD;
      test whether people can be encouraged to quit smoking by giving them pictures from their own&#xD;
      scans showing possible lung and heart damage, along with information about how stopping&#xD;
      smoking reduces their risk of cancer and heart attacks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer has the highest mortality of all cancers in the UK and is the single biggest&#xD;
      cause of premature death in Leeds. It disproportionately affects those from lower&#xD;
      socioeconomically deprived communities where rates of smoking are highest. In 2014 in the&#xD;
      Leeds South and East and the Leeds West Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) areas, lung cancer&#xD;
      standardized incidence rates were 131.4 and 103.3 respectively, compared to an average of&#xD;
      78.3 across England. Lung cancer standardized under-75 mortality rates were 52.4 and 39.3&#xD;
      respectively, compared to 33.26 across England. Poor outcomes from lung cancer treatment are&#xD;
      typically the result of advanced, incurable disease at the time of symptomatic presentation.&#xD;
      In 2011, the US National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated a 20% reduction in lung&#xD;
      cancer specific mortality, and a 6.7% reduction in all-cause mortality by annual low-dose CT&#xD;
      (LDCT) screening, and lung cancer screening is now being adopted across North America having&#xD;
      been recommended by the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2013. A number of&#xD;
      European nations are deliberating introducing screening programmes for lung cancer, and await&#xD;
      the results of the NELSON study, the only European study powered to demonstrate a mortality&#xD;
      reduction, which remains in follow-up. Despite widespread adoption in North America, several&#xD;
      important questions remain regarding the best way to implement lung cancer screening. These&#xD;
      include the optimum selection criteria to identify high-risk individuals to maximise clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness, how to increase participation among 'hard to reach'&#xD;
      populations, and how most effectively to embed smoking cessation support into these&#xD;
      programmes. The Yorkshire Lung Screening Trial, funded by Yorkshire Cancer Research ( ISRCTN&#xD;
      reference number 42704678) , seeks to address the first two issues identified above, and is&#xD;
      due to commence screening in 2018. However, there are no currently funded UK studies&#xD;
      specifically investigating optimal smoking cessation provision within a lung cancer screening&#xD;
      programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 85% of cases of lung cancer are caused by tobacco smoking, and stopping smoking, at&#xD;
      any age, significantly reduces lung cancer risk. It is therefore essential that any lung&#xD;
      cancer screening programme provides smoking cessation support for participants, and doing so&#xD;
      significantly increases the overall success of lung cancer screening programmes. One concern&#xD;
      that has been raised around lung cancer screening for current smokers is the potential 'moral&#xD;
      hazard' arising from a negative (i.e. reassuring) screening result, which may reduce&#xD;
      motivation to quit. Conversely, attendance at a lung cancer screening programme offers a&#xD;
      'teachable moment' for smoking cessation, occurring at a time when participating smokers may&#xD;
      be particularly receptive to offers of help to quit and indeed a negative screen result has&#xD;
      been reported as being perceived as a 'clean slate' as a motivator to stop smoking. This&#xD;
      observation fits with unpublished findings from a screening initiative in Manchester that&#xD;
      despite a high prevalence of emphysema (68%) and coronary artery calcification (74%), most&#xD;
      attendees were fit and relatively asymptomatic (85-90% performance status 0-1 and MRC&#xD;
      dyspnoea scale 1-2), and hence potentially more susceptible to a message that lung damage had&#xD;
      already occurred but clinical impact could be reduced by stopping smoking. One report from&#xD;
      the NELSON study suggested a lower quit rate in screened persons compared to the unscreened&#xD;
      control group, although a statistically significant effect did not persist following&#xD;
      intention to treat analysis. No significant difference was seen between screened and control&#xD;
      populations in the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Study, and the quit rate was significantly&#xD;
      higher in screened versus control populations in the UK Lung Screening (UKLS) Pilot. Evidence&#xD;
      suggests that smoking cessation and LDCT screening have additive effects on survival. An&#xD;
      analysis of participants in the NLST reported a 38% reduction in lung cancer mortality with&#xD;
      the combination of smoking abstinence at 15 years with LDCT screeningÍ¾ in addition, detection&#xD;
      of an abnormality on the CT scan was associated with increased likelihood of smoking&#xD;
      cessation. Further analysis of the NLST showed that arranging the smoking cessation support&#xD;
      at the time of the screening increased quit rates by 46% (although this intervention was&#xD;
      delivered to only 10% of study participants). In addition, research has indicated that adding&#xD;
      smoking cessation interventions to LDCT screening improves the cost effectiveness of such&#xD;
      programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, while smoking cessation is clearly an effective preventive intervention there is&#xD;
      little evidence on the design and optimization of the smoking cessation interventions and&#xD;
      support used in the screening setting. Evidence from a systematic review published in 2014&#xD;
      showed a benefit of materials tailored to the characteristics of individual smokers, although&#xD;
      the included studies were conducted predominantly in the general population, rather than&#xD;
      screening participants. Less research has been conducted investigating approaches to&#xD;
      cessation in smokers attending for lung cancer screening, although a recent study by Marshall&#xD;
      and colleagues reported that it was feasible to deliver a single tailored session of&#xD;
      motivational interviewing counselling on the day of screening. For historical reasons NHS&#xD;
      Stop Smoking Services (SSS) have evolved across the UK as opt-in facilities, whereby smokers&#xD;
      who decide or agree to try to quit smoking then seek and are delivered help to do so. During&#xD;
      the past five years however, evidence has grown that provision of smoking cessation support&#xD;
      as an opt-out default generates far more quit attempts. We have demonstrated this to be the&#xD;
      case in hospital inpatients, in which the opt-out model approximately doubled service uptake.&#xD;
      Similar findings have been reported in relation to pregnant women setting quit dates in one&#xD;
      NHS Foundation Trust, with uptake more than doubling after 'opt out' referrals were&#xD;
      implemented. A study from the US found that 83% of eligible smokers did not opt out of a&#xD;
      bedside consultation. Pro-active and systematic approaches to smoking cessation provision&#xD;
      were recommended by NICE for pregnant women in 2010 and across all acute, maternity and&#xD;
      mental health settings in 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent UK study has also demonstrated the efficacy of including personalised risk&#xD;
      information when inviting participants to smoking cessation services. A randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial compared an individually tailored risk letter with an invitation to attend an&#xD;
      introductory smoking cessation session to a standard generic letter advertising smoking&#xD;
      cessation services. The personalised information was presented as a &quot;Personal Health Risk&#xD;
      Report&quot;, and included information on the participant's general health derived from Quality&#xD;
      and Outcomes Framework (QOF) registered conditions on the GP record. In addition&#xD;
      disease-specific health risks were included in the risk report, with the aim of making the&#xD;
      individual aware of the personal health consequences of continuing to smoke, and their own&#xD;
      individual risk of serious illness. The aim of providing this information was to change the&#xD;
      individual's balance of perceived 'benefits' against their understanding of the harm caused&#xD;
      by smoking. The group receiving personalised risk information had significantly higher&#xD;
      attendance at stop smoking service (17.4% vs. 9.0%, adjusted OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.8- 2.7), higher&#xD;
      completion of a 6-week NHS course (14.5% vs. 7.0%, adjusted OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.8-2.9) and&#xD;
      higher 6- month validated abstinence (9.0% vs. 5.5%, adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.29-2.14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maximize smoking cessation among lung cancer screening participants it is therefore&#xD;
      clearly important that all smokers who attend are provided with cessation support as a&#xD;
      routine opt-out component of the screening visit, and that this support provides cessation&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy and behavioural support in accordance with evidence-based NHS SSS practice.&#xD;
      Furthermore the screening process, including risk assessment for lung cancer and imaging of&#xD;
      the lung parenchyma and coronary arteries, allows an unprecedented opportunity for&#xD;
      personalising the risks and harms of continued smoking, or conversely, the health gains to be&#xD;
      made by successful smoking cessation. However there is currently no evidence on how best to&#xD;
      design services to maximize the opportunity provided by screening participation, and how best&#xD;
      to use the personalised information forthcoming from the screening process.&#xD;
