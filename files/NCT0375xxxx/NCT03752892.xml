  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lung disease that limits the ability to breathe&#xD;
      enough for a good workout. One way to improve the exercise training is to reduce the number&#xD;
      of muscles being trained together. By training one leg at a time, the patient does not have&#xD;
      to breathe as much allowing each leg a better workout. Our groundwork suggests it may work in&#xD;
      patients with IPF. This study will help decide whether one-legged exercise training is better&#xD;
      at improving a patient's exercise endurance compared to the usual way of exercising with both&#xD;
      legs at the same time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea is a major clinical manifestation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). It becomes&#xD;
      more severe and more limiting as the condition progresses. Many professional respiratory&#xD;
      societies recommend that the standard of care for IPF includes pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).&#xD;
      However, some patients with IPF are so limited by dyspnea that they are unable to tolerate&#xD;
      levels of aerobic exercise training sufficient to induce the physiological adaptations that&#xD;
      will improve functional and health related outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for exercise&#xD;
      training interventions that will enhance the muscle training stimulus above that currently&#xD;
      possible in individuals with a marked ventilatory limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partitioning large muscle exercise using one-legged high intensity training is more effective&#xD;
      than conventional aerobic training when applied to patients with central ventilatory or&#xD;
      cardiac limitation. Effective partitioned exercise enables an increased muscle load with less&#xD;
      ventilatory load. It increases the training stimulus to the muscles as they work at a high&#xD;
      intensity, relative to their current aerobic state, necessary to increase their capacity. As&#xD;
      long as the active muscle mass can create the same demands on the central exercise components&#xD;
      of the heart and circulation as does conventional two-legged exercise, this simple,&#xD;
      inexpensive novel approach, will stimulate leg muscles sufficiently to improve overall&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness. For example, in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
      one-legged training has been shown to provide a muscle specific stimulus sufficient to&#xD;
      improve whole body peak oxygen uptake during pulmonary rehabilitation. A preliminary acute&#xD;
      study of patients with IPF has demonstrated that during a laboratory simulation of an&#xD;
      exercise training session, partitioning aerobic exercise extended exercise tolerance.&#xD;
      Participants achieved double the work whilst exercising with one leg compared with two-legged&#xD;
      cycle exercise. Partitioned training may therefore be an effective approach to exercise&#xD;
      training in patients with IPF enrolled in PR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of pharmacological agents that stabilize the clinical course of IPF presents a&#xD;
      window of opportunity for exercise rehabilitation to further improve function. The aim of&#xD;
      this proposed study is to determine whether, within the setting of PR, partitioned aerobic&#xD;
      exercise training with a one-legged cycle training regime is more effective than the&#xD;
      conventional two-legged regimen in increasing exercise tolerance. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that partitioned aerobic exercise training, using a one-legged training regime is more&#xD;
      effective than conventional two-legged exercise training in increasing exercise tolerance&#xD;
      (measured by constant power endurance) and cardiorespiratory fitness as measured by maximal&#xD;
      oxygen uptake. The results will inform the best approach to produce clinically meaningful&#xD;
      improvements in dyspnea and health status for those with IPF.&#xD;
