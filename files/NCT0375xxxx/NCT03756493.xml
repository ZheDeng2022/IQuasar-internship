  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different therapeutic approaches have been proposed for the treatment of furcation defects&#xD;
      and the regeneration of periodontium within the furcation area is considered one of the most&#xD;
      challenging aspect of surgical periodontal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal regeneration is a highly predictable therapeutic option for the treatment of&#xD;
      different furcation defects, particularly class II furcation involvements in the lower&#xD;
      molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the application of a combined therapeutic approach (i.e., barrier, bone&#xD;
      re-placement graft with or without biological agents) seems to offer better results as&#xD;
      compared with monotherapeutic treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated that platelet concentrates, such as platelet-rich plasma&#xD;
      (PRP), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and, more recently, leukocyte and platelet-rich&#xD;
      fibrin (L-PRF) can represent new therapeutic options for bone regeneration procedures by&#xD;
      increasing the healing potential of natural blood clot in the surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukocyte and Platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) is a second-generation platelet concentrate,&#xD;
      developed by Choukroun et al. It is prepared without the addition of any anticoagulants and&#xD;
      consists of a slowly polymerized complex fibrin network which incorporates leukocytes, glycan&#xD;
      chains, structural glycoproteins and an high concentration of growth factors such as&#xD;
      transforming growth factor β (TGF-B), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The three-dimensional architecture and the specific&#xD;
      biochemical properties, which facilitate the wound healing processes, have led to a&#xD;
      widespread use of this biomaterial in plastic surgery, maxillofacial surgery, oral and&#xD;
      periodontal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large clinical and histological evidence supports the concept that autogenous bone grafts&#xD;
      (ABG) are highly effective regenerative materials in the treatment of intrabony defects.&#xD;
      Moreover, with respect to the treatment of furcation defects, outcome data from a number of&#xD;
      studies generally indicate positive clinical benefits with the use of bone grafts in the&#xD;
      treatment of Class II furcations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, on the basis of such considerations, the aim of this study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a combined regenerative treatment by L- PRF and ABG in the treatment of&#xD;
      mandibular molars degree II furcation defects and to compare the outcomes of such a treatment&#xD;
      with those from (OFD)+ABG and OFD alone treatments.&#xD;

      Experimental Design. This randomized, comparative and clinical trial will be designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 months after three treatment modalities of&#xD;
      mandibular degree II furcation defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients study will exhibit buccal or lingual mandibular degree II furcation defects; all&#xD;
      experimental sites will be accessed with a SPPF procedure. L- PRF and autogenous bone graft&#xD;
      (ABG) will be applied to the debrided defects in the OFD+ABG+L-PRF group; the OFD+ABG group&#xD;
      will receive only ABG and the OFD group will be treated with Open Flap Debridement (OFD)&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population. At least fifty-four patients, aged 18 to 70 years old, affected by&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe chronic periodontitis, will be selected for this study and treated at the&#xD;
      Operating Unit of Periodontology and Oral Hygiene of the Department of Medical, Oral and&#xD;
      Biotechnological Sciences, &quot;G. D'Annunzio&quot; Chieti-Pescara University, Italy. Each patient&#xD;
      will participate in the study with a single experimental site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will receive verbal and written information and will sign a consent form&#xD;
      approved by the Ethical Committee of the G. D'Annunzio University of Chieti medical faculty.&#xD;
      The study protocol is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, as revised in&#xD;
      2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each defect will be assigned a defect number and will be randomly allocated to one of the&#xD;
      three treatment regimens. Assignment will be performed by a custom made computer-generated&#xD;
      table. To conceal allocation, opaque envelops will be assigned to the specific experimental&#xD;
      site and will be opened during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four months before the surgical treatment, all 54 patients will undergo non-surgical&#xD;
      periodontal treatment consisting of supragingival and subgingival scaling and root planing&#xD;
      (SRP) by ultrasonic instruments and hand curets and motivational instructions on oral home&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete oral and periodontal examinations will be performed for each patient before and 4&#xD;
      months after the non-surgical treatment. These will include full mouth plaque score (FMPS),&#xD;
      full mouth bleeding score (FMBS), probing depth (PD), vertical clinical attachment level&#xD;
      (VCAL), horizontal clinical attachment level (HCAL), and gingival recession (GR) for six&#xD;
      sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual/ palatal,&#xD;
      mid-lingual/palatal, and disto-lingual/palatal sites). The measurements will be recorded&#xD;
      using a University of North Carolina (UNC-15, HuFriedy, Chicago, Illinois, USA) periodontal&#xD;
      probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements at mid-buccal or mid-lingual experimental sites will be taken&#xD;
      immediately before surgical treatment (baseline) and 6 months after treatment, by the same&#xD;
      experienced examiner (MP), who will be masked to the treatment. The primary outcome of the&#xD;
      study will be HCAL gain at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic Measurements. Preoperative and 6 months postoperative standardized radiographs&#xD;
      will be taken by the paralleling technique using an individual film-holder device consisting&#xD;
      of a bite block rigidly connected to an acrylic dental splint to achieve identical film&#xD;
      placement at each evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiographs will be digitized using an image processing device, after choosing the&#xD;
      standard scan settings (600 dots per inch and 256 levels of gray).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements related to vertical bone level (VBL) will be performed using a dedicated&#xD;
      software and calculating the distance between the furcation fornix and the bottom of the&#xD;
      defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, from each patient of all groups, to avoid unblinding, 30 ml of blood was&#xD;
      collected in three 10-ml sterile tubes without anticoagulant, and it was quickly&#xD;
      centrifuged‖‖ at 3,000 revolutions/minute for 10 minutes.The fibrin clot (L-PRF) was&#xD;
      collected and squeezed in the L-PRF Box to form three membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique. All the surgeries will be performed by the same experienced clinician. In&#xD;
      all groups, after local anaesthesia, mucoperiosteal SPPFs will be raised. Mesial and distal&#xD;
      vertical releasing incisions will be performed to allow more visibility and defects&#xD;
      accessibility. After flap elevation, flap mobility will be tested to ensure that primary&#xD;
      closure of the wound could be achieved through tension-free suturing. The granulation tissue&#xD;
      adherent to the alveolar bone will be removed to provide full access and visibility to the&#xD;
      root and bone surfaces. SRP will be performed. ABG material will be collected using bone&#xD;
      scrapers in OFD+ABG+L-PRF group and OFD+ABG group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the OFD+ABG+L-PRF group , one L-PRF membrane cutted into small pieces and mixed with ABG&#xD;
      will be placed in the furcation defect. The other PRF membranes in each patient will be&#xD;
      placed over the grafted defect and will be sutured with an absorbable suture. The OFD+ABG&#xD;
      group defects will be grafted only with ABG and will be not covered by a L-PRF membrane. The&#xD;
      OFD group defect will be treated only with open flap debridement. Finally the flap will be&#xD;
      repositioned and horizontal mattress and interrupted sutures will be carried out.&#xD;
