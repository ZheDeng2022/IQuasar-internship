  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Common peroneal mononeuropathy at the fibular neck (CPN) is one of the most frequent&#xD;
      mononeuropathies of the lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common peroneal nerve sub serves sensation to the dorsum of the foot and toes. In CPN&#xD;
      motor fibers of the deep peroneal nerve are more frequently affected than those of the&#xD;
      superficial peroneal nerve. Fascicles of the deep branch of the common peroneal nerve are&#xD;
      more anteriorly located and more vulnerable to injury than those of the superficial peroneal&#xD;
      branch. The clinical and electrodiagnostic findings in CPN resemble the anatomical structure&#xD;
      of the common peroneal nerve, indeed fibers for the deep peroneal nerve and the superficial&#xD;
      peroneal nerve are bounded in separate fascicles along the course of the nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superficial peroneal nerve sensory potential (SPSP) should be performed to localize the site&#xD;
      of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrodiagnostic testing is used widely to evaluate the function of the common peroneal&#xD;
      nerve. SPSP have been examined in CPN with conflicting results. A loss in amplitude of this&#xD;
      response implies some axonal loss affecting either the common peroneal nerve or its&#xD;
      superficial branch. Prominent axonal loss is the hallmark of most CPN lesions and suggested&#xD;
      that abnormalities in sensory nerves mirror those in motor nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, assessment of the structure of the common peroneal nerve is likely to improve the&#xD;
      diagnostic yield&quot; by using high-resolution ultrasonography. Ultrasound imaging is painless,&#xD;
      does not expose the patient to radiation, and has several advantages compared with magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging in the laboratory setting, including reduced cost, accessibility, ability&#xD;
      to image the entire length of the nerve in a single study, and the ability to image both&#xD;
      statically and dynamically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted to evaluate the superficial peroneal sensory potential and&#xD;
      high-resolution ultrasonography role in confirmation of common peroneal mononeuropathy at the&#xD;
      fibular neck.&#xD;

      The current study is a case control study that was done in the period from January 2015 to&#xD;
      January 2016. The study included 70 participants presented with clinical and&#xD;
      electrophysiological evidence of common peroneal neuropathy at the fibular neck (CPN)&#xD;
      attending to Zagazig University Hospitals (Neurology, Rheumatology&amp; Rehabilitation, and&#xD;
      Orthopedic departments) and insurance hospitals of Sharkia governorate (47 male and 23&#xD;
      female). Their age (mean ± SD/years) was 40.4± 12.9, the duration between the onset of&#xD;
      symptom and enrollment in the study ranged between 21 days to 6 months. Seventy (45 males and&#xD;
      25 females) apparently healthy volunteers were included as controls, and their age (mean ±&#xD;
      SD/ years) was 41.3 ± 11.8. They were selected from the persons attending to blood bank for&#xD;
      blood donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants included in the present study are subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Full history taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Thorough clinical and neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Routine laboratories tests for exclusion of other systemic affection like diabetes&#xD;
           mellitus, renal or hepatic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Electrodiagnostic studies&#xD;
&#xD;
           All tests were done in the same room, at the time of clinical diagnosis using a Nicolet&#xD;
           Viking Quest cart electrodiagnostic system. Lower extremity temperature was maintained&#xD;
           at or above 30º C at time of examination. The electrophysiological studies included the&#xD;
           following:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A-Motor nerve conduction studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Motor conduction study of the common peroneal nerve (ankle-fibular neck -popliteal&#xD;
           fossa), tibial motor nerve conduction study were performed with surface disc recording&#xD;
           electrodes for the affected limb and the contralateral limb in all subjects. Evaluations&#xD;
           of both upper limbs were added to exclude more wide lesions if suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Common peroneal CMAPs were recorded over extensor digitorum brevis and tibialis&#xD;
           anterior.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigators considered that the lesion is axonal via axonal loss estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Axonal loss of the motor branch of the common peroneal nerve was estimated by comparing&#xD;
           the CMAP amplitude recorded from the extensor digitorum brevis on the affected and&#xD;
           contralateral sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An estimate of EDB axonal loss was obtained from the formula (U -A)/U ×100 U : (extensor&#xD;
           digitorum brevis response amplitude from the unaffected side).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A : (extensor digitorum brevis response amplitude from the affected side).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Categorization based on the motor estimated axonal loss as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
           No loss: (&lt;50%). Mild to moderate loss: (50-75%). Severe loss: (&gt;75%).&#xD;
&#xD;
           B- Sensory nerve conduction studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Antidromic evaluation of the superficial peroneal nerve sensory potential (SPSP) at the&#xD;
           ankle was studied with surface stimulating and recording electrodes on the affected limb&#xD;
           and the contralateral limb in all subjects. The site of stimulation was just anterior to&#xD;
           the edge of the shaft of the fibula and 14 cm proximal to the active ankle electrode.&#xD;
           The active recording electrode was placed midway between the edge of the tibia and the&#xD;
           tip of the lateral malleolus or 3 cm proximal to the bimalleolar line. The reference&#xD;
           recording electrode was placed 3 cm distal to the active electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SPSP was considered affected when any one of the following is detected :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No constant wave forms could be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SPSP amplitudes &lt; 5 μv or &lt; 50% of the contra lateral side.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Increased peak latency ≥ 4.4 ms (based on standard distance of 14 cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
           C-Electromyographic study (EMG) was carried out using concentric needle in the following&#xD;
           muscles: extensor digitorum brevis (EDB), tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, tibialis&#xD;
           posterior, extensor halucis longus, short head of biceps femoris, vastus lateralis,&#xD;
           medial head of gastrocnemius, iliacus, gluteus medius, tensor fascia lata and Paraspinal&#xD;
           muscles. Concentric needle EMG was performed in all patients. Spontaneous and voluntary&#xD;
           motor unit activity was assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Radiological examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Ultrasonographic assessment of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonographic examination by radiologist was conducted with a General Electric Logiq 7 Pro&#xD;
      machine (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, England), using a 5- to 12-MHz linear array&#xD;
      transducer. The cross sectional area (CSA) of the common peroneal nerve was determined within&#xD;
      the echogenic rim surrounding the nerve at the level of the fibular neck with the probe&#xD;
      perpendicular to the main nerve course in the transverse and longitudinal plane. The&#xD;
      sonographic measurements were done on the same day or within 1 week after the&#xD;
      electrodiagnostic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiologist was blinded to the participants' electrophysiological study data. However,&#xD;
      the radiologist was aware of the clinical and electrophysiological suspicion for common&#xD;
      peroneal neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authors of the present study considered that common peroneal nerve is affected by the&#xD;
      sonographic measurements if the value of CSA of the common peroneal nerve at the fibular neck&#xD;
      was &gt;11 mm2 according to the study control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Plain radiographs were done to detect the underlying traumatic injuries, such as a&#xD;
      proximal fibular head fracture or osseous tumors, or in assessing the severity of angular&#xD;
      deformities about the knee. Lumbosacral plain X ray or MRI were done only if needed to rule&#xD;
      lumbosacral affection.&#xD;
