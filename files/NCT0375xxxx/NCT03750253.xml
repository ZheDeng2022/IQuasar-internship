      Arthroscopic surgery is effective in treating osteochondral lesions of the talus. However,&#xD;
      there are still some patients with postoperative ankle pain. This study aims to investigate&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy of shock wave adjuvant therapy in the treatment of postoperative pain&#xD;
      caused by cartilage injury of talus after arthroscopy and to provide basis for further&#xD;
      popularization and application.&#xD;

      Arthroscopic surgery is effective in treating osteochondral lesions of the talus. However,&#xD;
      there are still some patients with postoperative ankle pain. This study was conducted to&#xD;
      investigate the clinical efficacy of shock wave therapy in the treatment of postoperative&#xD;
      pain caused by cartilage injury of talus after arthroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus treated by arthroscopic microfracture&#xD;
      surgery and still complained ankle pain three months after surgery were enrolled. Radial&#xD;
      extracorporeal shock wave therapy was used to give energy to the injured region of the talus&#xD;
      and the adjacent area.Treatment was done once a week for 5 consecutive weeks. After shock&#xD;
      wave therapy,the patients were followed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the American&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot scale(AOFAS-AHFS) , and followed finally by&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) of the ankle.&#xD;

    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale scores of the patients before and after the shock wave therapy are recorded. The scale ranges from 0-10 points, and decreases of the value represent a better outcome. The data analyses are performed with SPSS version 16.0 statistical software. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and 95% confidence intervals are determined. The data are compared by paired t test or rank-sum test. P value &lt; 0.05 is considered as statistically significant.</description>
