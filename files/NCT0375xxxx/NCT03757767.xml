      Rationale: Elevated levels of plasma triglycerides are increasingly recognized as an&#xD;
      important causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease and associated pathologies. Lowering&#xD;
      plasma triglycerides may therefore be a therapeutic target to lower cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      risk. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of plasma&#xD;
      triglycerides into fatty acids on the capillary endothelium, thereby lowering plasma&#xD;
      triglycerides and stimulating the uptake of these fatty acids into cells. Angiopoietin-like 4&#xD;
      (ANGPTL4) is produced by fat cells and promotes the unfolding and inactivation of LPL,&#xD;
      leading to decreased hydrolysis of plasma triglycerides. The role of ANGPTL4 in regulating&#xD;
      LPL is especially important during fasting. However, as most studies are performed in animal&#xD;
      models, little is known about the effects of fasting on adipose tissue metabolism in humans,&#xD;
      and specifically on ANGPTL4 and its relationship with LPL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The key objective of this study is to determine the effect of a prolonged fast on&#xD;
      ANGPTL4 gene and protein expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue, the key organ involved in&#xD;
      lipid metabolism. Additionally, the effect of a prolonged fast on LPL gene expression, LPL&#xD;
      protein expression, and on LPL activity in subcutaneous adipose tissue will be examined. To&#xD;
      explore the systemic effects of a prolonged fast, the investigators will also measure ANGPTL4&#xD;
      levels in plasma, and ANGPTL4 and LPL gene expression in circulating immune cells (PBMCs).&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to obtain a more holistic view on the changes&#xD;
      occurring upon a prolonged fast, by examining the effects of fasting on whole genome&#xD;
      expression, post-transcriptional changes, and on markers of metabolic status. The combined&#xD;
      results of all measurements will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the mechanistic&#xD;
      effects of a prolonged fast and the metabolic functioning in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The Fasting Study is a single arm intervention study in healthy men and women.&#xD;
      The investigators will examine the effects of a fed state, which is 2 hours after the last&#xD;
      food intake, versus a prolonged fasted state, which is 26 hours after the last food intake.&#xD;
      Adipose tissue biopsies and blood samples will be taken 2 hours after the last meal and 26&#xD;
      hours after the last meal. The 24 hours between sampling points are chosen to prevent effects&#xD;
      of the circadian rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population will consist of 24, 40-70 years old men and women with&#xD;
      a BMI of 22-30 kg/m2, selected from the surroundings of Wageningen through the mailing list&#xD;
      for potential study research subjects of the division of Human Nutrition and health of&#xD;
      Wageningen University. If needed, additional recruitment of research subjects will take place&#xD;
      by flyers and posters, or advertisements in local newspapers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All research subjects will start with the consumption of a standardized meal&#xD;
      (ad libitum). Directly thereafter the intervention begins, which is a fasting period of&#xD;
      twenty-six-hours, during which research subjects are not allowed to eat or drink anything&#xD;
      except for water, which the research subjects may consume ad libitum. The investigators will&#xD;
      take the first blood samples and adipose tissue biopsies two hours after the consumption of&#xD;
      the standardized meal. This is the fed state: the point in time where the body is&#xD;
      physiologically fed, based on the average time for plasma free fatty acids to drop.&#xD;
      Twenty-four hours after the &quot;fed state&quot;, research subjects are in the prolonged fasted state,&#xD;
      and the investigators will take the final blood samples and adipose tissue biopsies. The time&#xD;
      period of twenty-four-hours between sampling points is chosen to prevent the effects of&#xD;
      circadian related changes on our outcome measures.&#xD;
