  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia has long been considered the first choice technique in caesarean section,&#xD;
      but although it is a reliable and safe procedure, it is in some cases associated with&#xD;
      undesirable effects. Maternal hypotension after sub-arachnoid anesthesia is a reduction in&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg or a decrease of 20% compared to baseline values.&#xD;
      According to some authors, maternal hypotension occurs up to 80% in women undergoing&#xD;
      caesarean section after spinal anesthesia. In order to reduce the incidence of maternal&#xD;
      hypotension, some measures can be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a reduction of aorto-caval compression by manual displacement of the uterus on the left;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hemodynamic monitoring;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  administration of fluids;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  optimization of the dosage of the local anesthetic;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use of vasopressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to investigate, through the use of a continuous&#xD;
      non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring system (Clearsight® - Edwards Lifesciences), the&#xD;
      incidence of hypotension in pregnant women at risk undergoing spinal anesthesia due to&#xD;
      elective cesarean section.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective observational not-for profit study, 128 patients will be enrolled to&#xD;
      measure the incidence of hypotension during spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean section.&#xD;
      On the occasion of the preoperative visit, all patients to be subjected to elective cesarean&#xD;
      section will be subjected to the Postural Change Test (PCT), a predictive test for maternal&#xD;
      hypotension during spinal anesthesia that evaluate changes in heart rate of pregnant women&#xD;
      following postural changes. Specifically, after monitoring the heart rate in the supine&#xD;
      position, the patient is asked to change decubitus (from supine to left lateral and then back&#xD;
      to supine). The test is positive if the patient's heart rate changes more than 10% from&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once arrived in the obstetric emergency department, parturients with positive Postural Change&#xD;
      Test will be subjected to cannulation of a peripheral vein through a 18-20 Gauge needle&#xD;
      cannula and the Clearsight hemodynamic monitoring system will be placed on a finger. The&#xD;
      investigators will then proceed to the detection of the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean Blood Pressure (MAP);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart Rate (HR);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stroke volume (SV);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stroke volume Index (SVI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac Index (CI). These data will be collected and reported in the data sheet of the&#xD;
           study, at different time points (T0 - T9). Basal values will be collected at T0 and T1:&#xD;
           at T0 when the patient is in the supine position and at T1 when the patient is in a&#xD;
           lateral position. The investigators will then proceed to the administration of a&#xD;
           crystalloid bolus (10 ml/kg) and to the execution of spinal anesthesia (T2). The spinal&#xD;
           block needle will be inserted, compatibly to the patient's anatomical conditions, at the&#xD;
           L3-L4 / L4-L5 spaces. 0.5% hyperbaric Bupivacaine (5 mg/ml) will be administered at a&#xD;
           dose depending on the patient's weight and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the spinal block has been performed, the patient will be immediately placed in a supine&#xD;
      position. The investigators will then continue monitoring the parameters listed above using&#xD;
      Clearsight® (SV, SVI, MAP, CI) at 2-minute intervals in the phases following spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T3: 2 minutes after spinal anesthesia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T4: 4 minutes after spinal anesthesia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T5: 6 minutes after spinal anesthesia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T6: 8 minutes after spinal anesthesia. The other measurements will be made at skin&#xD;
           incision (T7), uterine incision (T8) and extraction (T9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any hemodynamic changes (MAP &lt;60 mmHg or CI &lt;2.5), under volemic optimization conditions,&#xD;
      will be treated by administration of vasoconstrictors (Etilefrine, intravenous bolus of 1-3&#xD;
      mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the afterbirth, the investigators will proceed to the infusion of liquids and uterotonic&#xD;
      according regimens in use at the unit of Anesthesia and Intensive Care of the Universitary&#xD;
      Hospital &quot;G. Rodolico&quot; of Catania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the descriptive nature of the study, a formal calculation of the sample size was not&#xD;
      made. As secondary end-points, the Stroke Volume variation following spinal anesthesia, the&#xD;
      amount of fluids administered, the vasoconstrictor doses used, diuresis, the Apgar index and&#xD;
      the fetal pH will be measured. The number of hypotension episodes not detected by the&#xD;
      traditional blood pressure monitoring system but detected by the Clearsight system will also&#xD;
      be recorded. For the qualitative variables, the absolute frequencies and the percentage&#xD;
      frequencies will be calculated. For the quantitative variables, if with normal distribution,&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation will be calculated; if with not normal distribution, median and&#xD;
      interquartile range will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normality of the distribution will be evaluated through the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test.&#xD;

    <description>The Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria (skin color, pulse rate, reflex irritability grimace, activity and respiratory effort) on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting Apgar score ranges from zero to 10. The test is done at 1 and 5 minutes after birth and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores 7 and above are generally normal; 4 to 6, fairly low; and 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low and cause for immediate resuscitative efforts.</description>
