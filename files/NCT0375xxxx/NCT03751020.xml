  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of writing interventions specifically&#xD;
      designed for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) emerging adults (ages 18-29) that are aimed at&#xD;
      improving the outcomes: depression, suicidality, substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is considered the third part (&quot;Phase 3&quot;) of a larger study where parts one and two&#xD;
      were designed to utilize elicitation focus groups to develop effective intervention materials&#xD;
      (Phase 1) and then refine the developed materials through structured interviews (Phase 2).&#xD;
      Phase 3 will test feasibility and assess early signs of efficacy of writing interventions. To&#xD;
      do this, participants will be randomized to one of three arms (one arm will serve as&#xD;
      control). Those that choose to participate will be asked to complete outcome measures&#xD;
      (depressive symptoms, suicidality, use of alcohol and illicit drugs, HIV risk behavior) and&#xD;
      measures of proposed mediators (self-reported and biological stress, behavioral and emotional&#xD;
      self-regulation) and moderators (e.g., social support, identity centrality) at baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention, and three-month follow-up. In addition, structured interviews with 15&#xD;
      intervention participants will be used to refine study procedures as the investigators scale&#xD;
      up this intervention for a future randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Intervention (day 5), and 3 Months.</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies -- Depression Scale (CESD). An overall depression score is computed as the sum of 20 items, with items 3, 11, 14, and 16 reversed. In cases with internally missing data (items not answered), the sums are computed after imputation of the missing values: # items on scale / # actually answered, multiplied by the sum obtained from the answered items. A range of 0-60, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptomatology during the past week.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Psychological Distress.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Intervention (day 5), and 3 Months.</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological Distress will be measured using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). The BSI consists of 18 items scored 0-4. Items are averaged to yield a final score of 0-4. The higher the score, the greater the psychological distress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Intervention (day 5), and 3 Months.</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rumination</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Intervention (day 5), and 3 Months.</time_frame>
    <description>Rumination will be assessed using the Ruminative Response Scale - Brooding Subscale (RRS). This scale is modified from the original measure where only items 5, 10, 13, 15 and 16 are used. Each item is scored by respondents on a scale of 1 to 4. To get the overall score, the 5 items are summed; total scores range from 5-20, with higher scores indicating greater brooding and rumination (related to depression) in an individual.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Support</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Intervention (day 5), and 3 Months.</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived social support is measured using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The MSPSS is a 12 item instrument that uses a scale 1-7 to rate each item. The scoring is done by taking the average of the items- therefore a score of 7 indicates the highest level of perceived social support.</description>

    <measure>Change in Risk Taking</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Intervention (day 5), and 3 Months.</time_frame>
    <description>Risk taking impulse will be assessed using the Columbia Card Task. Participants are presented with 32 face-down cards. Some of these cards are &quot;gain cards&quot; (which add either +10 or +30 points to the participant's total score) and some of these cards are &quot;loss cards&quot; (which subtract either -250 or -750 points from the participant's total score). On each trial, the participant may turn over as many cards as desired until a loss card is encountered or the participant chooses to not turn over any more cards. As a participant turns over more cards, the probability of encountering a loss card increases. Therefore, turning over more cards constitutes greater risk taking.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Minority Stress (Rejection)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Intervention (day 5), and 3 Months.</time_frame>
    <description>To assess rejection as a form of minority stress, the Gay-Related Rejection Sensitivity Scale (GRRS) will be used.The Gay-related rejection sensitivity scale was adapted for this study to be gender-inclusive and has 12 items. Scale range 1-36, where higher scores indicate greater rejection sensitivity based on one's sexual orientation (worse outcome).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Parental Attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Intervention (day 5), and 3 Months.</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's perception of their parent's attitudes towards their sexual orientation are assessed using the Parental Attitudes Toward Child's Sexual Orientation. This tool has 4 items- 2 that deal with mother/parent 1/closest female guardian, 2 that deal with father/parent 2/closest male guardian. The second item for each parent asks about their attitude towards the respondent's sexual orientation on a scale from 1 (completely tolerant and accepting) to 7 (completely hostile and rejecting). Scores for maternal and paternal attitude should be averaged for each participant. The score has a range from 1-7, where higher scores indicate greater rejection from parents (worse outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Outness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Intervention (day 5), and 3 Months.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants openness about one's sexual orientation will be assessed using the Outness Inventory (OI). A respondent is asked to rate how open they are with various people in society (from family to strangers) on an 11 item questionnaire. The scale for responding is 0-7- where 7 indicates that a person is completely open with their sexual orientation status. The scale score is obtained by averaging the 11 items for a score range of 0-7, where higher scores indicate more openness about respondents' sexual orientation in different domains of their lives/different people. 0 indicates that an item does not apply/ there is no such group of people/person in the respondents' life. A score of 7 would indicate that one is completely open or &quot;out&quot; with respect to sexual orientation.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were specifically recruited through tailored advertising on geo-targeted websites; bulletin boards and listservs of local colleges; in-person announcement and flyers at local businesses, community events, and the gay-straight alliances of area schools. Participants completed a brief online survey to confirm eligibility.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants completed a brief online survey to confirm eligibility, defined as:&#xD;
age 18 -29; identifying as sexual minority; currently living in one of the eligible counties; and having daily personal Internet access. Participants emailed a photo of an identification card(e.g. a driver's license), as proof of age. 108 people were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

Control: Participants randomly assigned to the control condition will be asked to write about what they have done since waking up that morning for 20 minutes across 3 consecutive days.

Expressive Writing (EW) Intervention: The EW intervention will utilize the procedures piloted earlier with gay and bisexual male college students in urban and rural regions of the US. In this condition, participants will be instructed to write for 20 minutes across three consecutive days in a free-form manner about the most stressful or traumatic LGB-related event that they have encountered.</description>

Self-Affirmation (SA) Intervention: The SA intervention will ask participants to read a brief description, over the course of 3 consecutive days, of a (hypothetical) LGB youth who is facing minority stress. Each day's description will contain a different LGB youth facing a different stigma-related stressor derived from Phase 1 and 2 interviews. Participants will then be asked to write a letter for 20 minutes to advise the LGB youth how best to cope with minority stress drawing on their personal experiences.</description>

        <title>Change in Depression.</title>
        <description>Depression will be measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies -- Depression Scale (CESD). An overall depression score is computed as the sum of 20 items, with items 3, 11, 14, and 16 reversed. In cases with internally missing data (items not answered), the sums are computed after imputation of the missing values: # items on scale / # actually answered, multiplied by the sum obtained from the answered items. A range of 0-60, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptomatology during the past week.</description>

        <title>Change in Alcohol Use.</title>
        <description>Alcohol use in participants will be assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification (AUDIT) instrument. The AUDIT consists of 10 items. Each of the questions has a set of responses to choose from, and each response has a score ranging from 0 to 4. All response scores should be added and recorded as &quot;Total&quot;. Total scores of 8 or more are recommended as indicators of hazardous and harmful alcohol use, as well as possible alcohol dependence. (A cut-off score of 10 will provide greater specificity but at the expense of sensitivity.) The score range is 0-40. Higher scores indicate greater hazardous drinking.</description>

        <description>Rumination will be assessed using the Ruminative Response Scale - Brooding Subscale (RRS). This scale is modified from the original measure where only items 5, 10, 13, 15 and 16 are used. Each item is scored by respondents on a scale of 1 to 4. To get the overall score, the 5 items are summed; total scores range from 5-20, with higher scores indicating greater brooding and rumination (related to depression) in an individual.</description>

        <description>Impulsiveness will be assessed using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). The BIS-11 is a 30 item questionnaire that uses a 1-4 rating scale per item. The 30-item self-report questionnaire, can yield a total score, as well as three factors: attentional (6, 5, 9, 11, 20, 24, 26, 28; motor (2, 3, 4, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 30); non-planning (1, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 27, 29). The motor scale has a range of 11-44, the greater the value, the greater the level of motor impulsiveness.</description>

        <title>Change in Risk Taking</title>
        <description>Risk taking impulse will be assessed using the Columbia Card Task. Participants are presented with 32 face-down cards. Some of these cards are &quot;gain cards&quot; (which add either +10 or +30 points to the participant's total score) and some of these cards are &quot;loss cards&quot; (which subtract either -250 or -750 points from the participant's total score). On each trial, the participant may turn over as many cards as desired until a loss card is encountered or the participant chooses to not turn over any more cards. As a participant turns over more cards, the probability of encountering a loss card increases. Therefore, turning over more cards constitutes greater risk taking.</description>

This tool has 4 items- 2 that deal with mother/parent 1/closest female guardian, 2 that deal with father/parent 2/closest male guardian. The second item for each parent asks about their attitude towards the respondent's sexual orientation on a scale from 1 (completely tolerant and accepting) to 7 (completely hostile and rejecting). Scores for maternal and paternal attitude should be averaged for each participant. The score has a range from 1-7, where higher scores indicate greater rejection from parents (worse outcome).</description>

        <title>Change in Outness</title>
        <description>Participants openness about one's sexual orientation will be assessed using the Outness Inventory (OI). A respondent is asked to rate how open they are with various people in society (from family to strangers) on an 11 item questionnaire. The scale for responding is 0-7- where 7 indicates that a person is completely open with their sexual orientation status. The scale score is obtained by averaging the 11 items for a score range of 0-7, where higher scores indicate more openness about respondents' sexual orientation in different domains of their lives/different people. 0 indicates that an item does not apply/ there is no such group of people/person in the respondents' life. A score of 7 would indicate that one is completely open or &quot;out&quot; with respect to sexual orientation.</description>

        <description>Everyday discrimination experienced by participants will be measured using the Everyday Discrimination - Sexual Orientation (EDSO) Part 2. Part 2 is a 2 item inventory where respondents rate statements on a scale of 0-3.

        <description>Feelings of victimization are captured using the LGBT Victimization Experiences measure. This questionnaire consists of 10 items. The LGBT victimization scale is rated on a 0 &quot;Never&quot; to 3 &quot;3+ times&quot; scale with a total score range 0-30. The total score reflects the amount of victimization one has experienced due to being known or thought to be LGBTQ. Higher scores indicate more negative experiences.</description>

Control: Participants randomly assigned to the control condition will be asked to write about what they have done since waking up that morning for 20 minutes across 3 consecutive days. This control matches the time and activity of the EW and SA arms and has been implemented across dozens of EW and SA studies.</description>

          <title>Expressive Writing (EW)</title>
          <description>Expressive Writing (EW) prompts individuals to write about personally stressful events, potentially enabling cognitive processing of unresolved, psychological and physiological stressors.&#xD;
Expressive Writing (EW) Intervention: The EW intervention will utilize the procedures piloted earlier with gay and bisexual male college students in urban and rural regions of the US. In this condition, participants will be instructed to write for 20 minutes across three consecutive days in a free-form manner about the most stressful or traumatic LGB-related event that they have encountered.</description>

        <group group_id="E3">
          <title>Self-Affirmation (SA)</title>
          <description>Self-Affirmation (SA) interventions prompt individuals to write advice to a (hypothetical) similarly stigmatized person regarding how best to cope with stigma-related stress. By affirming one's own stigmatized identity through the process of helping another similarly stigmatized person.&#xD;
Self-Affirmation (SA) Intervention: The SA intervention will ask participants to read a brief description, over the course of 3 consecutive days, of a (hypothetical) LGB youth who is facing minority stress. Each day's description will contain a different LGB youth facing a different stigma-related stressor derived from Phase 1 and 2 interviews. Participants will then be asked to write a letter for 20 minutes to advise the LGB youth how best to cope with minority stress drawing on their personal experiences.</description>
