  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy has been approved as the first line therapy in HER2+&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer. When patients experienced progression beyond trastuzumab containing&#xD;
      therapy, T-DM1 is considered as the second line therapy followed by trastuzumab plus any&#xD;
      other chemotherapeutic agents or lapatinib plus capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biosimilar drug is a biological product that is highly similar to a licensed biological&#xD;
      product, with no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity, or potency.&#xD;
      Several trastuzumab biosimilar products have been approved after efficacy and safety studies&#xD;
      which were usually as the first line setting with taxane combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though trastuzumab biosimilar drugs demonstrated similarity of equivalence with&#xD;
      trastuzumab in these studies, the efficacy of their second use beyond progression with other&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents has not been tested yet. In addition, the investigators don't have&#xD;
      any data regarding possible cross reactivity between trastuzumab and trastuzumab biosimilar&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators plan multicenter phase II clinical trial to test the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of trastuzumab biosimilar, Herzuma® in combination with&#xD;
      TPC in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer who progressed after 2 or more HER-2&#xD;
      directed chemotherapy.&#xD;

          3. Metastatic or unresectable disease documented on diagnostic imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior 2 or more HER-2 directed therapy for metastatic disease is mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must have at least one measurable or evaluable lesion according to Response&#xD;
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v 1.1)&#xD;
