    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of eculizumab in the treatment of pediatric refractory gMG based on change&#xD;
      from Baseline in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score for disease severity.&#xD;

      The study will consist of an up to 4-week Screening Period, 26-week Primary Evaluation&#xD;
      Treatment Period, an additional (up to) to 208-week Extension Period, and an 8-week Safety&#xD;
      Follow-up Period.&#xD;
