  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a constant effort to find ways to make a quicker recovery between demanding workouts and&#xD;
      football matches, this study is the first to investigate the benefits of protein&#xD;
      supplementation, and compares two types of proteins, an animal-derived (whey) and a&#xD;
      plant-derived (soy) protein, after an exercise-induced muscle injury caused by a speed&#xD;
      endurance training protocol. Soy protein could be a cheaper and more environment-friendly&#xD;
      alternative for athletes involved in high-velocity strength training.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, three-trial (placebo vs. whey protein isolate vs. soy protein isolate&#xD;
      consumption), cross-over, double-blind design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline performance testing: Initially, volunteers will participate in a performance&#xD;
           testing procedure at University facilities. These measurements include:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A) measurement of descriptor variables: a) body composition (DXA), b) VO2max, c) Yo-Yo&#xD;
           intermittent endurance level 2 (Yo-Yo IE2), d) Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 2&#xD;
           (Yo-Yo IR2), e) technical skill level, f) daily dietary intake profile (over a 7-day&#xD;
           period), g) gabitual physical activity level (over a 7-day period) and h) resting&#xD;
           mtabolic rate (RMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
           B) Measurement of dependent variables: a) isokinetic strength (concentric, eccentric)&#xD;
           and maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of knee extensors and flexors of both&#xD;
           lower limbs, b) counter movement jump height (CMJ), c) repeated sprint ability (RSA), d)&#xD;
           speed (10 and 30 m), e) delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS), f) blood sampling for&#xD;
           measurement of lactate concentration, creatine kinase activity (CK) and inflammatory&#xD;
           markers [i.e.Glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and protein carbonyls&#xD;
           (PC)].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 1-week adaptive period: based on a dietary analysis, participants will be given a&#xD;
           dietary plan [taking into account the resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total daily&#xD;
           physical activity related energy expenditure], providing a standard protein intake of&#xD;
           0.8-1 g protein/kg/day over the 1-week adaptive period. This protein intake is accepted&#xD;
           as the average and population-safe protein intake during periods of very low physical&#xD;
           activity and/or exercise levels. RMR, daily dietary intake and physical activity will be&#xD;
           measured before the adaptive period. Familiarization with the training protocol will&#xD;
           take place during this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants will randomly participate in three trials including: whey protein (WP), soy&#xD;
           protein (SP) and placebo (PL) supplementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A 7-day pre-loading phase: A 7-day pre-loading phase will be applied prior to each&#xD;
                trial, during which volunteers will receive the respective supplement (placebo,&#xD;
                whey protein or soy protein). In WP and SP trials, participants will consume daily&#xD;
                the appropriate amount of protein to reach a total protein intake of 1.5 g&#xD;
                protein/kg body weight (BW).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  On the 7th day (end of pre-loading phase), participants will repeat performance&#xD;
                testing (assessment of all dependent variables according to baseline testing) and&#xD;
                blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  On the 8th day, participants will perform the speed-endurance production training&#xD;
                (SEPT) session 1 (1st trial). During training, participants internal (heart rate)&#xD;
                and external load (total distance, speed zones, acceleration and decelerations,&#xD;
                impacts) will be continuously monitored using heart rate monitors and global&#xD;
                positioning system (GPS) instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Immediately after the training protocol: Determination of blood lactate&#xD;
                concentration (3-4 minutes post-training) and assessment of MVIC (1 hour, 2 hours&#xD;
                and 3 hours post-training).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1-Day post-training (9th day; 24 hours post-training): Blood sampling (for the&#xD;
                determination of CK, GSH, TAC and PC) and measurement of dependent variables (i.e.&#xD;
                isokinetic strength, MVIC, Speed, RSA, CMJ and DOMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2-Days post-training (10th day; 48 hours post-training): Blood sampling (for the&#xD;
                determination of CK, GSH, TAC and PC) and assessment of DOMS. Thereafter, the SEPT&#xD;
                session 2 will take place during which the particpants' internal and external load&#xD;
                will be continuously monitored (as described in SEPT session 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Wash-out period: 2-week without any activity or supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 2nd trial: repeat of stages 3 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 3rd trial: repeat of stage 3.&#xD;
