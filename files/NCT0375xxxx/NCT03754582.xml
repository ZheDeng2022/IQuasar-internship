      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of perampanel&#xD;
      administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion after switching from oral tablets (8 to 12&#xD;
      milligrams per day [mg/day]) as an adjunctive therapy in participants with epilepsy with&#xD;
      partial onset seizures (POS) (including secondarily generalized seizures) or primary&#xD;
      generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures.&#xD;

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product, any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease, any deterioration in nonprotocol-required measurements of a laboratory value or other clinical test that resulted in symptoms, a change in treatment, or discontinuation of study drug, recurrence of an intermittent medical condition not present pretreatment, an abnormal laboratory test result was considered an AE if the identified laboratory abnormality led to any type of intervention, withdrawal of study drug, or withholding of study drug, whether prescribed in the protocol or not.</description>

&#xD;
          2. Receiving a stable dose regimen of oral perampanel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Receiving a concomitant stable dose regimen of marketed AEDs. No change of dosing&#xD;
             regimen for concomitant AEDs is planned during the intravenous Treatment and Follow-up&#xD;
             Phases.&#xD;
