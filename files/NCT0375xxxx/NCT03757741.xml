  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FIBRO-RISK study aims to investigate the impact of inflammatory-mediated myocardial fibrosis&#xD;
      on the risk of recurrence after successful ablation of atrial fibrillation. The level of&#xD;
      systemic inflammation in the pre-ablation and immediate post-ablation period will be assessed&#xD;
      on the basis of serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers (hs-CRP, matrix metalloproteases,&#xD;
      interleukin-6), while the level of cardiac fibrosis will be determined based on MRI imaging&#xD;
      associated with complex post-processing techniques for mapping myocardial fibrosis at the&#xD;
      level of left atrium and left ventricle. At the same time, the amount of epicardial fat will&#xD;
      serve as an indirect marker of localized inflammation and will be determined at different&#xD;
      levels in the heart (surrounding left atrium, right atrium or the entire heart), while&#xD;
      ventricular function will be assessed on the basis of serum levels of NT pro-BNP prior to the&#xD;
      procedure. All these parameters will be investigated in patients with successful ablation of&#xD;
      AF, who will be divided into 2 groups: group 1 - patients who develop AF recurrence at&#xD;
      1-year, and group 2 - patients with no recurrence of AF at 1-year. In all patients, the&#xD;
      following biomarkers will be determined: serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers and&#xD;
      NT-proBNP at 24 hours and 1 year post-procedure, the amount of myocardial fibrosis at the&#xD;
      level of left atrium and left ventricle at baseline +/- 7 days and the amount of epicardial&#xD;
      fat surrounding left atrium, right atrium and the entire heart at baseline +/- 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study will be represented by the rate of AF recurrence at 1-year&#xD;
      post ablation, documented by either ECG or Holter monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints of the study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rate of re-hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rate of survival without relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE rate, including cardiovascular death&#xD;
           or stroke)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is on the rise, being the most frequent sustained&#xD;
      supraventricular arrhythmia and a health issue by its increased morbidity and mortality. In&#xD;
      most of the cases, myocardial tissue located at the level of the pulmonary veins represents&#xD;
      the trigger for atrial fibrillation. The pathophysiology of AF is still incompletely&#xD;
      understood, several studies suggesting that profibrotic and inflammatory processes have a&#xD;
      crucial role in the development of AF. So far the success rate of AF ablation is not very&#xD;
      high, reaching 70% in patients with paroxysmal AF and 50% in cases with persistent AF.&#xD;
      Several risk factors for the occurrence and recurrence of AF have been described in the&#xD;
      literature, including left atrial enlargement, left ventricular dysfunction, epicardial fat&#xD;
      volume, and myocardial fibrosis caused by local atrial inflammation. What remains to be&#xD;
      investigated is the relationship between these risk factors and the recurrence of AF after&#xD;
      radiofrequency catheter ablation using advanced 3D mapping system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical prospective, descriptive, single-center study which will be carried out in&#xD;
      the Center of Advanced Research in Multimodal Cardiac Imaging Cardiomed Tirgu Mures, Romania.&#xD;
      The duration of the study is 2 years which include the initial screening and the follow-up&#xD;
      period for the recurrence of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 100 subjects suitable for catheter ablation. Imaging biomarkers and&#xD;
      laboratory analyses such as high sensitive C Reactive Protein (hsCRP), matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteases (MMP), interleukin-6 (IL6) and N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (NT&#xD;
      pro-BNP) will be determined in the first 24 hours after the procedure. The anatomy of&#xD;
      pulmonary veins, atrial fibrosis, atrial volumes and the amount of epicardial fat will be&#xD;
      evaluated and quantified with late gadolinium-enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (LGE-CMR). All these parameters will be investigated in patients with successful ablation of&#xD;
      AF, who will be divided into 2 groups: group 1 - patients who develop AF recurrence at&#xD;
      1-year, and group 2 - patients with no recurrence of AF at 1-year. In all patients, the&#xD;
      following biomarkers will be determined: serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers and&#xD;
      NT-proBNP at 24 hours and 1 year post-procedure, the amount of myocardial fibrosis at the&#xD;
      level of left atrium and left ventricle at baseline +/- 7 days and the amount of epicardial&#xD;
      fat surrounding left atrium, right atrium and the entire heart at baseline +/- 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over a period of 2 years, in which patients will be examined at&#xD;
      baseline, and will be followed-up for recurrence of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will sign an informed written consent and will be checked for the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria prior to enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To investigate the correlation between imaging markers provided by cardiac magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (including the degree of left atrial and ventricular fibrosis, left and right&#xD;
      atrial volume, epicardial fat tissue volume), inflammatory biomarkers, and the risk of AF&#xD;
      recurrence post ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To investigate the correlation between structural remodeling of the left and right&#xD;
      atrium, epicardial fat tissue volume and serum inflammatory biomarkers in patients with AF.&#xD;
