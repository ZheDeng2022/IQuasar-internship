      Partially-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Single Ascending Dose (SAD) with a Food&#xD;
      Effect Cohort to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of TBI-223 in&#xD;
      Healthy Adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Part 1, up to 50 subjects in 6 dosing cohorts are planned to be enrolled; within each&#xD;
      cohort, 6 subjects will be assigned to active treatment and 2 to placebo. Each subject will&#xD;
      participate in one dose level. Based on interim pharmacokinetic data obtained during the dose&#xD;
      escalation, a dose cohort will be selected to return for additional dosing after a&#xD;
      high-calorie, high-fat meal (food-effect cohort). Each cohort will be dosed in two groups in&#xD;
      order to monitor subjects for adverse experiences, in particular, convulsions (in the dog&#xD;
      toxicity studies, tremors were observed at Cmax or plasma concentration of ≥82µg/mL, and&#xD;
      convulsions were observed at plasma concentration or Cmax of ≥ 158µg/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first cohort, a sentinel group of 3 subjects (2 active and 1 placebo) will be dosed at&#xD;
      least 24 hours before the remaining 5 subjects (4 active and 1 placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining cohorts will be dosed in 2 groups of 4 subjects each (3 active and 1 placebo),&#xD;
      at least 24 hours apart. One cohort (10 subjects) will be brought back to receive a dose (8&#xD;
      active and 2 placebo) under fed conditions (Food-effect Cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, it is planned to enroll a minimum of 24 subjects in a total of four arms with 6&#xD;
      subjects each. Each group of 6 subjects will receive a single dose of 1 of 3 sustained&#xD;
      release (SR) tablet formulations of TBI-223 under fed conditions, and one will receive an&#xD;
      immediate release (IR) formulation under fasted conditions.The group that received the IR&#xD;
      formulation will be brought back later to receive the same formulation under fed conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional cohorts may be enrolled if deemed appropriate (e.g., if bioavailability is lower&#xD;
      than expected) by the Sponsor to repeat a dose level, to study other dose levels, change&#xD;
      proposed cohorts, or to study a different dosage formulation. These decisions regarding&#xD;
      changed or additional cohorts will not take place until the Sponsor, in conjunction with the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator and dose escalating committee, has determined that adequate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics from the previous cohort have been demonstrated to permit&#xD;
      proceeding to the next cohort. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) should be immediately&#xD;
      notified of this revised approach for review and approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed throughout the study for all subjects. Safety assessments will&#xD;
      include physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs),&#xD;
      cardiac monitoring, adverse events (AEs), and clinical laboratory tests (including&#xD;
      hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine will be collected for clinical laboratory evaluations. Female subjects will&#xD;
      have blood collected for serum pregnancy testing. Postmenopausal females will have blood&#xD;
      collected to measure follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Dose escalation to the next cohort&#xD;
      (i.e., dose level) will not take place until the Sponsor, in conjunction with the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator, has determined that adequate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data from&#xD;
      the previous cohorts have been demonstrated to permit proceeding to the next cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator, in conjunction with the Sponsor may collect additional blood if&#xD;
      necessary, for repeat laboratory or safety evaluations including AE follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at one study center in the United States.This study will have up&#xD;
      to 6 planned dose levels. Based on interim pharmacokinetic data obtained during the dose&#xD;
      escalation, a dose cohort will be selected to return for additional dosing after a high&#xD;
      calorie, high-fat meal (Food-effect Cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Monitoring: Sponsor personnel (or designees) will be responsible for monitoring the&#xD;
      study to ensure compliance with the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCP). Compliance&#xD;
      may be verified by one or more of the following methods: on-site visits, frequent&#xD;
      communication with the Investigator, and/or review of case report forms (CRFs) and source&#xD;
      documents. The Investigator agrees to permit such monitoring as well as audits or reviews by&#xD;
      regulatory authorities and the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring and Procedures: Subjects will be instructed to inform the study physician&#xD;
      and/or research personnel of any AEs that occur at any time during the study. Subjects will&#xD;
      be monitored for AEs from the first dose through the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events: The Investigator or a suitably medically qualified designee are responsible&#xD;
      for eliciting adverse events by observing and questioning the subject and recording all&#xD;
      adverse events observed by him/her or reported by the subject during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting:The Investigator or designee will notify the&#xD;
      appropriate Sponsor contact immediately after the SAE detection, observation, or report of&#xD;
      occurrence (regardless of the relationship to test article).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical Methodology: Plasma samples will be analyzed for TBI-223 and M2 using validated&#xD;
      assays. Plasma samples from subjects who receive placebo for TBI-223 oral suspension will not&#xD;
      be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: : Final statistical analyses will be performed using appropriate&#xD;
      software, e.g. Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (Version 8.1 or higher, Certara, L.P. in conjunction with&#xD;
      the internet-accessible implementation of Pharsight® Knowledgebase Server™ [PKSO; Version&#xD;
      4.0.4 or higher, Certara, L.P.]) and/or SAS® (Version 9.4 or higher, SAS Institute Inc.).&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized by cohort using descriptive statistics. Summary&#xD;
      statistics will also be presented by gender within each cohort. Dose proportionality will be&#xD;
      assessed using a power model approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food-effect cohort: The effect of food will be assessed comparing pharmacokinetic parameters&#xD;
      (maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under plasma concentration versus time curves&#xD;
      (AUCs)) under fed versus fasting conditions using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) approach.&#xD;
