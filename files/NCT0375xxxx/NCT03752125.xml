  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of ingesting caffeine and mixed flavonoids&#xD;
      (4 capsules, split between breakfast and lunch) on energy expenditure and fat oxidation in a&#xD;
      metabolic chamber with 20 women (non-obese, healthy, ages 20-47 years, pre-menopausal). We&#xD;
      hypothesize that based on the existing literature, ingestion of a double dose of the&#xD;
      caffeine-mixed flavonoid supplement compared to placebo will increase fat oxidation and&#xD;
      increase 24 h energy expenditure by about 75 kilocalories.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will utilize a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, comparing acute&#xD;
      ingestion of the mixed flavonoid supplement (MF) compared to placebo control (PC) in healthy,&#xD;
      non-obese, pre-menopausal women. The study will consist of two 24-hour study periods spent in&#xD;
      the recently renovated indirect room calorimeter (i.e., metabolic chamber) at the University&#xD;
      of North Carolina Chapel Hill Nutrition Research Institute (UNC NRI). The 24-hour study&#xD;
      periods in the metabolic chamber will be 4 weeks apart. Primary outcome measures will be&#xD;
      24-hour energy expenditure (EE), resting metabolic rate (RMR), sleeping metabolic rate (SMR),&#xD;
      substrate utilization from the respiratory quotient (RQ), and physical activity energy&#xD;
      expenditure (AEE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following recruitment and eligibility assessment, study participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to complete either the mixed flavonoid (MF) or the placebo control (PC) study day.&#xD;
      After a 4-week washout, study participants will cross over and complete the alternative&#xD;
      treatment. A method of randomly permuted blocks will be generated using web-based&#xD;
      randomization software (www.randomization.com) resulting in 10 study participants receiving&#xD;
      MF during the first week, and 10 study participants receiving the PC during the first week.&#xD;
      Study participants will consume 2 MF or PC capsules 30 min before breakfast, and 2 MF or PC&#xD;
      capsules 30 min before lunch. During both study days, study participants will be fed in&#xD;
      energy balance (i.e., energy intake will be matched to energy expenditure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Experimental Study Participants: Using data generated previously in the UNC NRI metabolic&#xD;
      chamber, a sample size calculation with 80% power revealed that 15-20 study participants&#xD;
      would be needed to detect a 50 kcal difference in 24-h EE. To account for attrition, 25 study&#xD;
      participants will be recruited via mass advertisement throughout the local area.&#xD;
      Pre-menopausal women will be chosen because this is a target population of the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Pre-Study Baseline Testing Eligibility will be determined in the outpatient clinical suite&#xD;
      at the UNC NRI. Body composition (fat mass and fat free mass (FFM)) will be determined via&#xD;
      dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (GE Lunar iDXA; Milwaukee, WI). Body mass index (BMI,&#xD;
      kg/m2) will be calculated for measured height and weight. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) will&#xD;
      be estimated using a FFM-based equation [418 + (20.3 FFM)] (J Appl Physiol&#xD;
      1993;75:2514-2520). This estimated RMR will be used to calculate total dietary energy intake&#xD;
      while in the metabolic chamber: RMR x physical activity level (PAL) of 1.3, and then adjusted&#xD;
      using measured data (details provided below). A small blood sample will be obtained at this&#xD;
      time and T3, T4, and TSH levels assessed through the clinical lab at the Lab Corp&#xD;
      (Burlington, NC). A urine pregnancy test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Indirect calorimetry: The metabolic chamber at the Nutrition Research Institute in&#xD;
      Kannapolis, NC is an open-circuit, whole room indirect calorimeter. The CO2 and O2 analysers&#xD;
      are differential, with full scale readings set for 0%-1%. O2 consumption, CO2 production, EE&#xD;
      and RQ are recorded each minute. EE is calculated using an abbreviated Weir's formula (VO2 X&#xD;
      3.941) + (VCO2 X 1.106), where VO2 is the volume of oxygen consumed in L/minute and VCO2 is&#xD;
      the volume of carbon dioxide released in L/minute. RQ is calculated as VCO2/VO2. Area under&#xD;
      the curve (AUC) will be calculated using RQ data for the four hours following breakfast,&#xD;
      lunch and dinner as well as sleeping hours between midnight and 6:00 am. Spontaneous physical&#xD;
      activity will be measured each minute using a total room sensor. To calculate resting&#xD;
      metabolic rate (RMR), EE will be plotted against the activity motion sensor output (each&#xD;
      averaged over 30 minutes), and the y-intercept of the linear regression taken as EE in the&#xD;
      inactive state. RMR will be multiplied by 1440 minutes to extrapolate to 24 hours.&#xD;
      Twenty-four hour sleeping metabolic rate (SMR) will be determined as the lowest mean EE&#xD;
      (kJ/minute) measured over 3 consecutive hours between midnight and 6:30 am and multiplied by&#xD;
      1440 minutes. Diet induced thermogenesis (DIT) will be calculated by subtraction of SMR from&#xD;
      RMR. Activity induced EE (AEE) will be calculated as the difference between 24 hour EE and&#xD;
      RMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Metabolic chamber study day protocol. Subjects will arrive at the Nutrition Research&#xD;
      Institute Building (500 Laureate Way) at 7:00 am. A urine pregnancy test will be performed.&#xD;
      At 7:30 am, study participants will report to the metabolic chamber following an overnight&#xD;
      fast (no food or beverages containing calories, alcohol, or caffeine from 11 pm). Study&#xD;
      participants will be instructed on expectations of their stay and weighed in scrubs without&#xD;
      shoes. At 8:00 am study participants will be sealed in the chamber. Except for a 2-minute&#xD;
      interval each hour during which study participants will be requested to stand and stretch,&#xD;
      study participants will remain seated or reclined, but awake throughout the day. Study&#xD;
      participants will be asked to perform necessary daily activities during these 2-minute&#xD;
      intervals. Breakfast (9:00 am), lunch (1:30 pm), and dinner (7:00 pm), will be served through&#xD;
      an air-lock passage. Meals will be completed within 30 minutes of serving. Two MF capsules or&#xD;
      placebo will be consumed 30 min before breakfast, and then again 30 minutes before lunch. At&#xD;
      10:30 pm, study participants will be asked to lie down for sleep. Study participants will be&#xD;
      awakened at 6:30 am and allowed to move about the chamber to gather their belongings. At 7:15&#xD;
      am study participants will exit the chamber and be weighed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Design of Metabolic Diets: Eucaloric diets will be designed to provide approximately 35%&#xD;
      fat, 49% carbohydrates and 16% protein, reflecting current recommendations for this&#xD;
      population group. Menus will be designed using a nutrient calculation and food management&#xD;
      software, and consist of bagel, peanut butter, apple juice, whole-wheat bread, turkey,&#xD;
      cheese, mayonnaise, buttery spread (10% kcal as fat), potato chips, lasagna, carrots,&#xD;
      broccoli, rolls, and muffin. No beverages or foods containing caffeine will be served. The&#xD;
      same foods will be served at both chamber visits. A baseline menu for each subject will be&#xD;
      prepared based on calculated RMR X 1.3, reflecting the sedentary nature of the study day. To&#xD;
      ensure energy balance conditions, the baseline menu of the first visit will be modified&#xD;
      according to measured EE data at 3 hours (includes breakfast) and 7 hours (includes breakfast&#xD;
      and lunch). Subsequent meals will be adjusted accordingly with 100 kcal peach muffins&#xD;
      containing the same proportion of fat, carbohydrate and protein as the meals. Study&#xD;
      participants will be fed an identical amount of the same meal at their second visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Statistical Analysis: Data will be analyzed using SAS (Cary, NC). To guard against any&#xD;
      carryover effect from visit 1 to visit 2, a repeated measures regression with an unstructured&#xD;
      correlation matrix within subject will be run with treatment (MF and PC) and visit (1 and 2)&#xD;
      in the model along with an interaction term. If the interaction term is non-significant, then&#xD;
      it will be removed and the model re-run. Two energy expenditure curves, one for the MF day,&#xD;
      and one for the PC day, will be generated for each subject with the x axis representing time&#xD;
      (min), and the y axis representing energy expenditure (kcal). The area under the energy&#xD;
      expenditure curve for defined blocks of time will be calculated by using the trapezoid rule&#xD;
      in the EXPAND procedure in SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). A paired t-test on the&#xD;
      log-transformed area will be performed to compare the energy expenditure of each period in&#xD;
      the MF day with the corresponding period in the PC day. The Shapiro-Wilk test in the&#xD;
      UNIVARIATE procedure in SAS will be used for normality check. The Benjamini-Hochberg method&#xD;
      for false discovery rate correction in the MULTTEST procedure in SAS will be used for&#xD;
      multiple testing corrections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUPPLEMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mixed flavonoid supplement and placebo capsules will look identical and be supplied by&#xD;
      Reoxcyn Discoveries Group LLC (Salt Lake City, UT). Active ingredients in the flavonoid&#xD;
      capsules include vitamin C, wild bilberry fruit extract, green tea leaf extract, quercetin,&#xD;
      caffeine, and omega 3 fatty acids (see Appendix B). Capsule fill ingredients include Nu-Flow&#xD;
      70R (from powdered rice hulls), tapioca from cassava root, natural bamboo silica, and&#xD;
      marshmallow root. Placebo capsules will contain only the fill ingredients (without the active&#xD;
      ingredients). Two MF and PC capsules will be consumed 30 minutes before breakfast, and then&#xD;
      again before lunch. The MF capsules will provide 658 mg flavonoids and 214 mg caffeine.&#xD;
