    <textblock>
      In this work, we evaluated the biometry data of lens subluxation inducing acute angle closure&#xD;
      which were misdiagnosed as primary angle closure at the first visit, and compared with the&#xD;
      data of chronic angle closure glaucoma, cataract, primary acute angle closure.&#xD;

        This retrospective case study included 17 eyes of 17 patients with ASAC-LS, who were&#xD;
        misdiagnosed with APACG on their first visit. In addition, 56 eyes of 56 patients diagnosed&#xD;
        with APACG, 54 eyes of 54 patients diagnosed with CPACG, and 56 eyes of 56 patients&#xD;
        diagnosed with cataract were also included. All of the patients were admitted from Jan 10,&#xD;
        2016 to Dec 28, 2017 in Tianjin Medical University Hospital. This study was conducted in&#xD;
        accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Ethics Committee of&#xD;
        Tianjin Medical University Eye Hospital.&#xD;

        ASAC-LS was diagnosed according to the following criteria, including sudden pain in the&#xD;
        eye, decreased vision with or without nausea and vomiting. Slit lamp microscopy reveals&#xD;
        phacodonesis, lens inclination or vitreous herniation into the anterior chamber, central&#xD;
        and peripheral shallow anterior chamber, and asymmetric iris bulge. All patients were&#xD;
        confirmed during the surgery to have LS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        APACG was diagnosed with the following criteria6, 7 8, including substantially elevated IOP&#xD;
        and closed angle, acute eye pain, blurred vision, or nausea and vomiting. More importantly,&#xD;
        ischemic injury caused by acute ocular hypertension, ciliary or mixed congestion, corneal&#xD;
        edema, and glaucoma flecks should be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnostic criteria of CPACG included narrow angle with anterior synechiae of varying&#xD;
        widths, IOP &gt; 22 mmHg, and glaucomatous optic disc damage and visual field shrinkage9-11&#xD;
        The angle closure should be more than two quadrants, yet there was no ischemic injury in&#xD;
        the anterior segment caused by acute ocular hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria were history of laser peripheral iridotomy or peripheral iridectomy,&#xD;
        glaucoma filtration surgery, angle closure caused by ocular trauma, uveitis,&#xD;
        neovascularization or lens swelling or hyper mature lens. The patients with acute angle&#xD;
        closure in both eyes were excluded. The subjects in which Lenstar LS900 examination could&#xD;
        not be performed because of severe lens opacity or corneal edema were also not included in&#xD;
        the study.&#xD;
