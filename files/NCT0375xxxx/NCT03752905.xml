      Protocol PTR-01-001 is a Phase 1/2 study of PTR-01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into an up to 4-week Screening Period, a 10-week Treatment Period and an&#xD;
      8-week Follow-up Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4 will consist of 2, 4, 3 and 3 patients respectively. Each cohort will&#xD;
      consist of patients divided into two groups (Group 1 and Group 2) randomized in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
      Patients in Group 1 will receive three doses of active drug followed by 3 doses of saline&#xD;
      control. Patients in Group 2 will receive three doses of saline control followed by 3 doses&#xD;
      of active drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 patients randomized to Group 1 will receive 3 doses of active treatment (PTR-01) at&#xD;
      a dose of 0.1 mg/kg followed by 3 doses of saline control for a total of 6 doses. Cohort 1&#xD;
      patients randomized to Group 2 will receive 3 doses of saline control followed by 3 doses of&#xD;
      active treatment (PTR-01) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg for a total of 6 doses.&#xD;

      Protocol PTR-01-001 is a saline-controlled, single and repeat dose, dose-escalation,&#xD;
      crossover study designed to determine the safety, tolerability, tissue kinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of PTR 01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into three periods: an up to 4-week Screening Period, a 10-week&#xD;
      Treatment Period and an 8-week Follow-up Period. During the Screening Period and Follow-up&#xD;
      Period there will be no study drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Treatment Period a total of 3 doses of PTR-01 and 3 doses of saline control will&#xD;
      be administered to patients for a total of 6 doses over a 10-week period in three cohorts&#xD;
      dosed at 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg (active drug). Twelve patients with a diagnosis of RDEB&#xD;
      and a history of at least one chronic wound will be enrolled. Those patients who do not have&#xD;
      documentation of genetic analysis and IF staining will have blood for genetic analysis and a&#xD;
      biopsy for IF staining prior to enrollment (both required).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4 will consist of 2, 4, 3 and 3 patients respectively. Each cohort will&#xD;
      consist of patients divided into two groups (Group 1 and Group 2) randomized in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
      Patients will receive doses 2 weeks apart. Patients in Group 1 will receive three doses of&#xD;
      active drug followed by 3 doses of saline control. Patients in Group 2 will receive three&#xD;
      doses of saline control followed by 3 doses of active drug. This cross-over design will yield&#xD;
      a total of 14 patients all of whom will receive active drug and saline control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization, patients will complete a Screening Period to assess the extent and&#xD;
      impact of skin disease involvement and the chronicity of at least one wound. Only patients&#xD;
      who meet all of the eligibility criteria will be randomized for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 patients randomized to Group 1 will receive 3 doses of active treatment (PTR-01) at&#xD;
      a dose of 0.1 mg/kg followed by 3 doses of saline control for a total of 6 doses. Cohort 1&#xD;
      patients randomized to Group 2 will receive 3 doses of saline control followed by 3 doses of&#xD;
      active treatment (PTR-01) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg for a total of 6 doses. After the last&#xD;
      patient in Cohort 1 has received their third dose and safety labs for all patients have been&#xD;
      reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), the next cohort may be enrolled. This&#xD;
      same schedule and safety review process will be followed for all subsequent dosing cohorts,&#xD;
      with Cohort 2, Cohort 3 and Cohort 4 receiving 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy assessments will be performed prior to first dose of therapy (at the end of the&#xD;
      Screening Period), after the last dose of study drug in Period 1, after the last dose of&#xD;
      study drug in Period 2 of the Treatment Period and 2 weeks (Day 85) after the last dose of&#xD;
      study drug (at the end of the Follow-up Period).&#xD;

          3. Has a diagnosis of RDEB based on genetic analysis and consistent with a recessive&#xD;
             inheritance pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has deficient C7 staining at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) by IF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has at least 1 unhealed wound 10-200 cm2 for at least 6 weeks at the Screening Visit.&#xD;

               -  For women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) agrees to use highly effective&#xD;
                  contraceptive (including abstinence) methods from Screening, through the study,&#xD;
                  and for at least 10 weeks after the last dose of study drug. Non-childbearing&#xD;
                  potential is defined as a female who meets either of the following criteria: age&#xD;
                  ≥50 years and no menses for at least 1 year or documented hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
                  tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy (see Section 7.4.1.2 for details on the&#xD;
                  definition of non-childbearing potential).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For males, agrees to use a condom with any WOCBP sexual partner from Day 1 of&#xD;
                  study treatment, through the study, and at least 10 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
                  study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Be willing and able to comply with this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the inactive ingredients in PTR-01.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Is pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has received in the last six months any investigational gene therapy product or in the&#xD;
             last three months any non-gene therapy investigational products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Is anticipated to receive new regimens of antibiotics or other anti-infectives during&#xD;
             the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has any other medical or personal condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             may potentially compromise the safety or compliance of the patient, or may preclude&#xD;
             the patient's successful completion of the clinical study.&#xD;
