  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single center study to evaluate the efficacy, safety of nivolumab in&#xD;
      combination with radiation therapy in patients with mucosal melanoma of the head and neck&#xD;
      (MMHN). Target Accrual and Study duration We will accrue up to 26 patients. It is estimated&#xD;
      to take up to 2 years. The sample size is calculated by use of SWOG CRAB (Cancer Research And&#xD;
      Biostatistics) to control the type I error at 5 % for null hypothesis that the true response&#xD;
      rate was 25 % or below and to have 80 % of power if the true response rate was 50 % or&#xD;
      higher. Although the target number of evaluable patients is 23, we planned to recruit 10%&#xD;
      more than the target number of patients considering dropout, total 26.&#xD;

      This is a phase II, single-arm, single-center study to evaluate the response rate, efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of nivolumab in combination with radiation therapy in subjects with of locally&#xD;
      advanced, unresectable head and neck mucosal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cycle is defined as 14 days. The nivolumab dose will be fixed at the recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose of 3mg/kg as a 60-minute IV infusion every two weeks. Patients will continue on&#xD;
      nivolumab up to 8 weeks, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator's&#xD;
      decision to remove patient from the study, patient refusal to continue, or alternative&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent radiotherapy of 70Gy for 6-7 weeks will be initiated on the same day of first&#xD;
      nivolumab dose of cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of 70 Gy radiotherapy for 6-7 weeks begins on the day of initial&#xD;
      administration of nivolumab, radiation therapy dose and treatment schedule 2.0, based on NCFC&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is administered every two weeks in in combination with radiation therapy and has&#xD;
      elapsed since 8 weeks (after 4 cycles) The administration of clinical trials in is terminated&#xD;
      but nivolumabs is sustainable at the discretion of investigator. (This is carried out&#xD;
      independently of the clinical trial) The response rate of radiation therapy is assessed by&#xD;
      performing a tumor assessment every two months up to the end of radiation therapy.&#xD;

    <description>RR, as determied by irRECIST criteria, is defined as the proportion of all subjects whose best overall response (BOR) is either a CR or PR. BOR is determined by the best response designation recorded between the date of treatment initiation and the date of first objectively documented progression or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever is the first. For subjects without documented progression or subsequent anti-cancer therapy, all available repsonse designations will contribute to the BOR determination.</description>
