    <description>Chlorogenic acid for injection is polyphenols, micromolecular and un-endogenous substance. It might play the role of cancer treatment via balancing tumor micro-environmental immune status according to the stability and rationality of immunodeficiency and endogenous immune material expression around the tumor. Chlorogenic acid for injection is made from chlorogenic acid (purity≥98%) which is extracted from folium cortex eucommiae.Chlorogenic acid and its preparations have not been reported as chemical drug and marketed around the world.</description>
