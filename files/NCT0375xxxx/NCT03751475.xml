  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute malnutrition affects 51 million children under the age of 5 worldwide. Malnutrition&#xD;
      contributes to nearly half of all child deaths each year, with the forms characterized by&#xD;
      wasting or oedema (acute malnutrition) associated with the highest risk of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although acute malnutrition is a continuum condition, it is arbitrarily divided into severe&#xD;
      and moderate acute malnutrition (SAM, MAM) which are managed separately, with programs&#xD;
      overseen by different UN agencies, and using different protocols and products. Such&#xD;
      separation complicates delivery of care, contributes to high default and low coverage, and&#xD;
      creates confusion among caregivers. Often treatment is only available for SAM children&#xD;
      resulting in lives lost and costly hospitalisation that could be averted if nutritional&#xD;
      support were available earlier in the wasting process. If we are to reduce the health and&#xD;
      mortality burden from malnutrition, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of current&#xD;
      protocols need dramatic improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) for SAM (130-200 kcal/kg/d) has not&#xD;
      changed since introduction of out-patient protocols in the mid-2000s. Children classified as&#xD;
      SAM in these protocols are determined by three independent criteria: the presence of&#xD;
      nutritional oedema or MUAC &lt; 115 mm or weight-height Z score &lt;-3. The RUTF dosage in these&#xD;
      protocols is paradoxical in that the absolute amount of RUTF prescribed in the initial phases&#xD;
      of treatment is often less than that given as the child nears recovery, because the number of&#xD;
      packets in the weekly ration is determined by weight. However, rate of weight gain (g/kg/day)&#xD;
      is highest in the first two weeks of treatment, and then plateaus - suggesting no benefit of&#xD;
      increased RUTF amounts in the later phases of treatment. Progressive reduction seems to be a&#xD;
      more rational use of RUTF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Optimizing treatment for acute MAlnutrition (OptiMA) strategy consists in simplifying&#xD;
      management of acute malnutrition through the use of a single anthropometric admission&#xD;
      criterion (mid upper arm circumference [MUAC] &lt; 125 mm or nutritional oedema) - one that best&#xD;
      captures children's anthropometry related mortality risk- and by optimizing the use of RUTF&#xD;
      by adapting doses to the nutritional recovery of the child. RUTF doses begin at 170 kcal/kg/d&#xD;
      for the most severely wasted (MUAC &lt; 115 mm or oedema) and reduce to 75 kcal/kg/d as oedema&#xD;
      resolves and MUAC increases &gt; 120 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that this strategy could double the number of children in care&#xD;
      compared to current SAM programs without substantially increasing the amount of RUTF or&#xD;
      staffing required while maintaining a recovery rate in line with current programs. OptiMA may&#xD;
      also improve coverage and reduce the need for hospitalization through early identification of&#xD;
      malnourished children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a community-based non-inferiority clinical trial with&#xD;
      individual randomization comparing the OptiMA strategy to the Democratic Republic of Congo&#xD;
      standard nutritional protocol for SAM. Study children will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention arm or control arm - with children at MUAC &lt; 125 mm or oedema eligible for RUTF&#xD;
      in the intervention arm and those meeting current WHO SAM definition eligible in the control&#xD;
      group. All participants will be followed for 9 months post-randomization to assess&#xD;
      non-inferiority as defined by a composite of three endpoints : alive, acceptable nutritional&#xD;
      status (MUAC ≥ 125 mm and WHZ &gt;-3, no oedema) and no relapse to acute malnutrition for those&#xD;
      who were treated with RUTF. The main secondary outcome will assess the non-inferiority of&#xD;
      OptiMA RUTF dosing (170 kcal/kg/d) in children meeting current WHO SAM criteria compared to&#xD;
      children with the same criteria in the control arm who will receive 130-200 kcal/kg/d.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OptiMA strategy proposes a new malnutrition management approach, grounded in 3 main&#xD;
      principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, the diagnosis of acute malnutrition is refined to target those at highest mortality&#xD;
      risk within the CMAM definition of acute malnutrition (WHZ &lt; -2 or MUAC &lt; 125 mm or oedema),&#xD;
      by targeting treatment to children with a MUAC &lt; 125 mm or oedema. The simplicity of MUAC&#xD;
      measure allows families to screen children and check for oedema at home and identify&#xD;
      malnourished children at an earlier stage. The diagnosis is quickly confirmed by clinicians&#xD;
      at the health center. MUAC progression is also used to monitor recovery and determine&#xD;
      discharge thus eliminating the discrepancies that occur when both MUAC and WHZ are used to&#xD;
      diagnose acute malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, RUTF dosage is rationalized, and calibrated to the child's degree of wasting. The&#xD;
      WHZ tables and dosing tables are replaced by a single table that determines the child's RUTF&#xD;
      ration based on MUAC category and weight. Larger rations, on a per kilo basis, are given to&#xD;
      the most severely malnourished and the ration is reduced as the child progresses to recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, supply chain is simplified to a single RUTF and data management from 2 programs are&#xD;
      merged into one. This streamlined programme should result in better coverage, a high&#xD;
      proportion of children detected before MUAC&lt;115 mm, lower RUTF consumption per child and&#xD;
      fewer acute malnutrition related hospitalisations.&#xD;
