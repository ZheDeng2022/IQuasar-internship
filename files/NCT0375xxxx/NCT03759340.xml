    <textblock>
      This is an open label study of ATI-502 Topical Solution for the treatment of AA, AU, and AT&#xD;
      with the following goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ATI-502 Topical Solution in subjects&#xD;
           with AA, AU or AT following 24 weeks of treatment with ATI-501 Oral Suspension or&#xD;
           Placebo Suspension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the ability of ATI-502 Topical Solution to maintain or improve hair regrowth&#xD;
           in subjects previously treated with ATI-501 Oral Suspension or Placebo Suspension.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      This Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy,&#xD;
      and durability of efficacy of ATI-502 Topical Solution, 0.46% for the treatment of alopecia&#xD;
      areata (AA), alopecia universalis (AU) and alopecia totalis (AT) in adult subjects who&#xD;
      completed 24 weeks of treatment with ATI-501 Oral Suspension or Placebo Suspension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who complete 24 weeks of active treatment with ATI-501 Oral Suspension or Placebo&#xD;
      Suspension in study ATI-501-AUAT-201 will be assessed for eligibility to enter the study. At&#xD;
      Visit 9 in study ATI-501-AUAT-201, subjects who did not experience any adverse events (AEs),&#xD;
      serious adverse events (SAEs), or tolerability issues that met study discontinuation criteria&#xD;
      in study ATI-501-AUAT-201 and who in the opinion of the investigator are capable of&#xD;
      re-growing or maintaining scalp hair and meet the entry criteria are eligible to enroll in&#xD;
      this open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will apply ATI-502 Topical Solution, 0.46% BID to the entire scalp and if&#xD;
      applicable, the eyebrow(s) and return for safety and efficacy assessments as detailed in the&#xD;
      Schedule of Assessments (Table 3). Assessment of response to treatment will be performed at&#xD;
      Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, Week 24, and post-treatment Week 28. Safety and tolerability will be&#xD;
      evaluated at each study visit by assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, and&#xD;
      vital signs, and at Week 24, and physical examination findings&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score is a physician administered scale measuring the amount of scalp without any terminal hair assessed by the investigator. Possible scores range from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete scalp hair loss). A negative change in the SALT score over time represents hair regrowth by adding the percentage hair loss in the various areas (i.e. top, back, each side) of the scalp. For the primary endpoint, the primary efficacy variable was the mean relative percent change from the original baseline visit in study ATI-501-AUAT-201 and the SALT score at Week 24 on study ATI-502-AA-203. This represents the percentage of hair regrowth. It was calculated as the mean of the changes from baseline SALT score to the SALT score at Week 24, divided by baseline SALT score and expressed as a percentage.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Mean Relative Percent Change from Baseline (from the current study ATI-502-AA-203) in Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT). SALT score is on a percent scale where 0% is no hair loss and 100 % is total hair loss. A lower SALT score is a better outcome. A higher relative percent change is better.</description>

    <description>Proportion of subjects achieving SALT 75 (defined as a ≥ 75% improvement from baseline in SALT) by visit 6 SALT score is on a percent scale where 0% is no hair loss and 100 % is total hair loss. A bigger percent change is a more positive score.</description>

        <title>Change in the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Score</title>
        <description>The Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score is a physician administered scale measuring the amount of scalp without any terminal hair assessed by the investigator. Possible scores range from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete scalp hair loss). A negative change in the SALT score over time represents hair regrowth by adding the percentage hair loss in the various areas (i.e. top, back, each side) of the scalp. For the primary endpoint, the primary efficacy variable was the mean relative percent change from the original baseline visit in study ATI-501-AUAT-201 and the SALT score at Week 24 on study ATI-502-AA-203. This represents the percentage of hair regrowth. It was calculated as the mean of the changes from baseline SALT score to the SALT score at Week 24, divided by baseline SALT score and expressed as a percentage.</description>
