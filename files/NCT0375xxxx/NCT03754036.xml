      BACKGROUND: The influence of sleep extension on glucose homeostasis in adolescents at risk&#xD;
      for type 2 diabetes is unknown. This issue is of high clinical relevance given the high&#xD;
      prevalence of sleep deprivation in this population and the accumulating body of evidence&#xD;
      indicating that having a good night's sleep is important for the prevention of chronic&#xD;
      diseases including type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To determine if extending sleep duration improves insulin sensitivity in&#xD;
      adolescents presenting with risk factors for type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: It was hypothesized that compared with decreasing sleep duration, increasing&#xD;
      sleep duration by 1.5 hours over 1 week will improve insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Using a randomized, counterbalanced, 2-condition crossover design, 30 obese&#xD;
      adolescents between 13 and 18 years of age who have insulin resistance will complete the&#xD;
      study. Participants will sleep their typical amount at home for 1 week and will then be&#xD;
      randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by 1.5 hours per night for 1&#xD;
      week, completing the alternate schedule on the fourth week (washout period of at least 1 week&#xD;
      between sleep conditions). This procedure will result in a targeted 3-hour time in bed&#xD;
      difference between conditions. Sleep will be objectively measured using actigraphy&#xD;
      (Actiwatch) and sleep schedule adherence will be promoted by providing fixed bedtimes and&#xD;
      wake times during the experimental weeks, and will be monitored through phone calls to the&#xD;
      research center. Participants will also be compensated for keeping the sleep schedule and&#xD;
      daily calls to enhance adherence. The outcome measures will then be compared between both&#xD;
      sleep conditions at the end (on day 8 of each study week). The primary outcome measure will&#xD;
      be insulin sensitivity as measured by the Matsuda index (total body insulin sensitivity).&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance&#xD;
      (HOMA-IR), blood lipids, food intake and physical activity. Repeated measures analysis using&#xD;
      the mixed model will be used to assess the effect of the two sleep interventions on insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RELEVANCE: The study will provide the first robust clinical evidence to determine if&#xD;
      increasing sleep duration in youth at risk for type 2 diabetes improves insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
      This information will be essential for clinical and public health guidelines for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes prevention among adolescents.&#xD;
