      The PAN-cancer Early Detection study or PAN-study is a prospective cross-sectional&#xD;
      observational case-control study evaluating whether Breath Biopsy can differentiate between&#xD;
      patients with and without different cancer types by comparing breath biomarkers for a range&#xD;
      of cancer types including patients with gastric, oesophageal, and liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research may be extended to include also pancreatic, renal, prostate and bladder cancer&#xD;
      patients, however in agreement between Cambridge University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust,&#xD;
      University of Cambridge, CRUK and Owlstone Medical recruitment in these arms will not start&#xD;
      until further notice. When recruitment is planned to start in these arms, Owlstone Medical&#xD;
      will ensure to notify the REC. Subjects with a histologically confirmed cancer will be&#xD;
      recruited from CUH by local research staff. Breath samples will be collected by means of the&#xD;
      ReCIVA breath sampler which requires tidal breathing into a face mask for around 10 minutes.&#xD;
      A cancer free control subject matched for age, sex and tumour specific risk factors will be&#xD;
      recruited and sampled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a pressing need for techniques that allow detection of cancer at an earlier stage&#xD;
      when curative treatment is more likely. Exhaled biomarkers are known to reflect a wide range&#xD;
      of metabolic processes, including those related to cancer such as the Warburg effect.&#xD;
      Owlstone Medical Ltd (hereafter referred to as Owlstone Medical) has developed Breath Biopsy;&#xD;
      a workflow to collect and analyse breath Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in a highly&#xD;
      standardised way. The PAN-study is a collaborative effort between Cambridge University&#xD;
      Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH), University of Cambridge (UoC), Cancer Research United&#xD;
      Kingdom (CRUK) and Owlstone Medical to evaluate the potential of Breath Biopsy to detect&#xD;
      various types of cancer by profiling breath metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PAN-cancer Early Detection study or PAN-study is a prospective cross-sectional&#xD;
      observational case-control study evaluating whether Breath Biopsy can differentiate between&#xD;
      patients with and without different cancer types by comparing breath biomarkers for a range&#xD;
      of cancer types including patients with gastric, oesophageal, and liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research may be extended to include also pancreatic, renal, prostate and bladder cancer&#xD;
      patients, however in agreement between Cambridge University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust,&#xD;
      University of Cambridge, CRUK and Owlstone Medical recruitment in these arms will not start&#xD;
      until further notice. When recruitment is planned to start in these arms, Owlstone Medical&#xD;
      will ensure to notify the REC. Subjects with a histologically confirmed cancer will be&#xD;
      recruited from CUH by local research staff. Breath samples will be collected by means of the&#xD;
      ReCIVA breath sampler which requires tidal breathing into a face mask for around 10 minutes.&#xD;
      A cancer free control subject matched for age, sex and tumour specific risk factors will be&#xD;
      recruited and sampled. Breath samples will be shipped to Owlstone Medical for analysis of&#xD;
      breath biomarkers by Gas Chromatography-Time Of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) and Gas&#xD;
      Chromatography-Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry (GC-FAIMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first step towards evaluating VOCs analysis as a test to improve early&#xD;
      detection rates for cancer with future applicability to primary care. Ultimately, such a&#xD;
      research program could enable low cost and widespread targeted screening programs for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subset of up to 12 patients with cirrhosis and 12 healthy volunteers, a sub study will&#xD;
      be conducted to measure the washout of limonene after ingestion of a standardised quantity of&#xD;
      limonene under controlled circumstance for food and drink intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this limonene sub-study is to demonstrate that limonene is a biomarker that&#xD;
      differentiates between healthy individuals and cirrhotic patients with Child-Pugh grade A and&#xD;
      B with or without HCC as a comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to visit the clinical site to provide 4 breath samples at&#xD;
      different timepoints before and after ingestion of limonene. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      fast overnight for 10 hours, not to have brushed their teeth for 2 hours prior to first&#xD;
      breath sample and not be a current smoker or should not have smoked in the past 6 months.&#xD;
      Non-abstinent patients with alcohol related liver disease or participants who drink to excess&#xD;
      daily will be excluded from this sub-study.&#xD;

    <description>The ReCIVA breath sampler contains a CO2 and pressure sensor, which allows the operator to monitor the breath sampling procedure and patient comfort. Both the operator and the patient can pause or abort the breath sampling procedure within seconds by removing the mask. The time investment required from patients is approximately 15 minutes for consenting and medical history and 10 minutes per breath collection.</description>

      Patients will inhale room air from which environmental VOCs have been removed to prevent&#xD;
      contamination of the sample. The mask contains a CO2 sensor that drives two micro-pumps in&#xD;
      the mask that sample alveolar and bronchial breath separately. This is relevant because&#xD;
      different cancer biomarkers can be found in different portions of breath. During the&#xD;
      procedure the breath will automatically be sampled onto four sorbent tubes to collect a total&#xD;
      of 1.5L of breath. The procedure will normally take around 10 minutes, very rarely exceeding&#xD;
      15 minutes if exhaled volumes are small. After collection, the sorbent tubes are stored in&#xD;
      the refrigerator at 4-8°C until shipment to Owlstone Medical. For those participating in the&#xD;
      washout sub study, up to 6 samples will be obtained at various timepoints in one day.&#xD;
