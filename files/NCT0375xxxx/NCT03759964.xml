  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies using new forms of intravenous iron showed that it is effective in treating&#xD;
      perioperative anemia in orthopedic and digestive surgery. Effects of ferric carboxymaltose&#xD;
      have not been assessed in the settings of cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare ferric carboxymaltose to placebo in a randomized trial design where&#xD;
      ferric carboxymaltose / placebo will be administered in the postoperative period (Day 1)&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery. A total sample size of 200 patients (100 per group) will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FCAACS trial will assess the impact of administering intravenous iron (Ferric&#xD;
      carboxymaltose) after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of postoperative anemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of postoperative transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of complications related to intravenous iron&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the surgeries will be performed by the same surgical team and follow-up will be ensured&#xD;
      by the same Cardiac Surgery Unit (CSU) team according to department's standard protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the Ferric carboxymaltose group will receive 1g of Ferric carboxymaltose&#xD;
      diluted in 100 mL of IV isotonic serum saline, whereas participants in the Placebo group will&#xD;
      receive 100 mL of IV Placebo&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is very common in the perioperative of major surgery affecting about 30% of patients&#xD;
      preoperatively and more than 80% postoperatively. Anemia is an independent risk factor of&#xD;
      morbi-mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency is the first cause of anemia. Physiological reserves of iron are not&#xD;
      important, and the correction of anemia after hemorrhage is very slow. Hence, it takes 90&#xD;
      days to return to 80% of the basic Hb level after a blood donation of 500ml, and more than&#xD;
      150 days (almost 6 months), if one is deficient in iron. This is why iron is used to correct&#xD;
      anemia that occurs after bleeding. There are two routes for iron administration: oral and&#xD;
      intravenous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal absorption of iron is limited to 10-15 mg/d even when ingested doses are&#xD;
      increased. This absorption is decreased in the presence of an inflammatory state, which is&#xD;
      very common in the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intravenous route allows the delivery of significantly higher doses of iron (up to 1000&#xD;
      mg in 1 infusion), without any limitation related to absorption. This is why it is&#xD;
      interesting to administer it perioperatively where the expected delays are short.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently new intravenous iron formulations that have two advantages: a shorter&#xD;
      intravenous injection time and a higher maximum injectable dose per infusion. These new forms&#xD;
      are risk-free, with no serious allergy described so far in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies using new forms of intravenous iron showed that it is effective in treating&#xD;
      perioperative anemia in orthopedic and digestive surgery. Effects of ferric carboxymaltose&#xD;
      have not been assessed in the settings of cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the impact of ferric carboxymaltose in cardiac surgery, it will be compared to&#xD;
      placebo in a randomized trial design, where ferric carboxymaltose / placebo will be&#xD;
      administered in the postoperative period. Ferric carboxymaltose / placebo will be an add-on&#xD;
      to the current treatment of patients in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery, the&#xD;
      group that will be receiving placebo reflects the current management of the patients in these&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FCAACS trial will assess the impact of administering intravenous iron (Ferric&#xD;
      carboxymaltose) after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of postoperative anemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of postoperative transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of complications related to intravenous iron&#xD;
&#xD;
      FCAACS will be a parallel group randomized trial, with a 2-group design and no crossover.&#xD;
      Allocation ratio will be 1/1, in an equivalence framework. A total sample size of 200&#xD;
      patients (100 per group) will be needed.&#xD;
