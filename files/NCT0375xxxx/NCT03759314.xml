      Background: Inadequate nutrition has been associated with growing risk of falling and&#xD;
      impaired ability in elderly patients. Falling is a significant threat to the health of the&#xD;
      elderly. It is estimated that one third of people over the age of 65 experience at least one&#xD;
      falling each year. Over 60% of the falls cause serious injury or disability. Adequate&#xD;
      nutrition increases the muscle strength of the elderly. Therefore, determining and managing&#xD;
      the nutrition level is important for preventing falling. As far as we know emergency medical&#xD;
      services has never before reported being a part of prevention by performing risk&#xD;
      identification.&#xD;

      Aim: The purpose of the study is to assess whether it is possible to use a simple screening&#xD;
      tool to find out the risk of falling, the nutritional status and the level of cognitive&#xD;
      functioning activity when the EMS faces the elderly over the age of 70 years. In addition,&#xD;
      the flow of information between primary care and emergency services and nutritionists is&#xD;
      examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and method: Identification of poor nutrition is carried out in the Helsinki&#xD;
      University hospital area. All people over the age of 70 requiring ambulance transport will be&#xD;
      included in the study for 4 months during 2018. A structured electronic form is used to&#xD;
      identify the malnutrition, the level of cognitive functioning activity and the risk of&#xD;
      falling. The assessment is performed during the transport. The data is analyzed by the SPSS&#xD;
      statistical program both by descriptive and statistical significance by looking at the&#xD;
      methods suitable for the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The information produced by the research aims to develop (a) Identifying in the&#xD;
      ambulance those patients who are at risk; and (b) activating nursing staff and nutritionists&#xD;
      and, by means of these measures, increase the number of patients receiving effective&#xD;
      nutrition therapy.&#xD;

    <description>to use a simple screening tool to find out the risk of falling, the nutritional status and the level of cognitive functioning activity when the EMS faces the elderly over the age of 70 The risk-screening tool is based on valid scales. RISK SCREENING TOOL;&#xD;
Risk of falling:&#xD;
Prediction of falls (4 items, 0-3 points) Self-reporting of falls over a 12-month period (3 items, 0-3 points)&#xD;
Malnutrition Risk:&#xD;
Home care and meal services (Yes, No) Nutritional status (4 items, 0-3 points) Effect of the diseases on nutrition (4 items, 0-3 points) Age (1 item, 1 point)&#xD;
Delirium and cognitive functioning:&#xD;
Alertness / memory / attention deficit / symptoms (4 items, 0-3 points)&#xD;
Complete when:&#xD;
&gt; 70 years patient The patient's physical state allows. Mostly completed during transport (no need to add actual time on scene). Possible risk points are reported at donation to the emergency department.</description>
