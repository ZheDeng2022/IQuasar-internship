  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aversive childhood experiences (ACE) and their relation to the development of an alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder will be measured with fMRI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the impact of ACE on stress sensitivity, cue-reactivity&#xD;
      and emotion processing in individuals with AUD. (Neuro-) biological and physiological&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying AUD after ACE will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neural correlates of stress-sensitivity, emotion processing and alcohol cue-reactivity will&#xD;
      be assessed using fMRI. Furthermore, blood and saliva samples will be used to assess&#xD;
      biological and physiological mechanisms (e.g. salivary cortisol level or genetic markers of&#xD;
      AUD and possible gene-environment-interactions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question whether individuals with AUD and ACE might tend to use alcohol to cope with&#xD;
      stress, negative affect or intrusions (according to the self-medication model) will be&#xD;
      explored. On the other hand, individuals with AUD and low levels of ACE might use alcohol for&#xD;
      its positive effects (according to a positive reinforcement model).&#xD;
&#xD;
      90 individuals (30 HC and 60 individuals with AUD and varying levels of ACE) will be examined&#xD;
      using interviews, questionnaires and fMRI tasks as well as saliva and blood samples. All&#xD;
      ethical votes and informed consents of participants are and will be obtained according to the&#xD;
      declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
