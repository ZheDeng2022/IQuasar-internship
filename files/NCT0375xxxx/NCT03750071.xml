  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is conducted as a multicenter, open-label, Phase I/II trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of VXM01 in combination with avelumab in subjects with resectable and&#xD;
      non-resectable progressive glioblastoma following tumor resection and radiochemotherapy&#xD;
      containing temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be performed in 30 subjects with progressive glioblastoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 subjects who will not be candidates for a tumor re-operation (non-resectable&#xD;
           subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 subjects who will be candidates for a tumor re-operation (resectable subjects) The&#xD;
           trial, for each subject, will consist of a screening period, a treatment and&#xD;
           observatioon phase of 60 weeks including, a treatment phase of up to 48 weeks with prime&#xD;
           and boosting administrations of VXM01 in combination with avelumab and an observation&#xD;
           phase of 12 weeks and with an end of trial visit at Week 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive VXM01 in combination with avelumab up to Week 48. The end of study&#xD;
      (EoS) visit assessments will be performed Week 60.&#xD;
