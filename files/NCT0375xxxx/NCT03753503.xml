  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are experimental evidences of the important role of exercise in the PD, that induces&#xD;
      similar effects to pharmacotherapy. So far, the mechanisms of the impact of these changes on&#xD;
      the brain subcortical and cortical regions functioning, motor activities and cognitive&#xD;
      functions are still not clear. The aim of this longitudinal human experiment is to examine&#xD;
      the effects of cycle of 8-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on: (i)&#xD;
      neurophysiological function of cortical motor structures and skeletal muscle actvity, (ii)&#xD;
      psychomotor behavior critically associated with dopamine dependent neural structures&#xD;
      functioning and (iii) neurotrophic factors' secretion level in blood. The investigators will&#xD;
      recruit 40 PD individuals, who will be divided into two groups: one of them will perform two&#xD;
      8-weeks cycle of HIIT (PD-TR), and the other will not (PD-NTR). The investigators will&#xD;
      recruit also 20 age-matched healthy controls (H-CO) as additional control group who will not&#xD;
      perform the HIIT. All PD subjects will be examined during their medication &quot;OFF-phase&quot; pre&#xD;
      HIIT and 1 week-, 1 month-POST cycle of HIIT. The subject from H-CO will be tested only once.&#xD;
      To examine the assumed HIIT-induced changes in brain functioning the investigators will use:&#xD;
      (i) EEG (recorded simultaneously with EMG) methods to assess an amplitude, location and&#xD;
      directionality of brain electrical current of cortical regions and strength of intra-cortical&#xD;
      network interactions during motor tasks performance. During the EEG experiments the subjects&#xD;
      will perform (i) bimanual anti-phase DA level dependent motor tasks (during which the&#xD;
      investigators will record EMG, force). The investigators will also assess motor and non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms of PD and functional test of manual dexterity to evaluate a quality psychomotor&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using these methods the investigators will determine in detail the mechanisms of functioning&#xD;
      of the CNS in PD patients, with emphasis on the cortical interactions that are dependent on&#xD;
      synthesis and DA transmission. The results of the study will help to answer the fundamental&#xD;
      questions about HIIT induced neuroplasticity in PD patients, as well as complement the lack&#xD;
      in knowledge about the mechanisms of exercise-induced changes in PD, and as a consequence it&#xD;
      could enrich the golden standard of treatment in PD from pharmacotherapy toward&#xD;
      implementation of precise evidence based rehabilitation.&#xD;

      I. Research Project Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To characterize an influence of 8-week HIIT cycle on neurophysiological functions&#xD;
      (NPFs) of: (i) motor cortical structures, (that are critically dependant on the presynaptic&#xD;
      DA availability), using EEG, and (ii) skeletal muscles engaged in motor task, using surface&#xD;
      EMG. The following neurophysiological functions of CNS will be tested during performance of&#xD;
      the DA availability-dependant self initiated bimanual motor tasks: (i) a level of activation&#xD;
      of cortical structures, and (ii) strength of functional coupling between neural structures.&#xD;
      For skeletal muscles NPFs', the investigators will study a strategy of motor units&#xD;
      activation. Also, since the investigators will record EEG and EMG simultaneously, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess strength of cortico-muscular coupling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1. NPFs will improve after the 8-week HIIT cycle compared to baseline in the PD-TR&#xD;
      group, and will sustain one month post HIIT. Namely, the investigators speculate that for the&#xD;
      motor in CNS activity, it will be: (1) primary motor cortex (M1), supplementary motor area&#xD;
      (SMA); (2) decrease of activation of lateral premotor cortex (PMC) and cerebellum; with&#xD;
      simultaneous (3) increase of functional coupling of: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)&#xD;
      with M1, PMC, SMA and cerebellum; (4) decrease of functional coupling between M1, PMC, SMA,&#xD;
      cerebellum and parietal cortex. For the skeletal muscle function it will be an improvement in&#xD;
      recruitment strategy of motor units. Taking into the data from the simultaneous recording of&#xD;
      electrical activity of brain cortex and skeletal muscles engaged in motor tasks, the&#xD;
      investigators assume strengthening of corticomuscular coupling. In the PD-NTR group NPFs will&#xD;
      not improve or even will be worsened in the same time interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To characterize an influence of the 8-week HIIT cycle on the psychomotor behaviors&#xD;
      (PMBs), critically dependant on the DA availability and brain's NPFs. The following PMBs will&#xD;
      be tested during several experiments: (1) self initiated bimanual anti-phase movement tasks&#xD;
      during the simultaneous EEG, EMG and force recordings (2) all motor and non-motor PD symptoms&#xD;
      evaluation, based on neurological assessment, (3) overall cognitive function and specifically&#xD;
      aspects of executive function using psychological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2. PMBs will improve after the 8-week HIIT cycle compared to baseline in the PD-TR&#xD;
      group, and will sustain one month post HIIT, as a consequence of the improvements of&#xD;
      presynaptic striatal DA availability and NPFs, The PMBs improvement will not be present in&#xD;
      the PD-NTR group, or even the PMBs will be worsened in the same time interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To evaluate: (i) the effect of the 8-week HIIT cycle on BDNF, NGF, IGF-1 secretion&#xD;
      level in blood treated as markers of neuroplasticity efficiency (expressed in&#xD;
      exercise-induced increase of presynaptic DA level, and improvement of NPF' and PMBs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3. The secretion level of the BDNF, NGF and IGF-1 will increase after the first&#xD;
      and second bout of HIIT cycle compared to baseline in the PD-TR group, and will sustain one&#xD;
      month post HIIT. In contrary to PD-TR group, the improvement in BDNF, NGF and IGF-1 secretion&#xD;
      level will not be present in the PD-NTR group or even their level will decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Justification for tackling specific scientific problems by the proposed project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.1. EEG and EMG application to evaluate NPFs of brain cortical structures and skeletal&#xD;
      muscles II.1.1. A level of activation of neural cortical structures will be evaluated with&#xD;
      EEG averaging and source analysis (cortical neurons circuits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.1.2. Strength of functional coupling between the neural cortical structures will be&#xD;
      assessed with EEG-EEG coherence analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.1.3. Motor units activation strategy of skeletal muscle engaged during motor task will be&#xD;
      tested with surface EMG standard analysis and SSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.1.4. Strength of functional cortico-muscular coupling will be evaluated with analysis of&#xD;
      coherence between EEG and EMG signals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.2. PMBs will be evaluated based on motor and cognitive tasks performance, and neurological&#xD;
      and psychological tests/scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.2.1. Self initiated bimanual anti-phase index finger movements and bimanual dexterity&#xD;
      tasks will be assessed during simultaneous EEG, EMG and force recordings based on analysis of&#xD;
      force development, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.2.2. Motor and non-motor PD symptoms evaluation, based on neurological assessment using&#xD;
      the whole Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr scale (H&amp;Y).&#xD;
      Also, for the purpose of correlation estimation between the bimanual dexterity function&#xD;
      described in points II.2.1 the investigators will choose from the UPDRS the scores dedicated&#xD;
      for manual and bimanual function. Namely, the investigators will analyze parkinsonian&#xD;
      bradykinesia scores of the affected/more affected upper extremity based on the items 23-25&#xD;
      from UPDRS (finger tapps, opening and closing hands, pronation-supination hands movement;&#xD;
      respectively). The investigators will also analyze: (i) a performance of daily life manual&#xD;
      functions based on the items 8-11 from UPDRS (handwriting, cutting food and handling&#xD;
      utensils, dressing, hygiene; respectively). Additionally, the investigators will assess the&#xD;
      quality of life using Schwab and England Daily Living Activity Scale (S&amp;E DLA) (Fahn and&#xD;
      Elton, 1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.2.3. Psychological assessment of executive function using two tests: the Trail Making Test&#xD;
      (TMT) and Stroop Test (ST). In both the TMT and ST tests the time taken to complete the test&#xD;
      is used as the performance measure with shorter time as better performance. Also, to exclude&#xD;
      the patients with dementia the investigators will apply Mini Mental State Examination test&#xD;
      (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.3. Neurotrophic factors secretion in blood By using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&#xD;
      (ELISA technique), the investigators will assess secretion of serum BDNF, NGF, IGF-1 in&#xD;
      blood, that are responsible for neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Work plan The project realization is scheduled for 24 months. The project will enroll&#xD;
      two PD patients' groups: PD-TR - the PD patients who will perform physical training cycle;&#xD;
      PD-NTR - non-trained PD patients and one H-CO - healthy control group that will not perform&#xD;
      the HIIT cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will start with baseline testing session (PRE-HIT) in the both PD groups. Then&#xD;
      the PD-TR group will perform the 8-week HIIT cycle, and the PD-NTR group will not perform&#xD;
      HIIT cycle in this time period. Then, 1 week-, and one month post HIIT cycle cessation the&#xD;
      investigators will perform testing sessions in the PD-TR and PD-NTR group. The healthy&#xD;
      control group will be tested only in one time point, when the lab space will not be occupied&#xD;
      with PD patients tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Research methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.1. Research design This project will be a longitudinal, randomized (opaque envelopes&#xD;
      randomization) controlled study with 3 arms. The investigators will recruit 40 PD&#xD;
      individuals, who will be randomly allocated into two equal groups: PD-TR (N=20) and PD-NTR&#xD;
      (N=20). The investigators will compare the results from these two groups to explore a&#xD;
      longitudinal effect HIIT cycles on measurement outcomes. Additionally, the investigators will&#xD;
      recruit a healthy control group (H-CO; N=20) that will be tested only once, and will&#xD;
      constitute &quot;healthy state&quot; condition for comparisons with both PD patients groups. The&#xD;
      comparison of PD-NTR with H-CO will show us the mechanisms of pathological changes in PD&#xD;
      patients and comparison of PD-TR with H-CO will give us an opportunity to explore the&#xD;
      character of mechanisms (restoration or compensation) of HIIT induced changes in PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 40 PD individuals, will be qualified to our study after being diagnosed to have an&#xD;
      idiopatic PD, based on neurological assessment. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease will be&#xD;
      based on medical history, physical and neurological examinations and response to L-dopa.&#xD;
      IV.2.2. Subjects recruitment. The PD subjects will be recruited from Neurology Clinic,&#xD;
      Wroclaw Medical University (WMU) in Wroclaw, Poland, where the person performing the&#xD;
      neurological PD patients evaluation in our project (Budrewicz Slawomir, M.D, Ph.D.) is&#xD;
      employed as movement disorders neurologists and consult PD patients there. Taking into&#xD;
      account the capabilities and top position of the WMU, the investigators are sure that the&#xD;
      investigators are able to recruit and finally qualify 40 PD patients. The healthy elderly&#xD;
      control group of subjects will be recruited based on: (i) public advertisement and (ii)&#xD;
      contacts with the Universities of the Third Age and the Seniors' Clubs around the Warsaw&#xD;
      city.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.2. Training procedures The patients from PD-TR group will perform 8-week HIIT cycle. The&#xD;
      8-week HIIT program will consist of three weekly 1-hour training sessions (each consisting of&#xD;
      a 10-min warm-up, 40 min of high-intensity interval exercise and a 10-min cool-down phase at&#xD;
      a slow voluntary speed) performed on a stationary cycle ergometer (MONARK, Ergomedic 874E,&#xD;
      Sweden) that will measure cadence (revolutions per minute; [rpm]) and power [W]. During each&#xD;
      training session, the interval exercise will consist of 8 sets of 5-min intervals, including&#xD;
      3 min of cycling at ≥ 60 [rpm] but preferably at 80-90 [rpm] (fast phase of interval) and 2&#xD;
      min of cycling at ≤ 60 [rpm] (slow phase of interval). The patients in the PD-TR group will&#xD;
      be rhythmically cued by a metronome and verbally encouraged by an instructor to pedal with&#xD;
      the set speed appropriate for the fast and slow phases. The cadence values will be presented&#xD;
      to each subject in real time on a screen as feedback to control the rpm during the different&#xD;
      interval phases. The heart rate (HR; beats per minute [bpm]) measured using a Polar system&#xD;
      (Polar, Finland), cadence [rpm], and power [W] will be monitored and collected during each&#xD;
      training session. Training supervisor will adjust the resistance for each patient to ensure&#xD;
      cycling at each patient's target heart rate (THR) and with appropriate speed. PD patients&#xD;
      will cycle at 60%-75% of their individualized HRmax (maximal heart rate). The PD patients&#xD;
      will be encouraged to cycle faster (80-90 rpm or 30% faster than their voluntary pedaling&#xD;
      rate) during the fast phase of interval and to increase his/her THR every 2 weeks by 5% (60%&#xD;
      of the HRmax during 1-2 week, 65% during 3-4 week, 70% during 5-6 week, and 75% during 7-8&#xD;
      week of training period). Additionally, the patients' perceptions of the exercise intensity&#xD;
      (for the fast and slow phases of the interval) will be assessed using the Borg Rating of&#xD;
      Perceived Exertion (RPE) (Borg, 1982).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.3. Measurement procedures All PD subjects will be examined during their medication&#xD;
      off-phase, i.e. after an overnight 12-hours withdrawal of anti-parkinsonian drugs (24-hours&#xD;
      for extended release medications). The testing sessions' sequence for specific methods is as&#xD;
      follows: 1'st day - (i) blood sampling; (ii) psychological, neurological and functional tests&#xD;
      -&gt; 2'nd day - (i) EEG + EMG + force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.4. Statistical analysis The investigators will first perform a between-group comparison&#xD;
      for all demographics and clinical characteristics to check for baseline differences. This&#xD;
      will be done using the two-tailed Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U tests for normally and&#xD;
      non-normally distributed data or the Fisher's exact test for contingency data. Repeated&#xD;
      measures analysis of variance will be used to perform a between-group comparison of changes&#xD;
      in the testing points. Significant main effects will then be subjected to a post-hoc&#xD;
      pair-wise comparison primarily between PD-TR and PD-NTR, and PD-TR and H-CO. Correlation&#xD;
      analysis (Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient) will be performed between EEG, EMG&#xD;
      (describing NPFs), PMBs, and neuroplasticity markers outcomes. For all analyses, a&#xD;
      significance level will be set to α=0.05 with Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons&#xD;
      when necessary.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Motor and non-motor Parkinson's disease signs/symptoms will be evaluated using UPDRS (sections I - III, that include the items 1 -31). Each item is expressed in [points] from 0 to 4 points, with an interpretation that the higher value means the severe accentuation of sign/symptom. The total score will be reported, as the sum of the points of the sections I-III (the score in the range 0 - 176 points) and each section's score will be reported as well, i.e.: the sum of the points of the section I (sum of points for items 1-4 in the range 0 - 16 points), the sum of the points of the section II (sum of points for items 5-17 in the range 0 - 52 points), the sum of the points of the section III (sum of points for items 18-31 in the range 0 - 108 points).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>S&amp;E DLA scale measure of daily function of Parkinson's disease patients, expressed in [%] from 100 to 0 % (with the higher % value as the better score). The 100% score means that the person is completely independent; able to do all chores without slowness, difficulty or impairment; essentially normal; unaware of any difficulty. The 0% score decribes the person bedridden with the only vegetative functions such as swallowing; bladder and bowel functions are not functioning.</description>
