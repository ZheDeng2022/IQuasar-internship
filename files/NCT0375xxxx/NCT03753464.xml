      The aim of this pilot, exploratory, single blind clinical trial is to evaluate the epigenetic&#xD;
      changes associated with peri-implantitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients will be voluntarily enrolled in two groups: 10 healthy participants, and 10&#xD;
      participants with peri-implantitis. Periodontal and peri-implant clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      measurements, as well as body mass index, medical and dental history will be recorded within&#xD;
      the following timelines: at baseline (for both groups), and 6 months after baseline for the&#xD;
      peri-implantitis group only. At baseline, gingival biopsies and blood will be harvested from:&#xD;
      a) healthy gingival sites during either surgical removal of wisdom teeth or gingivoplasty, in&#xD;
      the healthy group; and, b) from a peri-implantitis site during surgical treatment of&#xD;
      peri-implantitis, and when possible, from a healthy gingival site within the same&#xD;
      participant, in the peri-implantitis group. After harvesting of biopsies, peri-implantitis&#xD;
      subjects will be re-evaluated 6 months after treatment. During the 6-month visit, if a second&#xD;
      surgical treatment of peri-implantitis in the same implant treated at baseline is indicated&#xD;
      as standard of care of the participant, a new gingiva biopsy and blood will be collected.&#xD;
      Gingival biopsies and blood collected from each participant will be used to perform DNA&#xD;
      methylation analysis.&#xD;
