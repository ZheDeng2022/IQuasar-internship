      BACKGROUND: A cornerstone of treatment in preeclampsia is to correct the potential&#xD;
      hypovolemia with intravascular optimisation, which is usually performed as a fluid challenge.&#xD;
      The prediction of fluid responsiveness in these patients, secondary to anatomical and&#xD;
      physiological changes associated with pregnancy has not been established. This study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate if Passive Leg Raising (PLR) protocol can predict fluid responsiveness in pregnant&#xD;
      patients with severe preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: in 35 pregnant women diagnosed with preeclampsia with a clinical&#xD;
      indication to optimise intravascular volume, . A PLR manoeuvre and a fluid challenge will be&#xD;
      performed, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded using Bioreactance technology.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistical analyses, Pearson chi-square test, and mean standard deviation (SD)&#xD;
      will be calculated. Analysis of proportion was used to calculate probabilistic intersections&#xD;
      of the interventions. The area under curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive&#xD;
      value and negative predictive value were calculated for a delta of 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to evaluate the if passive leg rising protocol identifies fluid responsivness in&#xD;
      pregnant patients with preeclampsia&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION The clinical manifestations of preeclampsia (PE) are the consequence of&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction. [1, 2] Different hemodynamic patterns have been described, which&#xD;
      includes: high vascular resistance, cardiac output (CO) alterations, relative hypovolemia,&#xD;
      and increased risk for pulmonary oedema, [3-6] which has been recognised as the most common&#xD;
      final cause of death in women with complications of hypertension7. The risk of pulmonary&#xD;
      oedema in preeclampsia is caused by different pathophysiological changes that follow the&#xD;
      disease. It can be classified as increase preload caused by iatrogenic resuscitation and&#xD;
      resolving puerperal oedema. Cardiac causes such as the presence of a myopathic ventricle,&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction, valvular heart disease, increased afterload caused by severe&#xD;
      hypertension and increased vascular resistance, and other factors such as reduced oncotic&#xD;
      pressure increased capillary permeability or a combination of all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cornerstone of treatment to correct the potential hypovolemia in preeclampsia is&#xD;
      intravascular volume optimization, which usually is performed as a fluid challenge, [8-9]&#xD;
      However, the increased risk of pulmonary oedema has made us understand the need to use&#xD;
      dynamic hemodynamic parameters for fluid responsiveness to guide optimal intravascular volume&#xD;
      optimization in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring fluid therapy upon clinical observation or the estimation of filling pressures&#xD;
      using clinical markers such as blood pressure, pulse rate and urinary output as an endpoint&#xD;
      of euvolemia may be inaccurate in women with severe preeclampsia. In critically ill settings&#xD;
      the resolution of severe hypovolaemia is accompanied by rising blood pressure, falling of&#xD;
      pulse rate and increasing the urinary output. However, in preeclamptic women, oliguria may&#xD;
      develop because of intrinsic renal disease and may not respond to plasma volume expansion&#xD;
      with an increase of urinary output. [20] Tachycardia commonly complicates severe&#xD;
      preeclampsia, and a persistently rapid pulse rate may not be a reliable indication of&#xD;
      intravascular volume depletion, especially when the systolic blood pressure is within&#xD;
      reasonable limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intensive care unit, patients with spontaneous ventilation, an increase of stroke&#xD;
      volume during passive leg raising (PLR) predicts fluid responsiveness. [10-13] However,&#xD;
      during pregnancy, the validity of PLR has been questioned, secondary to the known anatomical&#xD;
      changes that occur from the compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC) by the gravid uterus&#xD;
      and the presence of increased abdominal pressure. [14-16] However recently Brun20 published&#xD;
      the first study that showed that PLR accurately predicts fluid responsiveness in the setting&#xD;
      of Severe Preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic bioreactance technology, [17] which is based on the analysis of thoracic voltage&#xD;
      amplitude changes in response to a high-frequency injected current, and has the potential to&#xD;
      be a useful noninvasive clinical tool for monitoring hemodynamics in pregnant women. However,&#xD;
      the prediction of fluid responsiveness in these patients, secondary to anatomical and&#xD;
      physiological changes associated with pregnancy has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to evaluate if PLR test can predict fluid responsiveness in&#xD;
      pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS The study is approved by the Institutional Review Board. Both ethic and&#xD;
      research committee approved the protocol with registers number DI/17/112/03/039. Patients&#xD;
      will be informed and signed consent before participation. Patients are going to be&#xD;
      prospectively assessed, and consecutive measurements will be performed in an obstetric ICU of&#xD;
      MexicoÂ´s General Hospital Dr Eduardo Liceaga from December 2016 to July 2017. A sample was&#xD;
      calculated for known variance P .01. Measurements for blood pressure and heart rate are made&#xD;
      using bioreactance (NICOMTM Panamedical Mexico City, Mexico) technology.[18] The monitor will&#xD;
      be placed at bedside, to monitor Systolic Arterial Pressure (SAP) and Diastolic Arterial&#xD;
      Pressure (DAP), Stroke Volume (SV), Stroke Volume Index (IVS), Cardiac Output (CO) and&#xD;
      Cardiac Index (CI).18 Because hemodynamic values may vary within a respiratory cycle,[17] an&#xD;
      average of 10 consecutive cardiac cycles, over at least one respiratory cycle, was used for&#xD;
      measurements of SAP, DAP, MAP, SV, and ISV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, we use the best dynamic index report under those 10 minutes. A PLR manoeuvre was&#xD;
      performed for 3 minutes. The manoeuvre involved elevating the patient's legs and placing them&#xD;
      on an inflatable leg wedge providing an angle of 45 degrees while in the supine position.&#xD;
      Next, a 250 crystalloid /colloid (Hartmann + albumin 25%) bolus was given recording the same&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters to observe changes in dynamic measurements to compare both results and&#xD;
      classified them as responder and non-responder. No determination or Central Venous Pressure&#xD;
      or surrogate was made because of the accumulative evidence of the failure of this methods to&#xD;
      detect changes in intravascular volume status. A change of 12% after PLR and bolus was used&#xD;
      to consider a patient responder[20]. Finally, we used the values for ISV because it would be&#xD;
      the better parameter (without the influence of heart rate and independent of the body area).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Using SPSS 23 statistics Descriptive data analysis of patients will be&#xD;
      performed for this purpose, a multivariable database will be constructed, and descriptive&#xD;
      statistical analyses made. To evaluate the distribution between variables a Pearson&#xD;
      chi-square test will be used. Mean standard deviation (SD) values, and analysis of proportion&#xD;
      with the aim of knowing the probabilistic intersections. The area under the curve,&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive and positive predictive value will be&#xD;
      calculated for 12 for ISV.&#xD;
