  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-center, single-arm registry to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bare&#xD;
      metal stent-assisted percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in the treatment of&#xD;
      superficial femoral and/or proximal popliteal artery (P1) lesions in patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic peripheral artery disease&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to collect acute and follow-up (up to 12 months) safety and&#xD;
      efficacy data on the ZENFlex™ Peripheral Stent System in the stent-assisted angioplasty&#xD;
      treatment of patients with de novo or restenotic lesion(s) of the native superficial femoral&#xD;
      artery (SFA) and/or proximal popliteal artery (PPA, P1 segment) when used according to IFU.&#xD;
      Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled in this study at up to 5 sites in Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, single-arm observational registry and does not include an active&#xD;
      control arm. Therefore, no formal sample size calculation has been performed. All subjects&#xD;
      will be evaluated at pre-discharge and during clinical follow-up visits 6 (182 ± 30 days) and&#xD;
      12 (365 ± 30 days) months post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints are patency rate after one year and composite of freedom from device and&#xD;
      procedure-related death through 12 months post procedure as well as freedom from both target&#xD;
      limb major amputation and clinically-driven target lesion revascularization.&#xD;

    <description>The ZENFLEX Peripheral Stent System is designed to deliver a self-expanding stent to the iliac artery, superficial femoral arteries and / or proximal popliteal arteries to improve luminal diameter. The self-expanding stent is composed of nickel titanium alloy (nitinol); contains a total of 12 tantalum / gold radiopaque markers and imparts an outward radial force on the luminal surface of the vessel to establish patency.</description>
