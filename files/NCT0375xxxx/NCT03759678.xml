  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, open-label, rater-blinded prospective Phase II study&#xD;
      which will assess the safety and efficacy of N-Acetyl-L-Leucine (IB1001) for the treatment of&#xD;
      Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two phases to this study: the Parent Study, and the Extension Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Parent Study evaluates the safety and efficacy of N-Acetyl-L-Leucine (IB1001) for the&#xD;
      symptomatic treatment of A-T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Extension Phase evaluates the long-term safety and efficacy of IB1001 for the&#xD;
      neuroprotective, disease-modifying treatment of A-T.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of N-Acetyl-L-Leucine&#xD;
      (IB1001) in the treatment of A-T investigating the efficacy in terms of improving symptoms,&#xD;
      functioning, and quality of life against the defined endpoints in patients with A-T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed during three study phases: a baseline period, a 6-week treatment&#xD;
      period, and a 6-week post-treatment washout period. If within 6 weeks prior to the initial&#xD;
      screening visit, a patient has received any of the prohibited medications defined in the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria (irrespective of the preceding treatment duration) a wash-out study-run&#xD;
      in of 6 weeks is required prior to the first baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive the study drug during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each individual patient, the study lasts for approximately 3.5 - 4 months during which&#xD;
      there are 6 study visits to the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Extension Phase allows patients who have completed the Parent Study to, at the&#xD;
      discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI), continue treatment with N-Acetyl-L-Leucine&#xD;
      (IB1001). Patients will receive treatment with IB1001 for two one-year treatment periods,&#xD;
      separated by a 6-week washout. All patients will receive the study drug during the treatment&#xD;
      period. For each individual patient, the Extension Phase lasts for approximately 25.5 months,&#xD;
      during which there are 6 visits to the study site.&#xD;

    <description>The primary evaluation of the CI-CS will be performed by two independent neurologists whose assessments will be based on videos of the anchor test taken at each visit. These raters will be blinded to the treatment phases and the chronological order of the videos to reduce detection and performance bias.&#xD;
The CI-CS assessment will instruct the blinded rater to consider: 'compared to the first video, how has the severity of their performance on the 9HPT-D or 8MWT changed (improved or worsened) in 6-weeks as observed in the second video?'&#xD;
The CI-CS is evaluated on a 7 point Likert scale (+3=significantly improved to -3= significantly worse).</description>

    <description>The SCAFI scale is a validated ataxia rating scale and is an objective measure of ataxia and physical functioning which consists of three subscales: the 8 Meter Walk Test (8MWT), the 9-hole peg test with both dominant and non-dominant hands (9HPT-D; 9HPT-ND) and the &quot;PATA&quot; test to measure speech performance.&#xD;
For the 8MWT and 9HPT tests, a lower score/time indicates a clinical improvement. A higher &quot;PATA&quot; test score indicates improvement in speech performance.&#xD;
The SCAFI total score, and three subscales (8MWT, 9HPT-D, and PATA) are reported for statistical analysis.</description>

    <description>The SARA scale is an eight-item clinical rating scale (gait, stance, sitting, speech, fine motor function and taxis) with a total score range of 0-40, where 0 is the best neurological status and 40 the worst.&#xD;
