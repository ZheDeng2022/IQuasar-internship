  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While a large focus of research on U.S. college drinking has focused on the prevalence of and&#xD;
      problems related to heavy-episodic drinking, less has focused on college students who are&#xD;
      either abstainers or lighter drinkers (i.e., for men, drinking 4 or fewer drinks in two hours&#xD;
      and 14 or fewer drinks per week; and for women drinking 3 or fewer in two hours and 7 or&#xD;
      fewer drinks per week). Over 40% percent of college students ages 18-22 do not report&#xD;
      drinking in the past month with only half of those engaging in regular heavy-episodic&#xD;
      drinking. Research suggests that a significant proportion of students who were abstinent or&#xD;
      light drinkers prior to and upon entering college initiate drinking and progress to becoming&#xD;
      heavy-episodic drinkers. This provides evidence that the first few months of college is a&#xD;
      high-risk time for initiating both drinking and heavy-episodic drinking and that delaying the&#xD;
      onset of heavy-episodic drinking among light drinkers and abstainers should lead to reduced&#xD;
      harms throughout the college years and young adulthood. Mobile phone-based interventions are&#xD;
      an innovative method for reaching young people and have been established as an empirical&#xD;
      approach towards addressing health issues, including alcohol use. The ultimate goal of this&#xD;
      proposal is to develop, refine and pilot a text message (TM) intervention for abstainer and&#xD;
      lighter drinking first year college students with the ultimate goal of delaying alcohol&#xD;
      initiation and/or reducing alcohol use escalation. An iterative process of focus groups,&#xD;
      intervention content development, and user feedback focused on the unique experiences of&#xD;
      abstainers and lighter drinkers will inform the TM Intervention to be delivered in a pilot&#xD;
      study with 6 weeks of TMs. The pilot study will include a 6 week post-intervention&#xD;
      assessment, and 3, 6, and 9 month follow-ups among 100 incoming first year abstainer and&#xD;
      lighter drinker college students. Given that reducing young adults' and college students'&#xD;
      engagement in excessive alcohol use has been listed as a major objective of Healthy People&#xD;
      2020 and a key priority of NIAAA, an intervention that focuses on delaying alcohol initiation&#xD;
      and escalation into higher-risk alcohol use among abstainer and lighter drinkers could make&#xD;
      important strides to achieving this goal.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first year at college, and specifically the first 6 weeks of college, has been identified&#xD;
      as a critical period particularly influential to college students' alcohol use trajectories.&#xD;
      The prevalence of heavy drinking increases rapidly upon college entry relative to pre-college&#xD;
      use and patterns of high-risk alcohol use established during the transition to college can&#xD;
      result in a range of adverse consequences that persist throughout the academic year. While a&#xD;
      large focus of research on U.S. college drinking has been on the prevalence of and problems&#xD;
      related to heavy-episodic drinking (4+/5+ drinks in two hours for women/men), less research&#xD;
      has focused on college students who are either abstainers (i.e., do not drink any alcohol) or&#xD;
      lighter drinkers (i.e., men: 4 or fewer drinks in two hours and 14 or fewer drinks per week;&#xD;
      women: 3 or fewer in two hours and 7 or fewer drinks per week). Research indicates that&#xD;
      between 21% and 26% of first-year colleges students who were abstinent or light drinkers&#xD;
      before college escalated to heavy episodic drinking during their freshman year. Further, over&#xD;
      40% percent of college students ages 18-22 do not report drinking in the past month, with&#xD;
      only half of those engaging in regular heavy-episodic drinking. Research indicates that risk&#xD;
      cognitions (i.e., prototypes, norms) are associated with initiation and escalation of alcohol&#xD;
      use and also tend to peak around the time that individuals transition out of high school and&#xD;
      into a riskier college environment. Delaying the onset of heavy-episodic drinking among&#xD;
      abstainers and lighter drinkers during the first-year of college, a particularly high-risk&#xD;
      period, should lead to reduced related harms throughout both the college years and young&#xD;
      adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tailoring intervention approaches to students at various levels of risk, including abstainers&#xD;
      or lighter drinkers, may greatly increase efficacy and reduce costs associated with universal&#xD;
      interventions (King et al., 2008). No single intervention is likely to sufficiently reduce&#xD;
      college drinking or consequences; therefore a &quot;mix of strategies is best&quot;. An underexplored&#xD;
      strategy is delivering intervention content that reinforces existing reasons for not drinking&#xD;
      among abstainers and lighter drinkers, with the goal of delaying the initiation of heavy&#xD;
      drinking and/or the escalation to heavy drinking during the first year of college. Given that&#xD;
      longitudinal findings indicate that stronger endorsement of reasons for drinking lightly or&#xD;
      not drinking, such as academic responsibilities, normative influence, and concern for social&#xD;
      images are associated with delayed alcohol initiation, lower levels of alcohol use and higher&#xD;
      rates of abstention among young adults, including college students, interventions for&#xD;
      abstainers and lighter drinkers that focus on reinforcing proximal reasons not to drink or to&#xD;
      drink lightly have promise to dissuade students from initiation of drinking or to delay more&#xD;
      hazardous drinking patterns later on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, mobile phone-based interventions are an innovative method for reaching young&#xD;
      people and have been established as an evidence-based, recommended approach towards&#xD;
      addressing health issues including alcohol use. Mobile phone text-messaging (TM) offers an&#xD;
      innovative technological approach to brief intervention for college students in a mode in&#xD;
      which they are familiar and they already use frequently. Presenting preventative intervention&#xD;
      content via TM, especially for abstainer and lighter drinking college students, may be one&#xD;
      way to delay alcohol use initiation and prevent the escalation of alcohol use during the&#xD;
      first year of college. Therefore, the present project has the following primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Recruit first year college students who are abstainers and lighter drinkers to examine&#xD;
      students' reactions to TM intervention content through an iterative process of focus groups,&#xD;
      intervention content development, and user feedback, which will inform a new intervention to&#xD;
      be delivered in a pilot study (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Through focus groups, elicit responses to timing of the TM intervention, specifically&#xD;
      what days and times per week and how many times per day (set within research-established&#xD;
      ranges) abstainer and lighter drinkers think receiving TMs will the most useful and impactful&#xD;
      to inform TM delivery for the pilot study (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Conduct a pilot study with 6 weeks of TM intervention content, a 6 week&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment and 3, 6, and 9 month follow-ups among 100 abstainer or lighter&#xD;
      drinking first-year college students to determine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      effect sizes (to estimate power and sample sizes for a future R01). Newly enrolled first-year&#xD;
      college students will be randomized to the TM intervention or attention only control. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize the TM Intervention will be feasible and acceptable to abstainer&#xD;
      and lighter drinking students, including being accessible, usable, convenient, relevant and&#xD;
      helpful. The investigators further hypothesize that receiving the TM intervention will be&#xD;
      associated with less initiation and escalation of drinking, fewer negative consequences, more&#xD;
      favorable prototypes of abstainers and lighter drinkers, greater perceived abstaining and&#xD;
      light drinking norms, greater engagement and enjoyment of alternative activities, and greater&#xD;
      endorsement of personal goals that do not involve alcohol at the 6 week post-intervention&#xD;
      assessment and 3, 6, and 9 month follow-ups relative to attention only control.&#xD;
