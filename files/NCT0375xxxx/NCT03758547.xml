  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will assess the effects of secretion removal on &quot;noninvasive&quot;&#xD;
      respiratory mechanics, in deeply sedated mechanically ventilated patients All the&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients will be submitted to the recording of compliance and&#xD;
      resistance at baseline (time0), immediately after the application of 10 cycles alternating 30&#xD;
      cmH20 during expiration and -30 cmH20 during exhalation (time1). Afterward the patients will&#xD;
      undergo an additional trail using the so called &quot;percussion&quot; technique, to assess any&#xD;
      synergic effect of this procedure (time2)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this observational study, the investigators will assess the effects of two secretion&#xD;
      removal techniques on passive respiratory mechanics, in patients undergoing invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients will undergo 3 sequential assessments at time0 (baseline), at time1&#xD;
      after the application of of 10 cycles alternating 30 cmH20 during expiration and -30 cmH20&#xD;
      during exhalation and finally after a 20 sec application of a &quot;percussion technique&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be ventilated without PEEP and sedated with a benzodiazepine infusion to&#xD;
      produce complete relaxation and adaptation to the ventilator, as assessed by the complete&#xD;
      absence of spontaneous efforts, so that there was no change in inspiratory flow rate, tidal&#xD;
      volume, or respiratory rate during the three measurement periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Airway pressure (Paw) and flow (V) will be measured continuously throughout the respiratory&#xD;
      cycle with the transducer and expiratory tidal volume will obtained by electrical integration&#xD;
      of the flow signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial blood gas specimens will be withdrawn from the radial artery and analyzed with a&#xD;
      blood gas analyzer The patients will be studied in the semi recumbent position. After&#xD;
      baseline measurements of respiratory mechanics will recorded under control conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct measurement of PEEPi will be obtained using the following method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After several breaths under controlled mechanical ventilation, and with the patient relaxed,&#xD;
      the airway opening is occluded at the end of a tidal expiration, using the end-expiratory&#xD;
      hold button incorporated in the ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occlusion will be then released for the mechanical lung inflation, and after a few&#xD;
      breaths the airway opening will be again occluded at the end of the inflation, using the&#xD;
      end-inspiratory hold button of the ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The static compliance of the total respiratory system (Cst rs) will be corrected for the&#xD;
      compliance of the ventilator tubing and the gas compression (0.8 ml/cm H20 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end-inspiratory occlusion technique also allows determination of the inspiratory&#xD;
      resistive properties of the respiratory system, named R,rs min and R,rsmax, that means the&#xD;
      minimal respiratory resistances (those due mainly to the airways) and maximal respiratory&#xD;
      resistances (those mainly due to stress relaxation and Pendelluft)&#xD;
