  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frequency of constitutional mismatch-repair deficiency among suspected neurofibromatosis type&#xD;
      1 patients without a NF1 mutation Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) is a rare&#xD;
      inherited condition. Individuals with CMMRD have an extraordinarily high risk to develop a&#xD;
      malignant tumor in childhood or adolescence. Nearly all known CMMRD patients developed a&#xD;
      malignancy within the first three decades of life and most often in (early) childhood. Since&#xD;
      early cancer detection improves the chances to survive, these patients should be included&#xD;
      from early childhood on in intensive cancer surveillance protocols. Typically patients are&#xD;
      diagnosed with CMMRD only when they develop their first malignant tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many children with CMMRD show already before the onset of the first malignant tumor clinical&#xD;
      signs that may serve as a signpost of this severe condition. Often CMMRD patient show skin&#xD;
      patches of milk coffee-like color, termed caf√© au lait maculae (CALM), which are very typical&#xD;
      for a different inherited condition named neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1, which is much&#xD;
      more frequent than CMMRD, also leads to tumor development. But NF1 tumors are usually benign&#xD;
      and NF1 children need different, less rigorous, tumor surveillance programs than CMMRD&#xD;
      patients. A child with &gt;5 CALM is suspected of having NF1. However, if this diagnosis cannot&#xD;
      be confirmed by identification of the causative genetic alteration (NF1-mutation), CMMRD is&#xD;
      one possible, but presumably rare, alternative (= differential) diagnosis. Therefore, human&#xD;
      geneticists and pediatricians discuss internationally, whether these children should be&#xD;
      tested for CMMRD. Diagnosing CMMRD in this situation would allow offering appropriate cancer&#xD;
      surveillance protocols to these patients before they develop their first malignant tumor.&#xD;
      However, CMMRD testing in this situation may also cause difficulties. Genetic testing may for&#xD;
      instance render an ambiguous result, which can neither confirm nor rule out CMMRD. Such a&#xD;
      result would create great uncertainty of the appropriate management of the patient. It would&#xD;
      be not clear whether intensive cancer surveillance, that may be very stressful for the&#xD;
      patient and the family, should be applied or not. Such potential disadvantages of (with&#xD;
      respect to tumor development) predictive CMMRD testing argue more against testing when the&#xD;
      chances to identify CMMRD in a patient and consequently achieving a benefit for the patient&#xD;
      are low. But currently the frequency of CMMRD patients among suspected NF1 patients without a&#xD;
      causative NF1 mutation is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the aim of this project to get a reliable estimation on the frequency of the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis CMMRD in children with NF1 signs in whom the diagnosis NF1 cannot be&#xD;
      confirmed. This information is needed to evaluate and weight the benefits and potential&#xD;
      disadvantage of CMMRD testing in these children. To know this frequency is also important for&#xD;
      appropriate genetic counseling of at risk children and their parents.&#xD;

      We will analyze at least 670 archived gDNA and cDNA samples of suspected NF1 patients. To&#xD;
      avoid generating data for individual patients, we will analyze only fully anonymized samples.&#xD;
      However, to get some overall information on the phenotype of the CMMRD patients which will be&#xD;
      identified in this study, we will form clinical subgroups within the total cohort.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Since CALM or CALM-like pigmentation alterations are the most prevalent NF1 sign in&#xD;
             CMMRD patients, at least two should be present in the patient. Therefore, we will&#xD;
             include any suspected de novo (=non-familial = NF1 signs absent in parents) NF1&#xD;
             patient who falls into one of three clinical groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. &gt;5 CALM with or without skinfold freckling and no other NIH NF1 criterion,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. &gt;5 CALM with or without skinfold freckling and one or more other NIH NF1&#xD;
                  criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. 2-5 CALM and one or more NIH NF1 criteria other than CALM.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient's age must be below 17 years, since the vast majority of CMMRD cases will&#xD;
             have developed a tumor by this age. However, overall we aim that the large majority of&#xD;
             patients is below the age of 10 years which is the mean age of tumor onset in CMMRD&#xD;
             patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A causative NF1 or SPRED1 mutation must be largely excluded by mutation analysis&#xD;
             protocols that reach highest mutation detection rates in bona fide NF1 patients (i.e.&#xD;
             familial cases who fulfill NIH criteria)* and sufficient amounts of gDNA and cDNA must&#xD;
             be available for subsequent massive-parallel sequencing-based mutation analysis which&#xD;
             potentially needs to be complemented with RNA-based techniques (cDNA) particularly for&#xD;
             the notoriously difficult PMS2 gene.&#xD;
