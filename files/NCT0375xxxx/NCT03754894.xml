  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keratinized gingiva around dental implants are necessary to achieve esthetic appearance in&#xD;
      the anterior teeth, also it is more resistant to abrasion, recession, less in plaque&#xD;
      accumulation and inflammation, and easy to manipulate during stage two surgery and impression&#xD;
      making in prosthetic stage. For the aforementioned reasons over year's authors have developed&#xD;
      many techniques to increase the amount of keratinized gingiva around the dental implants such&#xD;
      techniques are apically and laterally repositioned flaps , free gingival grafts, acellular&#xD;
      dermal matrix allograft , coronally repositioned flap and sub epithelial connective tissue&#xD;
      flaps . Huh et al compared the effects of the use of a ready-made plastic stent on the width&#xD;
      of peri-implant keratinized mucosa with those of conventional methods. In addition, the&#xD;
      effect of a plastic stent on peri-implant soft tissue was examined through histological&#xD;
      observations. Reported that the width of the keratinized mucosa was significantly higher and&#xD;
      the distance from the top of the implant platform to the mucogingival junction was&#xD;
      significantly longer in the ready-made plastic stent group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus this study will be performed to compare between the effect of the use of a ready- made&#xD;
      plastic stent on the width of peri-implant keratinized tissue and that of conventional&#xD;
      methods during first stage of implant surgery.&#xD;

      This prospective clinical study will be conducted on Twenty patients will be selected from&#xD;
      the outpatient clinic of Oral Medicine, Periodontology, and Oral Diagnosis department,&#xD;
      Faculty of Dentistry, Ain Shams University This methodology will be reviewed by Ain shams&#xD;
      university, faculty of dentistry research ethics committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Healthy adult patients as evidenced by Burkett's oral medicine health history&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Both genders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age from 20 -50 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Having at least one missing tooth at Posterior area (premolars or molars).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Attached gingiva width below 3 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient should agree to sign a written consent after the nature of the study will be&#xD;
           explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Smokers ( &gt;10 cigs/day ) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vulnerable groups (as pregnant females and decisional impaired individuals) will be&#xD;
           excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with poor oral hygiene or not willing to perform oral hygiene measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prisoners and handicapped patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients with periodontal or periapical infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients met the eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated using computer assisted&#xD;
      randomization through numbered sealed envelopes into two treatment modalities groups: -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I (with ready-made plastic stent): Will include 10 patients where combined full /&#xD;
      partial thickness apically repositioned flap with paracrestal lingual incision will be&#xD;
      performed for implant placement followed by healing abutment placement covered by ready-made&#xD;
      plastic stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II (control): Will include 10 patients where combined full / partial thickness apically&#xD;
      repositioned flap with paracrestal lingual incision will be performed for implant placement&#xD;
      followed by healing abutment placement then suturing the flap in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive healing abutments in first stage of implant surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal will be reviewed by the research ethics committee, the procedure will be fully&#xD;
      explained to the patients and they will sign an informed consent&#xD;
