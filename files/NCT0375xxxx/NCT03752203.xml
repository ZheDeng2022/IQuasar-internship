  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sodium fluorescein, which has been shown to be useful for intraoperative guidance regarding&#xD;
      the resection of adult neurosurgical tumors, can aid the resection of pediatric neurosurgical&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective non-randomized cohort study with patients presenting to&#xD;
      Children's Hospital Colorado for resection of a central nervous system tumor. This study will&#xD;
      employ the use of sodium fluorescein and an FDA approved operative microscope equipped with&#xD;
      excitation and barrier filters for monitoring with sufficient fluorescent enhancement and&#xD;
      contrast. Fluorescein sodium is a small organic salt that accumulates in areas of diminished&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier integrity and allows for determination of the margins between tumor and&#xD;
      normal brain function.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The primary neurosurgeons who will perform the resections will be investigators on the study and will identify eligible patients from the established practice. At the time surgical intervention is recommended, the doctors will inform patients and parents/guardians of the existence of the study. Only those subjects with a clinical relationship to the study investigators will be recruited.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Pre-op assessment to outpatient follow up, up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For all patients, pre-operative imaging and post-operative imaging will be used to analyze the extent of resection of the tumors. In intracranial lesions, the use of volumetric imaging tools will be used to calculate the extent of tumor resection.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-op assessment to outpatient follow up, up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For all patients, pre-operative imaging and post-operative imaging will be used to analyze the extent of resection of the tumors. In spinal lesions, manual measurement will be used to determine the extent of resection.</description>

    <measure>Subjective Utility</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-op assessment to outpatient follow up, up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The doctor's satisfaction with the resection of the tumor(s) will be based upon pre and post imaging, as well as his or her personal experience.</description>
