  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Einstein Healthcare Network in North Philadelphia serves a predominantly underserved medical&#xD;
      community. The investigators routinely see patients who cannot afford absorbent pads after&#xD;
      prostate surgery, which helps with quality of life secondary to urinary incontinence. The&#xD;
      investigators will provide absorbent pads to participants who would be unable to afford them.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that providing absorbent pads for 6 months will result in&#xD;
      improved quality of life in regards to management of urinary incontinence after radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When detected early and managed with appropriate surgical treatment, such as radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy, Prostate cancer prognosis is excellent, but recovery may be associated with&#xD;
      significant transient impact on quality of life. This impact most often manifests in urinary&#xD;
      domains, specifically, development of stress urinary incontinence. Several simple, low-cost&#xD;
      but high-yield interventions may dramatically improve patient's postoperative quality of&#xD;
      life. However, such interventions may be out of reach for patients from Health Enterprise&#xD;
      Zones (HEZ) with limited funds. To make resources readily available for this patient&#xD;
      population, the inclusion criteria will be prostatectomy patients of any age who reside&#xD;
      within the designated North Broad street HEZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress urinary incontinence after prostatectomy is a source of major distress. Incontinence&#xD;
      tends to improve over time with most patients regaining their urinary function. Symptomatic&#xD;
      support with disposable absorbent pads/diapers for several months helps men effectively&#xD;
      manage this side effect. While for most men the cost of the diapers is manageable, for men in&#xD;
      HEZ this represents a significant financial burden on the patient and on caregivers. As a&#xD;
      result, these patients often choose to remain home bound until they recover urinary control,&#xD;
      preventing them from early return to employment and resulting in social isolation. The&#xD;
      Healthcare Disparity SEED Grant will provide up to a 6-month supply of disposable absorbent&#xD;
      pads/diapers to those patients meeting our inclusion criteria. Michigan Incontinence Symptom&#xD;
      Index (M-ISI) questionnaires will be distributed to patients pre-operatively and during&#xD;
      interval post-operative office visits to assess patient satisfaction with voiding function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to distributing M-ISI questionnaires, we will also distribute the Extended&#xD;
      Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) to evaluate overall quality&#xD;
      of life. This is a validated questionnaire capable of accurately assessing multiple domains&#xD;
      of quality of life after prostate cancer treatment. Results of M-ISI and EPIC-CP scores will&#xD;
      be compiled and analyzed to determine if intervention has resulted in measurable improvement&#xD;
      between the treatment and control groups.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months after radical prostatectomy</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire to assess severity of urinary incontinence and how it influences a patient's quality of life. The questionnaire asks a total of 10 questions scaled 0 to 4. The 10 questions that make up the questionnaire cover bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms specific to stress urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence, how many pads patients are using to manage their incontinence, and how it is influencing their daily activities. Patients with higher scores have more severe and bothersome urinary incontinence.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months after radical prostatectomy</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire to help assess overall quality of life in patients with prostate cancer. This questionnaire is a 1-page, 16-item questionnaire that is designed to assess urinary incontinence, urinary irritation, bowel irritation, sexual health and hormonal health after prostate cancer surgery. Each domain is scored separately from a scale of 0 to 12. The minimum symptom score in each domain is a 0 and the maximum symptom score in each domain is a 12.</description>
