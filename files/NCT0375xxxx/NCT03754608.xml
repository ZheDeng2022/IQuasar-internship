  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop a set of biomarkers for imaging of small vessel disease in diabetic individuals&#xD;
      using advanced MRI techniques. With this the investigators want to document progression of&#xD;
      disease both radiologically and clinically.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use a paradigm developed at Yale University called Cognitive&#xD;
      Predictive Modelling (CPM) which takes connectivity data and reduces it to two smaller&#xD;
      network which predict higher and lower performance in a particular task for which these&#xD;
      networks have been optimized. Vascular measures will complement this measure.&#xD;

        Our study population are those with type 2 diabetes in mid-life and old age, who may or may&#xD;
        not have cognitive deficits, whose cognitive deficits (when present) cannot be better&#xD;
        explained by other factors. We exclude those who are unable to have MRI or cognitive&#xD;
        testing due to a variety of reasons.&#xD;
