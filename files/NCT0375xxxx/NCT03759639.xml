  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, open-label, rater-blinded prospective Phase II study&#xD;
      which will assess the safety and efficacy of N-Acetyl-L-Leucine (IB1001) for the treatment of&#xD;
      Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two phases to this study: the Parent Study, and the Extension Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Parent Study evaluates the safety and efficacy of N-Acetyl-L-Leucine (IB1001) for the&#xD;
      symptomatic treatment of NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Extension Phase evaluates the long-term safety and efficacy of IB1001 for the&#xD;
      neuroprotective, disease-modifying treatment of NPC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the Parent Study, Patients will be assessed during three study phases: a baseline period,&#xD;
      a 6-week treatment period, and a 6-week post-treatment washout period. If within 6 weeks&#xD;
      prior to the initial screening visit, a patient has received any of the prohibited&#xD;
      medications defined in the eligibility criteria (irrespective of the preceding treatment&#xD;
      duration) a wash-out study-run in of 6 weeks is required prior to the first baseline&#xD;
      assessment. All patients will receive the study drug during the treatment period. For each&#xD;
      individual patient, the Parent Study lasts for approximately 3.5 - 4 months during which&#xD;
      there are 6 visits to the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Extension Phase allows patients who have completed the Parent Study to, at the&#xD;
      discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI), continue treatment with N-Acetyl-L-Leucine&#xD;
      (IB1001). Patients will receive treatment with IB1001 for two one-year treatment periods,&#xD;
      separated by a 6-week washout. All patients will receive the study drug during the two&#xD;
      one-year treatment periods. For each individual patient, the Extension Phase lasts for&#xD;
      approximately 25.5 months, during which there are 6 visits to the study site.&#xD;
