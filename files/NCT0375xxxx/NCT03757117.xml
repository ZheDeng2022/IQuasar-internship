    <textblock>
      Public health strategies are urgently needed to improve HIV disparities among transgender&#xD;
      women, highly burdened by the epidemic globally, including holistic approaches that address&#xD;
      those health needs prioritized by the community. To address this urgent need, a three-phase&#xD;
      implementation science study of an integrated HIV service delivery model that combined HIV&#xD;
      prevention and treatment services with gender-affirming primary medical care for transgender&#xD;
      women was implemented in Lima, Peru, supported by peer navigation to improve outcomes across&#xD;
      the HIV continuum of care: regular HIV testing for HIV-uninfected participants and linkage to&#xD;
      preventive services; and engagement in treatment resulting in viral suppression for&#xD;
      HIV-infected participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A three-phase sequential implementation science study that culturally tailored an informed&#xD;
      consent model of transgender care integrating routine HIV prevention and treatment as part of&#xD;
      cross-sex hormone therapy supported by peer health navigators for transgender women was&#xD;
      implemented in Lima, Peru.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult individuals, ages ≥18 years, assigned a male sex at birth, who identified as&#xD;
      male-to-female transgender or on the trans-feminine continuum, regardless of initiation or&#xD;
      completion of gender enhancement procedures, were eligible to participate. The study target&#xD;
      population was transgender women who were unaware of their HIV serostatus or were living with&#xD;
      HIV but not engaged in routine HIV care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1. Formative research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community Engagement and Education. Following principles of Good Participatory Practice to&#xD;
      ensure ethical and scientific integrity, based on the specific needs of the target population&#xD;
      and to enhance community engagement, a Task Force composed of transgender women community&#xD;
      representatives was convened for the study. The Task Force informed the investigators on&#xD;
      community issues, advised on study design, supported development of educational programs and&#xD;
      campaigns, and facilitated collaborations with the study population. Tailored annual&#xD;
      community engagement and education plans were designed in advance of study implementation to&#xD;
      include: (1) formative research for stakeholder identification and educational material&#xD;
      validation; (2) community awareness activities; and (3) study communication, including&#xD;
      development of educational materials, community consultations, and communication of study&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed-Methods Formative Research. Formative research was conducted among transgender women to&#xD;
      assess: (1) experiences accessing HIV prevention services and engagement in HIV primary care,&#xD;
      including facilitators and barriers to medical access; (2) attitudes toward a peer navigation&#xD;
      system to increase engagement in HIV care; (3) gender-affirmative procedures (experiences&#xD;
      with previous and current use of hormone therapy, both personal experiences and community&#xD;
      perspectives); (4) assessment of health care needs related to HIV care and&#xD;
      gender-affirmation; and (5) attitudes toward having a dedicated facility to receive&#xD;
      gender-affirmative care. Formative research also included healthcare professionals (including&#xD;
      medical providers and administrators) to assess: (1) knowledge of and experience providing&#xD;
      feminization hormone therapy for transgender woman patients; (2) feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of providing cross-hormone therapy with the existing public health system; (3)&#xD;
      acceptability and willingness to provide cross-sex hormone therapy; and (4) perceptions of&#xD;
      stigma and discrimination resulting from providing hormone therapy to transgender women. Both&#xD;
      transgender women and healthcare professionals were queried about: (1) perceived&#xD;
      acceptability of intervention components; and (2) potential barriers to intervention success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training. Formative research informed the development of training plans to educate study&#xD;
      providers, peer health navigators, and community stakeholders on the hormone therapy&#xD;
      intervention. Transgender women community representatives and healthcare providers received&#xD;
      medical education training in health care needs, services, and strategies including a gender&#xD;
      affirmative approach to transgender medical care, cross-sex hormone therapy, managing HIV&#xD;
      infection, and the peer health navigation to improve linkage and retention in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2. Interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design. Between October 2016 and April 2017, a 12-month, non-randomized, single-arm,&#xD;
      pilot cohort study was implemented in Lima, Peru to assess the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and potential effectiveness of integrating routine HIV prevention and treatment services with&#xD;
      gender-affirming care (i.e., feminizing hormone therapy) supported by transgender women&#xD;
      community peer health navigators. The study was grounded in an implementation science&#xD;
      framework, which aimed to test and translate research to promote evidence-based practices for&#xD;
      improving health and well-being. Specific design considerations were given to elements that&#xD;
      could be replicated by different institutions, including the Ministry of Health,&#xD;
      non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations providing HIV care for&#xD;
      transgender women, and/or researchers seeking to develop health interventions culturally&#xD;
      tailored to the needs of transgender women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment. Purposive sampling through peer-recruitment was used to recruit individuals from&#xD;
      the target population who were unaware of their HIV serostatus, believed they were&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected, or were living with HIV but not engaged in care. Socially well-connected&#xD;
      transgender women members and community leaders acted as peer recruiters inviting fellow&#xD;
      transgender women to participate in the study. Peer recruiters conducted outreach work by&#xD;
      visiting transgender women-specific socialization venues (e.g., commercial sex work areas,&#xD;
      beauty parlors, sporting events, community events), where they approached potential&#xD;
      participants and referred them to the study site. This recruitment strategy was complemented&#xD;
      by social media initiatives to promote study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening. Counselors explained the study objectives to potential participants and obtained&#xD;
      written informed consent to be screened for participation, HIV and sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infection testing, sample storage for further testing, and contact for future studies.&#xD;
      Participants who agreed and provided voluntary informed consent underwent a computer-assisted&#xD;
      self-interview (CASI) which included questions on demographics, gender identity, sexual&#xD;
      orientation and role, sexual risk behavior, previous HIV testing and diagnosis, history of&#xD;
      body enhancement procedures and hormone therapy use, life expectations, problems and barriers&#xD;
      perceived due to being transgender women, HIV testing history, and prior engagement in care,&#xD;
      if HIV positive. Counselors assisted participants in cases of computer unfamiliarity.&#xD;
      Physicians obtained a brief medical history and performed a targeted physical examination,&#xD;
      including examination of the genitals, anus, lymph nodes, skin, and oropharynx. A peripheral&#xD;
      blood sample was obtained for assessment of HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus infection, as well as hematology and biochemistry laboratory tests. Participants&#xD;
      underwent oropharyngeal and rectal swabbing, and provided a urine sample for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infection. An anal cytobrush was used to&#xD;
      assess the presence of cytological abnormalities induced by human papillomavirus infection.&#xD;
      Participants were asked to provide two sputum samples and undergo a chest x-ray to rule out&#xD;
      active tuberculosis. Volunteers were convened to return to the site in 2 weeks for the&#xD;
      provision of results and enrollment if they were eligible and agreed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment. Peer health navigators remained in contact with screened participants and&#xD;
      facilitated their return to the research site for enrollment. At the site, a physician&#xD;
      assessed eligibility, which included transgender women who resided in Lima and normal&#xD;
      hematology and biochemistry laboratory results. Individuals presenting with active&#xD;
      tuberculosis, history of pancreatitis, alcohol or drug consumption or other behavioral health&#xD;
      condition that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the evaluation of the&#xD;
      study objectives, severe medical comorbidity, use of immunosuppressive, nephrotoxic or&#xD;
      hepatotoxic therapy were excluded. Volunteers received a detailed explanation of the risks&#xD;
      and benefits of the medical intervention. Consenting participants underwent a CASI&#xD;
      questionnaire, which included questions about personal and social network support for&#xD;
      resilience to societal stigma and discrimination, hormone therapy expectations, and housing.&#xD;
      Questions about tuberculosis knowledge and attitudes toward its prevention and treatment were&#xD;
      also included. A peripheral blood sample was obtained for assessment of baseline fasting&#xD;
      glucose and lipids, estradiol and total testosterone levels. For those enrolled without any&#xD;
      contraindications, feminization hormone therapy comprised of spironolactone and estradiol&#xD;
      valerate was prescribed and dispensed to all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up. Participants were asked to return to the site for study visits at months 1, 3, 6,&#xD;
      9 and 12, which included follow-up clinical assessment, laboratory testing, and hormone&#xD;
      therapy adherence counseling and education following standard protocols. At quarterly visits,&#xD;
      participants also received pre- and post-test counseling and sexual risk behavior reduction&#xD;
      education, underwent HIV and syphilis testing, and answered a CASI questionnaire on gender&#xD;
      identity and body image sexual risk behavior, substance use, attitudes toward HIV testing,&#xD;
      personal and social network support, hormone therapy expectations, mental health, adherence&#xD;
      to hormone therapy, and involvement in transgender women community building activities.&#xD;
      Hormone therapy was dispensed on site on a monthly basis. Peer health navigation facilitated&#xD;
      retention in care by outreach work, social media, and phone contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen for Feminizing Hormone Therapy. Estradiol valerate was initiated at 2 mg PO daily and&#xD;
      increased to 4 mg after 4 to 12 weeks. Antiandrogen therapy with spironolactone started at a&#xD;
      dose of 50 mg daily and increased every 4 weeks to 200 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Care for HIV Positives and Diagnosed with Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI).&#xD;
      Participants diagnosed with HIV infection were referred to standard Peru Ministry of Health&#xD;
      protocol care was offered, including initiation of antiretroviral therapy and assessment of&#xD;
      baseline and quarterly plasma HIV-1 RNA and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) lymphocyte&#xD;
      cell count monitoring. Participants diagnosed with non-HIV STI received international&#xD;
      standard treatment and those susceptible to hepatitis B virus were referred for vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Procedures. HIV antibody screening was conducted on whole blood. Positive samples&#xD;
      were sent for confirmatory testing to the Peru National Institute of Health laboratory by&#xD;
      means of indirect immunofluorescence, unless a previous positive confirmatory result was&#xD;
      identified in the Peru NIH database. Plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ lymphocyte cell count&#xD;
      assessments were also conducted at the Peru NIH laboratory. Antibodies to Treponema pallidum&#xD;
      were detected using a rapid plasma reagin test and confirmed by a T. pallidum particle&#xD;
      agglutination assay. Both hepatitis B virus and anti-hepatitis C virus serologies were tested&#xD;
      by means of chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis&#xD;
      infections were diagnosed by a DNA amplification test. Cytological slides were manually&#xD;
      colored using standard papanicolaou staining. Sputum testing for tuberculosis used the&#xD;
      Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Hematology, biochemistry and hormone tests were assessed automatically.&#xD;
      All laboratory test results were provided to participants within a maximum of 14 days, and&#xD;
      those with abnormal tests results were referred to clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3. Dissemination of intervention and study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When intervention 12-month follow-up was near completion, the study team prepared&#xD;
      communication plans for disseminating and interpreting study results. Investigators convened&#xD;
      the Task Force, Ministry of Health representatives and scientific stakeholders in a community&#xD;
      forum to on the implications of the intervention. In this forum, investigators presented a&#xD;
      draft version of &quot;Best Practices&quot; for dissemination of integrated transgender women health&#xD;
      care services and asked the audience for input that was further incorporated.&#xD;
