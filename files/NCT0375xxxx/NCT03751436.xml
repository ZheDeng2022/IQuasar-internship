  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax when given&#xD;
      together with enzalutamide and to see how well they work in treating patients with castration&#xD;
      resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Androgens can cause&#xD;
      the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs, such as enzalutamide, may lessen the amount of&#xD;
      androgens made by the body. Venetoclax may target a special group of prostate cancer cells&#xD;
      that is known to lead to resistance to treatment. Giving enzalutamide and venetoclax may work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and&#xD;
           recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of enzalutamide in combination with venetoclax in&#xD;
           patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). (Phase Ib)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability profile of enzalutamide in combination with&#xD;
           venetoclax in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
           (Phase Ib)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax in combination with enzalutamide in patients with&#xD;
           metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that are enzalutamide-naive, as&#xD;
           measured by 12-month progression free survival rate. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess PSA50 response as well as circulating tumor cell (CTC) response in patients&#xD;
           who received venetoclax + enzalutamide. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
           -To estimate the proportion of patients who received venetoclax + enzalutamide and&#xD;
           remain radiographic progression free at 6 months. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the time to first skeletal-related event (SRE) and the time to first&#xD;
           symptomatic skeletal event (SSE). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
           - To estimate the time to clinical progression. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the time to initiation of new systemic treatment for prostate cancer. (Phase&#xD;
           II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the effect of venetoclax + enzalutamide on overall survival. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHARMACOKINETIC OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of enzalutamide and venetoclax when&#xD;
      given in combination to patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Comprehensive analyses of venetoclax levels to assure that they are in the therapeutic&#xD;
      range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY BIOMARKER OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify non-inherited biomarkers that are predictive of response to study treatment&#xD;
      (i.e., predictive biomarkers), are associated with progression to a more severe disease state&#xD;
      (i.e., prognostic biomarkers), are associated with acquired resistance to study treatment,&#xD;
      are associated with susceptibility to developing adverse events, can provide evidence of&#xD;
      study treatment activity, can increase the knowledge and understanding of prostate cancer&#xD;
      biology or study treatment mechanism of action, or can contribute to improvement of&#xD;
      diagnostic assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) and enzalutamide PO QD on days 1-28.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year and then every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
