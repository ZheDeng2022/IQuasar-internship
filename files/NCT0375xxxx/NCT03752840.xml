  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vast majority of blindness is avoidable. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates&#xD;
      that 80% of cases of visual impairment could be prevented or reversed with early diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment. The leading causes of visual impairment are cataract and refractive error,&#xD;
      followed by glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy (DR).&#xD;
      Loss of vision from these conditions is not inevitable; however, identifying at-risk cases&#xD;
      and linking cases with appropriate care remain significant challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the global burden of avoidable blindness, eye care systems must determine optimal&#xD;
      strategies for identifying people with or at risk for visual impairment beyond opportunistic&#xD;
      screening. Outreach programs can prevent blindness both by screening for asymptomatic disease&#xD;
      like age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and glaucoma and case&#xD;
      detection of symptomatic disease like cataract and refractive error. Eye care systems have&#xD;
      developed numerous community-based approaches to these identification methods, including&#xD;
      screening using telemedicine and case detection via cataract camps or community health worker&#xD;
      models, but no studies have been conducted on the comparative effectiveness or cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of these various approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technology promises to greatly improve access to sophisticated eye care. AMD, DR, and&#xD;
      glaucoma can result in irreversible vision loss, and early diagnosis and effective treatment&#xD;
      can prevent progression.Thus, community screening programs may prevent progression and&#xD;
      improve the vision of a population.However, mass screening for eye disease is currently not&#xD;
      recommended. Although self-evident that early detection can prevent blindness for an&#xD;
      individual, no randomized controlled trial has been able to demonstrate that screening&#xD;
      improves visual acuity at the community level. However, recent technological advances promise&#xD;
      to dramatically change the equation by allowing non-medical personnel to use&#xD;
      mobile,easy-to-use retinal imaging devices to diagnose screenable eye diseases such as AMD,&#xD;
      DR, and glaucoma. Mobile technology could also transform the way clinics communicate with&#xD;
      their patients, improving linkage to and retention in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an ideal test for community-based screening. OCT can be&#xD;
      performed through an undilated pupil and is less subject to optical aberrations due to&#xD;
      cataract than is fundus photography. OCT machines have pre-installed algorithms to screen for&#xD;
      glaucoma, and major anatomical abnormalities can easily be detected even by novice&#xD;
      technicians. The infrared image allows detection of referable diabetic retinopathy, and newer&#xD;
      OCT angiography machines offer even more discrimination of early diabetic retinopathy. OCT&#xD;
      machines are ever more portable, and could be feasibly used in community-based screening&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a large cluster-randomized trial in Nepal to compare two&#xD;
      community-based blindness prevention programs: (1) a state-of-the-art screening program&#xD;
      employing OCT and intraocular pressure testing to screen for glaucoma, DR, and AMD followed&#xD;
      by enhanced linkage-to-care to the local eye hospital, and (2) a screening program involving&#xD;
      only visual acuity assessment. An initial door-to-door census will assess baseline visual&#xD;
      acuity in both study arms. The investigators will compare visual acuity between the two arms&#xD;
      through a second door-to-door census 4 years later (primary outcome). The investigators&#xD;
      maximize their chances of finding an effect by conducting the study in Nepal, where the&#xD;
      burden of undiagnosed eye diseases is high. If successful in Nepal, future studies could&#xD;
      assess the generalizability of such a program to other settings, such as rural communities in&#xD;
      the industrialized world.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research will consist of a large cluster-randomized trial in Nepal in which all&#xD;
      communities receive visual acuity screening during a baseline census, and then half&#xD;
      subsequently receive screening with OCT and intraocular pressure testing with an iCare&#xD;
      tonometer. Participants with abnormal results will be referred to the local eye hospital for&#xD;
      examination and treatment. Repeat visual acuity assessment will be performed 4 years later.&#xD;
      Those with incident visual impairment at the time of the final census, defined as visual&#xD;
      acuity worse than Snellen 20/60 (Metric Snellen worse than 6/18; logMAR worse than 0.48),&#xD;
      will receive a comprehensive eye exam to determine the cause of visual impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 - Visual Acuity: To determine whether an intensive screening program results&#xD;
      in better visual acuity at 4 years than screening with visual acuity testing alone. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that individuals from clusters randomized to the intensive&#xD;
      screening program will have better visual acuity compared to those receiving visual acuity&#xD;
      testing alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 - Eye Disease: To determine whether an intensive screening program reduces the&#xD;
      incidence of visual impairment due to AMD, DR, or glaucoma. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that incident visual impairment due to AMD, DR, or glaucoma will be less common in clusters&#xD;
      randomized to the intensive screening program.&#xD;
