             active must use adequate contraception with their female partner throughout the study&#xD;
             and until one month after the last administration of trial medication. Adequate&#xD;
             methods are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexual abstinence or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A vasectomy performed at least 1 year prior to screening (with medical assessment&#xD;
                  of the surgical success) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Surgical sterilisation (including bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy or&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy) of the subject's female partner or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The use of condoms, if the female partner uses an adequate contraception method&#xD;
                  in addition, e.g., intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal contraception (e.g.&#xD;
                  implants, injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives) that started at&#xD;
                  least 2 months prior to first drug administration, or barrier method (e.g.&#xD;
                  diaphragm with spermicide) Unprotected sexual intercourse with a female partner&#xD;

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to&#xD;
             administration of trial medication or during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are&#xD;

             at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,&#xD;
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)&#xD;
