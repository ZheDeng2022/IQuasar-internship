  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant difficulty in incorporating the weaker arm in daily activities after stroke is,&#xD;
      in part, driven by difficulty in engaging both arms interactively in a coordinated manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to determine the nature of bimanual coordination deficits after stroke&#xD;
      and takes initial steps to test a novel theory-driven approach to improve interactive&#xD;
      bimanual coordination in patients with stroke. This project will advance stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation by identifying novel, scientifically-based strategies to improve the&#xD;
      engagement of the weaker arm in coordinated and interactive bimanual actions of daily life,&#xD;
      thus improving quality of life in individuals after stroke.&#xD;

      Overall materials and methods: The proposed experiments will follow the general pattern we&#xD;
      have used in previous behavioral psychophysical studies in individuals with and without&#xD;
      stroke. A controlled virtual environment that records kinematics of the arm and allows&#xD;
      real-time movement interaction with a virtual motor task will be used. A program integrating&#xD;
      motion capture system (Acsention Technology TrakSTAR) and MATLAB-based GUI-gaming environment&#xD;
      allows tracking of the two arms, experimenter-control for specific manipulation such as&#xD;
      position of the virtual brick, target gap, relative contribution of the arms and mapping of&#xD;
      each arm movement to the movement of the virtual brick to provide real-time and post-response&#xD;
      feedback. Participants will be seated in an adjustable chair facing a computer monitor with&#xD;
      their trunk constrained to the chair. Their arms will be completely supported on a low&#xD;
      friction table top and free to move in the horizontal (X-Y) plane with minimal resistance. An&#xD;
      opaque screen will occlude participants' direct vision of their arms. Magnetic markers will&#xD;
      be secured to their hands just proximal to the wrist joint and the position of the markers&#xD;
      mapped to a virtual brick shown on the computer screen. The motor task is to move the virtual&#xD;
      brick(s) to a virtual target gap(s) on the computer screen by moving both arms in 2D (X-Y)&#xD;
      plane on the low-friction table. While real-time visual feedback of the brick is available,&#xD;
      the brick cannot be felt haptically. From a perceptual perspective, in independent goal&#xD;
      condition, each arm moves its own virtual brick to the target gap. In common-goal condition,&#xD;
      a common brick was moved on the computer screen to a target window by predetermined weighting&#xD;
      of each arm movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to beginning the experiments, participants will reach with the paretic arm in three&#xD;
      different directions (135º, 90º and 45º relative to the horizontal) to record the maximum&#xD;
      reaching distance for two trials in each direction. The minimum reach distance across the&#xD;
      three directions will be used to calibrate the start and end position of the target gaps. The&#xD;
      target window position will be placed at 70 and 90% of the maximum reach distance, oriented&#xD;
      at 45º, 90º and 135º relative to the horizontal. From a motor execution perspective, bimanual&#xD;
      reaching to the 90º target will require mirror movements of the two arms in a forward&#xD;
      direction. Reaching to 45º and 135º targets will require parallel movements of the two arms&#xD;
      in those directions. Mirror and parallel movements have been shown to require distinct motor&#xD;
      control strategies, as well as different levels of transcallosal inhibition, hence have been&#xD;
      included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Participants will come to the laboratory for a baseline evaluation to determine&#xD;
      eligibility to participate in the experimental protocol. During this baseline evaluation, we&#xD;
      will perform the following tests: (1) Fugl-Meyer Examination, (2) Mini-mental scale, (3)&#xD;
      Tests for hemineglect using a line-bisection test, (4) Western Aphasia Battery for patients&#xD;
      with Aphasia (5) TMS safety questionnaire, (6) MRI safety questionnaire, (7) Box and Block&#xD;
      test as well as (8) Penn Neurocognitive assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patients qualify for the study, they will come to the lab for three separate&#xD;
      sessions. The first two sessions will be behavioral sessions while the third session will be&#xD;
      a neuroimaging session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first behavioral session, participants will be tested for bimanual coordination in&#xD;
      two different tasks- virtual-reality (VR) based task and real-world tasks. In the VR-based&#xD;
      task, we will test a total of 240 trials under different conditions to obtain a baseline&#xD;
      performance data. We will also have participants perform a battery of bimanual real-world&#xD;
      tasks. During the second session, we will test the effect of two different perceptual cues on&#xD;
      bimanual coordination. During Aim 2 experiments, participants will be instructed to &quot;move&quot; a&#xD;
      common virtual brick with both arms to the target windows in three directions (mirror- 90º;&#xD;
      parallel- 45º and135º) without tilting the brick within a target MT of 800 milliseconds- 1.2&#xD;
      seconds. Participants will complete four 60-trial blocks a pseudorandom order. Each block&#xD;
      will consist of a distinct task conditiondepending upon the nature of perceptual cues&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition 1 will be similar to the common-goal bimanual condition in Aim 1 where they will&#xD;
      transport a common virtual block fixed in a horizontal position to three targets in&#xD;
      pseudorandom order. The movement of the bar will be an unweighted average of the two arm&#xD;
      movements; i.e., each arm will contribute to 50% of the virtual bar movement (50-50&#xD;
      weighting). For Condition 2, the weighting coefficients of the two arms will be equal (i.e.&#xD;
      50-50); and the virtual brick will tilt in the direction of the lagging arm proportional to&#xD;
      the relative time-lag between arms.Operational definition of relative time-lag: Relative&#xD;
      time-lag is different than absolute time lag. Relative time-lagis the time-lag between the&#xD;
      relative timing of each arm within its trajectory. To illustrate, if the left and right arm&#xD;
      are contributing to 70 and 30% of the brick movement, relative time-lag at mid-movement will&#xD;
      be zero if the left and right arm have covered half of their respective trajectories.&#xD;
      Therefore, relative time-lag is influenced by temporal as well as spatial component of the&#xD;
      movement of each arm. Concurrent and post-response feedback about the tilt and path of the&#xD;
      virtual brick will be provided after each trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition 3 will be similar to block 1 (block fixed in horizontal position), but the arm&#xD;
      weighting will be 70-30. Condition 4: In addition to the &quot;tilt&quot; feedback about the relative&#xD;
      time-lag, each arm will be differentially weighted- i.e., the paretic arm will have a higher&#xD;
      weighting coefficient compared to the nonparetic arm. Specifically, the paretic arm will&#xD;
      contribute to 70% of the virtual brick movement while the nonparetic arm will contribute to&#xD;
      30% of the virtual brick movement. 20 trials of bimanual reaching in each direction (90º; 45º&#xD;
      and 135º) will be completed in pseudorandom order.&#xD;
