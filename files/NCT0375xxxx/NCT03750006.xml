  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a clinical condition of poor physiological reserve that increases risks for&#xD;
      adverse health outcomes including falls, hospitalization and mortality. Exercise is&#xD;
      beneficial for the prevention and even reversal of frailty, yet participation among older&#xD;
      individuals is limited. Short session high intensity interval training (HIIT) is emerging as&#xD;
      a promising exercise strategy that achieves performance gains with lower time commitment. The&#xD;
      goal of this pilot proposal is to establish the feasibility of HIIT exercise training&#xD;
      protocols in 65-85 year old individuals, as well as to demonstrate the ability to detect&#xD;
      functional and physiologic benefits. The investigators anticipate the preliminary research&#xD;
      findings will lay the foundation for future human clinical studies that will permit us to&#xD;
      significantly improve the health of Veterans.&#xD;

      Enhancing functional capacity in older adults with short session high intensity interval&#xD;
      training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frailty is a condition of poor physiological reserve that increases susceptibility to falls,&#xD;
      hospitalization, disability and mortality. The incidence of frailty rapidly increases after&#xD;
      the age 65, growing from 10% to as many as 50% of those 85 years or older; therefore over 9&#xD;
      million Veterans are either frail or at risk for frailty. Exercise has proven benefits for&#xD;
      frailty, yet older adults rarely attain the recommended 150 minutes a week of moderate&#xD;
      intensity exercise. High intensity interval training (HIIT) is emerging as an alternative as&#xD;
      it delivers similar or better gains than moderate intensity exercise in less time. Recently,&#xD;
      the investigators published that a 3-day-a-week, 10-minute HIIT regimen in aged mice not only&#xD;
      reduces frailty, but leads to both strength and endurance benefits. In addition, the&#xD;
      preliminary data demonstrate significant changes in microRNA (miRNA) profiles. Despite the&#xD;
      potential of short session HIIT to improve functional capacity and lead to better adherence,&#xD;
      the modality has not been tested in individuals 65-85 years of age, and in particular, frail&#xD;
      individuals. The goals of this proposal are to: 1) investigate the feasibility of recruiting&#xD;
      and administering short session HIIT to frail, pre-frail, and non-frail older Veterans and 2)&#xD;
      to characterize the physical performance benefits and serum microRNA (miRNA) profiles in&#xD;
      those participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these goals the investigators will administer a short session HIIT regimen&#xD;
      totaling only 10-minutes, 3-days-a-week for 3 months, using recumbent exercise cycles, to&#xD;
      65-85 year old participants. The investigators will also utilize next generation RNA sequence&#xD;
      technology to assess HIIT impacts upon microRNA profiles in serum samples. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate this project will demonstrate the feasibility of administering short session HIIT&#xD;
      to older individuals, including vulnerable frail and pre-frail populations as well as&#xD;
      demonstrate the ability to collect and analyze serum miRNA profiles. The advantages to this&#xD;
      program are the ability to maintain or build muscle mass and improve aerobic conditioning,&#xD;
      especially in older patients where frailty and sarcopenia are so prevalent. This pilot&#xD;
      project will therefore lay the foundation for future clinical trials that further explore the&#xD;
      utility of HIIT to prevent or delay the onset of frailty in larger cohorts, and ultimately&#xD;
      lead to the enhancement of functional capacity and quality of life in aging Veteran&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Thus, the investigators will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (a) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (b) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; (c) restrictions on redistribution of the data to third parties, and proper acknowledgement of the data resource, and (d) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed. De identified data will be maintained on a VA server and will only be shared via encrypted devices. Co-Investigators will have access to the data collected as part of their aims. Investigators working on the grant will have access to the data through the PI.
