    <textblock>
      Observing a lack of research investigating the chronic physiological and psychological&#xD;
      responses to this type of exercise training the aim of this study is to investigate the&#xD;
      optimal training configurations of DoIT to produce positive effects on health, performance&#xD;
      and quality of life markers in sedentary overweight or obese adults aged 30-55 years. The&#xD;
      DoIT program will be performed in a small-group setting indoor or outdoor implementing a&#xD;
      progressive manner for 12 months and using bodyweight exercises with alternative modes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This controlled, randomized, four-group, repeated-measures clinical trial will be consisted&#xD;
      of the following stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial testing: body weight and height, RMR, daily physical activity (PA), daily&#xD;
           nutritional intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a 4-week adaptive period: based on a dietary analysis, participants will be given a&#xD;
           dietary plan (considering the RMR and total daily physical activity related energy&#xD;
           expenditure), providing an isocaloric diet over the initial 4-week adaptive period.&#xD;
           During this adaptive period, volunteers will also be familiarized with exercises&#xD;
           techniques and overload patterns that will be used throughout the study through 4&#xD;
           preparatory sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At the end of the adaptation period, participants will participate in assessment&#xD;
           procedures (baseline testing) at University facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After the adaptive period all participants will be randomly assigned to four groups&#xD;
           (control, 1 session/week, 2 sessions/week, 3 sessions/week). The exercise protocols that&#xD;
           will be used throughout the 1-year intervention will be consisted of 8-12 neuromotor&#xD;
           exercises in circuit fashion applying prescribed time (15-45 sec) of effort and passive&#xD;
           recovery intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After 12 months of exercise intervention all participants will participate in assessment&#xD;
           procedures (post-training testing) at University facilities within 5 days after the&#xD;
           completion of the last training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be randomly assigned to the following four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group (no training)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. DoIT-1 (1 session/week)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. DoIT-2 (2 sessions/week)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. DoIT-3 (3 sessions/week)&#xD;

    <time_frame>At baseline, at 6 months and at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mood will be measured using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire, which uses a unipolar scale to rate the extent to which they are experiencing or have experienced 20 affect states in the past week using a 5-point scale (0 = not at all, 4 = extremely). Higher scores indicate greater negative mood.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, at 6 months and at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which is an instrument that has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. All items are rated on a 4-point scale (e.g., from &quot;Almost Never&quot; to &quot;Almost Always&quot;). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical self.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, at 6 months and at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical self will be measured using the Physical Self-Perception Profile (PSPP), which is an instrument with 30 questions comprising five 6-item subscales. Each item has a four-point structured-alternative format. Scores range from 6 to 24 on each subscale, with high scores representing positive perceptions. Half of the items are worded in the negative direction.</description>
