  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of Stratacel® wound dressing&#xD;
      on cosmetic outcomes following 1064/532nm picosecond laser (Picoway®, Syneron Candela Corp,&#xD;
      Wayland, MA, USA) treatment of abdominal striae alba. Secondary objectives include examining&#xD;
      the effect of Stratacel® wound dressing on post-laser healing and symptomatology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty adult subjects with abdominal striae alba will be enrolled. All striae will be treated&#xD;
      using the 1064/532nm picosecond laser with designated and standardized settings (Appendix A).&#xD;
      The abdominal striae treatment region will then be split across the body vertically with one&#xD;
      half randomized to Stratacel® and the other to placebo, clear ultrasound gel (Aquasonic). A&#xD;
      blinded study coordinator will apply the products to each randomized half-abdomen immediately&#xD;
      following laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 3 treatments will be completed at 1 month intervals. Blinded-investigator and&#xD;
      subject self-assessments will be performed at post-treatment days 2, 5, 7, and 10 after each&#xD;
      laser session. Assessments will also be performed 1 and 3 months after the final laser&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
