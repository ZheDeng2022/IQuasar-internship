  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inequalities in stillbirth, infant and child mortality as well as other reproductive health&#xD;
      outcomes have been reported among ethnic minority groups in Denmark. The MAMAACT study aims&#xD;
      to improve the communication between non-Western immigrant women and midwives regarding body&#xD;
      symptoms that need prompt reaction, and thus improve perinatal health. 19 of 21 maternity&#xD;
      wards in Denmark participate in the study. By simple randomization 10 maternity wards have&#xD;
      been selected to the intervention group and 9 maternity wards to the control group. The&#xD;
      intervention consist of post graduate training of midwives in intercultural competence and&#xD;
      use of health education materials (leaflet and app) on pregnancy warning signs. The&#xD;
      intervention will be implemented in the antenatal care from October 2018- September 2019. The&#xD;
      training is expected to reach 350 midwives working with antenatal care and 27000 pregnant&#xD;
      women, of whom 2700 are expected to be non-Western migrant women. The effect of the MAMAACT&#xD;
      intervention will be analyzed by assessing women's ability to actively engage with health&#xD;
      care providers (primary outcome), women's knowledge about warning signs of pregnancy&#xD;
      complications and health system navigation using survey data. Secondary outcomes are 5-minute&#xD;
      Apgar score, umbilical-cord blood gas analysis, transfer to a neonatal intensive care unit,&#xD;
      gestational age at birth, fetal birthweight according to gestational age and ICD-10 code for&#xD;
      sign of asphyxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAMAACTs overall target group is all pregnant women, and the specific target group is women&#xD;
      of non-Western origin. Therefore, the outcomes of the trial will be analysed for both the&#xD;
      total population and for the effects among non-Western immigrant women specifically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Training of midwives in intercultural competence and increased attention to&#xD;
      communication of warning signs of pregnancy during antenatal care will improve the&#xD;
      communication and interaction between women and midwives, improve health literacy of the&#xD;
      women and enable them to better access the relevant care in case of a pregnancy complication,&#xD;
      which will then increase survival and health of newborn children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is a complex intervention and designed as a cluster randomised trial. 19&#xD;
      maternity wards participate and by simple randomization within thee groups of maternity wards&#xD;
      according to the proportion of non-Western migrant women giving birth, 10 clusters are in the&#xD;
      intervention group and 9 in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the intervention will be analysed in a difference-in-difference design,&#xD;
      where the change in outcomes from before to after intervention period at the intervention&#xD;
      sites are compared to the change at the control sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary trial outcome is studied using telephone surveys with pregnant women recruited&#xD;
      through the antenatal care services. The questionnaire will include validated items on the&#xD;
      health literacy dimension actively engagement with health care providers (5 items) and health&#xD;
      system navigation (5 items). Women are recruited when they attend for the week 20 ultra sound&#xD;
      scan and will be interviewed between pregnancy week 30+0 and 38+7. The questionnaires are&#xD;
      managed in six languages (Danish, Arabic, English, Turkish, Somali and Urdu, and bilingual&#xD;
      and trained interviewers conduct the interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using unpublished data from pregnant women at Hvidovre Hospital in 2016 (n=407), Danish born&#xD;
      women are found to have a mean level of the relevant health literacy dimension on 4.16 and&#xD;
      non-Western migrant women have a significantly lower mean at 3.97. The goal is that the&#xD;
      MAMAACT intervention will to improve the mean level of the non-Western migrant women to the&#xD;
      level of the Danish born women at baseline, thus an effect on 0.2 on the mean of the&#xD;
      dimension are to be shown. A recent Danish cluster randomized trial aiming at improved breast&#xD;
      feeding by improving the guidance of new mothers at maternity wards has reported&#xD;
      intra-cluster correlation coefficients (ICC) under 0.005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the sample size calculation an estimation with 10 cluster in the control group and 10&#xD;
      clusters in the intervention group were used, however after recruitment and randomization 9&#xD;
      wards were in the control group and 10 in the intervention group. With an ICC on 0.005 with&#xD;
      10 clusters in the intervention arm and 10 clusters in the control arm an effect on 0.1 with&#xD;
      a strength of 80 % can be detected if data from 2580 of the total population before and after&#xD;
      the intervention (1290 from the intervention before and after and 1290 from the control group&#xD;
      before and after) is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With an ICC on 0.005 with 10 clusters in the intervention arm and 10 clusters in the control&#xD;
      arm an effect on 0.2 with a strength of 80 % can be detected if data is collected from 500&#xD;
      non-Western women before and after the intervention (250 from the intervention both before&#xD;
      and after and 250 from the control group both before and after).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on telephone survey data, effects on the skills in health system navigation among the&#xD;
      women will also be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall effects of the MAMAACT intervention on stillbirth and neonatal health will be&#xD;
      analysed by the medical birth registry and obstetric databases. Stillbirth is defined as&#xD;
      death of a child without any signs of life after 22 completed weeks of gestation. Neonatal&#xD;
      death is defined as death of a child after live birth before 1 months of age. No significant&#xD;
      effects on these outcomes are expected due to low numbers in the short intervention period.&#xD;
      Secondary trial outcomes are 5-minute Apgar score, umbilical-cord blood gas analysis,&#xD;
      transfer to a neonatal intensive care unit, gestational age at birth, fetal birthweight&#xD;
      according to gestational age, ICD-10 code for sign of asphyxia, and pregnancy complications&#xD;
      (preeclampsia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All effectiveness analysis will be using an intention-to-treat approach and will account for&#xD;
      the clustering of individuals and potential confounding in a controlled mixed effect&#xD;
      regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of the intervention will be analyzed using qualitative data. The resarch&#xD;
      questions are: How do midwives and non-Western immigrant women react to the MAMAACT&#xD;
      intervention across Denmark? Which barriers exist in the organisation of antenatal care, and&#xD;
      how do they affect the national implementation of the MAMAACT intervention? What are&#xD;
      non-Western immigrant women's everyday life conditions in Denmark, and how do they affect&#xD;
      women's responses to potential pregnancy complications?&#xD;
