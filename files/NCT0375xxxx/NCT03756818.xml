    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of TAK-659 and paclitaxel in&#xD;
      treating patients with advanced solid tumors. TAK-659 may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving TAK-659 and&#xD;
      paclitaxel may work better in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. To define the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of spleen tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor TAK-659 (TAK-659) and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the safety profiles of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. To evaluate clinical response signals to the combination. II. To&#xD;
      analyze pharmacokinetic interactions between TAK-659 and paclitaxel. III. To assess&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers (baseline molecular mutation status) and/or resistant pathways by&#xD;
      comparing molecular signatures at baseline versus at time of relapse in patients who have&#xD;
      achieved objective responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor TAK-659 and&#xD;
      paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor TAK-659 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and&#xD;
      paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over approximately 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.&#xD;
