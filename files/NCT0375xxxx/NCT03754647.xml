      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of Vitamin C upon Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) - treated Obsessive&#xD;
      Compulsive Disorder (OCD) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to examine the effect of vitamin C upon Selective Serotonin Reuptake&#xD;
      Inhibitors (SSRIs) - treated Obsessive Compulsive Disorder patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a prospective type of interventional study to to assess the effects of vitamin C&#xD;
      along with SSRIs upon OCD patients. The study will be conducted in the Department of&#xD;
      Pharmacology and Department of Psychiatry, BSMMU, from September 2017 to February 2019. A&#xD;
      total of 90 OCD patients will be selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      patients will be divided randomly into 2 groups: group A and group B. Group A will consist of&#xD;
      45 patients who will receive only SSRIs orally daily and group B would consist of 45 patients&#xD;
      who will receive vitamin C, 500 mg BID orally daily along with SSRIs for 8 weeks. To see the&#xD;
      effects of Vitamin C, Yale-Brown score of obsessive-compulsive disorders (Y-OCD) would be&#xD;
      assessed by Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at baseline (before vitamin C&#xD;
      administration) and 8 weeks after intervention. Biochemical parameters of oxidative stress&#xD;
      markers such as plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), plasma reduced glutathione (GSH) and plasma&#xD;
      vitamin C level would also be performed at baseline (before vitamin C administration) and 8&#xD;
      weeks after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and of the World Medical&#xD;
      Assembly. Patients will be informed about the study in easy language and then informed&#xD;
      consent will be taken. This study has no potential risk to the patients. Confidentiality will&#xD;
      be strictly maintained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is the fourth-most common mental disorder. The World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) estimated OCD to be among the top 10 causes of years lived with&#xD;
      illness related disability by 2020. Various psychological, social, genetic and biochemical&#xD;
      factors are presumed to be involved in the etiology of OCD. Researches so far have indicated&#xD;
      that free radical induced injuries are involved in the pathology of OCD. A well-known source&#xD;
      of antioxidant is Vitamin C, which is easily available, cheap and more powerful regarding&#xD;
      antioxidant effects compared to many other natural sources of vitamin C. Until now little&#xD;
      study has been performed to observe the effect of vitamin C administration concurrent to the&#xD;
      Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of OCD. Therefore the&#xD;
      present study has been designed to assess the effects of vitamin C along with SSRIs upon OCD&#xD;
      patients. The study would be a prospective type of interventional study to be conducted in&#xD;
      the Department of Pharmacology and Department of Psychiatry, BSMMU, from September 2017 to&#xD;
      February 2019. A total of 90 OCD patients will be selected according to inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. The patients will be divided randomly into 2 groups: group A and group B.&#xD;
      Group A would consist of 45 patients who will receive only SSRIs orally daily and group B&#xD;
      would consist of 45 patients who will receive vitamin C, 500 mg BID orally daily along with&#xD;
      SSRIs for 8 weeks. Comparison between the two groups will be performed through biochemical&#xD;
      parameters of oxidative stress markers such as serum malondialdehyde (MDA), serum reduced&#xD;
      glutathione (GSH) and serum vitamin C levels at baseline (before vitamin C administration)&#xD;
      and 8 weeks after intervention by vitamin C. Along with the biochemical parameters,&#xD;
      Yale-Brown score of obsessive-compulsive disorders (Y-OCD) would also be assessed by&#xD;
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS).Data would be analyzed by Scientific Package&#xD;
      for Social Science(SPSS) and represented by tables and figures as applicable. Significance&#xD;
      level would be set at 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001. Patient's data will be recorded in a&#xD;
      predetermined data sheet. Patients will be informed about the study in easy language and then&#xD;
      informed consent will be taken. This study has no potential risk to the patients. Hence, this&#xD;
      study would be the first to examine the efficacy of vitamin C as an adjunct to SSRIs in the&#xD;
      treatment of OCD.&#xD;
