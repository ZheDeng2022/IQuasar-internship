  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) demonstrate altered lower limb biomechanical&#xD;
      alignment in walking (e.g. excessive hip/knee flexion or equinus during stance) and&#xD;
      experience walking activity limitations that negatively influence their ability to&#xD;
      participate in day to day life. Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) are a fundamental rehabilitation&#xD;
      strategy to facilitate walking in children with CP; yet, a review suggests that efficacy of&#xD;
      the &quot;traditional&quot; solid AFO (TSAFO) in this population remains equivocal. A novel decision&#xD;
      tree to guide orthotic prescription proposes a patient-specific method for adjusting AFO&#xD;
      alignment and integrating footwear modifications (Ankle Foot Orthoses-Footwear Combinations,&#xD;
      AFO-FC). This approach is based on visualizing the sagittal plane orientation of the ground&#xD;
      reaction force vector with respect to lower limb segments during gait. The AFO-FC represents&#xD;
      a paradigm shift in orthotic management as it accommodates ankle equinus contractures in a&#xD;
      rigid AFO, reorients the tibial segment with a heel wedge under the AFO, and applies&#xD;
      different heel, midsole and forefoot shoe modifications to restore lost ankle-foot rockers.&#xD;
      The primary goal of AFO-FCs are to improve stability by facilitating more normal segment&#xD;
      kinematics in single limb stance, decreasing hip/knee flexion. Despite their promise,&#xD;
      evidence of an immediate positive effect on midstance alignment is limited, with no evidence&#xD;
      of clinical effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal assesses the feasibility of using a randomized waitlist study to acquire pilot&#xD;
      data on a targeted clinical cohort of children with CP evaluating the effectiveness of&#xD;
      AFO-FCs as compared to TSAFO during daily life. Individual joint and combined kinematics and&#xD;
      kinetics will be examined for potential mechanisms of action as well as daily walking&#xD;
      performance, balance and satisfaction with the AFO-FC in 30 ambulatory children with CP, ages&#xD;
      4-9 years, with bilateral crouch or equinus gait pattern, comparing gait in TSAFO to the&#xD;
      AFO-FCs.&#xD;

      The goal of this proposal is to assess the feasibility of using a randomized waitlist study&#xD;
      to acquire pilot data on a targeted clinical cohort of children with CP evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of AFO-FCs as compared to TSAFO during daily life. Individual joint and&#xD;
      combined kinematics and kinetics will be examined for potential mechanisms of action as well&#xD;
      as daily walking performance, balance and satisfaction with the AFO-FC in 30 ambulatory&#xD;
      children with spastic diplegia CP, ages 4-9 years, with bilateral crouch or equinus gait&#xD;
      pattern, comparing gait in TSAFO to the AFO-FCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Examine the effect of AFO-FC on individual joint kinematics, overall gait deviations&#xD;
      and walking speed as compared to the TSAFO in children with CP. Multiple gait deviations&#xD;
      (e.g. crouch or equinus) in CP result in slow, inefficient walking [14]. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      the individualized ankle angle, leg segment alignment, and footwear profiles of the AFO-FCs&#xD;
      will optimize lower limb joint kinematics, decrease overall gait deviations facilitating&#xD;
      longer step lengths (improved stance stability), with resultant increased gait speed as&#xD;
      compared to TSAFO. Instrumented gait analysis will assess gait speed and calculate changes in&#xD;
      joint specific kinematics with the Gait Profile Score (GPS) and overall combined gait&#xD;
      kinematics with the GDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine the effect of AFO-FC on daily walking activity, balance, mobility, and&#xD;
      satisfaction as compared to the TSAFO in children with CP. We hypothesize that the AFO-FC&#xD;
      will positively affect community walking activity levels, balance, physical activity and&#xD;
      satisfaction as compared to the TSAFO. Walking activity will be captured by the StepWatch 速&#xD;
      accelerometer; balance by the Pediatric Balance Scale; physical activity by the Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcomes Measurement System (PROMIS速) Pediatric Physical Activity and the Gait&#xD;
      Outcomes Assessment List (GOAL); and satisfaction with device by the Orthotic and Prosthetic&#xD;
      Users' Survey (OPUS).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Baseline Gait Profile Score (GPS) at 3 Months-individual Lower Extremity Joint Kinematics</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post wearing assigned orthotic intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Gait Profile Score (GPS) represents the pattern of deviation as a single number and is derived from the same individual joint/limb gait kinematics as Gait Deviation Index (GDI) The GPS minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 20. A higher score is a worse outcome. An minimally clinically important difference is published to be 1.6 for children with CP.</description>

    <measure>Change in Right Baseline Gait Deviation Index (GDI) at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post wearing assigned orthotic intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Gait Deviation Index (GDI) as a value representing overall gait deviation from a normal kinematic profile (0 to 120 scale) captures cumulative changes occurring at multiple joints and segments by side left/right. GDI has been shown to have concurrent validity with gross motor function and functional walking levels in children with CP. A score &gt; 100 is considered in the normal range. A higher score is a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Gait speed will be captured during the three dimensional gait analysis testing. Gait speed is measured in meters per second (m/sec) with range from 0 to ~ 3.0 m/sec for walking in children. A higher number of m/sec is considered a better outcome with minimally clinically important difference (MCID) of .10 m/s for persons with CP.</description>

The StepWatch 速 is a two dimension accelerometer validated to capture when the foot leaves the ground for a metric of stride counts within the context of daily life. Average strides/day can range from 0 to unlimited strides/day. A higher number of strides/day is considered a better outcome.</description>

Gait speed is measured in meters per second (m/sec) with range from 0 to ~ 3.0 m/sec for walking in children. A higher number of m/sec is considered a better outcome with minimally clinically important difference (MCID) of .10 m/s for persons with CP.</description>

          <title>Change in Baseline Walking Speed in Meters/Second (m/s) at 3 Months.</title>
          <description>Gait speed will be captured during the three dimensional gait analysis testing. Gait speed is measured in meters per second (m/sec) with range from 0 to ~ 3.0 m/sec for walking in children. A higher number of m/sec is considered a better outcome with minimally clinically important difference (MCID) of .10 m/s for persons with CP.</description>

The GOAL range of standard scores is 0 to 100 with a high score a better outcome. The GOAL will allow clinicians to better understand the motor abilities, priorities, and expectations of ambulant children with CP and to improve decision-making about appropriate interventions. The GOAL consists of 48 items grouped into seven domains: 1) activities of daily living and independence; 2) gait function and mobility; 3) pain, discomfort and fatigue; 4) physical activities, sports and recreation; 5) gait pattern and appearance; 6) use of braces and mobility aids; and 7) body image and self-esteem.</description>
