      Research aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the home-based intervention to test and start (HITS) trial is to establish&#xD;
      whether (i) the provision of two micro-incentives and (ii) a male-sensitive and HIV-specific&#xD;
      decision support app will reduce population-level HIV viral load and HIV-related mortality in&#xD;
      men, as well as population-level HIV incidence in young women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish the causal impact of two micro-incentives (aimed at increasing uptake of&#xD;
           home-based HIV testing and linkage to care, respectively) on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Population-level HIV viral load in men&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Population-level HIV-related mortality in men&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Population-level HIV incidence in young women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish the causal impact of a male-sensitive and HIV-specific decision- support app&#xD;
           (called EPIC-HIV) on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Population-level HIV viral load in men&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Population-level HIV-related mortality in men&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Population-level HIV incidence in young women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish the causal impact of the two conditional micro-incentives on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. HIV status knowledge in men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. HIV knowledge in men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. HIV treatment knowledge in men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. HIV treatment utilization in men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Sexual behavior in men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Healthcare utilization in men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Household healthcare expenditures&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Household wealth&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Retention in HIV care in men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Establish the causal impact of the male-sensitive HIV-specific decision support app on:&#xD;

             1. HIV status knowledge in men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. HIV knowledge in men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. HIV treatment knowledge in men and women&#xD;

&#xD;
             6. Healthcare utilization in men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Household healthcare expenditures&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Household wealth&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Retention in HIV care in men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that each of the two interventions - micro-incentives aimed at&#xD;
      encouraging HIV testing and linkage to HIV care and a male-sensitive HIV-specific decision&#xD;
      support app - will each increase HIV testing and HIV treatment uptake and via this mechanism&#xD;
      lead to reduced population viral load and HIV-related mortality particularly in men. Reduced&#xD;
      viral load among men, in turn, will reduce HIV incidence in young women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design Following a formative phase to develop the design of the two HITS&#xD;
      intervention the investigators will determine the causal impact of the interventions on our&#xD;
      three primary endpoints in a 2x2 factorial cluster-randomized controlled trial with a&#xD;
      baseline adjustment. A mixed- methods approach will be employed that combines the strengths&#xD;
      of rapid formative social science research (that will inform the precise delivery of the HITS&#xD;
      intervention) with a causally rigorous statistical methodology to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the HITS intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HITS intervention will be delivered through the Africa Health Research Institute's (AHRI)&#xD;
      existing HIV surveillance operations. The investigators will randomize 45 communities to the&#xD;
      four interventions. 8 communities each will receive one of the interventions&#xD;
      (micro-incentives only, male-sensitive HIV-specific decision support app only); 8 communities&#xD;
      will receive both interventions and 21 communities will receive standard-of-care. Communities&#xD;
      will be stratified by incidence in young women (2004-2016) to derive a similar baseline&#xD;
      incidence across intervention and standard-of-care communities prior to the implementation of&#xD;
      the intervention. Both men and women will be eligible to receive the financial incentives to&#xD;
      test and link to care, whilst only men will be eligible for the EPIC HIV-specific decision&#xD;
      support application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the total of 3x8=24 communities in the intervention arms, an estimated total of 4,667&#xD;
      individuals will receive a HITS intervention. In the 21 communities, 4,900 individuals will&#xD;
      receive the standard-of-care. Outcomes will be assessed in all eligible individuals living in&#xD;
      the 45 communities, which together have an estimated population size of 30,000 adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation The study was powered using the outcome of HIV incidence in women&#xD;
      aged 15-30. Using actual Africa Health Research Institute HIV incidence data, the&#xD;
      investigators simulated the HITS intervention introduced in 2011 to 24 of the 45 communities&#xD;
      in the study area. The investigators simulated an intervention that led to a 25% reduction in&#xD;
      arm 1 (micro-incentives), 25% reduction in arm 2 (male-sensitive counselling) and a 32%&#xD;
      reduction in the combined arm. Communities were stratified by baseline incidence (three&#xD;
      strata) in young women (2004-2011) to allow for a similar baseline incidence in intervention&#xD;
      and control communities and the investigators included a random effect in the simulations to&#xD;
      adjust for clustering by community. The results show that the investigators would have been&#xD;
      able to detect this reduction in incidence in &gt;80% of simulation replicates (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
      Therefore, if the investigators were to introduce the HITS intervention in 2018 and follow&#xD;
      young women up for at least 3 years post intervention (ie utilize a total of 17 years of&#xD;
      incidence data - 2004 to 2021) the investigators would be in excess of 90% powered to detect&#xD;
      such a reduction in incidence in this critical age-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methodology Research site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be managed from the Africa Health Research Institute, formerly Africa Centre&#xD;
      that conducts a large longitudinal Demographic and Health surveillance. Participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled during the routine HIV surveillance study (Population Intervention Program) -&#xD;
      trained fieldworkers visit participants at home once a year to conduct household surveys&#xD;
      using tablet computers and offer point of care HIV testing to all individuals aged 15+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In those arms of this cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) that include the once-off&#xD;
      two-stage micro-incentive scheme, consenting men and women will be offered a first&#xD;
      opportunity to earn a R50 food voucher (redeemable in a local supermarket) conditional on HIV&#xD;
      testing. If a participant tests positive for HIV, he/she will have the opportunity to receive&#xD;
      a second R50 food voucher conditional on linking within 6 weeks following the HIV test to one&#xD;
      of the 11 local primary care clinics where HIV treatment and care are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In those arms of this cluster RCT that include the male-sensitive HIV-specific decision&#xD;
      support app, men will be offered EPIC-HIV (a first version, so-called EPIC-HIV-1) prior HIV&#xD;
      counseling and testing. EPIC-HIV-1 is aimed at increasing HIV testing uptake. Those&#xD;
      participants who do not link to care within a month of the HIV test will be offered a second&#xD;
      version of EPIC-HIV (so-called EPIC-HIV-2) at home to encourage linkage to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up routinely through the AHRI's ongoing population-based HIV&#xD;
      surveillance. All participants will be followed up for at least 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linkage to care will be routinely established via the AHRI's ongoing linkage of clinical&#xD;
      records for all patients in the local public sector ART program in the demographic&#xD;
      surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: Data will be collected and managed by AHRI Research Data Management within&#xD;
      PIP databases as per AHRI comprehensive study operating procedures (SOPs). The Population&#xD;
      Intervention Platform (PIP) database has strictly restricted access via a data enclave on a&#xD;
      secure server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All primary analyses (of both primary and secondary endpoints) will be intent-to-treat (ITT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the binary primary outcomes - HIV testing uptake, HIV treatment linkage, and&#xD;
      population-level HIV viral suppression - the investigators will use generalized linear models&#xD;
      with a Poisson distribution, log link function, and robust error terms to determine effect&#xD;
      sizes (risk ratios).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the two survival-analytical primary endpoints - population-level mortality among men and&#xD;
      population-level HIV incidence among women - the investigators will use the Cox proportional&#xD;
      hazards model to determine effect sizes (hazard ratios). If the proportional hazards&#xD;
      assumption of the Cox model is violated, the investigators will use appropriate alternative&#xD;
      survival analytical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all primary analyses, the investigators will adjust for both baseline endpoints and&#xD;
      clustering. For the survival analytical endpoints, the investigators will use data from the&#xD;
      period 2004-2017 for baseline endpoint adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, to the ITT analyses, the investigators will measure intervention effects&#xD;
      adjusted for non-compliance using instrumental variable (IV) approaches&#xD;
