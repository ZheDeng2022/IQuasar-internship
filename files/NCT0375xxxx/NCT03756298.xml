  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients who received neoadjuvant therapy for TNBC prior to surgery&#xD;
      and did not get pCR. Given the relatively poor prognosis for these patients, this population&#xD;
      is considered novel therapeutic as adjuvant treatment. Currently, capecitabine monotherapy&#xD;
      could be beneficial to this group of patients according to CREATE-X trial results. The&#xD;
      investigators are addressing the effect of anti-PD-L1, atezolizumab combined with&#xD;
      capecitabine in patients with TNBC who did not get pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      compared to capecitabine monotherapy.&#xD;
