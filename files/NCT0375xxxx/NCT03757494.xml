  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study that will look at how well a treatment called Cranial Electrotherapy&#xD;
      Stimulation (CES) works for patients who struggle with symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress&#xD;
      Disorder. Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation is delivered using a device called Alpha-Stim®.&#xD;
      This is a safe, non-invasive treatment that applies a low-level pulsed electric current&#xD;
      through the brain using clip-on electrodes attached to the earlobes. Cranial Electrotherapy&#xD;
      Stimulation treats conditions such as physical pain, anxiety, and depression.&#xD;

    <description>We will deem the treatment feasible if ≥ 6 participants complete the protocol, based on completion of ≥ 60% treatments (3 out of 5 treatment days, weekly at home), and attending and completing ≥ 75% of the weekly assessments, including the week 1 baseline and week 4 treatment completion visit</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability, we expect this treatment to be safe, based on the very few adverse events and no serious adverse events in the literature and relative safety when compared to current pharmacologic treatments (e.g., SSRIs and SNRIs) for PTSD.</description>

    <description>Efficacy, while the study isn't powered for an efficacy trial, the initial screening to baseline pretreatment to post-treatment change in the magnitude of change in PTSD symptoms (as measured by the PCL-5) during Alpha-Stim® treatment using paired t-tests can be used to determine sample size and power calculations for future studies.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. To ensure participants can safely receive Alpha-Stim®, eligible participants must meet&#xD;
             all established screening criteria for safety during Alpha-Stim® using a safety&#xD;
             screener (as assessed during phone screen and medical records review). We are&#xD;
             screening to access for metal. These are conservative measures require a patient not&#xD;
             having the following (unless MRI-safe): Cardiac pacemaker, implanted device (deep&#xD;
             brain stimulation) or metal in the brain, cervical spinal cord, or upper thoracic&#xD;
             spinal cord. The patient would additionally be required to not have an implanted&#xD;
             cardiac defibrillator;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Outpatients 18-70 years of age (inclusive);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Meet DSM-V criteria for PTSD (acute or chronic) at the time of the screening and/or&#xD;
             baseline visit; symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a baseline score of &quot;Moderately Ill&quot; or worse on the CGI-S;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be on a stable psychotropic regimen for at least 6 weeks prior to baseline, or no&#xD;
             psychotropic medication at all (for at least 6 weeks prior to baseline), and be&#xD;
             willing to maintain the current regimen and dosing for the duration of the study&#xD;
             (unless medically necessary to make changes with notification of research staff);&#xD;

        with all study related procedures and visits; (9) Be capable of independently reading and&#xD;
        understanding patient information materials and giving written informed consent.&#xD;
