  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the abuse potential of single doses of&#xD;
      cebranopadol (GRT6005) relative to hydromorphone (immediate-release formulation [IR] and&#xD;
      placebo in 48 non-dependent recreational opioid users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives were to evaluate the abuse potential of hydromorphone IR compared to&#xD;
      placebo (trial validation), to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single doses of&#xD;
      cebranopadol (200, 400, and 800 micrograms), and to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      cebranopadol and optionally some of its metabolites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study comprised an Enrollment Visit, a Qualification Phase, a Treatment Phase with 7&#xD;
      double-blind treatment periods for each participant, and a Final Examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Qualification Phase, all participants completed a naloxone challenge test to confirm&#xD;
      that they were not opioid-dependent. The Objective Opioid Withdrawal Scale was used to record&#xD;
      the signs or symptoms of withdrawal observed during the naloxone challenge test. Following&#xD;
      the naloxone challenge test, participants received a single oral dose of hydromorphone&#xD;
      immediate-release (IR) 12 milligrams (mg) and placebo in a double-blinded, randomized&#xD;
      crossover manner to ensure that they could discriminate between an active drug and placebo&#xD;
      and could tolerate hydromorphone IR 12 mg. After a washout phase of at least 3 days,&#xD;
      participants could continue with the Treatment Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Treatment Phase, each participant received single oral doses of the 7 different&#xD;
      investigational medicinal products (IMPs) (Treatment A to Treatment G) in 7 sequential&#xD;
      treatment periods. The treatment sequences per participant were randomly assigned, except for&#xD;
      one administration of placebo (Treatment G) which always followed the highest dose of&#xD;
      cebranopadol (Treatment C). Each IMP administration was given under fasted conditions and was&#xD;
      separated by a washout period of at least 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were confined to the study site from Day -1 until 48 hours after the first IMP&#xD;
      administration in the Qualification Phase and from Day -1 until 56 hours after the IMP&#xD;
      administration in the treatment periods. Pharmacodynamic assessments and blood sampling for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics were performed from pre-dose until 56 hours post-dose in each treatment&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Final Examination was conducted 5 days to 10 days after the discharge from the last&#xD;
      treatment period or upon early discontinuation from the study.&#xD;

Based on the assigned treatment sequence, each participant was randomly allocated to receive a single oral dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) in each of 7 periods. One administration of placebo (Treatment G) always followed cebranopadol 800 micrograms (Treatment C). Each IMP administration was given under fasted conditions and was separated by a washout period of at least 14 days.</intervention_model_description>

               -  For women of childbearing potential: A medically acceptable and highly effective&#xD;
                  method of birth control is defined as any form of contraception with a low&#xD;
                  failure rate defined as less than 1 percent per year. For example:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Hormonal contraceptives for at least 8 weeks prior to the Enrollment Visit&#xD;
