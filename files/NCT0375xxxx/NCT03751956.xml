  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the mass balance and biotransformation pathways of HSK3486&#xD;
      in healthy Chinese male subjects administered with a single intravenous dose of [14C]HSK3486,&#xD;
      so as to characterize the drug's general pharmacokinetics and safety in humans and provide&#xD;
      supportive data for reasonable use.&#xD;
