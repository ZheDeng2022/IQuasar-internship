      This is a prospective parallel non-blinded randomized study with two arms, an intervention&#xD;
      group and an active control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty healthy, but stressed nurses will be randomly assigned to either participate in a&#xD;
      6-week internet-based mindfulness meditation program produced by the Cleveland Clinic called&#xD;
      Stress Free Now for Healers or to listen to relaxing music for at least 5 minutes a day for 6&#xD;
      weeks, and pre-post comparisons will be made for RNA expression profiles, plasma cytokine&#xD;
      concentrations, telomerase activity, 6-point salivary cortisol and several self-reported&#xD;
      assessments of physical and mental health.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic psychological stress is becoming increasingly pervasive in modern society, with 59%&#xD;
      of working age adults who seek primary health care for any reason suffering from significant&#xD;
      levels of stress. With long work hours and every increasing demands, healthcare workers are&#xD;
      at an especially high risk of experiencing excessive amounts of stress, with over 50% of U.S.&#xD;
      physicians and 34% of nurses now reporting symptoms of burnout. Psychological stress has been&#xD;
      shown to have a variety of detrimental effects on the immune system, including an increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to infection, a diminished immune response to vaccines, reactivation of&#xD;
      chronic infections, and the development of chronic inflammation, which in turn is a&#xD;
      contributing factor to the development and exacerbation of a wide variety of chronic&#xD;
      conditions. Acute stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system, provoking the release of various hormones such as ACTH, cortisol,&#xD;
      and catecholamines, which in turn alter the functions of immune cells and generally lead to&#xD;
      increased production of inflammatory cytokines, including, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF-α .&#xD;
      The communication between the neuroendocrine system and the immune system is bidirectional as&#xD;
      cytokines also influence hormone production and the brain's response to stress. When&#xD;
      experienced acutely, this physiologic response is harmless. However, when the stress is&#xD;
      chronic it can lead to dysregulation of the immune system, setting the individual up for a&#xD;
      host of problems ranging from serious infections to chronic inflammatory diseases like&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, Alzheimer's and overall accelerated aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various strategies have been used to counteract both the psychological and physiological&#xD;
      effects of chronic stress including cognitive behavioral therapy, yoga, meditation,&#xD;
      biofeedback, and others. While all of these have shown benefits, meditation, in particular,&#xD;
      has recently gained widespread popularity as a simple and effective intervention for reducing&#xD;
      stress. An ancient practice associated with many religions and cultures in different forms,&#xD;
      meditation generally involves a calm and relaxed state of focus or concentration. Although&#xD;
      its purpose has historically been to help the practitioner gain spiritual insight and achieve&#xD;
      some form of enlightenment, it is now being studied as a way to improve mental and physical&#xD;
      health. The most extensively studied form of meditation in the medical literature is the&#xD;
      8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program developed by Jon Kabat Zinn, which&#xD;
      has been shown to benefit patients with a wide variety of mental and physical health&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One mechanism by which this and other forms of meditation are thought to exert their&#xD;
      beneficial effects is through their anti-inflammatory effects, affecting the immune system at&#xD;
      the cellular and molecular level. For example, a randomized controlled trial in older adults&#xD;
      that went through the 8-week MBSR course showed a more than 25% pre-post change in 143 genes,&#xD;
      including reduced activity of NF-kB target genes, relative to controls. But, similar changes&#xD;
      have been observed in less time-intensive programs. Just 12 minutes a day of Kirtan Kriya&#xD;
      Meditation for 8 weeks led to changes in 63 genes in a group of dementia caregivers compared&#xD;
      to those who only listened to relaxing music. The observed changes included downregulation of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines and NF-kB related transcripts as well as upregulation of&#xD;
      immunoglobulin-related transcripts and interferon response factors.Some changes may even&#xD;
      occur in as little as one day. Kaliman and colleagues showed that following an 8-hour&#xD;
      meditation retreat experienced meditators showed reduced expression of histone deacetylases,&#xD;
      global histone modifications, and downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes compared to a&#xD;
      group of non-meditators who spent the same time simply relaxing. A meta-analysis of&#xD;
      randomized trials has also shown consistently positive effects of meditation on immune cell&#xD;
      telomeres, which is a marker of immune cell aging. As Epel and colleagues recently showed,&#xD;
      many of these effects may be due to a non-specific relaxation response, especially in&#xD;
      novices.However, when Creswell and colleagues compared the changes in a group of stressed,&#xD;
      unemployed adults that went through either a 3-day meditation retreat or a 3-day relaxation&#xD;
      retreat at the same center, only the meditation group showed a sustained reduction in IL-6&#xD;
      that could be accounted for, in part, by connectivity changes within the brain.Two recent&#xD;
      papers have done an excellent job of summarizing the current knowledge regarding the&#xD;
      molecular signature associated with mind-body training, and the reader is referred to these&#xD;
      for a more detailed review of the topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite their effectiveness, a major limitation of MBSR and similar programs is a formidable&#xD;
      time commitment and a high dropout rate, limiting its utility as a practical intervention for&#xD;
      stress management in the population at large, especially busy healthcare workers. It would be&#xD;
      ideal to have a more scalable intervention which economizes on time, adapts to modern&#xD;
      lifestyles and is inexpensive. Accordingly, the Cleveland Clinic developed an online&#xD;
      mindfulness-based stress reduction program known as Stress Free Now. A 6-week program with&#xD;
      short daily online articles with tips and ideas for reducing stress and an accompanying app&#xD;
      with guided meditations, Stress Free Now is designed for the modern man or woman and capable&#xD;
      of reaching the masses. In 2013, a study showed that participants in this program experienced&#xD;
      significant stress reductions and improvement in other psychological measures compared to&#xD;
      controls. What remains to be answered is whether this program will exhibit biological effects&#xD;
      comparable to those seen with in-person interventions. This is the purpose of this project.&#xD;
      Using whole transcriptome sequencing and measurement of circulating cytokines, telomerase&#xD;
      activity, and diurnal cortisol rhythms the investigators plan to characterize the molecular&#xD;
      and immunological phenotype associated with participating in an internet-based mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation program. It is hypothesized that following participation in Stress Free Now for&#xD;
      Healers, participants will exhibit downregulation of pro-inflammatory gene pathways as well&#xD;
      as reduced circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, increased telomerase activity and&#xD;
      reduced, smoother diurnal cortisol patterns compared to controls. This knowledge would be&#xD;
      significant because it would provide, for the first time, mechanistic evidence of the&#xD;
      benefits of a brief, internet-based mindfulness-meditation program, supporting the&#xD;
      implementation this and similar programs into clinical practice. The present study will be a&#xD;
      prospective parallel non-blinded randomized study with two arms, an intervention group and an&#xD;
      active control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, 60 healthy healthcare workers will be randomly assigned to either participate in a&#xD;
      6-week internet-based mindfulness meditation program produced by the Cleveland Clinic called&#xD;
      Stress Free Now for Healers or to listen to relaxing music for at least 5 minutes a day for 6&#xD;
      weeks, and pre-post comparisons will be made for RNA expression profiles, plasma cytokine&#xD;
      concentrations, telomerase activity, 6-point salivary cortisol and several self-reported&#xD;
      assessments of physical and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 healthy, but stressed nurses will be enrolled in this study. After being&#xD;
      screened and providing consent to participate, all subjects will schedule an initial study&#xD;
      visit with the study coordinator at Cleveland Clinic Main Campus between the hours of 6 am&#xD;
      and 11 am. They will be asked to arrive to this visit having fasted for 8-12 hours prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 1: Upon arrival, the consent form will be reviewed and signed by both the&#xD;
      participant and the study coordinator, and a copy of the form will be provided to the&#xD;
      participant for his or her records. Any questions the participant has regarding the study&#xD;
      will also be answered at this time. The participant will then be asked a few questions&#xD;
      regarding his or her medical history and current medications. The participant will then be&#xD;
      asked to fill out several assessments regarding his or her mental, emotional and physical&#xD;
      health. The participant will then have 3, 10 mL tubes and 1, 2.5 mL tube of blood drawn,&#xD;
      after which the participant will be monitored for at least 5 minutes for signs of dizziness&#xD;
      or lightheadedness. During this time, the study coordinator will inform the participant of&#xD;
      his assignment and give instructions accordingly. If the participant has been assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention group, the study coordinator will help register him or her for the Stress Free&#xD;
      Now course and show him or her both how and where to access the website and download the app&#xD;
      on his or her phone. The participant will be instructed to begin the program the day of his&#xD;
      or her first study visit. If the participant has been assigned to the control group, the&#xD;
      study coordinator will show him or her how to access the relaxing music recordings and&#xD;
      instruct him or her to listen to one of the recordings for at least 5 minutes every day for&#xD;
      the next 6 weeks. The participants in the control group will have access to the Stress Free&#xD;
      Now course at no charge at the conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 2: The final study visit will be scheduled for a time between 6 am and 11 am&#xD;
      within one week of the conclusion of the 6-week period from initial study visit. The&#xD;
      participant will be again asked to fast for 8-12 hours prior to the study visit. Upon&#xD;
      arrival, the participant's medical history and medications will be reviewed for any changes,&#xD;
      and any questions the participant has will be answered. The participant will then be asked to&#xD;
      fill out the same assessments that were administered during the initial study visit. Again,&#xD;
      3, 10 mL tubes and 1, 2.5 mL tube of blood will be drawn and the participant will be&#xD;
      monitored for at least 5 minutes for signs of dizziness or lightheadedness. The participant&#xD;
      will then be thanked for participating in the study and provided with the agreed upon&#xD;
      compensation. The participant will also be told to look out for an email in 6 weeks with a&#xD;
      link to the same questionnaires the participant filled out in the first and last study&#xD;
      visits. If the participant does not complete the online questionnaires within 2 days of being&#xD;
      emailed the link, the participant will be sent an email reminder. Additional email reminders&#xD;
      will be sent 1 and 2 weeks after the original link was sent if the questionnaires have still&#xD;
      not been completed by these dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salivary cortisol/DHEA test: At both study visit 1 and 2 participants will be provided with&#xD;
      the Adrenocortex Stress Profile with Cortisol Awakening Response kit from Genova Diagnostics&#xD;
      free of charge and told to collect all samples the next day following the printed&#xD;
      instructions included in the kit. They will then ship the samples along with a requisition&#xD;
      form containing only their study ID number, the date and time to Genova Diagnostics according&#xD;
      to the instructions in the kit using the included prepaid shipping label. Once the samples&#xD;
      have been processed and analyzed, the results will be uploaded to a password-protected online&#xD;
      research account at gdx.net, to which only the principle and co-investigators will have&#xD;
      access. A MTA/Data Use agreement between the Cleveland Clinic and Genova Diagnostics is in&#xD;
      process and will be fully executed before the start of the study and the participants will be&#xD;
      informed that the data of this test will be shared with an outside company.&#xD;
