      Background and Objectives: The Thoracic Erector Spinae Plane Blockade (ESPB) is a regional&#xD;
      anesthesia technique recently described by Forero M in November 2016 , whereby local&#xD;
      anesthetic (LA) is injected in the inter Fascial space between posteriorly the fascia of&#xD;
      Erector Spinae Muscles (IFS-ESP) (the iliocostalis, longissimus, and spinalis muscles ) and&#xD;
      anteriorly the inter-transverse ligament to achieve multi-metameric analgesia for thoracic or&#xD;
      upper abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies published showed controversies on the spread of the local anesthetic and also&#xD;
      the clinical efficiency .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clarification of mechanism of the paravertebral block is one example for the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) in this context We therefore designed a&#xD;
      prospective study in volunteers to examine the spread of LA via MRI investigation in&#xD;
      correlation with the extent of somatic block after a standardized ultrasound (US) guided&#xD;
      ESPB. Our study will study the spread at T4 or T5 level which is the level used for most of&#xD;
      thoracic, cardiac and breast surgeries to determine if dye would spread anteriorly to the&#xD;
      involve or igins of the ventral and dorsal branches of the spinal nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ethical committee approval we will select 10 Healthy volunteers to perform Unilateral&#xD;
      ESP single shot block with a very low dose of Local anesthetic (LA) (Ropivacaine 0.5% 1 mg/kg&#xD;
      (Maximal dose recommended = 3 mg/kg ) mixed with 0,1ml gadolinium After injection an&#xD;
      ultrasound image of the spread of the LA with an easy 3 Dimension will be acquired. 10 and 30&#xD;
      minutes after injection a MRI will be performed to analyze the ultrasound spread. An&#xD;
      Evaluation of the extension of Sensory Blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be kept under monitoring for 1,5 hours to assess any complication Sensory block&#xD;
      will be assessed. At 1 week after the study day, all volunteers will undergo an investigation&#xD;
      of the puncture sites to exclude puncture- related infection or hematoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be done The cranio-caudal spread of LA will be recorded (US + MRI)&#xD;
      and described for each of the volunteers.&#xD;

      Screening Visit Ten healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 45 year olds Will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. Prior to inclusion in the study, we informed them about the nature, scope, and the&#xD;
      procedures of the study and about the particular study-related risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anatomical abnormalities of the thoracic spine identified by physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body mass index ≥30 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical contra-indication for Conscious MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Claustrophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Metal implants (pacemaker and others)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity against Ropivacaine or other amino-amide LAs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in another clinical study within the last 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coagulopathies in the medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormalities in electrocardiography that are considered clinically relevant such as&#xD;
           atrio-ventricular block or bradycardia After signing the informed consent, each&#xD;
           volunteer will go under a general physical examination, including patient history and&#xD;
           drawing of blood for the laboratory (red and white blood count, and standard blood&#xD;
           coagulation parameters).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, an electrocardiogram as well as determination of blood pressure and heart rate&#xD;
      will be performed. when all inclusion criteria will be met, a bilateral cross-sectional&#xD;
      ultrasound examination of the IFS-ESP at the thoracic 4 (T4) level will be performed to&#xD;
      confirm a clear identification of the ultrasound landmarks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transverse process T4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anterior fascia of Erector Spinae Muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inter-transverse ligament The T4 level will be determined by counting the spinous&#xD;
           processes from the seventh cervical vertebra (vertebra prominens) in a distal direction.&#xD;
           The screening visit took place within 3 weeks before study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided ESPB and MRI Investigation On the morning of study, the volunteers will be&#xD;
      admitted to the clinical ward. A venous access will be inserted into an antecubital vein and&#xD;
      standard cardiorespiratory monitoring will be established (electrocardiogram, noninvasive&#xD;
      blood pressure, and Spo2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound-guided injection of LA inside the IFS-ESP will be performed under direct&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance using a ultrasound system (Logic S8 GE healthcare ultrasound) with a&#xD;
      50-mm 7-15 MHz linear ultrasound transducer in a para sagittal lateral position with the&#xD;
      scheduled blocking area above. The IFS-ESP will be visualized as our group is performing at&#xD;
      the level of T4 transverse process (See Bellow Performance protocole in Images) The puncture&#xD;
      area and the ultrasound probe will be prepared in a sterile manner, and a skin wheal was&#xD;
      performed with 1 ml lidocaine 2%. Then, the puncture will be performed with a 21-G, 80-mm&#xD;
      Facette tip needle and an injection line (Stimuplex D Plus, 0.71 Å~ 80 mm, 22G Å~ 3 ⅛ ,&quot;&#xD;
      BBraun Melsungen AG) realizing an &quot;in-plane&quot; ultrasound guided technique. Once the tip of the&#xD;
      needle was placed inside the IFS-ESP, 2 ml dextrose will be injected checking the caudal and&#xD;
      cranial spread and also the &quot;breathing sign&quot;. (See protocol of puncture bellow). After these&#xD;
      safety tests performed : local anesthetic Ropivacaine 0.5% mixed with 0,1ml gadolinium will&#xD;
      be injected as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient 40 to 49 kg = 8 mL= 40 mg of ropivacaine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient 50 to 59 kg = 10 mL = 50 mg of ropivacaine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient 60 to 69 kg = 12 mL = 60 mg of ropivacaine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient over 70 Kg = 15 mL = 75 mg of ropivacaine Maximum dose of Ropivacaine = 3 mg/kg&#xD;
           (International recommendations and manufacturer recommendation) After the injection of&#xD;
           LA a manual 3D acquisition will be done ( GE easy 3D Software) will do recorded to&#xD;
           visualize the spread of LA inside the IFS-ESP, then an MRI will be performed 10 minutes&#xD;
           and 30 minutes after injection using a 3-Tesla unit, long spine coil, covering the whole&#xD;
           spine. T2-weighted sequences will be performed in sagittal and coronal planes. Axial&#xD;
           T2-weighted sequences with fat suppression will be added in the region of the fluid&#xD;
           accumulation. Axial T1-weighted sequences in this region will be performed to identify&#xD;
           or exclude hemorrhagic components. Slice thickness will be 3 mm. During MRI&#xD;
           investigation, the volunteers will be monitored via the MRI Bluetooth monitoring system&#xD;
           (Spo2 , electrocardiogram). The distribution pattern of LA inside the IFS-ESP will be&#xD;
           evaluated by analyses of the T2-weighted, fluid-sensitive images. Starting at the T4&#xD;
           puncture level, the axial T2-weighted sequences will be analyzed in a cranial and caudal&#xD;
           direction to evaluate the cranio-caudal spread of LA. Any distribution of LA outside the&#xD;
           IFS-ESP : ventral to the inter-transverse ligament, epidural, paravertebral&#xD;
           prevertebral, and contralateral) will be analyzed. All images will be investigated by&#xD;
           the same radiologist Evaluation of Sensory Blockade Sensory block will be assessed by&#xD;
           pinprick testing with 22-G short bevel needles in comparison with the contralateral&#xD;
           dermatomes. The blocked area will be tested from the T1 dermatome at the anterior&#xD;
           axillary line and at the parasternal space in a cranial and then in a caudal direction.&#xD;
           If required, the C2-5 dermatomes will be tested at the neck. Each individual dermatome&#xD;
           on the blocked side will be compared with the contralateral side. All assessments will&#xD;
           be performed by one investigator. Assessments will be quantified with the following&#xD;
           scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0 =full feeling)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 = reduced&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 = No feeling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory scores will be evaluated at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior block&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 min after block before second MRI investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  60 min after block&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  120 min after block&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 h after the block to check the full recovery Successful blockade in a specific&#xD;
           dermatome will be defined when pinprick testing will be positive value = 2. Onset and&#xD;
           duration of ESPB will be not evaluated, as this study is designed to investigate the&#xD;
           spread of LA within the ESPB. The expansion of the ESPB will be investigated&#xD;
           meticulously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation after Injection of LA Inside the IFS-ESP The volunteers will be observed and&#xD;
      monitored (Spo2, electrocardiogram, and noninvasive blood pressure) 3 h after performance of&#xD;
      ESPB and discharged after that time. A dedicated study emergency telephone number will be&#xD;
      provided in cases of any medical problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of Side Effects Decrease in heart rate and blood pressure ≥30% from initial values&#xD;
      will be treated with 0.01 mg/kg glycorpyrrolate and repetitive doses of 2 mg etilefrine,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any sign of toxicity by IV injection = LAST protocol with intra-lipid 20% and keep in closed&#xD;
      observation for 12 hours (ASRA recommendation) Follow-up Investigation At 1 week after the&#xD;
      study day, all volunteers will undergo an investigation of the puncture sites to exclude&#xD;
      puncture- related infection or hematoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The cranio-caudal spread of LA will be recorded and described for each&#xD;
      of the volunteers. Due to not-normally distributed nature of the data, we will use a&#xD;
      one-tailed Wilcoxon test to compare the cranial versus the caudal spread of LA at the same&#xD;
      side. Pearson correlation coefficient will be used to correlate the spread of LA with the&#xD;
      sensory distribution of ESPB Data will be presented as median (interquartile range). A P &lt;&#xD;
      0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. SPSS 17.0.1 will be used as statistical&#xD;
      software (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY).&#xD;
