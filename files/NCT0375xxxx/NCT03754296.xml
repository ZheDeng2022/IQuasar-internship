      The TRUST study is a non-interventional, prospective, multicenter, international, single arm&#xD;
      and non-inferiority study. It is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mechanical&#xD;
      thrombectomy of the CATCHVIEW device compared to SOLITAIRE 2/FR based on an objective&#xD;
      performance criterion (OPC) defined with available and published clinical evidence gathered&#xD;
      through the Solitaire clinical trials in the arterial revascularization of patients with&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;

        Patients with acute onset of stroke symptoms leading to significant clinical deficit in the&#xD;
        setting of an angiographically proven occlusion of a proximal intracranial artery&#xD;
        (intracranial internal carotid, middle cerebral M1 and/or M2 segments, carotid terminus or&#xD;
        tandem proximal ICA/MCA-M1) who could have endovascular therapy (defined as the first pass&#xD;
        with assigned study device) started within 8h of onset of stroke symptoms will be eligible&#xD;
        for the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical signs consistent with acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-stroke modified Rankin Score ≤ 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient able to be treated within 8 hours of onset of stroke symptoms and within 2&#xD;
             hours between qualifying imaging from CTA or MRA to groin puncture&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initial NIHSS ≥ 6 and &lt; 30 at the time of inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Arterial occlusion in the intracranial internal carotid, M1/M2 segment of the MCA,&#xD;
             carotid terminus or tandem proximal ICA/MCA-M1 confirmed by CT or MR angiography that&#xD;
             is accessible to the device&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute ischemic stroke where patient is ineligible for IV thrombolytic treatment or the&#xD;
             treatment is contraindicated (e.g., patient presents beyond recommended time from&#xD;
             symptom onset), or where patient has received IV thrombolytic therapy without partial&#xD;
             or complete recanalization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary use of the CATCHVIEW stent retriever for the procedure (decision of use is&#xD;
             done independently and prior to the participation of the patient in the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of the patient or legally authorized representative to provide a signed and&#xD;
             dated informed consent form before the procedure. Where applicable, in case of medical&#xD;
             emergency not allowing the patient to provide consent and unavailability of the&#xD;
             legally authorized representative, a physician who does not take part in the study&#xD;
             will sign the informed consent before the procedure. In any case, the patient or the&#xD;
             legally authorized representative consent shall be requested as soon as possible after&#xD;
             the procedure up until the discharge visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinical exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical presentation suggests a subarachnoid hemorrhage, even if initial CT or MRI&#xD;
             scan is normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspicion of aortic dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with a co-morbid disease or condition that would confound the neurological and&#xD;
             functional evaluations or compromise survival or ability to complete follow-up&#xD;
             assessments within 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of other arterial disease that would prevent the device from reaching&#xD;
             the target vessel and/or preclude safe recovery of the device&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who requires hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, or who have contraindication&#xD;
             to an angiogram for whatever reason&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious sensitivity to radiographic contrast agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sensitivity to nickel-titanium&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with stenosis proximal to the thrombus site that may preclude safe recovery of&#xD;
             the device&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to reach the occlusion site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hemorrhagic diathesis, coagulation factor deficiency, or oral anticoagulant&#xD;
             therapy with INR&gt;3.0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in an interventional investigation drug or device treatment&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
        Imaging exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline non-contrast CT or DWI MRI evidence of a moderate/large core deﬁned as&#xD;
             extensive early ischemic changes of Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (ASPECTS) &lt;&#xD;
             6&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Imaging evidence that suggests, in the opinion of the Investigator, the patient is not&#xD;
             appropriate for mechanical thrombectomy intervention (e.g. inability to navigate to&#xD;
             target lesion, moderate/large infarct with poor collateral circulation, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CT or MRI evidence of hemorrhage on presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CT or MRI evidence of mass effect or intra-cranial tumour (except small meningioma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Imaging evidence of cerebral vasculitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CT or MRI showing an infarction core involving greater than 1/3 of the MCA territory&#xD;
             (or in other territories &gt; 100 cc of tissue) on presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CT or MRI evidence of a basilar artery (BA) occlusion or posterior cerebral artery&#xD;
