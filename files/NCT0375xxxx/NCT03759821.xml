  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the independent and combined effectiveness of engaging both&#xD;
      mothers and fathers in bundled parenting and nutrition behavior change packages on early&#xD;
      child nutrition and development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The overall aim of EFFECTS is to develop, implement, and evaluate nutrition and parenting&#xD;
      interventions that will be delivered by community health workers in the Mara region of&#xD;
      Tanzania. We will use a 2x2 factorial cluster randomized controlled study design, plus a&#xD;
      local standard of care control group, to evaluate the effectiveness of EFFECTS on the primary&#xD;
      outcomes of early child nutrition and development. In total, there will be five study arms:&#xD;
      nutrition intervention with mothers, nutrition intervention with mothers and fathers, bundled&#xD;
      nutrition and parenting intervention with mothers, bundled nutrition and parenting&#xD;
      intervention with mothers and fathers, and a local standard of care control. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that an intervention approach that engages fathers will benefit the primary outcomes; a&#xD;
      bundled nutrition and parenting package will benefit the same primary outcomes; and that the&#xD;
      combined intervention approach - that both engages fathers and bundles nutrition and&#xD;
      parenting messages - will have additive benefits on the primary outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Eighty villages in the Mara region of Tanzania will be randomly selected and randomly allocated with equal probability and in equal numbers to one of the five EFFECTS study arms. In each participating village, one sub village will be randomly selected with equal probability, and a sampling frame of all households in that sub village will be created with the help of local leaders. Households will be selected from this sampling frame using simple random sampling. The selected households will be listed in random order and visited by study staff, who will assess whether a household meets all inclusion criteria and provides informed consent. Households will be visited until 12 households are enrolled in each village. If not enough eligible households are found, additional households will be selected using the same procedure from the nearest sub village in the same village.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in early child development</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition is used to assess cognitive, language, and motor development. Each domain of development is reported separately.

    <measure>Responsive feeding practices</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Responsive feeding was measured among mothers using a maternal-reported scale. Each item is scored on 4-point Likert scale: 0 = never, 1 = sometimes, 2 = often, and 3 = always. Negatively worded items were reverse scored.

Each item was scored on a 4-point frequency scale (0=never, 1=once or twice a week, 2=multiple times a week, and 3=every day or nearly every day) and summed for a total score. Higher scores represent more frequent engagement in stimulation.</description>

For each of the 12 items on the scale, women and men will report their level of agreement scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). The items are summarized to generate a total score ranging from 12 to 60 or a standardized z-score.

Smaller differences in time spent between men and women indicate greater gender equity at household level.</description>

    <measure>Intimate partner violence (IPV)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mothers' experience of intimate partner violence will be measured based on self-reported experiences of physical, emotional, and/or sexual violence by their male partner in the past 3 months. These questions come from IPV questionnaire in the domestic violence module of the Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys. Maternal victimization of IPV will be analyzed according to four classifications: (1) any type of violence; (2) any physical violence; (3) any emotional violence; and (4) any sexual violence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parenting stress</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Parental Distress subscale of the Parenting Stress Index questionnaire was used with both mothers and fathers. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale. Applicable items will be reverse-coded, such that the highest response option=4 is in the direction of more parenting stress and response option=1 is reflective of minimal/no parenting stress. Total scores will be calculated for the Parental Distress subscale. Higher scores indicate greater parenting stress.</description>

Group sessions will last between 1.5-2 hours and groups will meet biweekly for a period of 12 months. Due to the COVID pandemic, group sessions were paused for three months (March-June 2020). The intervention resumed in July 2020 with delivery via home visits rather than peer groups, and concluded in September 2020.</description>
