  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Neonatal sepsis is a major contributor to global under five mortality. In&#xD;
      developing countries a major proportion of neonatal sepsis is thought to emanate from the&#xD;
      healthcare setting, due to challenges in infection prevention practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To study the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and evaluate the effect of multimodal&#xD;
      infection control interventions on the incidence of neonatal sepsis; and colonization by&#xD;
      multidrug resistant Gram negative bacteria (MDRGNB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A controlled before and after interventional trial comprising a 7 month pre-&#xD;
      intervention phase, 5 month intervention phase and 7 month post-intervention phase. Neonates&#xD;
      admitted at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) will&#xD;
      be enrolled prospectively and followed up for diagnosis of sepsis and outcome of admission.&#xD;
      This will be used to describe the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis. Swabs will be collected&#xD;
      from a subpopulation of included neonates at intervention site (KBTH) and control site (37&#xD;
      Military Hospital) NICUs to assess colonization of neonates with MDRGNB. Environmental swabs&#xD;
      will be collected from surfaces at the NICU to assess MDRGNB contamination of the&#xD;
      environment. The intervention comprises infection prevention strategies including&#xD;
      implementation of the WHO multimodal hand hygiene strategy. The primary endpoint is incidence&#xD;
      of neonatal sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcome: This study will contribute to improved infection prevention practices in&#xD;
      the participating NICUs and highlight lessons which other national and regional NICUs may&#xD;
      learn from.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background In 2012, it was estimated that approximately 680,000 neonatal deaths in developing&#xD;
      countries were due to bacterial infections, with an incidence risk of 7.6% and a case&#xD;
      fatality risk of 9.8. A major proportion of neonatal infections are expected to be&#xD;
      health-care associated, due to inadequate infrastructure and resources for infection control&#xD;
      and prevention. Hospital acquired infections(HAIs) are associated with multi-drug resistant&#xD;
      (MDR) bacteria, which increases the risk of therapeutic failure due to the limited choice of&#xD;
      available antibiotics. HAIs also lead to extended duration of admission, increased medical&#xD;
      costs, morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transmission of MDR bacteria in the hospital environment is thought to be due to unhygienic&#xD;
      practices which occur during clinical invasive procedures, (e.g. artificial ventilation,&#xD;
      catheter and intravenous line insertion). Neonatal infections may also be due to invasion by&#xD;
      colonizing bacteria of the neonate, usually originating from maternal and environmental&#xD;
      flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the WHO, 50% of HAIs are preventable through implementation of infection control&#xD;
      practices. The WHO has instituted a multimodal hand hygiene strategy that has been found to&#xD;
      improve hand hygiene compliance and reduce the prevalence of HAIs. However, the effectiveness&#xD;
      of this strategy in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with high risk of colonization with&#xD;
      environmental bacteria has not been studied. In fact, most studies that have examined the&#xD;
      potential sources and mode of transmission of organisms that cause neonatal sepsis have been&#xD;
      conducted in well-resourced countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that the hospital environment serves as a source of MDR Gram&#xD;
      negative bacteria responsible for neonatal colonization and sepsis among patients admitted at&#xD;
      the NICU of the KBTH; and that implementation of the multimodal hand hygiene strategy will&#xD;
      lead to a reduction in the incidence of neonatal sepsis and colonization by MDR Gram negative&#xD;
      bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To determine the impact of multi-modal infection control interventions on the&#xD;
      incidence of neonatal sepsis and colonization by MDR Gram negative bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method This study will evaluate the impact of WHO multimodal hand hygiene strategy on the&#xD;
      incidence of neonatal sepsis and neonatal colonization by MDR Gram negative bacteria as well&#xD;
      as pilot surveillance of neonatal sepsis at the participating sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting: Data will be collected at the NICU of the KBTH and the 37 Military Hospital,&#xD;
      Accra, Ghana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The study will be a controlled before and after interventional trial with one&#xD;
      interventional site (KBTH) and a control site (37 Military hospital). Data will be collected&#xD;
      over 19 months with a baseline phase of 7 months; an interventional phase of 5 months; and a&#xD;
      post intervention phase of 7 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The WHO multimodal hand hygiene strategy comprises five essential elements;&#xD;
      system change-availability of alcohol-based hand rub at the point of care and/ or access to&#xD;
      safe continuous water supply and soap and towels; training and education of healthcare&#xD;
      professionals; monitoring of hand hygiene practices and performance feedback; reminders in&#xD;
      the workplace; and the creation of a handhygiene safety culture with the participation of&#xD;
      both individual healthcare workers and senior hospital managers.&#xD;
