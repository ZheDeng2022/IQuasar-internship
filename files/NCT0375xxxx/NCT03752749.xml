    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the effects of mild acute intermittent hypoxia&#xD;
      (AIH) in combination with an anti-inflammatory drug (i.e. prednisolone) on motor performance&#xD;
      in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Spinal cord lesion at the level of C4 or below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Incomplete spinal cord injury ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) Impairment&#xD;
             Scale classification C or D. ASIA C or D classification requires that individuals have&#xD;
             detectable motor function below the level of spinal injury and have preserved&#xD;
             sensation of the sacral segments S4-S5 (anal sphincter).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age between 18 and 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically stable with medical clearance to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SCI due to non-progressive etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than 6 months since initial SCI. We plan to choose subjects greater that six&#xD;
             months post-injury, to ensure minimal confounding effects of spontaneous neurological&#xD;
             recovery during the experiments. This will mean that changes in motor performance are&#xD;
             due to the interventions associated with the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have active and passive ROM at the ankle from 10 degrees dorsiflexion to&#xD;
             30 degrees plantar flexion, 0 to 120 degrees of knee flexion, 90 degrees of hip&#xD;
             flexion, and 10 degrees of hip extension in order to be positioned correctly for motor&#xD;
             performance testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of severe medical illness, including cardiac disease, uncontrolled high blood&#xD;
             pressure, restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease, significant osteoporosis or&#xD;
             history of fracture following SCI, or history of lower limb peripheral nerve injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, unhealed decubitus ulcers, active&#xD;
             heterotopic ossification, rheumatologic disease or inflammatory arthritis, presence of&#xD;
             a deep venous thrombosis, cancer, or active infection will be excluded, as these&#xD;
             conditions can cause systemic inflammation independent of spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with tracheostomy, asthma, or recent or current pulmonary infection will&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing will be excluded, as the potential effects of&#xD;
             intermittent hypoxia on pregnant women and fetus are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will also be excluded if they are currently taking NSAIDs, steroids, or&#xD;
             disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Participation is allowed if the&#xD;
             subject and his/her physician agree to suspend all NSAIDs for a minimum of a 14-day&#xD;
             washout period prior to study evaluation and for the duration of the study.&#xD;
             Individuals taking oral steroids, DMARDs will be excluded from the study due to the&#xD;
             potential risks of abruptly discontinuing these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals will be excluded if they have a history of severe adverse reaction or&#xD;
             allergic response to prednisolone in the past, history of stomach or intestinal&#xD;
             ulcers, bleeding problems, chronic kidney disease, drink more than 3 alcoholic&#xD;
             beverages per day, or are currently taking blood thinners. Excluding these individuals&#xD;
             will limit the potential for having an adverse reaction to the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
             administered in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals receiving intrathecal baclofen will be excluded. Individuals prescribed&#xD;
             medications other than intrathecal baclofen for alleviation of spastic motor behaviors&#xD;
             will be excluded unless both the subject and his/her physician agree to cease all such&#xD;
             medications for a 14-day minimum washout period prior to participation and for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals will be excluded if they are taking antifungal ointments, estradiols or&#xD;
             estrogens, rifampin, phenytoin, barbiturates or bupropion as these drugs can potential&#xD;
             interact with prednisolone. See &quot;concomitant medications&quot; section below.&#xD;
