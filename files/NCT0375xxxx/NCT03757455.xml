    <textblock>
      In the study, the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program is applied to total&#xD;
      pancreatectomy (TP) and low-risk pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) patients identified by a small&#xD;
      number of acinar cells in the cut edge of the pancreas. The research setting is randomized&#xD;
      and controlled. All patients arriving at the Tampere University Hospital (TAUH) for PD or TP&#xD;
      surgery are recruited into the study. Recruited patients are randomized to the ERAS protocol&#xD;
      and to the standard protocol recovery program. The ERAS program differs from the normal care&#xD;
      protocol preoperatively, intraoperatively and postoperatively as explained in the following&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ERAS protocol, both on the previous day of the surgery and on the following days, the&#xD;
      patient is discussed with the patient about the benefits of the protocol used and the&#xD;
      recovery program objectives. The purpose is to motivate and encourage the patient. On the day&#xD;
      of surgery, the patient's intake of food and fluids is allowed to be closer to the surgery&#xD;
      and the patient is also given a carbohydrate drink two hours before surgery. The nasogastric&#xD;
      tube set at the beginning of surgery is removed at the end of the surgery and peripancreatic&#xD;
      or perihepatic drains are not routinely placed. After surgery, drinking is allowed after four&#xD;
      hours and the patient is encouraged to move as actively as possible in the bed. On the first&#xD;
      and second postoperative day, the patient is allowed to enjoy normal food and drink according&#xD;
      to his or her ability, and pancreatic capsules are given in the course of food. Additionally,&#xD;
      the analgesic to be administered through the epidural cannula is dosed as far as possible to&#xD;
      allow mobilization of the patient. The discussion on the benefits and recovery targets of the&#xD;
      ERAS protocol are continued. On the third postoperative day, the epidural infusion is&#xD;
      discontinued and the pain medication is moved to opioid-based pain management. This is&#xD;
      continued until specific criteria for passing to the follow-up care are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typical complications (pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, postpancreatectomy&#xD;
      hemorrhage) are registered during hospitalization and their severity ratings according to&#xD;
      ISGPS, ISPGF and Clavien-Dindo classifications are also determined. Other variables&#xD;
      registered are the number of intensive care days, situations requiring new surgeries, 30 and&#xD;
      90 day mortality, the completion time of the criteria for passing to follow up care, and the&#xD;
      total length of hospitalization. In addition, the need for readmissions is registered. The&#xD;
      implementation of the ERAS protocol is followed by a separate tracking template, in which the&#xD;
      nurses record the progress of the goals specified in the protocol on a daily basis. The&#xD;
      results of the study are analyzed with the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;

      In the study, the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program is applied to total&#xD;
      pancreatectomy (TP) and low-risk pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) patients identified by a small&#xD;
      number of acinar cells in the cut edge of the pancreas. The research setting is randomized&#xD;
      and controlled. All patients arriving at the Tampere University Hospital (TAUH) for PD or TP&#xD;
      surgery are recruited into the study. Patients will be sent a handout of the study along with&#xD;
      the letter of invitation for the surgery itself. Recruitment takes place at the first&#xD;
      appointment of the surgery where the surgeon presents the study to the patient. If the&#xD;
      patient wishes to participate in the study, the patient issues a signature on the consent&#xD;
      form. They are randomized to this ERAS program for shortened recovery period and a standard&#xD;
      protocol recovery program. Allocation to the groups takes place using opaque envelope-coded&#xD;
      randomization codes. The research nurse prepares the envelopes in twelve patient&#xD;
      randomization blocs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the low risk PD-patients recruited, the pathologial sample of the cut-edge of&#xD;
      the pancreas is analyzed by pathologist during the surgery. If the pancreatic cut-edge&#xD;
      contains less than 40% acinar cells, the patients is considered low risk patient. This method&#xD;
      is based on earlier studies in our pancreatic research group. All TP patients are per se in&#xD;
      the small complication risk group. Only those patients with a low risk of complications&#xD;
      continue to be involved in the study in standardized or ERAS protocol groups according to the&#xD;
      original allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERAS protocol consist of following actions in comparison to standard protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Pain management by epidural cannula at the level to make mobilization possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discussion of the ERAS protocol (objectives, benefits, time of passing to follow up&#xD;
           care) (also continues on the following days) and encouragement&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Pancreatin capsules per os before eating, 25,000 IU 1-2 capsules on big meals and 1 on&#xD;

      - Mobilization: As much as possible, autonomous movement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative day 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ending epidural infusion, cannula removal later if p.o. medication is sufficient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As independent as possible&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Support and encouragement continues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain management at a level that allows mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passing to follow up care when following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The patient should be able to enjoy at least two meals without significant nausea&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Bowel movements returned&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The patient should be able to move, urinate, and perform daily operations at&#xD;
                pre-operative level&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The patient does not need strong analgesics when moving&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate should be in the&#xD;
                reference range or pre-cut level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. The patient has no signs of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain medication changes to tramadol 100 mg three times a day when discharged&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all those involved in the study, PD's surgery technique is standardized to classic&#xD;
      Whipple surgery, submersion bowel-pancreatic seam, antecholic gastro-jejunostomy and&#xD;
      entero-entero anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is left out of the study if a patient is undergoing another surgery than PD, TP&#xD;
      or does not undergo surgery at all. Likewise, the study is suspended from the consideration&#xD;
      of the surgeon if, for any other reason, the patient may be expected to be a high&#xD;
      complication risk patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typical complications (pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, postpancreatectomy&#xD;
      hemorrhage) are registered during hospitalization and their severity ratings according to&#xD;
      ISGPS, ISPGF and Clavien-Dindo classifications are also determined. Other variables&#xD;
      registered are the number of intensive care days, situations requiring new surgeries, 30 and&#xD;
      90 day mortality, the completion time of the criteria for passing to follow up care, and the&#xD;
      total length of hospitalization. In addition, the need for readmissions is registered. The&#xD;
      implementation of the ERAS protocol is followed by a separate tracking template, in which the&#xD;
      nurses record the progress of the goals specified in the protocol on a daily basis. The&#xD;
      results of the study are analyzed with the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main variable of the study is the treatment period at the university hospital. The side&#xD;
      variables are the total treatment time, the total amount of complications, and the number of&#xD;
      readmissions. The hypothesis is that recovery is faster in the ERAS group, but the occurrence&#xD;
      of complications and readmissions are the same in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistical power calculation, assuming 80% statistical power (1-β) and 5% significance&#xD;
      level (α), was carried out with a continuous outcome superiority trial. The sample size was&#xD;
      calculated using the main coefficient of variation assuming that in the standard protocolled&#xD;
      patients the median of the discharge time is nine days and in the ERAS program for seven&#xD;
      days, i.e. a presumption of approximately 20% decrease in treatment days. Three days were&#xD;
      assumed to be the standard deviation. The sample size thus obtained is 36 per group, which is&#xD;
      rounded up to approximately 80 patients in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When evaluating the time spent collecting the data, it is assumed that 20% of the patients&#xD;
      will drop out of the study for various reasons. In TAUH, approximately 100 PDs and 15 TP&#xD;
      patients are operated in two years and approximately 70% of patients of PD are in a low risk&#xD;
      of complications. Consequently, the number of patients to be collected in two years would be&#xD;
      approximately 0.7 ∙ 0.8 ∙ 100 + 0.8 ∙ 15 ≈ 68, which is almost sufficient for the purpose of&#xD;
      this study to achieve statistical significance. The estimated duration of the study is&#xD;
      therefore little more than two years. However, the study will be continued as long as&#xD;
      necessary to collect the required number of patients. When half of the final number of&#xD;
      patients has been collected, an interim analysis is made of the differences in the groups. If&#xD;
      the results of the ERAS protocol are at least as good as the standard group, the study will&#xD;
      be continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recruited patients are asked for written consent for participation in the study. The&#xD;
      research file is stored in the TAUH research register. Patient information and research&#xD;
      results are treated confidentially in the manner required by the Finnish Personal Data Act.&#xD;
      The final research results are reported at group level and the identification of individual&#xD;
      investigators is not possible. The research funding is provided by the Tampereen Pancreatic&#xD;
      Research Group the largest funders being the State Research Fund and Sigrid Jusélius&#xD;
      Foundation. Also Finnish Medicine Foundation in providing personal funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Tampere University Hospital.&#xD;
      The earlier ERAS studies have shown that their use is safe and in most cases beneficial to&#xD;
      the patient. In this study, it is novel that only small complication risk patients are&#xD;
      included in the study. In addition, halfway between the research is performed an interim&#xD;
      analysis to ensure the safety of the ERAS protocol. Patient's own consent is asked before&#xD;
      surgery, and information on the research is provided within the limits of the success of the&#xD;
      study. Patient's refusal or suspension of study does not affect the patient's treatment in&#xD;
      any way.&#xD;
