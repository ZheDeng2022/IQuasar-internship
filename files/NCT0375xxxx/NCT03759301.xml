      The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of adjuvant growth hormone&#xD;
      injection during controlled ovarian stimulation, in poor responder women undergoing&#xD;
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedures.&#xD;

      Infertility is defined as the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more&#xD;
      of regular unprotected sexual intercourse (and there is no other reason, such as&#xD;
      breastfeeding or postpartum amenorrhoea). Primary infertility is infertility in a couple who&#xD;
      have never had a child. Secondary infertility is a failure to conceive following a previous&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subfertility, usually defined as the absence of conception after one year of regular&#xD;
      intercourse, subfertility is a common problem affecting as many as one in six couples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE)&#xD;
      recommendations, couples with an estimated live birth rate of 40% or higher per year are&#xD;
      encouraged to continue aiming for a spontaneous pregnancy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment methods for infertility may be grouped as medical, complementary and alternative&#xD;
      treatments. Some methods may be used in concert with other methods. Drugs may be used for&#xD;
      both women and men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If conservative medical treatments fail to achieve a full term pregnancy, the physician may&#xD;
      suggest the patient undergo assisted reproductive fertilization (ART). Methods for ART&#xD;
      include artificial insemination (IUI), gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), zygot&#xD;
      intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) or ICSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is an in vitro fertilization procedure in which a&#xD;
      single sperm is injected directly into an oocyte. During the past decade, ICSI has been&#xD;
      applied increasingly around the world to alleviate problems of severe male infertility&#xD;
      because too few motile and morphologically normal sperm were present in the ejaculate of the&#xD;
      male partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there have been several improvements in techniques of ART during the last three&#xD;
      decades clinical pregnancy and live-birth rates remain at approximately 30-40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing these rates is desirable for couples undergoing ART, as treatment failure is a&#xD;
      source of psychological distress, and the most common cause of drop-out before achieving&#xD;
      pregnancy.The most common interventions to improve ART outcome are the use of maximized&#xD;
      controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), transference of multiple embryos into the uterus and&#xD;
      cryopreservation of surplus oocytes/embryos. However, the first two of these interventions&#xD;
      might increase the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and multiple pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-vitro fertilization (IVF) protocols are constantly under review in an attempt to decrease&#xD;
      hormone (gonadotrophin) requirement, improve follicular recruitment, whilst primarily to&#xD;
      increase live birth rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantation failure is thought to result from impairment of embryo development and/or from&#xD;
      abnormal uterine receptivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some protocols have considered the role of growth hormone in IVF. Growth hormone is a&#xD;
      biological peptide hormone, synthesized, stored and secreted by somatotroph cells located in&#xD;
      the anterior pituitary gland. Growth hormone can be synthetically produced using recombinant&#xD;
      DNA technology and is licensed to be used in the human population. There is currently no&#xD;
      consensus as to the route, dose or timing of growth hormone administration in IVF protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor Ovarian Response (POR) is defined by the Bologna criteria, with an incidence between 9&#xD;
      and 24% of all cycles of IVF, usually it indicates a reduction in follicular response,&#xD;
      resulting in a reduced number of retrieved oocytes. It has been recognized that, in order to&#xD;
      define the poor response in IVF, at least two of the following three features must be&#xD;
      present: (i) advanced maternal age or any other risk factor for POR; (ii) a previous POR; and&#xD;
      (iii) an abnormal ovarian reserve test (ORT). Two episodes of POR after maximal stimulation&#xD;
      are sufficient to define a patient as poor responder in the absence of advanced maternal age&#xD;
      or abnormal ORT. By definition, the term POR refers to the ovarian response, and therefore,&#xD;
      one stimulated cycle is considered essential for the diagnosis of POR. However, patients of&#xD;
      advanced age with an abnormal ORT may be classified as poor responders since both advanced&#xD;
      age and an abnormal ORT may indicate reduced ovarian reserve and act as a surrogate of&#xD;
      ovarian stimulation cycle outcome. In this case, the patients should be more properly defined&#xD;
      as 'expected poor responder'. If this definition of POR is uniformly adapted as the 'minimal'&#xD;
      criteria needed to select patients for future clinical trials, more homogeneous populations&#xD;
      will be tested for any new protocols. Finally, by reducing bias caused by spurious POR&#xD;
      definitions, it will be possible to compare results and to draw reliable conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How the intervention might work? The administration of growth hormone may potentiate the&#xD;
      effect of exogenous gonadotrophins. Growth hormone is reported to modulate the action of&#xD;
      follicular stimulating hormone on granulosa cells by up-regulating the local synthesis of&#xD;
      insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1). This interest has been stimulated by animal studies&#xD;
      which suggest that growth hormone may increase the intra-ovarian production of the IGF-1.&#xD;
      IGF-1 displays growth hormone dependence both in-vivo and in-vitro The interaction between&#xD;
      growth hormone and IGF-1 is of significance since IGF-1 has been shown to play an important&#xD;
      part in ovarian function in both animal and human models. The addition of IGF-1 to&#xD;
      gonadotrophins in granulosa cell cultures increased gonadotrophin action on the ovary by&#xD;
      several mechanisms including augmentation of aromatase activity, 17 beta-oestradiol and&#xD;
      progesterone production and luteinising hormone receptor formation. IGF-1 has also been found&#xD;
      to stimulate follicular development, oestrogen production and oocyte maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving the outcomes of ICSI by the use of growth hormone adjuvant therapy is important&#xD;
      particularly in those women who are considered poor responders. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      establish the role of growth hormone in ICSI.&#xD;
