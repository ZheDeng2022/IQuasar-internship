    <textblock>
      meningitis is a notifiable disease in many countries, the exact incidence rate is unknown. In&#xD;
      2013 meningitis resulted in 303,000 deaths - down from 464,000 deaths in 1990. In 2010 it was&#xD;
      estimated that meningitis resulted in 420,000 deaths, excluding cryptococcal meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial meningitis occurs in about 3 people per 100,000 annually in Western countries.&#xD;
      Population-wide studies have shown that viral meningitis is more common, at 10.9 per 100,000,&#xD;
      and occurs more often in the summer. In Brazil, the rate of bacterial meningitis is higher,&#xD;
      at 45.8 per 100,000 annually.Sub-Saharan Africa has been plagued by large epidemics of&#xD;
      meningococcal meningitis for over a century,leading to it being labeled the &quot;meningitis&#xD;
      belt&quot;. Epidemics typically occur in the dry season (December to June), and an epidemic wave&#xD;
      can last two to three years, dying out during the intervening rainy seasons.Attack rates of&#xD;
      100-800 cases per 100,000 are encountered in this area, which is poorly served by medical&#xD;
      care. These cases are predominantly caused by meningococci.The largest epidemic ever recorded&#xD;
      in history swept across the entire region in 1996-1997, causing over 250,000 cases and 25,000&#xD;
      deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meningococcal disease occurs in epidemics in areas where many people live together for the&#xD;
      first time, such as army barracks during mobilization, college campuses and the annual Hajj&#xD;
      pilgrimage. Although the pattern of epidemic cycles in Africa is not well understood, several&#xD;
      factors have been associated with the development of epidemics in the meningitis belt. They&#xD;
      include: medical conditions (immunological susceptibility of the population), demographic&#xD;
      conditions (travel and large population displacements), socioeconomic conditions&#xD;
      (overcrowding and poor living conditions), climatic conditions (drought and dust storms), and&#xD;
      concurrent infections (acute respiratory infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are significant differences in the local distribution of causes for bacterial&#xD;
      meningitis. For instance, while N. meningitides groups B and C cause most disease episodes in&#xD;
      Europe, group A is found in Asia and continues to predominate in Africa, where it causes most&#xD;
      of the major epidemics in the meningitis belt, accounting for about 80% to 85% of documented&#xD;
      meningococcal meningitis cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infections that involve the central nervous system (CNS), such as meningitis/encephalitis&#xD;
      (ME), are severe clinical conditions associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality as&#xD;
      well as significant long-term sequelae . acute inflammation of the protective membranes&#xD;
      covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges.The most common&#xD;
      symptoms are fever, headache, and neck stiffness.Other symptoms include confusion or altered&#xD;
      consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light or loud noises. Young children&#xD;
      often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability, drowsiness, or poor feeding.If&#xD;
      a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis; for instance, meningitis&#xD;
      caused by meningococcal bacteria may be accompanied by a characteristic rash. The&#xD;
      inflammation may be caused by infection with viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms, and&#xD;
      less commonly by certain drugs.Meningitis can be life-threatening because of the&#xD;
      inflammation's proximity to the brain and spinal cord; therefore, the condition is classified&#xD;
      as a medical emergency. A lumbar puncture can diagnose or exclude meningitis.A needle is&#xD;
      inserted into the spinal canal to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which&#xD;
      envelops the brain and spinal cord. The CSF is examined in a medical laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some forms of meningitis are preventable by immunization with the meningococcal, mumps,&#xD;
      pneumococcal, and Hib vaccines.Giving antibiotics to people with significant exposure to&#xD;
      certain types of meningitis may also be useful.The first treatment in acute meningitis&#xD;
      consists of promptly giving antibiotics and sometimes antiviral drugs.Corticosteroids can&#xD;
      also be used to prevent complications from excessive inflammation. Meningitis can lead to&#xD;
      serious long-term consequences such as deafness, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, or cognitive&#xD;
      deficits, especially if not treated quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      most common symptom of meningitis is a severe headache, occurring in almost 90% of cases of&#xD;
      bacterial meningitis, followed by nuchal rigidity (the inability to flex the neck forward&#xD;
      passively due to increased neck muscle tone and stiffness). The classic triad of diagnostic&#xD;
      signs consists of nuchal rigidity, sudden high fever, and altered mental status; however, all&#xD;
      three features are present in only 44-46% of bacterial meningitis cases.If none of the three&#xD;
      signs are present, acute meningitis is extremely unlikely.Other signs commonly associated&#xD;
      with meningitis include photophobia (intolerance to bright light) and phonophobia&#xD;
      (intolerance to loud noises). Small children often do not exhibit the aforementioned&#xD;
      symptoms, and may only be irritable and look unwell.The fontanelle (the soft spot on the top&#xD;
      of a baby's head) can bulge in infants aged up to 6 months. Other features that distinguish&#xD;
      meningitis from less severe illnesses in young children are leg pain, cold extremities, and&#xD;
      an abnormal skin color.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nuchal rigidity occurs in 70% of bacterial meningitis in adults. Other signs include the&#xD;
      presence of positive Kernig's sign or Brudziński sign. Kernig's sign is assessed with the&#xD;
      person lying supine, with the hip and knee flexed to 90 degrees. In a person with a positive&#xD;
      Kernig's sign, pain limits passive extension of the knee. A positive Brudzinski's sign occurs&#xD;
      when flexion of the neck causes involuntary flexion of the knee and hip. Although Kernig's&#xD;
      sign and Brudzinski's sign are both commonly used to screen for meningitis, the sensitivity&#xD;
      of these tests is limited.They do, however, have very good specificity for meningitis: the&#xD;
      signs rarely occur in other diseases. Another test, known as the &quot;jolt accentuation maneuver&quot;&#xD;
      helps determine whether meningitis is present in those reporting fever and headache. A person&#xD;
      is asked to rapidly rotate the head horizontally; if this does not make the headache worse,&#xD;
      meningitis is unlikely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other problems can produce symptoms similar to those above, but from non-meningitic causes.&#xD;
      This is called meningism or pseudomeningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meningitis caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (known as &quot;meningococcal&#xD;
      meningitis&quot;) can be differentiated from meningitis with other causes by a rapidly spreading&#xD;
      petechial rash, which may precede other symptoms.The rash consists of numerous small,&#xD;
      irregular purple or red spots (&quot;petechiae&quot;) on the trunk, lower extremities, mucous&#xD;
      membranes, conjuctiva, and (occasionally) the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. The&#xD;
      rash is typically non-blanching; the redness does not disappear when pressed with a finger or&#xD;
      a glass tumbler. Although this rash is not necessarily present in meningococcal meningitis,&#xD;
      it is relatively specific for the disease; it does, however, occasionally occur in meningitis&#xD;
      due to other bacteria. Other clues on the cause of meningitis may be the skin signs of hand,&#xD;
      foot and mouth disease and genital herpes, both of which are associated with various forms of&#xD;
      viral meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional problems may occur in the early stage of the illness. These may require specific&#xD;
      treatment, and sometimes indicate severe illness or worse prognosis. The infection may&#xD;
      trigger sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome of falling blood pressure, fast&#xD;
      heart rate, high or abnormally low temperature, and rapid breathing. Very low blood pressure&#xD;
      may occur at an early stage, especially but not exclusively in meningococcal meningitis; this&#xD;
      may lead to insufficient blood supply to other organs.Disseminated intravascular coagulation,&#xD;
      the excessive activation of blood clotting, may obstruct blood flow to organs and&#xD;
      paradoxically increase the bleeding risk. Gangrene of limbs can occur in meningococcal&#xD;
      disease.Severe meningococcal and pneumococcal infections may result in hemorrhaging of the&#xD;
      adrenal glands, leading to Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, which is often fatal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain tissue may swell, pressure inside the skull may increase and the swollen brain may&#xD;
      herniate through the skull base. This may be noticed by a decreasing level of consciousness,&#xD;
      loss of the pupillary light reflex, and abnormal posturing.The inflammation of the brain&#xD;
      tissue may also obstruct the normal flow of CSF around the brain (hydrocephalus).Seizures may&#xD;
      occur for various reasons; in children, seizures are common in the early stages of meningitis&#xD;
      (in 30% of cases) and do not necessarily indicate an underlying cause.Seizures may result&#xD;
      from increased pressure and from areas of inflammation in the brain tissue. Focal seizures&#xD;
      (seizures that involve one limb or part of the body), persistent seizures, late-onset&#xD;
      seizures and those that are difficult to control with medication indicate a poorer long-term&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation of the meninges may lead to abnormalities of the cranial nerves, a group of&#xD;
      nerves arising from the brain stem that supply the head and neck area and which control,&#xD;
      among other functions, eye movement, facial muscles, and hearing. Visual symptoms and hearing&#xD;
      loss may persist after an episode of meningitis.Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or&#xD;
      its blood vessels (cerebral vasculitis), as well as the formation of blood clots in the veins&#xD;
      (cerebral venous thrombosis), may all lead to weakness, loss of sensation, or abnormal&#xD;
      movement or function of the part of the body supplied by the affected area of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meningitis is typically caused by an infection with microorganisms. Most infections are due&#xD;
      to viruses,with bacteria, fungi, and protozoa being the next most common causes. It may also&#xD;
      result from various non-infectious causes. The term aseptic meningitis refers to cases of&#xD;
      meningitis in which no bacterial infection can be demonstrated. This type of meningitis is&#xD;
      usually caused by viruses but it may be due to bacterial infection that has already been&#xD;
      partially treated, when bacteria disappear from the meninges, or pathogens infect a space&#xD;
      adjacent to the meninges (e.g. sinusitis). Endocarditis (an infection of the heart valves&#xD;
      which spreads small clusters of bacteria through the bloodstream) may cause aseptic&#xD;
      meningitis. Aseptic meningitis may also result from infection with spirochetes, a group of&#xD;
      bacteria that includes Treponema pallidum (the cause of syphilis) and Borrelia burgdorferi&#xD;
      (known for causing Lyme disease). Meningitis may be encountered in cerebral malaria (malaria&#xD;
      infecting the brain) or amoebic meningitis, meningitis due to infection with amoebae such as&#xD;
      Naegleria fowleri, contracted from freshwater sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In premature babies and newborns up to three months old, common causes are group B&#xD;
      streptococci (subtypes III which normally inhabit the vagina and are mainly a cause during&#xD;
      the first week of life) and bacteria that normally inhabit the digestive tract such as&#xD;
      Escherichia coli (carrying the K1 antigen). Listeria monocytogenes (serotype IVb) is&#xD;
      transmitted by the mother before birth and may cause meningitis in the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older children are more commonly affected by Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) and&#xD;
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotypes 6, 9, 14, 18 and 23) and those under five by Haemophilus&#xD;
      influenzae type B (in countries that do not offer vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculous meningitis, which is meningitis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is more&#xD;
      common in people from countries in which tuberculosis is endemic, but is also encountered in&#xD;
      persons with immune problems, such as AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent bacterial meningitis may be caused by persisting anatomical defects, either&#xD;
      congenital or acquired, or by disorders of the immune system.Anatomical defects allow&#xD;
      continuity between the external environment and the nervous system. The most common cause of&#xD;
      recurrent meningitis is a skull fracture, particularly fractures that affect the base of the&#xD;
      skull or extend towards the sinuses and petrous pyramids. Approximately 59% of recurrent&#xD;
      meningitis cases are due to such anatomical abnormalities, 36% are due to immune deficiencies&#xD;
      (such as complement deficiency, which predisposes especially to recurrent meningococcal&#xD;
      meningitis), and 5% are due to ongoing infections in areas adjacent to the meninges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viruses that cause meningitis include enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus (generally type 2,&#xD;
      which produces most genital sores; less commonly type 1), varicella zoster virus (known for&#xD;
      causing chickenpox and shingles), mumps virus, HIV, and LCMV.[20] Mollaret's meningitis is a&#xD;
      chronic recurrent form of herpes meningitis; it is thought to be caused by herpes simplex&#xD;
      virus type 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of risk factors for fungal meningitis, including the use of&#xD;
      immunosuppressants (such as after organ transplantation), HIV/AIDS, and the loss of immunity&#xD;
      associated with aging.It is uncommon in those with a normal immune system but has occurred&#xD;
      with medication contamination.Symptom onset is typically more gradual, with headaches and&#xD;
      fever being present for at least a couple of weeks before diagnosis.The most common fungal&#xD;
      meningitis is cryptococcal meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans. In Africa, cryptococcal&#xD;
      meningitis is now the most common cause of meningitis in multiple studies,and it accounts for&#xD;
      20-25% of AIDS-related deaths in Africa.Other less common fungal pathogens which can cause&#xD;
      meningitis include: Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis,&#xD;
      and Candida species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A parasitic cause is often assumed when there is a predominance of eosinophils (a type of&#xD;
      white blood cell) in the CSF. The most common parasites implicated are Angiostrongylus&#xD;
      cantonensis, Gnathostoma spinigerum, Schistosoma, as well as the conditions cysticercosis,&#xD;
      toxocariasis, baylisascariasis, paragonimiasis, and a number of rarer infections and&#xD;
      noninfective conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Untreated, bacterial meningitis is almost always fatal. Viral meningitis, in contrast, tends&#xD;
      to resolve spontaneously and is rarely fatal. With treatment, mortality (risk of death) from&#xD;
      bacterial meningitis depends on the age of the person and the underlying cause. Of newborns,&#xD;
      20-30% may die from an episode of bacterial meningitis. This risk is much lower in older&#xD;
      children, whose mortality is about 2%, but rises again to about 19-37% in adults.Risk of&#xD;
      death is predicted by various factors apart from age, such as the pathogen and the time it&#xD;
      takes for the pathogen to be cleared from the cerebrospinal fluid,the severity of the&#xD;
      generalized illness, a decreased level of consciousness or an abnormally low count of white&#xD;
      blood cells in the CSF. Meningitis caused by H. influenzae and meningococci has a better&#xD;
      prognosis than cases caused by group B streptococci, coliforms and S. pneumonia. In adults,&#xD;
      too, meningococcal meningitis has a lower mortality (3-7%) than pneumococcal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children there are several potential disabilities which may result from damage to the&#xD;
      nervous system, including sensorineural hearing loss, epilepsy, learning and behavioral&#xD;
      difficulties, as well as decreased intelligence. These occur in about 15% of survivors.Some&#xD;
      of the hearing loss may be reversible. In adults, 66% of all cases emerge without disability.&#xD;
      The main problems are deafness (in 14%) and cognitive impairment (in 10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculous meningitis in children continues to be associated with a significant risk of&#xD;
      death even with treatment (19%), and a significant proportion of the surviving children have&#xD;
      ongoing neurological problems. Just over a third of all cases survives with no problems.&#xD;
