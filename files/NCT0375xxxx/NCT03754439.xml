  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Centralisation of neonatal intensive care has led to an increase in postnatal inter-hospital&#xD;
      transfers within the first 72 hours of life. Studies have shown transported preterm infants&#xD;
      have an increased risk of intraventricular haemorrhage compared to inborns. The cause is&#xD;
      likely multi-factorial, however, during the transportation process infants are exposed to&#xD;
      noxious stimuli (excessive noise, vibration and temperature fluctuations), which may result&#xD;
      in microscopic brain injury. However, there is a paucity of evidence to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of noise and vibration exposure during transportation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim to quantify the level of vibration and noise as&#xD;
      experienced by a preterm infant during inter-hospital transportation in ground ambulance in&#xD;
      the United Kingdom&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) measure the physiological and biochemical changes that occur as a result of ambulance&#xD;
      transportation (ii) quantify microscopic brain injury through measurement of urinary S100B&#xD;
      and other biomarkers (iii) evaluate the development of intraventricular haemorrhage on&#xD;
      cranial ultrasound iv) monitor vibration and sound exposure, using a prototype measuring&#xD;
      system, during neonatal transport using both a manikin and a small cohort of neonatal&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v) evaluate vibration and sound exposure levels using an updated transportation system&#xD;
      modified to reduce effects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There were 50 000 premature births in the United Kingdom (UK) and this number is increasing&#xD;
      each year due to changes in demographics of the childbearing population with a trend towards&#xD;
      increasing maternal age, increased uptake in fertility treatments and a greater number of&#xD;
      medically induced deliveries. This has resulted in a greater risk of preterm delivery.&#xD;
      Significant advances in neonatal intensive care have led to better survival rates with more&#xD;
      preterm infants surviving at the extremes of gestational age. However, this is not without&#xD;
      significant co-morbidity in terms of increased incidence of respiratory disease, cerebral&#xD;
      palsy, learning difficulties and behavioural problems in surviving infants. The long term&#xD;
      effect of impairment in cognitive functioning has led to an increased incidence of special&#xD;
      education needs (one to one support, special schools), lower scores of cognitive ability&#xD;
      (e.g. reading &amp; maths), a higher rate of school failure and lower up take of higher education&#xD;
      in early adulthood in these infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the increasing preterm birth rate year strategies to reduce this level of morbidity&#xD;
      are of great importance to public health care. In 2003, neonatal services were reorganised&#xD;
      into managed clinical network leading to the development of hospitals of different specialist&#xD;
      levels of care working together with the aim to improve provision of quality care and&#xD;
      neonatal outcomes. Although this change in practice has led to an increase in survival, the&#xD;
      level of neurodisability has remained the same. Furthermore, the number of neonatal&#xD;
      inter-hospital has subsequently increased (10,000 in 2010 to 16,000 in 2016) with the&#xD;
      necessity to move premature infants to higher level centres for on-going care but also the&#xD;
      need to move infants due to lack of available cots at higher level centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal transport has been associated with significant morbidity in terms of severe&#xD;
      intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH). A large study of 69 000 very low birth weight infants&#xD;
      based in the USA showed infants who undergo inter-hospital transportation within the first 72&#xD;
      hours of life, a period when infants are most vulnerable to IVH, are 75% more likely to&#xD;
      develop any IVH and 44% more likely to develop severe IVH compared to inborn non-transported&#xD;
      infants. Severe IVH has been associated with both short and long term neurological morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. It has been estimated 50 to 80% of survivors with severe IVH develop cerebral&#xD;
      palsy and 70% have cognitive impairment. Mild IVH, although not significantly associated with&#xD;
      severe impairment, has been shown result in lower developmental scores at school age, with a&#xD;
      higher percentage of infants requiring educational support compared to infants who never&#xD;
      developed IVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the significant lifelong impact of severe IVH on premature infants, their families and&#xD;
      society, current practice needs to be stratified to reduce the risk associated with&#xD;
      transportation. The causation of this additional morbidity is unknown and likely to be&#xD;
      multifactorial. However, studies that have accounted for risk factors known to be associated&#xD;
      with IVH, such as, low birth weight and intubation using multivariable regression models have&#xD;
      still found an association between transport and IVH, which raises the question whether the&#xD;
      physical process of transportation itself contributes to the development of IVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During transportation infants are exposed to both excessive vibration and noise. Studies have&#xD;
      shown in healthy adults excessive vibration is associated with adverse health effects, such&#xD;
      as, fatigue, headaches, circulatory disturbance and neurological disorders. Studies have&#xD;
      shown neonates are exposed to vibration levels during neonatal transport to be in the range&#xD;
      of 0.4-5.6m/s2, which would be deemed extremely uncomfortable by International Standards&#xD;
      Organization (ISO) 2631. However, a weakness of all these studies accessing vibration levels&#xD;
      during transport is in the location of the vibration sensor during measurement, which is&#xD;
      either placed on the mattress or incubator and therefore may not give a true reflection of&#xD;
      the vibration exposure the neonate's head endures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is a paucity of evidence to evaluate the effect of vibration on neonates&#xD;
      especially during transportation. Cerebral blood flow can be monitored via near infra-red&#xD;
      spectrometry (NIRS), which is a real time and non-invasive technique. Soul et al demonstrated&#xD;
      that continuous monitoring of regional cerebral oxygenation with NIRS can be correlated with&#xD;
      changes in systemic blood pressure and provide insight into the fluctuating nature of&#xD;
      cerebral pressure in preterm infants and hence identify infants at risk of cerebral&#xD;
      pathology. NIRS monitoring during ambulance transfer would allow real time assessment of the&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion during ambulance transfer. Additionally, simultaneous vibration and noise&#xD;
      measurement will allow correlation of exposure levels with changes in cerebral perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, exposure to excessive sound, like vibration, has been shown to have adverse&#xD;
      effects in healthy adults and neonates. Excessive noise has been shown to increase heart rate&#xD;
      (HR), increase blood pressure, increase respiratory rates (RR) and alter sleep cycles in both&#xD;
      term and preterm infants. Premature infants have decreased autonomic self-regulatory&#xD;
      mechanisms and are unable to adapt to loud noxious stimuli, which predisposes them to&#xD;
      physiological instability. This instability can potentially result in fluctuations in&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow, which could increase the risk of bleeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a small number of studies have documented vibration (although of the incubator) and&#xD;
      noise exposure during transportation, none of the studies have correlated the level of&#xD;
      exposure with physiological changes or biochemical markers of neurological injury.&#xD;
      Correlation of vibration exposure as experienced by the neonatal head and noise exposure&#xD;
      within the incubator will allow the investigators to plan interventional strategies aimed at&#xD;
      reducing both vibration and noise exposure. Overall, by reducing these noxious stimuli the&#xD;
      investigators aim to reduce both subtle neurological injury and IVH to improve long term&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes.&#xD;
