      Burden:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provision of health care to urban poor population is a great challenge because of supply and&#xD;
      demand barriers in the urban health system, which is considered patchy and fragmented. The&#xD;
      poor urban people, especially mothers have little access to government health facilities. The&#xD;
      health care platform is not well designed in primary health care delivery for urban health&#xD;
      system but presently almost 30 percent people are living in urban area of the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge gap:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about what happen if psycho social stimulation is provided using urban&#xD;
      lactating allowance program on children's cognition and behavior. There is little information&#xD;
      about nature and bottleneck of Early Childhood Development (ECD) activities available in the&#xD;
      urban Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an opportunity to develop a combined package integrating psycho social stimulation&#xD;
      with the existing urban lactating allowance program on disadvantaged children's development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the urban health system is complex, patchy and fragmented, prior to this intervention An&#xD;
      analysis will be done on ECD services and its bottleneck in urban area through Tanahashi&#xD;
      framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis (if any):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adding psycho social stimulation to urban lactating allowance program will have additional&#xD;
      effect on children's cognitive, motor and language development and behavior compared to the&#xD;
      comparison group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally the intervention will- improve mothers' quality of life and reduce their&#xD;
      depressive symptoms be cost effective,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of integrated urban lactating allowance and psycho social&#xD;
           stimulation on children's cognitive, motor and language development and behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure nature and bottleneck of ECD services in urban Bangladesh&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure effect of the programs on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mothers' quality of life and mental health (depression symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cost effectiveness of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A two-arm, Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial: i) Lactating allowance + Psycho&#xD;
      social stimulation; (ii) Only lactating allowance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures/variables: Children's cognitive, motor and language development measured on&#xD;
      Bayley-III, behavior on Wolke's rating scales, Mother's quality of life and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms , household food security status, socioeconomic status, quality of home stimulation&#xD;
      using family care indicators, Mother's knowledge on child care and development, children's&#xD;
      growth measured by length/height, weight and head circumference,mothers' height, weight and&#xD;
      mid upper arm circumference, direct and indirect cost of the project.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 250 million children do not reach their potential due to poverty,&#xD;
      inadequate stimulation and associated risk factors in low and middle income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Bangladesh more than 50% of children under 5 years are at risk of developmental delay.&#xD;
      Urban population is about 28% and it is expected to rise to more than 40% by 2030. In fact,&#xD;
      urbanization in Bangladesh is rapidly growing but is not well planned. Poor urban women and&#xD;
      children are vulnerable in terms of health and education .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urban health care facilities are fragmented and patchy and every year rise in population&#xD;
      is putting more pressure on health system. Moreover, there is huge economic disparity between&#xD;
      rich and poor in the urban areas and poorer people have little access to health care due to&#xD;
      both supply and demand barriers. So the situation is rolling more difficult every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MOWCA) has taken initiatives to help urban poor&#xD;
      mothers through lactating allowance (LA) and limited health education programs. A study&#xD;
      conducted in Zimbabwe documented that unconditional cash transfer showed an increase in&#xD;
      receiving children's birth certificate and immunization in the age group of 0-4years and&#xD;
      school attendance in 6-12 years. Recent systematic review concluded that unconditional cash&#xD;
      transfer may not improve health services use in children and adult in low and middle income&#xD;
      countries but may have positive impact on food choices and food security. It is expected that&#xD;
      this urban lactating allowance will develop economic capacity of people, empower women,&#xD;
      improve their quality of life and reduce gender gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few ECD programs are available for poor urban children especially for the 1st thousand&#xD;
      days. The idea is to develop a combined package integrating psycho social stimulation with&#xD;
      the existing urban lactating allowance program and measuring its effects on disadvantaged&#xD;
      children's development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the urban health system is complex, patchy and fragmented, prior to this intervention an&#xD;
      analysis will be done on ECD services and its bottleneck in the project area through&#xD;
      Tanahashi framework. A facility assessment will be done to understand nature of ECD services.&#xD;
      A meeting will be conducted with relevant experts to finalize the services delivery mechanism&#xD;
      of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will follow two sequential stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I: Understand nature and analyse bottleneck of ECD services in selected urban areas of&#xD;
      Bangladesh through a survey using Tanahasi framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage II: Document that adding ECD activities to urban lactating allowance program will&#xD;
      improve children's cognition, motor, language and behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology for stage I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, an analysis will be done on ECD program in urban area through Tanahashi framework. A&#xD;
      documentation will be done on availability, accessibility, utilization and adequate coverage&#xD;
      of the ECD activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECD and related services will be analyzed through:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Household Survey and b) Facility assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Household survey A survey will be conducted with 426 mothers having child less than five&#xD;
           years. On an average 22 respondents will be recruited from each cluster. the total&#xD;
           clusters will be 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size was calculated assuming 50% effective coverage, 20% error, 95% confidence&#xD;
           interval and 10% refusal rate the total sample size calculated was 426 in an urban&#xD;
           setting..&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Facility Assessment Moreover, ECD or relevant services will be collected through&#xD;
           visiting service delivery facilities. government and private hospitals, NGOs and schools&#xD;
           (kindergarten) will be visited and data will be collected on services available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this stage, a stakeholders meeting with relevant experts will be conducted to&#xD;
      finalize a service delivery mechanism&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology for stage II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim is to document that adding ECD activities to urban lactating allowance program&#xD;
      improves children's cognition, language and motor and behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cluster randomized controlled trial of the effects of adding psycho social&#xD;
      stimulation to the existing lactating allowance of the country with 2 arms: i) Psycho social&#xD;
      stimulation+ Urban lactating allowance and ii) Only urban lactating allowance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of the study area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A municipality will be selected for this study. The Initial plan is to conduct the study in&#xD;
      Rangpur City Corporation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 20 clusters (10 interventions &amp; 10 comparisons) and 30 mother child dyads in&#xD;
      each cluster. In Rangpure City Corporation there are 33 Wards. A Ward will be considered as a&#xD;
      cluster. Cluster will be assigned randomly to intervention or comparisions group. A buffer&#xD;
      zone will be made to reduce spill over effect with remaining Wards and or villages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the Government is providing urban lactating allowance to 2000 mothers in Rangpur City&#xD;
      Corporation, it is expected that there will be approximately at least 50 mother child dyads&#xD;
      in each cluster. 30 participants will be selected from the list considering mothers lower age&#xD;
      and/or those with single child (if available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, sample is 600. Previous studies of psycho social stimulation alone achieved an&#xD;
      effect size of 0.4 SD on children's development. In this study, lactating allowance (cash) as&#xD;
      an intervention that might have also positive effect on the child development. But to be on&#xD;
      the safe side, it is assumed that an effect size of 0.35 SD, 80% power, 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval, 1.58 cluster design effect and 25% drop-out rate the sample size was calculated to&#xD;
      be 300 in each arm with 30 children in each of the 20 clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be checked for normality. Appropriate measures will be taken if there are any&#xD;
      abnormal distributions. Frequency table and percentage will be used to present nature of ECD&#xD;
      services and its bottleneck. Service availability would be presented in a table through&#xD;
      facility assessment and the bottlenecks (accessibility, utilization and coverage) will also&#xD;
      be presented through interviews with mothers. For intervention trial, differences between&#xD;
      groups in background characteristics will be analyzed using t-test for continuous variables&#xD;
      and chi-square test for categorical variables.. Effect of the ECD intervention will be&#xD;
      measured using intention-to-treat analysis controlling for the clustering effect in&#xD;
      multivariate regression analysis. All covariates will be controlled and effect modifier and&#xD;
      mulnicolinearity will be checked before regression analysis. Quality of life data will be&#xD;
      analysed based on WHO guideline for WHOQoL tools.. Similarly, total score of SRQ will be&#xD;
      calculated and then differences between arms will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to estimate the resource use and costs associated with&#xD;
      interventions. Direct and indirect cost will be measured for all the groups. Average costs&#xD;
      per participants will be calculated by multiplying the cost of resource items by their&#xD;
      respective unit costs. Outcomes will be generated from the study after the intervention and&#xD;
      the differences will be measured before and after the intervention in two groups. Then the&#xD;
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be used in cost-effectiveness analysis.&#xD;
