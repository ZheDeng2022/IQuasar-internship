  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intranasal corticosteroids are accepted as safe and effective first-line therapy for allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis, especially in treatment of persistent symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Budesonide, a non-halogenic glucocorticoid, is widely used in the management of inflammatory&#xD;
      mucosal diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and allergic rhinitis. It&#xD;
      is a highly fat-soluble substance with low water solubility and is presented as dispersion in&#xD;
      marketed nasal sprays, like Rhinocort aqua 64. The maximum therapeutic efficacy of Rhinocort&#xD;
      aqua is obtained after an application period of 7 to 14 days. In Budesolv, the solubility of&#xD;
      budesonide is considerably increased suggesting that the same therapeutic efficacy can be&#xD;
      reached with a lower dose. Better bioavailability of the dissolved drug promise an earlier&#xD;
      onset of therapeutic efficacy. The current trial is undertaken to demonstrate these two&#xD;
      effects. Subjects suffering from grass pollen allergic rhinitis will be challenged with grass&#xD;
      pollen in a challenge chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic subjects will be treated with two actuations (50 μl) of respective study treatment&#xD;
      into each nostril once daily for 8 days. The total daily budesonide dose will be 40 μg per&#xD;
      subject for Budesolv 10 and 256 μg per subject for Rhinocort® aqua 64. The primary objective&#xD;
      of the study is to show non-inferiority of Budesolv 10 to Rhinocort® aqua 64. On day 8 grass&#xD;
      pollen allergic patients will be challenged with grass pollen over a period of 6 hours and&#xD;
      subjective nasal symptoms (congestion, sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea) as well as objective&#xD;
      symptoms (nasal airflow, nasal secretion) will be assessed every 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective of the trial is to demonstrate an early on-set of therapeutic efficacy&#xD;
      of Budesolv 10 compared to Rhinocort aqua. On day 1, grass pollen allergic patients will be&#xD;
      challenged with grass pollen allergen in the challenge chamber over a period of 6 hours.&#xD;
      After 1 hour 45 minutes, patients will receive their first dosage of the respective nasal&#xD;
      spray treatment. During the 6 hour grass pollen challenge, subjective and objective endpoints&#xD;
      will be measured every 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To eliminate an individual bias based on expectations, the effect and onset of action is also&#xD;
      compared to the effects of a suitable placebo. The same set of study participants will&#xD;
      receive all three interventions in three consecutive treatment periods.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, three way cross over, double-blind, single site&#xD;
      trial in adult subjects (18 years of age and older) who demonstrate grass specific&#xD;
      Immunglobulin E (IgE) reactivity and have a history of grass pollen induced allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis with or without controlled asthma. In the cross-over setting&#xD;
      three treatments, namely placebo, Budesolv 10 or Rhinocort® aqua 64 will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence/non-inferiority&#xD;
      between Budesolv 10 and Rhinocort® aqua 64, a marketed comparator containing the same&#xD;
      compound (budesonide), in patients suffering from grass pollen induced allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis with or without controlled asthma on day 8 of treatment. A&#xD;
      placebo group will be introduced to show effectiveness of treatment and hence validate the&#xD;
      trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be based on the assessment of rhinitis symptoms during grass pollen&#xD;
      challenge performed in the Vienna Challenge Chamber (environmental exposure chamber).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective of the trial is the early onset of action of Budesolv 10 compared to&#xD;
      Rhinocort® aqua 64, determined on day one of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 + 2 - Screening + Inclusion period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for appropriate allergic response. A total nasal symptom score&#xD;
      (TNSS) of at least 6 points out of 12 within the first two hours in the grass pollen&#xD;
      challenge chamber is required to be included into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 + 5 + 7 / &quot;day 1&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment arms (fully&#xD;
      blinded) in the order of their screening numbers assigned at visit 1. Subjects will enter the&#xD;
      study site about one hour ahead of the start of allergen provocation. After positive&#xD;
      completion of all study relevant assessments, subjects enter the grass pollen challenge&#xD;
      chamber for subjective and objective assessments for a period of 6 hours. One hour forty-five&#xD;
      minutes after entry, the first treatment will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjective nasal symptom score will be recorded every fifteen minutes during a 6-hour&#xD;
      allergen exposure challenge. Every hour rhinomanometry will be performed to objectively&#xD;
      evaluate the respiratory function of the nose. Additional rhinomanometry will be performed at&#xD;
      two hours 30 minutes after entry. Subjects will continue treatment with two actuations into&#xD;
      each nostril once a day until day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 + 6 + 8 / &quot;day 8&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 8 of their respective treatment block, subjects will enter the study site about two&#xD;
      hours before provocation will start. Subjects will take their last treatment dosage&#xD;
      approximately one hour before entering the challenge chamber. The study medication device&#xD;
      will be returned to study site staff for external analytical evaluations after usage&#xD;
      (in-use-stability test). After receiving their last treatment dose and shortly before&#xD;
      entering the challenge chamber, baseline symptom score will be assessed. Like on day one,&#xD;
      subjects will be provoked for 6 hours with grass pollen allergens. Subjective symptom scores&#xD;
      will be recorded every fifteen minutes, and rhinomanometry will be performed every hour&#xD;
      during the challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between the respective study treatments, a wash-out period of at least 20 days must be&#xD;
      adhered to allowing complete dissipation of the previous treatment. After the wash-out&#xD;
      period, subjects change to the next treatment block in the sequence. During the entire trial,&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to monitor for adverse events (AEs), and they will record the use of&#xD;
      concomitant medications on the provided form. Female subjects of child-bearing potential will&#xD;
      complete a urine pregnancy test in the course of all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following parameters will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective symptom score (nasal, ocular, respiratory) during a grass pollen challenge&#xD;
           lasting for 6 hours - every 15 minutes Active anterior rhinomanometry (AAR) - every 60&#xD;
           minutes, additional measurement on day 1 at 2:30 after entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function tests using regular spirometry for FEV1 and FVC - every 120 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasal secretion weight - every 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination - at Screening and Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs - every visit, pre- and post-challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety laboratory assessments: Complete blood count with differential, blood chemistry,&#xD;
           liver function, urine dipstick test - at screening and last treatment visit, serology at&#xD;
           screening and drug abuse test on investigator's decision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin Prick Test with skin prick test solution (Manufacturer Allergopharma) - at&#xD;
           Screening or within the previous 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific CAP analysis (g6) - at Screening or within the previous 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG - at screening and Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events - throughout the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant medication - throughout the study One week after the final provocation&#xD;
           session, subjects will complete the trial after their follow up visit. Validated methods&#xD;
           of data collection, analysis, and evaluation will be used for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial endpoints are listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint will be the mean 'Total Nasal Symptom Score' (TNSS), calculated&#xD;
      as the baseline adjusted mean of TNSS measured at 17 time points (every 15 minutes) during&#xD;
      the grass pollen allergen exposure challenge from time point 2 to 6 hours on day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TNSS is the sum of the symptoms &quot;nasal congestion&quot;, &quot;rhinorrhea&quot;, &quot;itchy nose&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;sneezing&quot;. Each individual symptom will be scored on a 4-point categorical scale from 0-3&#xD;
      (where &quot;0&quot;= none &quot;1&quot;=mild &quot;2&quot;=moderate &quot;3&quot;=severe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Secondary efficacy endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point when onset of action can be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional secondary efficacy endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasal airflow: will be assessed every hour during the six hour grass pollen allergen&#xD;
           exposure challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasal secretion: will be assessed every 30 minutes during the six-hour grass pollen&#xD;
           allergen exposure challenge. Additional rhinomanometry will be done on day 1 at 2:30 h&#xD;
           after entry in the challenge chamber&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total ocular symptom score (TOSS) is the sum of the symptoms &quot;ocular itching&quot;,&#xD;
           &quot;redness&quot;, &quot;watery eyes&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total asthma symptom score (TASS) is the sum of the symptoms &quot;cough&quot;, &quot;wheeze&quot;,&#xD;
           &quot;dyspnea&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each individual symptom of TOSS and TASS will be scored on a 4-point categorical scale from&#xD;
      0-3 (where &quot;0&quot;= none &quot;1&quot;=mild &quot;2&quot;=moderate &quot;3&quot;=severe). TOSS and TASS will be assessed every&#xD;
      15 minutes during the six-hour grass pollen allergen exposure challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
