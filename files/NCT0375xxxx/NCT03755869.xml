    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and&#xD;
      development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and&#xD;
      tumor celltebiz related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase III study, Patients who failed at&#xD;
      least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance were&#xD;
      treated with anlotinib (12mg, po. qd. on day 1to14 of a 21-day cycle) or placebo, the&#xD;
      anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS&#xD;
      were 1.4 months and 6.3 months.&#xD;

      It is an open, single-arm, multi-center clinical trial conducted in China, and plan to&#xD;
      Recruiting103 patients who were progressed after first line systemic therapy and&#xD;
      refused/can't tolerate chemotherapy. Patents receive 12mg anlotinib orally daily on day 1to&#xD;
      14 of a 21-day cycle until progression of disease, assess safety and efficacy of the drug.&#xD;
