  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In sub-Saharan Africa, cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women&#xD;
      because of the difficulty in implementing screening programs. The main obstacles in these&#xD;
      countries are poverty, lack of healthcare infrastructures and trained practitioners. With the&#xD;
      availability of new technologies, researchers are looking for new strategies adapted to low-&#xD;
      and middle-income countries to identify cervical precancerous lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current evidence shows that Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing is more effective than&#xD;
      cytology (Pap smear) for cervical cancer screening in resource-limited settings. Indeed, the&#xD;
      GeneXpertÂ® HPV test offers the opportunity to prevent cervical cancer (CC) in a single visit:&#xD;
      rapid detection of high-risk HPV (HPV) infection followed by same day treatment of&#xD;
      HPV-positive women during the same visit (screen-and-treat approach).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However only a small proportion of HPV-positive women will develop cervical (pre)cancer,&#xD;
      making it important to select those to treat. This triage can be achieved by colposcopy,&#xD;
      cytology and visual inspection after application of acetic acid (VIA). Though VIA is the&#xD;
      triage test recommended by WHO for resource-limited countries, it has not yet been widely&#xD;
      assessed in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the investigators is to assess the performance of HPV-test followed by&#xD;
      Visual Inspection after application of Acetic acid and Lugol's iodine VIA/VILI to detect&#xD;
      cervical precancerous lesions in a screen-and-treat strategy in Cameroon (sub-Saharan Africa)&#xD;
      where there is no cervical cancer-screening program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators organized a successful free screening campaign in Cameroon in 2015 that&#xD;
      allowed to identify the expectations of women and their eagerness to benefit from prevention&#xD;
      of gynecological cancers and sexually transmitted diseases.&#xD;
