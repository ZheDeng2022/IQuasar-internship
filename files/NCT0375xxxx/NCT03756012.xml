      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pulse widths &lt;500 μsec and &gt;1000 μsec&#xD;
      on clinical outcomes during a temporary SCS trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective, multi-center, two-arm, randomized, crossover design to&#xD;
      be conducted at up to 10 sites. The study will enroll up to 100 subjects in order to include&#xD;
      up to 10 subjects in the study per site. Subjects selected to participate in the trial have&#xD;
      back and/or leg pain, have been evaluated as a candidate for SCS and have agreed to undergo a&#xD;
      temporary SCS trial using the Algovita® system with percutaneous leads. Each subject will be&#xD;
      followed during the trial period of approximately 7+/-2 days. The study will end when the&#xD;
      last subject has completed the trial period and exited. The expected enrollment period for&#xD;
      this study is approximately six months. After exit from the clinical study, subjects will&#xD;
      continue to be followed by their physician per usual care. All device and procedure-related&#xD;
      AEs will be collected and reported per the study protocol.&#xD;

          <description>This was a case series and all patients received both algorithms; pulse widths &lt;500 µsec and &gt;1000 µsec during a temporary SCS trial with Algovita Trial System. Study ended early and results are only available for total population.&#xD;
Algovita Spinal Cord Stimulation System: The Algovita™ SCS system is indicated as an aid in the management of chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs, including unilateral or bilateral pain associated with failed back surgery syndrome, intractable low back pain and leg pain.&#xD;
Adverse Events were not collected. Study was ended prematurely and results were only provided for total population instead of separate arms since subjects received both interventions.</description>
