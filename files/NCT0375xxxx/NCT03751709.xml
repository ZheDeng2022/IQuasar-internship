    <textblock>
      Single center Phase 1 dose escalation trial of the combination of standard-of-care&#xD;
      blinatumomab plus Haplo-Mismatched Cellular Therapy (HMCT). HMCT refers to the infusion of&#xD;
      donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected via pheresis from a haploidentical family&#xD;
      member - the procedure is analogous to giving a donor lymphocyte infusion outside of the&#xD;
      setting of an allogeneic stem cell transplant; also known as 'microtransplantation'. The HMCT&#xD;
      is an unselected mix of lymphocytes and leukocytes, but the product dose escalation will be&#xD;
      done based on the T cell content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten recipients are planned. Each subject will be administered one infusion of HMCT during the&#xD;
      first cycle of blinatumomab and two infusions during cycle two of blinatumomab; the CD3+ cell&#xD;
      dose of the HMCT infusion is governed by dose escalation / de-escalation following a Bayesian&#xD;
      method.&#xD;

      This single center, phase 1 study will examine the safety, side effects, and effectiveness of&#xD;
      combining the investigational use of Haplo-Mismatched Cellular Therapy (HMCT) in combination&#xD;
      with blinatumomab. Investigators plan to give HMCT starting on day 15, after the initial CRS&#xD;
      caused by blinatumomab has resolved. The investigational treatment will start with 1% of the&#xD;
      typical HMCT dose (10e6 CD3+ cells/kg) and will employ a modified dose escalation design as&#xD;
      an additional safety measure. The primary end points will be DLT of the combination of&#xD;
      blinatumomab and HMCT.&#xD;

             discretion of the treating physician if they are no longer candidates for further TKI&#xD;
             based therapy. Prior therapy with a minimum of 2 prior 2nd/3rd generation TKI is&#xD;
             required. (TKI therapy is not allowed while on trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior blinatumomab treatment are eligible if last treatment was at least&#xD;
             3 months prior to C1D1, patient's blasts are confirmed to express CD19, and patient&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate organ function as defined below (note there are no marrow&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  AST/ALT â‰¤ 2.5 x the upper limits of institutional normal (â‰¤ 5 x ULN for patients&#xD;

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or complete abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry, for the duration of study, and for two months after study participation. Should&#xD;
             a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;

             prior to starting blinatumomab).&#xD;
