      Purpose: To develop and test the feasibility of an exercise intervention that combines group&#xD;
      walking, activity tracking, and heart rate monitoring, and determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      this intervention on the physical and mental health for individuals with schizophrenia&#xD;
      spectrum disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 14 individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): During the baseline assessment, subjects will be provided with a Fitbit&#xD;
      wristband and instructed how to use it. During the first group session, subjects will be&#xD;
      taught how to use their heart rate (on the Fitbit) to determine how fast subjects should walk&#xD;
      (to achieve the appropriate exercise dosage). Information on proper care, usage, and how to&#xD;
      determine the appropriate heart from the watch, which will be used to guide the intensity of&#xD;
      the walk will be provided to subjects and reviewed at each group session. For all clinic&#xD;
      based group sessions, subjects will arrive at the STEP clinic to meet the entire group and&#xD;
      leaders and be reminded of the heart rate (HR) that corresponds with the intensity of that&#xD;
      group session. Next, the group will go outside and walk for 30 minutes. At the completion of&#xD;
      30 minutes, everyone will go back into the clinic for water and review of the walk. After the&#xD;
      second group session of each week, subjects will receive weekly progress reports of their&#xD;
      steps and minutes spent walking the prior week (obtained from Fitbit devices). During this&#xD;
      session, subjects will also set individual goals for the upcoming week for both their&#xD;
      &quot;intensity walks&quot; and total steps per day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overview of Procedures: PACE-life will be integrated into the Schizophrenia Treatment and&#xD;
      Evaluation Program (STEP) outpatient clinics in Raleigh, NC and Carrboro, NC. The group walks&#xD;
      will occur in the surrounding area around the clinics on sidewalks, bike trails, and&#xD;
      residential streets. Goal setting groups and all assessments will take place in a conference&#xD;
      room at the clinic. Goal-setting will include setting goals for the upcoming week in terms of&#xD;
      number of steps as well as how many intensity walks that individuals plan to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments/Measures: The exercise intervention, PACE-Life, will last for 24 weeks and&#xD;
      includes both group walks and independent walks (done at a location of the subject's&#xD;
      choosing). Participants will be asked to complete assessments at screening, baseline,&#xD;
      mid-point, post-test, and 1-month follow-up (approximately 28 weeks total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Screening the following measures will be examined: Demographics, the Wechsler Abbreviated&#xD;
      Scale of Intelligence (WASI), a licensed physician will complete a medical history and&#xD;
      physical exam, Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Baseline, Mid-point, Post-test, and 1-Month Follow-up the following measures will be&#xD;
      examined: Demographics, Minutes Spent Walking, the Short Form International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire (IPAQ), Steps/day, Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)- CRF will be measured using&#xD;
      the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Self-determination Basic Needs, the Basic Psychological Need&#xD;
      Scale-in General, the Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise Scale (BPNES), the Mini&#xD;
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (Baseline Only), Resting Systolic/Diastolic&#xD;
      Blood Pressure and resting heart rate (RHR), autonomous motivation will be measured with the&#xD;
      Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-2 (BREQ-2), enjoyment of walking will be&#xD;
      measured with the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES), the UCLA Loneliness Scale,&#xD;
      Weight, BMI, and Waist/hip Circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the open trial, the investigators will administer a brief questionnaire&#xD;
      to the subjects regarding satisfaction and acceptability that will have both forced choice&#xD;
      and open-ended questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention- Groups will occur twice per week for 30 minutes for the entire intervention&#xD;
      without changes in frequency and duration. The intensity, however, of both group walks and&#xD;
      home-based walks will increase throughout this intervention in a stepwise fashion to create&#xD;
      an exercise dose response to maximize impact on CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fitbits: All participants will be provided a Fitbit that is labeled with a participant&#xD;
      number. All Fitbits are paired to a Fitbit account. Data from Fitbit devices can be synced to&#xD;
      the corresponding account and accessed through Fitbit.com. Participants will be provided&#xD;
      information about their accounts should participants want to look at the data but will be&#xD;
      asked not to change any of the settings as the investigators will be using data for tracking&#xD;
      steps/day and minutes spent walking.&#xD;

          <description>This is a pilot project with one single group that will be evaluated on the adherence to a walking protocol (Exercise Intervention- PACE-Life). Subjects will be walking two times a week under the supervision of the psychiatric clinic. In addition, subjects will be encouraged to add walking on their own on the days when subjects are not exercising under the supervision of the clinic. This pilot will be used to inform the final design of the subsequent randomized clinical trial that will be implemented following this pilot. Exercise Intervention- PACE-Life: Subjects will be provided with a Fitbit wristband and instructed how to use it.</description>

Subjects will be walking two times a week under the supervision of the psychiatric clinic. In addition, subjects will be encouraged to add walking on their own on the days when subjects are not exercising under the supervision of the clinic. This pilot will be used to inform the final design of the subsequent randomized clinical trial that will be implemented following this pilot.

        <title>Mean Difference in Waist Circumference</title>
        <description>Mean difference in waist circumference from Baseline to Post Treatment (24 weeks) and to Follow-Up Visit (up to 28 weeks). Normal waist circumference ranges ≤ than 94cm for males and &lt; than 80 for females to higher than 102 cm for males and 88cm for females . Higher scores reflect worse outcomes (i.e. greater waist circumference = disease development risk).</description>

            <description>This is a pilot project with one single group that will be evaluated on the adherence to a walking protocol (Exercise Intervention- PACE-Life). Subjects will be walking two times a week under the supervision of the psychiatric clinic. In addition, subjects will be encouraged to add walking on their own on the days when subjects are not exercising under the supervision of the clinic. This pilot will be used to inform the final design of the subsequent randomized clinical trial that will be implemented following this pilot. Exercise Intervention- PACE-Life: Subjects will be provided with a Fitbit wristband and instructed how to use it.</description>

        <description>Mean difference in weighted average motivation score (relative autonomy index) from Baseline to Post Treatment (24 weeks) and to Follow-Up Visit (up to 28 weeks). The BREQ-2 is a 19 item self-report scale. Answers are on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4. Zero corresponds to &quot;not true for me&quot; and 4 corresponds to &quot;very true for me.&quot; Possible scores range from -24 to +20. Each subscale is calculated from averages (items scored 0-4) and then a weight is applied. Higher scores reflect better outcomes (higher autonomous motivation to exercise).</description>

            <description>This is a pilot project with one single group that will be evaluated on the adherence to a walking protocol (Exercise Intervention- PACE-Life). Subjects will be walking two times a week under the supervision of the psychiatric clinic. In addition, subjects will be encouraged to add walking on their own on the days when subjects are not exercising under the supervision of the clinic. This pilot will be used to inform the final design of the subsequent randomized clinical trial that will be implemented following this pilot. Exercise Intervention- PACE-Life: Subjects will be provided with a Fitbit wristband and instructed how to use it.</description>

          <title>Single Arm Experimental Walking Group</title>
          <description>This is a pilot project with one single group that will be evaluated on the adherence to a walking protocol (Exercise Intervention- PACE-Life). Subjects will be walking two times a week under the supervision of the psychiatric clinic. In addition, subjects will be encouraged to add walking on their own on the days when subjects are not exercising under the supervision of the clinic. This pilot will be used to inform the final design of the subsequent randomized clinical trial that will be implemented following this pilot.&#xD;
Exercise Intervention- PACE-Life: Subjects will be provided with a Fitbit wristband and instructed how to use it.</description>
