    <textblock>
      Phase 1b - To assess the safety/tolerability of VERU-111 and to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose of VERU-111 in patients with metastatic, castration resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      who have failed a novel androgen blocking agent therapy (mCRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - To estimate the PSA50 response rate, defined as a decline in PSA to ≥50% of&#xD;
      baseline level, confirmed with a second measurement at least 3 weeks apart (PCWG3).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 7 sites in the US only with approximately 18 patients for Phase 1b portion (3 patients&#xD;
      per dose group) of the study. Additional patients may be enrolled into the Phase 1b portion&#xD;
      of the study depending on the safety and tolerability assessment in the dose escalation&#xD;
      scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 26 patients will be enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b Approximately 18 patients for Phase 1b portion (3 patients per dose group) will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study. Additional subjects may be enrolled based on the assessment of&#xD;
      safety and tolerability in the dose escalation scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VERU-111 will be administered orally for three 21-day cycles in which the patient will take&#xD;
      the study drug (capsules) daily with food for 7 days and then have a 14-day treatment free&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation Criteria In Phase 1b, three patients will be planned at each dose level and&#xD;
      followed for one 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 0/3 patients exhibit a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) after one 21-day cycle, the next&#xD;
           patient will be treated at the next dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If one patient out of the 3 exhibits a DLT related to the study agent, the cohort will&#xD;
           be expanded to up to 6 patients. If 1 of 6 patients exhibits a DLT related to the study&#xD;
           agent, then the next patient will enroll at the next dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 2 of the first 3 subjects OR 2 of the first 6 patients exhibit a DLT related to the&#xD;
           study agent, the MTD is considered to have been determined and at least 3 additional&#xD;
           patients will be entered at the dose level below the one at which DLT is observed. Dose&#xD;
           escalations will occur no sooner than 3 weeks after the last patient on the dose level&#xD;
           has begun therapy to allow for full assessment of DLT. No intra-patient escalation will&#xD;
           be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If &lt;1 of 6 patients experience a DLT, this will be the recommended Phase 2 dose for the&#xD;
           expansion cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cohort Review Committee, consisting of investigators, the medical monitor and the sponsor,&#xD;
      will monitor the trial on an ongoing basis for safety and will guide dose escalation&#xD;
      decisions based on the occurrence of DLTs as described in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned dosing for VERU-111 in the Phase 1b portion will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group Daily dose Dosing Regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 4.5mg Daily dosing on Day 1-7 of each 21-day cycle for 3 cycles Treatment may continue&#xD;
           past the planned three 21-day cycles until DLT or disease progression is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 9mg Daily dosing on Day 1-7 of each 21-day cycle for 3 cycles Treatment may continue&#xD;
           past the planned three 21-day cycles until DLT or disease progression is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 18mg Daily dosing on Day 1-7 of each 21-day cycle for 3 cycles Treatment may continue&#xD;
           past the planned three 21-day cycles until DLT or disease progression is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 27mg Daily dosing on Day 1-7 of each 21-day cycle for 3 cycles Treatment may continue&#xD;
           past the planned three 21-day cycles until DLT or disease progression is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 36mg Daily dosing on Day 1-7 of each 21-day cycle for 3 cycles Treatment may continue&#xD;
           past the planned three 21-day cycles until DLT or disease progression is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 45mg1 Daily dosing on Day 1-7 of each 21-day cycle for 3 cycles Treatment may continue&#xD;
           past the planned three 21-day cycles until DLT or disease progression is&#xD;
           observed.Treatment may continue past the planned three 21-day cycles until DLT or&#xD;
           disease progression is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 If after the first 21-day cycle for the 45 mg in Treatment Group 5 no DLT is observed, then&#xD;
      additional dose levels and additional dosing schedules (i.e. 14 days of daily dosing followed&#xD;
      by a 7-day treatment free period) may be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 The maximum tolerated dose of VERU-111 identified in the Phase 1b portion of the&#xD;
      study will be used in the Phase 2 portion of the study. The dosing regimen will be daily&#xD;
      dosing for 7 days followed by a 14-day treatment free period (21-day cycle). Three 21-day&#xD;
      cycles are planned in this study. However, treatment may continue past the planned three&#xD;
      21-day cycles until DLT or disease progression is observed.&#xD;
