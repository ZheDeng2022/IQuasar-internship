  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To maintain mobility as we age we must navigate a complex environment that challenges us with&#xD;
      a range of disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, older adults are often unsuccessful in resisting these disturbances, and fall.&#xD;
      Falls are the greatest source of injury, and for older adults, the greatest source of&#xD;
      injury-related death. Approximately a quarter of falls happen following slips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research on slips has shown that use of perturbation training to improve specific&#xD;
      motor skills to resist slips can vastly reduce falls. However, these interventions have only&#xD;
      addressed slips occurring at heel-strike, and not the diverse range of slipping disturbances&#xD;
      presented by a complex environment. This project will focus on slips that occur across the&#xD;
      gait cycle, and the reactive stabilization movements that follow. Slips at different phases&#xD;
      of the gait cycle have unique biomechanical contexts, and successful reactive stabilization&#xD;
      movements are likely to be highly specific to that context. Yet nothing is known about the&#xD;
      specificity of the repertoire of reactive stabilization movements to resist different slip&#xD;
      conditions. Furthermore, variability in the repertoire of reactive stabilization movements is&#xD;
      likely to affect the success/failure rate of resisting these disturbances. Thus, the&#xD;
      objective of the proposed project is to determine the roles of variability and specificity in&#xD;
      reactive stabilization movements to resist falling in diverse slipping conditions. A novel&#xD;
      wearable apparatus for slip perturbations will deliver lifelike, unexpected slips in early,&#xD;
      middle and late stance in younger and older adults. Biomechanical analysis based on&#xD;
      three-dimensional motion capture data of the reactive stabilization movements will generate&#xD;
      novel results on the specificity and variability of protective stepping and arm swinging&#xD;
      responses. The central hypothesis is that increases in specificity and decreases in&#xD;
      variability of reactive stabilization movements will reduce fall rates. The first specific&#xD;
      aim is to quantify variability and specificity of reactive responses to diverse slip&#xD;
      perturbations and determine their relationships to fall rates. The second specific aim is to&#xD;
      determine how repeated exposure to diverse slip perturbations affects reactive responses, and&#xD;
      whether it relates to gait variability. The long-term objective of this research is to&#xD;
      support future studies into the repertoire of reactive stabilization movements across the&#xD;
      full range of disturbances faced in navigating the environment.&#xD;

      Subjects will be recruited through fliers from local exercise and community centers,&#xD;
      independent senior living centers, and on the campus of the University of Nebraska at Omaha.&#xD;
      Younger subjects age 19-35 years will be recruited. Older adults age 65-79 years will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At entry in the study, all subjects must self-report to be free from the following: history&#xD;
      of 1 or more falls in the previous year, ear infections, vertigo, Meniere's disease, chronic&#xD;
      dizziness. Subjects will not be excluded, but information will be collected on the following&#xD;
      factors: hip/knee replacements, pain in the body, body-mass index, daily physical activity&#xD;
      measures. A written informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of the&#xD;
      University of Nebraska Medical Center (the IRB of record) will be obtained prior to the&#xD;
      screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures Overview: Analysis of responses and falls from diverse slip perturbations&#xD;
      will take place in the main Motion Analysis Laboratory of the Biomechanics Research Building&#xD;
      at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Each subject will participate in 3 visits within the&#xD;
      span of 1 week. On the initial visit, subjects will perform informed consent, then be asked&#xD;
      to provide demographic information (age, gender, height, body mass), a medical questionnaire&#xD;
      to assess exclusion criteria, and a physical activity questionnaire. Upper and lower body&#xD;
      strength will be measured using a hand-held dynamometer during the first and last visits. On&#xD;
      each of the three visits, subjects will perform a gait variability assessment followed by a&#xD;
      diverse slip perturbation assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait variability assessment procedures: Before recording data, retroreflective markers will&#xD;
      be placed on specific anatomical locations. These locations are defined to create a full-body&#xD;
      dynamics model. Following familiarization, subjects will walk on a treadmill for 5 minutes at&#xD;
      a prescribed pace of 1.3 meters per second while whole body kinematics are collected. Both&#xD;
      linear and nonlinear measures of gait variability will be calculated (Table 1) to determine&#xD;
      possible relationships between these measures and other outcome variables such as learning&#xD;
      rate for reactive movements, and fall rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diverse slip perturbation assessment procedures: subjects will walk overground back and forth&#xD;
      across a large motion capture area. Previous studies show that walking speed is highly&#xD;
      correlated with some outcome measures, specifically variations in whole body angular&#xD;
      momentum, gait variability measures, and loss of balance following a slip. Therefore, we will&#xD;
      control gait speed across all subjects to 1.3 Â± 0.2 m/s, a typically comfortable speed for&#xD;
      both younger and older adults. Participants will be informed that a slip may occur, and that&#xD;
      if slipped, they should attempt to maintain balance and continue walking. Subjects will then&#xD;
      be slipped without warning at a randomly chosen time after 1 to 3 minutes of walking. Slips&#xD;
      will be administered to both feet simultaneously during early, middle or late stance in a&#xD;
      randomized order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each slip, subjects will rest seated for 5 minutes. During this rest period, motion&#xD;
      capture data and force data from the harness will be recorded, and the WASP will be reset for&#xD;
      the next trial. Subjects will complete four slips in each of early, middle, and late stance&#xD;
      on each visit. Measures of falls, slip severity, and reactive stabilization movements will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
