  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amblyopia is treated by glasses and patches or blurring eyedrops to the good eye. This works&#xD;
      in about 70% of children, but parents and children strongly dislike these treatments which&#xD;
      may carry on for years and involve frequent clinic visits. In this pilot trial, 66 children&#xD;
      will receive, at random, either a Nintendo 3DSXL console with movies, or standard&#xD;
      patching/blurring eye-drop treatment. The Investigators will monitor adverse events (double&#xD;
      vision), change in the balance between the two eyes and in visual acuity over 16 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Lazy eye&quot; (amblyopia) is the commonest sight problem in children, affecting about one in 30&#xD;
      children. It is caused by a difference in spectacle prescription between the eyes and/or a&#xD;
      squint (eye misalignment), with the brain ignoring one eye. Amblyopia is treated by glasses&#xD;
      and patches or blurring eyedrops to the good eye. This works in about 70% of children, but&#xD;
      parents and children strongly dislike these treatments which may carry on for years and&#xD;
      involve frequent clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators have developed an exciting new treatment: children watch customized movies&#xD;
      for an hour a day on a hand-held 3D computer-game console. The Investigators blur the picture&#xD;
      that the good eye sees to match it with what the weaker eye sees. They have tested this&#xD;
      approach on 22 children, with an average improvement in vision by three lines on the test&#xD;
      chart over 8 - 24 weeks, which may be faster than with standard treatment. Parents and&#xD;
      children the Investigators have spoken with like both the idea of research in this area and&#xD;
      the engaging nature of this device. The Investigators now need to assess how the new&#xD;
      treatment compares with standard treatment, but first need to ensure that the new treatment&#xD;
      is safe and that families will use it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot trial, 66 children will receive, at random, either a Nintendo 3DSXL console&#xD;
      with movies, or standard patching/blurring eye-drop treatment. The Investigators will monitor&#xD;
      adverse events (double vision), change in the balance between the two eyes and in visual&#xD;
      acuity over 16 weeks. Parents and children have helped develop this pilot - this involvement&#xD;
      will be continued throughout the study. At study completion, children and parents will be&#xD;
      involved in deciding how best to communicate the findings on hospital websites, in&#xD;
      newsletters, at conferences and in medical journals.&#xD;

    <description>The experimental intervention will be BBV treatment, i.e. viewing movies for one hour or 2x30min/day on a Nintendo 3DSXL console. With this technology, the Investigators will show blurred images to the better-seeing eye and normal images to the amblyopic eye, encouraging the use of the amblyopic eye and improving acuity.</description>
