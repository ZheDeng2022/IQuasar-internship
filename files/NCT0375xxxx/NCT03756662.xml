  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate both the safety and feasibility of the surgical&#xD;
      implantation of the ARGOS-SC implant during non-penetrating glaucoma surgery and the safety&#xD;
      and usability of the ARGOS-SC implant and system in the year following the implantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm clinical&#xD;
      investigation. Subjects will be followed up at regular intervals for one year following&#xD;
      implantation to collect safety and performance information. Enrollment will be halted at&#xD;
      every serious adverse device event (SADE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensor device is intended to be permanently implanted suprachoroidal in the human eye&#xD;
      during non-penetrating glaucoma surgery and is used in conjunction with the hand-held&#xD;
      MESOGRAPH reading device to telemetrically measure the intraocular pressure (IOP) of the&#xD;
      implanted eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation was based on the study's dual purpose of establishing safety and&#xD;
      comparability of IOP measurements with the ARGOS-SC system to those made with GAT and DCT.&#xD;
      IOP measurements will be made with all devices at various time points, resulting in a within&#xD;
      individual control for IOP variables. Based on these calculations (performance, safety) and&#xD;
      considering possible drop-outs, the exploratory investigation will enroll 24 patients. The&#xD;
      minimum number of measurements required to hold the performance claim is approx. 120. With&#xD;
      multiple (&gt;8) measurements with either method (ARGOS, GAT) per patient, a sufficient number&#xD;
      of paired measurements (in total &gt;&gt;120 measurement pairs) will be available to show&#xD;
      equivalence of the methods (primary objective).&#xD;
