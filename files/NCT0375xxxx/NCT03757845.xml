  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a global epidemic associated with inflammation, aggressive&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and increased risk for, and severity of, coronary artery disease. Strategies&#xD;
      to improve glycemic control with insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents have not impacted&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in type II DM patients with known heart disease. The&#xD;
      Investigators have found that the typical &quot;Western&quot; diet, which is high in saturated fats,&#xD;
      such as the lipid palmitate, but low in unsaturated fats, such as the lipid oleate, results&#xD;
      in changes to cell membrane lipid content and disruptions to membrane functional domains&#xD;
      -called caveolae- that are associated with insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. In&#xD;
      mice, the investigators found that palmitate induces both systolic and diastolic contractile&#xD;
      dysfunction. They have demonstrated, in cell cultures, that oleate prevents palmitate-induced&#xD;
      cell dysfunction. This may explain how a diet rich in unsaturated fats and plant-derived&#xD;
      flavonoids, such as the &quot;Mediterranean&quot; diet, can counter the adverse cardiovascular effects&#xD;
      of DM. This study builds in these prior findings and its central hypothesis is that, in DM, a&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet can induce rapid changes in cardiac cell membrane lipid composition and&#xD;
      signaling. This is a randomized dietary intervention in DM subjects scheduled for coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, to examine the effects of a short-term modified&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet (ModMeD), compared to the standard cardiac DM diet (SCaDMD), on receptor&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase signaling, serum and cellular lipid content, and membrane/caveolae function.&#xD;

      Study Design: The study is a prospective, un-blinded, randomized interventional clinical&#xD;
      trial comparing ModMeD to standard cardiac diet in 48 (24 per arm) inpatients with type II DM&#xD;
      scheduled for CABG at MMC and who are scheduled to stay in the hospital for four (4) or more&#xD;
      days prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it is not feasible to blind the subjects or clinicians, laboratory investigators&#xD;
      processing specimens and analyzing biological responses to the intervention will be blinded.&#xD;
      Specifically, tissue samples will be de-identified and coded before transferring to the&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine if a Mediterranean diet causes rapid changes in lipid content&#xD;
      (as determined by mass spectrometry) and in cardiac cell activity (as determined by ERBB2&#xD;
      expression level) among patients with TIIDM undergoing CABG surgery at MMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard Cardiac DM Diet (SCaDMD) during the inpatient stay (before and after CABG&#xD;
           surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mediterranean Diet (MedD) during the inpatient stay (before and after CABG surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject recruitment: 48 inpatient adults will be enrolled (age ≥ 18 years diagnosed with type&#xD;
      II DM with hemoglobin A1c level greater than 7.5% and coronary artery disease with planned&#xD;
      surgical revascularization (CABG)) at MMC. Other inclusion criteria include planned&#xD;
      pre-surgical hospital stay of at least 4 days, and willingness to have the Mediterranean Diet&#xD;
      restricted menu for the duration of their inpatient stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent Process: Via an IRB-approved partial HIPAA waiver, the clinical team will&#xD;
      screen for eligible patients who are scheduled for CABG surgery. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      approached by their clinical team to gauge interest in study participation. Patients who&#xD;
      indicate interest will be approached by a study team member to explain the study fully and&#xD;
      obtain informed consent. Patients who sign the informed consent form for this research will&#xD;
      have agreed to: 1) have baseline body measurements 2) be randomized to consume a&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet or the standard cardiac DM diet during their hospital stay, 3) undergo a&#xD;
      biopsy procedure at the time of their CABG and to donate ventricular myocardium tissue&#xD;
      approximately the size of a grain of rice, 4) donate tissue usually discarded during surgery&#xD;
      (cardiac right atrial tissue, skeletal muscle and fat), 5) donate a total of 30 ml of blood&#xD;
      collected at 3 time points: prior to, during, and 4 days post CABG surgery, 6) to fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires about their food consumption and 7) allow the review of their medical record&#xD;
      for their cardiovascular health information. The informed consent will include itemized&#xD;
      patient responsibilities such as completing dietary questionnaire accurately, and adhering to&#xD;
      diet restrictions, including the requirement that patient families do not bring outside food&#xD;
      items to patients. Interested patients and their families will be given ample opportunity to&#xD;
      ask questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Questionnaire: Upon obtaining informed consent all subjects will complete a dietary&#xD;
      questionnaire (DHQ II) provided to them by a registered dietitian staffing Cardiology&#xD;
      Inpatient floors at MMC. The DHQ II is an online food frequency questionnaire advanced by the&#xD;
      NIH (https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/dhq2/about). The original DHQI was developed by the Risk&#xD;
      Factor Assessment Branch and validated to show that it provides reasonable nutrient estimates&#xD;
      26-29. The DHQII is an updated version with 10 more food items (134 instead of 124) and 8&#xD;
      dietary supplements. The DHQII has 4 versions that differ by time frame and portion size&#xD;
      questions. We will utilize the one-month option (Appendix A) that includes portion sizes.&#xD;
      This is a self-administered questionnaire to be completed by the patient that takes about an&#xD;
      hour. Subjects will be offered the online version via portable tablet or a paper version.&#xD;
      DHQII data will be analyzed using the Diet*Calc software program freely available from the&#xD;
      NCI (https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/dhq2/dietcalc/). This program generates nutrient and food&#xD;
      group intake estimates for the standard versions of the DHQII used in this study. Data from&#xD;
      the dietary questionnaire will allow us to conduct a number of exploratory analyses that have&#xD;
      not been attempted before. For example, we will look for associations between the abundance&#xD;
      of certain lipid species with patient unsaturated and saturated fat intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline anthropometrics: Height (m) and weight (kg) will be measured using standard clinical&#xD;
      equipment and will be verified by a study team member. This information will be used to&#xD;
      calculate body mass index (BMI), at the time of enrollment. A study team member will also&#xD;
      measure waist and hip circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: After subjects have been screened for eligibility and have provided informed&#xD;
      consent, they will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two dietary interventions.&#xD;
      Randomization will be implemented by the study statistician and will be involve&#xD;
      stratification by gender in alternating blocks of 4 and 6. nQuery randomizer will be used to&#xD;
      create the randomization scheme; the randomization list will be transferred to sealed,&#xD;
      opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes, one set for each stratum. At the time of&#xD;
      randomization, the next numbered envelope will be opened to determine study group assignment.&#xD;
      Study dietitians will ensure diet assignments are communicated and followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Cardiac DM Diet (SCaDMD): As per current nutritional guidelines, all subjects will&#xD;
      receive standard instruction and the dietary menu (Appendix B) from an MMC dietitians. based&#xD;
      upon their diagnoses of DM and coronary disease. Patients will be prescribed a cardiac diet,&#xD;
      which is a lower fat diet, and if desired by the practitioner, additional sodium or&#xD;
      carbohydrate restrictions may be included on a case by case basis. Study dietitians will&#xD;
      supervise will the recording of record food consumption daily from enrollment until day 4&#xD;
      post CABG surgery by 1) direct questioning, 2) review of food orders placed by the patient,&#xD;
      and 3) examination of food trays upon completion of meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediterranean Diet (MedD): The MMC registered dietitians have created a sub-menu (Appendix C)&#xD;
      from the existing MMC inpatient menu that is compliant with the Mediterranean diet as&#xD;
      described by Casas et al. (2016)20 and was used in the PREDIMED trial. The only difference&#xD;
      between the Mediterranean diet used in this study that used in the PREDIMED trial is the&#xD;
      exclusion of wine and sofrito, a sauce used as a base in Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and&#xD;
      Latin American cooking. This was due to the limits of MMC cafeteria. Upon randomization,&#xD;
      study dietitians will meet with the subject to review the ModMeD and guide their food&#xD;
      selection. Study dietitians will also meet with floor nurses to explain the difference&#xD;
      between the standard diet and the Mediterranean diet and to explain the study procedures to&#xD;
      record food consumption. Study dietitians will supervise the recording of food consumption&#xD;
      daily from enrollment until day 4 post CABG surgery by 1) direct questioning, 2) review of&#xD;
      food orders placed by the patient, and 3) examination of food trays upon completion of meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biologic Sample collection: Ventricular cardiac tissue, atrial cardiac tissue, and skeletal&#xD;
      intercostal muscle will be collected from study participants during their CABG surgery. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected at three time points: 1) at enrollment (on the day of the&#xD;
      questionnaire and anthropomorphic measurements), 2) on the day of surgery, and 3) before&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital. All samples will be de-identified, coded, packaged per Category&#xD;
      B regulations and transported by courier to MMCRI. Samples will be received, logged and&#xD;
      processed by trained lab personnel. Any excess tissue not utilized for this study will be&#xD;
      banked and distributed by the BioBank for non-specified research if patient consent has been&#xD;
      obtained for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen handling: Blood specimens will be left at room temperature for 15-20 minutes and&#xD;
      then centrifuged for 30 minutes. The supernatant (serum) will be collected and stored on ice&#xD;
      for transport to MMCRI. We have performed tests to evaluate the stability of lipids in blood&#xD;
      serum and have found that lipids are stable for up to 3 hours at room temperature. All tissue&#xD;
      will be frozen as soon as possible and transported frozen on dry ice to MMCRI. All serum and&#xD;
      tissue samples will be stored at -80ºC. Experience has shown that samples remain unchanged&#xD;
      for more than 1 year under these conditions. Sample analysis will be performed when all&#xD;
      samples have been collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventricular tissue: Anterior left ventricular (LV), free wall epicardial biopsies (1.5mm x&#xD;
      1.5-7mm deep/length) will be obtained from patients undergoing bypass surgery by their&#xD;
      cardiac surgeon at the time of the surgery25,30. Specifically, the biopsy will be performed&#xD;
      after cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion is initiated and once the aorta has been clamped and&#xD;
      cardioplegia administered. An area approximately the size of a grain of rice on the surface&#xD;
      of the anterior wall of the left ventricle free of epicardial fat will be chosen for the&#xD;
      biopsy. The biopsy will be performed in parallel with other procedures to prepare the patient&#xD;
      for grafts and will not add to the overall surgery time. The tissue will be placed in&#xD;
      physiological buffer solution for cell isolations or lipid extraction for lipidomic&#xD;
      profiling. Cell isolations will be performed as soon as possible after tissue is received at&#xD;
      MMCRI. Tissue that will be used for lipid extractions can be frozen at -80ºC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial tissue: The atrial tissue will come from the discarded right atrial appendage (RAA)&#xD;
      during surgery. Atrial tissue is considerably larger than the ventricular biopsy and allows&#xD;
      us to subdivide each sample. One piece will be placed into physiologic buffer for cell&#xD;
      isolation. A second piece will be placed in formalin and used for immunofluorescence. The&#xD;
      third will be stored in RNAlater® Solution to stabilize RNA until extraction. The final piece&#xD;
      will be frozen for isolation of caveolae fractions, lipidomic and protein profiling, and&#xD;
      western blotting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skeletal intercostal muscle tissue: Intercostal muscle is removed during surgery in order to&#xD;
      access the left internal mammary artery, which is used to provide a bypass graft. The&#xD;
      discarded intercostal skeletal muscle will be divided into two pieces, one frozen for&#xD;
      isolation of caveolae fractions, lipidomic and protein profiling, and western blotting, and&#xD;
      the second either placed in formalin and used for immunofluorescence, placed in physiologic&#xD;
      buffer for cell isolation, or placed in RNAlater® Solution to stabilize RNA until extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood: A baseline blood sample will be drawn via venipuncture once before surgery (on the day&#xD;
      of diet questionnaire administration when patient is having daily clinically-indicated blood&#xD;
      draws) to evaluate monocyte expression of CAV as well as plasma lipidomic profiles. Follow-up&#xD;
      blood samples will be taken at two other times points: the day of the surgery via a central&#xD;
      line and 4 days after the surgery and before discharge via venipucture. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected into 2 5-ml tubes, an ACD (Acid Citrate Dextrose) anticoagulant tube and a&#xD;
      red-capped SST tube and refrigerated or processed within 3h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: The medical records of the participants will be reviewed to abstract&#xD;
      demographic and clinical data as specified below. Patient data collection will occur at&#xD;
      enrollment and approximately 1 month post surgery (for a maximum of three six months). The&#xD;
      data will be entered into a study specific, HIPAA-compliant, REDCap database, along with&#xD;
      intervention-specific data (questionnaire data, anthropomorphic measurements and diet&#xD;
      information). These data, which includes patient names and other identifiers, will only be&#xD;
      accessible to clinical investigators. Laboratory data will be maintained separately. Clinical&#xD;
      data will be coded and exported for collation with laboratory data and analysis without other&#xD;
      personal identifiers. The link to the code will be accessible only to clinical investigators.&#xD;

      8.0 Laboratory Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1 Expression levels of ERBB and other proteins: Cell surface ERBB2 expression in atrial&#xD;
      endothelial cells will be assessed by flow cytometry. Also, levels of ERBB2, CAV1/3, and&#xD;
      IRS-1, will be determined by Western blot using specific antibodies (CAV1: BD# 610058, mouse&#xD;
      or Cell Signaling; CAV3: BD# 610420, mouse IRS-1: BD#611395, mouse. pY989-IRS-1: Santa Cruz,&#xD;
      SC-17200-R, rabbit, total ERBB2: Life Technologies. pERBB2/Tyr1248: Millipore, 06-229, in&#xD;
      combination with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated FITC, Abcam, ab6717). pAkt levels will be&#xD;
      assessed in circulating monocytes collected from whole blood as well as in isolated atrial&#xD;
      and ventricular endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional lipid and protein analysis: Lipid composition of the baseline plasma samples will&#xD;
      be compared with that obtained from the corresponding atrial and ventricular tissue samples&#xD;
      to assess the degree that fasting circulating lipids represent tissue content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-myocyte single cell suspension will be prepared from atrial tissue using collagenase&#xD;
      II/Dispase II digestion as described36. ERBB receptor and CAV1 and 2 levels in conjunction&#xD;
      with cell-specific markers will be measured by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size/Power: Pilot data was used to determine the likely levels of several measures in&#xD;
      our study population and have chosen one to use for a power analysis, cell surface ERBB2&#xD;
      expression in atrial endothelial cells. Pilot data using fluorescence based flow cytometry&#xD;
      revealed a mean of 9.56 and SD of 3.14 for this measure in diabetic patients (Fig. 3). Thus,&#xD;
      target sample size of 24 patients in each study group will allow for detection of a&#xD;
      difference of 2.64 in this measure (hypothesized to be similar in the control group to our&#xD;
      preliminary data and higher in the intervention group) with 80% power and a significance&#xD;
      level of 0.05. Secondary analyses of plasma lipid content and monocyte signaling will be&#xD;
      repeated measures analysis, which will add additional power given that we will have multiple&#xD;
      observations per person, and take away some power given the necessity for adjusting p values&#xD;
      for multiple comparisons by time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: This will be an intention-to-treat analysis. The success of randomization will be&#xD;
      evaluated by comparing patient characteristics at baseline using proportions or means and SDs&#xD;
      using by chi-square tests or Student's t-tests, as appropriate. Within group changes (i.e.&#xD;
      delta score) and between group differences in measures taken at serial time points (blood&#xD;
      serum) will be analyzed by mixed model repeated measures ANOVA; the mixed model will be&#xD;
      required because patients are likely to have different duration of dietary exposure and,&#xD;
      therefore, different numbers of repeated measures. Variables of interest are time, treatment&#xD;
      group, and the time by treatment interaction. Model results will be used to estimate mean&#xD;
      values and change over time for within-group and between-group comparisons. Graphical&#xD;
      techniques and time point-specific p values will be used to identify the time course of any&#xD;
      observed changes, e.g., how quickly the dietary intervention might lead to differences in the&#xD;
      measures examined. Significance will be identified at the P&lt;0.05 level, with appropriate&#xD;
      adjustment for multiple comparisons where applicable. In the lipidomic analyses a false&#xD;
      discovery rate of 0.05 will be set and FDR-corrected P values will be reported. The linear&#xD;
      relationship between the change in specific signaling measures (ERBB levels) and the change&#xD;
      in lipid species (SM and other classes) will be examined using Pearson's correlation&#xD;
      coefficient. Analysis will be conducted in SAS.&#xD;
