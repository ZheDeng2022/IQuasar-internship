  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this first-in-human phase I study is to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      HAL-MRE1 subcutaneous immunotherapy in subjects suffering from ragweed pollen-induced&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis with or without asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 4 treatment groups: 1 placebo group and 3 groups treated with different doses&#xD;
      of HAL-MRE1.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A chemically modified, aluminum hydroxide adsorbed ragweed extract (HAL-MRE1) for&#xD;
      subcutaneous administration was developed for the treatment of ragweed pollen-induced&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) with or without asthma. The aim of this&#xD;
      first-in-human phase I study is to assess the safety and tolerability of HAL-MRE1&#xD;
      subcutaneous immunotherapy in subjects suffering from ragweed pollen-induced ARC with or&#xD;
      without asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 3 staggered cohorts of 15 subjects each who are randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the active or placebo group in a 2:1 manner using block randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one month gap must be maintained between the end of the ragweed pollen peak season (2018)&#xD;
      and subject randomization into the study. The study has seasonal constraints; subjects with&#xD;
      concomitant tree and/or grass pollen allergies must complete study treatment before any&#xD;
      allergy symptoms due to tree and/or grass pollen exposure develop or start study treatment&#xD;
      after the symptoms caused by the tree and/or grass pollen exposure have disappeared.&#xD;
