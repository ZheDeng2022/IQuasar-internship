      INTRODUCTION Background Children Cancer in Pakistan: Millions of people are affected by&#xD;
      cancer worldwide. Cancer is one of the major health problems in Pakistan . About 8,000&#xD;
      children below 18 year were diagnosed with cancer annually. Most children diagnosed in&#xD;
      advance stage . In Pakistan 31% children had leukemia, 20% had Lymphoma, 08 % had sarcoma, 8&#xD;
      % had bone tumor, 7% had brain tumor, 6 % had retinoblastoma, 5 % had wilms tumor, 4% had&#xD;
      germ cell tumor, 4 % had neuroblastoma and the other had 7 % .Cancer affects family&#xD;
      emotionally and physically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy and side effect: Millions of people are also facing difficulties due to&#xD;
      chemotherapy worldwide. If the patient will not prepare for chemotherapy treatment properly&#xD;
      he/she can face problem in future .Chemotherapy is the common method of treatment. The common&#xD;
      side effects of chemotherapy are diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, hair loss, neuropathy, weight&#xD;
      loss, dysphagia, oral ulcer, fatigue, dyspnea, constipation, insomnia and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, also affects quality of life, economic conditions, emotions and social wellbeing.&#xD;
      Before starting chemotherapy treatment the patient should receive written information about&#xD;
      diagnoses, treatment goal, chemotherapy duration, side effects of drugs, the material should&#xD;
      design at the level of patient knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer vs anxiety depression: The anxiety is due to unawareness about chemotherapy side&#xD;
      effect. 47% victims of patient have anxiety due to cancer . The power to control disease can&#xD;
      be lost due to anxiety .Side effect of chemotherapy management required self-care and it is&#xD;
      can be effect due to depression. Anxiety and depression has an association with cancer,&#xD;
      chemotherapy related fatigue, lack of education about chemotherapy side effect management and&#xD;
      long term exposure of children in hospital . Cancer treatment required nursing intervention&#xD;
      to reduce anxiety and depression . Anxiety leads to delay chemotherapy treatment and&#xD;
      prognoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidences of Multimedia education to reduce Anxiety and depression: It is the main&#xD;
      responsibility of Oncology nurse to educate patient about the management of side effect of&#xD;
      chemotherapy but mostly patient received written material only. The recommended practice to&#xD;
      reduce anxiety of patient is to educate about side effect of chemotherapy. The patient should&#xD;
      be education both for short term management and long-term management. Education about side&#xD;
      effect helps to decrease anxiety. The effect of multimedia education to reduce anxiety is&#xD;
      evident in mammography, MRI, ECT, cardiac surgeries, gynecological laparotomy, laparoscopic&#xD;
      cystectomy, hemodialysis, teeth removal and peptic ulcer disease. Nursing intervention&#xD;
      through education helps to reduce anxiety and stress , after chemotherapy, promote side&#xD;
      effect management, decrease complications and increase psychological wellbeing. Many resource&#xD;
      centers for patient education on cancer are available on internet about chemotherapy and side&#xD;
      effect to increase the psychosocial health. The resources can be utilized as a part of&#xD;
      continuous nursing education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety and depression in Pakistan: Anxiety and depression is more common in Pakistan due to&#xD;
      lack of infrastructure for mental health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: The main aim of this study is to find the effect of nurse let chemotherapy&#xD;
      education on parent's anxiety as in children case parents are the key role for securing among&#xD;
      children cancer. The study will help to examine the effect of psycho-education about&#xD;
      chemotherapy and side effect management on parent's anxiety and depression at Indus children&#xD;
      cancer Hospital, Karachi Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature Review&#xD;
&#xD;
      International Findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      European study found that 20 minutes of video education is more effective with verbal and&#xD;
      written education . A randomize control trial was done by Williams and Schreier (2005), on&#xD;
      RCT(N=71), the experimental group (n-38) received audiotaped 20 minutes of education on&#xD;
      management of fatigue, sleep disturbance and anxiety along with standard care and the control&#xD;
      group (n=33) received verbal instruction and written material. The anxiety level was measured&#xD;
      at 1 month and 2 months. Larger number of patient (n=16) in control group reported anxiety as&#xD;
      compared to experimental group (n=10) significantly (p=0.001). Similar result were found from&#xD;
      the study of Malone (2007) that education helps to reduce anxiety. Another study mentioned&#xD;
      that familiarity with environment of chemotherapy is necessary as it also impact on anxiety.&#xD;
      Almost 50% cases diagnosed with cancer reported the symptoms of anxiety. According to NCCN&#xD;
      guideline, the anxiety management related to chemotherapy and side effect management is the&#xD;
      primary responsibility of oncology team including oncology nurse . Study from USA mentioned&#xD;
      that, the caregiver of children diagnosed with cancer have 44% greater stress as compared to&#xD;
      24% parents of healthy children . Another study mentioned that 98% participant were satisfied&#xD;
      with chemotherapy educational experience, 100 % participants mentioned that educational&#xD;
      environment is supportive, 81% feel that quality of life can be improved through education .&#xD;
      Another study mentioned, 87.6% participant were satisfied with chemotherapy education, 87.5 %&#xD;
      agree that it helps to reduce anxiety, 93.3% participant felt that it will be effective if&#xD;
      given first time before chemotherapy, 86.6% participant was satisfied for 30 minutes of&#xD;
      education timing before chemotherapy treatment. 85.7% participant report that quite room&#xD;
      environment is effective for chemotherapy education .In another study mentioned that, 84%&#xD;
      patient report that educational class was help to reduce anxiety and 64.7% participant&#xD;
      disagree for education in group . A randomize control trail was conducted in Greenville and&#xD;
      founded that 23% participant in control group report anxiety after 1 month of treatment as&#xD;
      compared to 14% in interventional group significantly . Written information before&#xD;
      chemotherapy should be provided to patient, the information should include chemotherapy and&#xD;
      side effect, future plan, and follow-up . Many studies had mentioned that that&#xD;
      psycho-education is effective to reduce anxiety during chemotherapy management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study from Rawalpindi reported that 10-25% participant reported anxiety and depression&#xD;
      during chemotherapy and 16% have anxiety and 27% have depression . Another study mentioned&#xD;
      that myeloid leukemia is commonly diagnosed in younger age but mostly reported in chronic&#xD;
      phase . A study from Lahore mentioned that 56% parents have depression, higher in mothers&#xD;
      specially those who are low educated and had poor socio-economical class. A study from&#xD;
      Karachi mentioned caregiver stress related to cancer patient s, 17% mild, 34% moderate and 49&#xD;
      % severe stress. It was also conclude that caregiver stress for cancer patient had&#xD;
      significant association with caregiver age, relationship with child , female gender and&#xD;
      longer duration of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of Problem Children cannot look after themselves. Parents are the primary caregiver&#xD;
      of children. If they initially feel anxiety and depression, it will be difficult for them to&#xD;
      manage chemotherapy and side effects. Education about chemotherapy is neglected due to heavy&#xD;
      workload and other responsibilities. More than 50% of individual newly diagnosed with cancer&#xD;
      have unknown anxiety related to chemotherapy and their side effect . Those who do not receive&#xD;
      chemotherapy education prior to treatment face difficulties in later life . The side effects&#xD;
      of chemotherapy like vomiting, nausea, loss of appetite and fatigue were managed through&#xD;
      self-care . After an intensive literature review it was found that no study was conducted in&#xD;
      Pakistan focusing effect of nurse-led multimedia education and telephonic follow up, on&#xD;
      chemotherapy side effects management for parent's anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of Study Pediatric cancer is the leading cause of children mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      in Pakistan. More than 8,000 children under 18 year of age were diagnosed with cancer in a&#xD;
      year. Cancer treatment were managed by the parents specially mother. Evidences showed lack of&#xD;
      knowledge about chemotherapy and dissatisfaction of the information about what they have&#xD;
      received, leads uncertainty, apprehension and delay continuation with chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
      Many organization developed booklet for patient education about chemotherapy and side effect&#xD;
      management. They also have provided online resources. The patient read information at their&#xD;
      own efforts. Multimedia education and Tele- nursing follow up was found cost effective method&#xD;
      to reduce family anxiety in many countries . Parent's anxiety and depression leads poor&#xD;
      management of cancer treatment for their child. Literature evidence that Nurse led&#xD;
      psycho-education through multimedia education telephonic follows up is cost effective method&#xD;
      to reduce anxiety and depression related to treatment process. According to senior oncologist&#xD;
      Pakistan, Parents are anxious not only about Chemo side-effect but also about disease itself.&#xD;
      Most parents have same knowledge of side effects of chemotherapy because of their experiences&#xD;
      with friend's relatives who have undergo to course treatment. Secondly, side effect is&#xD;
      mentioned at first counseling session by primarily oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To measure the effect of nurse-led multimedia education, booklet providence and&#xD;
      telephonic follow up about chemotherapy and side effects management on parent's anxiety and&#xD;
      depression of children receiving chemotherapy for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational Definitions Nurse-Led: Any intervention given by the nurses under professional&#xD;
      guidelines. Multimedia education: Education given by using PowerPoint presentation or by&#xD;
      using multimedia projector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephonic Follow up: The continuation of educational process by using Tele-communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy side effect: The adverse effects of chemotherapy other than therapeutic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent's anxiety and depression: Feelings of concern, uneasiness, nervousness and sadness of&#xD;
      parents related to child, diagnosed with cancer and undergoing for chemotherapy first time.&#xD;
