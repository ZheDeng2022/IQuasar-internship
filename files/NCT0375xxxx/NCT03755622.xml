    <textblock>
      Trans-palatal Arch or TPA is an intra oral device that is occasionally used in conjunction of&#xD;
      orthodontic fixed appliance treatment. It has two main types, the fixed or removable TPA. The&#xD;
      purpose of this appliance is to maintain upper jaw's arch width and preventing upper molar&#xD;
      teeth from moving forward. It holds the upper molar teeth in their original position so that&#xD;
      if any upper teeth are extracted to make room for the others to straighten, the upper molars&#xD;
      will not move into the extraction spaces. It comprises of a stainless steel wire with a&#xD;
      central semi loop that fits comfortably across but not touching the palate. On each side, it&#xD;
      is attached with metal bands around each of the two upper molar teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The construction of TPA requires at least three appointments that take up one to three weeks&#xD;
      time. Firstly, an elastic &quot;doughnut&quot; like rubbery separators will be placed between the upper&#xD;
      molar teeth using a special tool. Slight tightness is usually felt when the separators are&#xD;
      inserted. The whole procedure takes less than a couple of minutes. Patients will be sent away&#xD;
      for up to 14 days with the separators in place. For the second appointment, the separators&#xD;
      will be removed with dental probe. The correct size metal bands are then selected for the&#xD;
      upper molar teeth. Once a correctly fitting band has been chosen, an impression (mould) of&#xD;
      the upper teeth with the bands in place will be taken. The impression, together with the&#xD;
      bands will be sent to the laboratory for construction of the TPA. Separators will be placed&#xD;
      again until patients come back to have TPA fitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the mould of the teeth is scanned and printed out using three dimensions (3D) technology,&#xD;
      the number of appointments could be reduced. The second appointment which requires molar&#xD;
      bands selection, impression and replacement of separators of upper teeth could be skipped.&#xD;
      Molar bands selection can be carried out outside the mouth and straight away sent to the&#xD;
      laboratory for TPA construction. All parties involved, patients, clinicians and dental&#xD;
      technologists will benefit the innovation by reduction of time spent for TPA related&#xD;
      procedure. However, the study that compares innovated TPA from 3D reconstructed models and&#xD;
      conventional method has never been done and related similar studies are very scarce.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transpalatal Arch (TPA) has been invented by Dr. Robert Ara Goshgarian, a renowned&#xD;
      orthodontist more than 7 decades ago. Throughout the years, various modifications of the&#xD;
      design were made for different purposes and to increase its efficacy in achieving the optimum&#xD;
      level of anchorage. In 1947, fabrication of Nance Palatal Ach (NPA) pioneered the adjustment&#xD;
      of TPA by incorporation of an acrylic button that connects the palatal wire at the highest&#xD;
      part of palatal vault. Recent innovations mostly involved adhesions of TPA to mini implants&#xD;
      or temporary anchorage devices (TAD) and proven to be time and cost effective to be used in&#xD;
      orthodontics. The usage of TPA for space maintenance demonstrated to be more advantagous in&#xD;
      term of soft tissue compatibilty and increase in vertical control compared to Nance&#xD;
      appliance. The combination of TPA and extraction of deciduos maxillary canines in the late&#xD;
      mix dentition has shown to be an acceptable interceptive treatment to prevent maxillary&#xD;
      canines palatal impaction. Despite numerous changes and alterations, the versatility of usage&#xD;
      has made TPA remained as a useful adjunct in clinical orthodontics until today. However the&#xD;
      fabrication of TPA required meticulous clinical steps which started with insertion of&#xD;
      elastomeric separators on mesial and distal interproximal surfaces of maxillary permanent&#xD;
      first molar teeth. One week later, separators were removed and series of molar bands&#xD;
      selection or 'try in' session were carried out to get the correct size that fits the molar&#xD;
      teeth. The drawbacks of this action is that, the 'used' molar bands if not properly&#xD;
      decontaminated with an enzymatic cleaning and properly sterilized using autoclave, it may&#xD;
      constitute a cross-infection hazard. An impression with molar bands in situ were taken and&#xD;
      sent to the dental lab for fabrication of TPA followed by re-insertion of separators between&#xD;
      the molar teeth. This means that each patient has to bear the discomfort caused by&#xD;
      elastomeric separators for at least two weeks time or more. Orthodontists have to spent time&#xD;
      for molar bands selection and dental technicians have more workload from pouring of&#xD;
      impression until finishing of TPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients do not have to undergo twice elastomeric separators placement as reported that among&#xD;
      4 orthodontic treatment procedures carried out,(upper alginate impression, separator&#xD;
      placement, band placement and adjustment of arch wire), placement of separator causes a&#xD;
      significant bacteraemia. Clinicians could cut down the number of appointments and time could&#xD;
      be utilized to see more other cases. Currently there are 7 dental technicians in Paediatric&#xD;
      and Orthodontic Department to cater for 10 Orthodontists, 6 Senior Postgraduates and 5 Junior&#xD;
      Postgraduates, 1 technician was assigned for Optech management at Balai Ungku Aziz and&#xD;
      starting from 2018, all technician will be involved in dental chair maintenance for the whole&#xD;
      UM. Heavy workload and other commitments resulted in lack of time to finish all orthodontic&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether TPA fabricated from 3D reconstructed model are feasible for clinical&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the oral health related quality of life of patients before wearing TPA and&#xD;
           after 3 months of appliance wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the oral health related quality of life of patients wearing TPA fabricated&#xD;
           from 3D reconstructed model and conventionally produced TPA up to 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare pain levels of patients wearing TPA fabricated from 3D reconstructed model&#xD;
           and conventionally produced TPA up to 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine clinicians' preferences between TPA made from 3D reconstructed model and&#xD;
           TPA produced from plaster dental cast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOME&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Oral health related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOME&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinicians preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethical approval gained from Medical Ethics Committee, (DF CD1607/0057(P) Faculty of&#xD;
           Dentistry, University of Malaya from 11th July 2016 - 31st May 2019&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grant approved : PPPC/C1-2016/DGD/12 RM 17,085.00&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size estimation is based on comparative literature by (Johal et al., 2014) and&#xD;
           calculated using G Power 3.1.92 software under supervision of statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therefore, it was estimated that a sample size of 46 subjects was needed to demonstrate&#xD;
           a significant change in OHRQoL, with an 80 per cent probability power at the 5% level of&#xD;
           significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sample size was inflated by a 10% margin to allow for loss to follow-up and drop&#xD;
           outs; thus, the total sample size was a minimum of 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      52 patients undergoing orthodontic treatment at Orthodontic Clinic, University of Malaya,&#xD;
      required Transpalatal Arch (TPA) and fulfilled the inclusion criterias will be be randomly&#xD;
      selected for this single-blinded study.They will be divided into two groups (n =26 for each&#xD;
      group) , Group C will received conventional TPA while Group 3D will be given TPA fabricated&#xD;
      on three-dimensionally (3D) reconstructed model. 6 orthodontic postgraduates will be involved&#xD;
      in providing treatment for these patients. 4 operators will be having 9 patients each while&#xD;
      the other 2 operators will have 8 patients each. 4 operators will be provided with an opaque&#xD;
      envelope comprises of 9 lots each and 2 operators will have 8 lots each. Dental Surgery&#xD;
      Assistant (DSA) assisting each operator will open the opaque envelope that have been&#xD;
      allocated for each sample after the written consent is signed.Baseline questionnare (T0) will&#xD;
      be distributed at this stage, prior to fabrication of TPA. Group C will undergo normal&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory procedure of conventional TPA. For Group 3D, the dental casts will be&#xD;
      sent to Centre For Biomedical And Technology Integration (CBMTI) for digitization using the&#xD;
      Geomagic Capture three-dimensional scanner carried out by 2 trained Design Engineer.Captured&#xD;
      images are automatically processed by the Geomagic Design X software and virtually remodelled&#xD;
      by the same personnel. Total resection of upper right and left second premolars (15, 25) and&#xD;
      upper right and left second molars (17, 27) were simulated prior to printing for easier molar&#xD;
      band insertion and cost reduction. Modified 3D dental model were printed out using&#xD;
      Acrylonitrile-Butadine-Styrene (ABS) material through Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM)&#xD;
      technique . TPA will be constructed on it by the same technician who fabricated the&#xD;
      conventional version. First modified OHIP 14, (T1) will be distributed 1 week post&#xD;
      cementation of TPA, followed by T2 at 1 month post insertion and T3 at 3 months post&#xD;
      cementation. Patients will be dismissed from the study after the T3 stage.&#xD;

        -  Analysis : Paired t-test, Repeated measure ANOVA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative analysis : NVivo&#xD;
&#xD;
      OHIP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral Health Impact Profile Malaysian version (L-OHIP[M]) with 45 items is an adaptation&#xD;
           of the original version developed by Slade and Spencer (1994), 49 items&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short version (S-OHIP[M]) was also developed, which contains only 14 items -Seven&#xD;
           domains namely:-&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Functional limitation&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Physical pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Psychological discomfort&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Physical disability&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             6. Social disability&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Handicap&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the S-OHIP(M)was developed to be used as a descriptive and discriminative measure in&#xD;
      population oral health surveys, it may also be appropriate for use in clinical trials and in&#xD;
      clinical practice as an evaluative measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focus group interview is a &quot;carefully planned discussion designed to obtain perceptions&#xD;
           in a defined area of interest in a permissive, nonthreatening environment&quot; (Krueger,&#xD;
           1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intended to promote self disclosure among participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most likely to happen when the participants perceive that they are alike in some&#xD;
           important way and when the environment is non judgmental.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 - 10 participants, 1 moderator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conversation taped, recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  60 - 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Until saturation point reached (saturation is the point at which no new information&#xD;
           emerges).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcribe into several themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze by NVivo software.&#xD;
