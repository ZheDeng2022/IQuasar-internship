    <textblock>
      Generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) is an ultra-rare disorder with an&#xD;
      estimated birth prevalence of around 1 in 400,000.1 GACI is generally fatal before birth or&#xD;
      within the first six months after birth. The cause of death is frequently myocardial&#xD;
      infarction or stroke. GACI is strongly associated with inactivating mutations in&#xD;
      ectonucleotide pyrophosphate/ phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1). Many patients with GACI, including&#xD;
      some without an ENPP1 mutation also present with mutations in adenosine triphosphate binding&#xD;
      cassette transporter protein subfamily C member 6 (ABCC6). Autosomal recessive&#xD;
      hypophosphatemic rickets type 2 (ARHR2) and pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) are believed to be&#xD;
      closely related to GACI. ARHR2 is caused by mutations in the ENPP1 gene and PXE is caused by&#xD;
      mutations in the ABCC6 gene, with both being observed among patients with GACI. The natural&#xD;
      history of GACI and in particular its long term morbidity and mortality are poorly&#xD;
      understood. The primary objective of this study is to characterize overall survival among&#xD;
      patients with GACI, over time from birth.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) is an ultra-rare disorder with an&#xD;
      estimated birth prevalence of around 1 in 400,000.1 GACI is characterized by extensive&#xD;
      arterial calcifications, arterial stenosis, myointimal proliferation and periarticular&#xD;
      calcifications. Individuals with GACI also experience calcification in other body areas, such&#xD;
      as joints and organs. GACI is generally fatal before birth or within the first six months&#xD;
      after birth. The cause of death is frequently myocardial infarction or stroke. GACI is&#xD;
      strongly associated with inactivating mutations in ectonucleotide pyrophosphate/&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1); around three quarters of GACI cases investigated had one or&#xD;
      several ENPP1 mutations. Many patients with GACI, including some without an ENPP1 mutation&#xD;
      also present with mutations in adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter protein&#xD;
      subfamily C member 6 (ABCC6). Autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets type 2 (ARHR2) and&#xD;
      pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) are believed to be closely related to GACI. ARHR2 is caused by&#xD;
      mutations in the ENPP1 gene5 and PXE is caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene,3 with both&#xD;
      being observed among patients with GACI. The natural history of GACI and in particular its&#xD;
      long term morbidity and mortality are poorly understood, but a strong understanding of the&#xD;
      condition will be crucial for further therapy development and drug testing. This study aims&#xD;
      to address this knowledge gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize overall survival among patients with&#xD;
      GACI, over time from birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the patient and disease characteristics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe symptomology at diagnosis and the change in symptomology over time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe treatment patterns specific to GACI or rickets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize mental/physical impairment, education, and employment situation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the sequelae of the disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence of rickets; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Growth velocities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GACI genotype (mutation in ENPP1 and/or ABCC6) confirmed through mutational analysis of&#xD;
           the patient and a GACI phenotype confirmed by imaging or biopsy; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GACI phenotype confirmed with imaging, biopsy, or mutational analysis of the parents&#xD;
           indicating a GACI genotype (mutation in ENPP1 and/or ABCC6) coinciding with symptoms of&#xD;
           the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected for both living and deceased patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
