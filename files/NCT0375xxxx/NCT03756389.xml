  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory Phase 2 trial of BMX-010 in patients with Rosacea which will be&#xD;
      conducted in two parts. Up to 210 subjects with Rosacea will be enrolled.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A is designed to confirm the optimal formulation, strength, and dosing frequency of the&#xD;
      study drug. Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled in this part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is designed to be a randomized, double-blind trial studying the optimal formulation,&#xD;
      strength, and dosing frequency of BMX-010 as determined in Part A, compared to Placebo. Up to&#xD;
      150 subjects will be enrolled in this part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts, adult subjects with Rosacea will be enrolled.&#xD;
