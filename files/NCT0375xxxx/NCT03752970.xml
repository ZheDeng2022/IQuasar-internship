  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study in adults with Crohn's Disease who also have fistulas near the anus. The&#xD;
      study has 2 parts. The first part is to find out more about what causes the fistulas. In this&#xD;
      part of the study, tissue samples are taken from patients. The second part of the study tests&#xD;
      whether a medicine called spesolimab (BI 655130) helps patients with Crohn's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants get study medication for 24 weeks. The participants are put into 2 groups. It is&#xD;
      decided by chance who gets into which group. One group gets an intravenous drip that contains&#xD;
      spesolimab every 4 weeks. The other group gets a placebo drip every 4 weeks. The placebo drip&#xD;
      looks like the spesolimab drip, but contains no medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors regularly examine fistulas of the participants. The results of the fistula&#xD;
      examinations are compared between the groups. The doctors also check the general health of&#xD;
      the patients.&#xD;
