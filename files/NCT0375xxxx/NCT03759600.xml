    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of niraparib in participants&#xD;
      with advanced, relapsed, high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer who have received 3 or 4 previous chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called niraparib. Niraparib is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-positive, advanced, relapsed,&#xD;
      high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. This&#xD;
      study will look at the efficacy and safety of niraparib in Japanese participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 16 participants. Participants will be enrolled to one&#xD;
      group and after that will be asked to take niraparib capsules at the same time each day&#xD;
      throughout the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Niraparib 300 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is approximately 23 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic in the&#xD;
      treatment period, and the post-treatment period including follow-up assessments after the&#xD;
      last dose of the study drug.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after the last dose (Approximately 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher TEAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after the last dose (Approximately 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who has enrolled in a study; it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A severity grade was defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 4.03. As per NCI-CTCAE, Grade 1 scales as Mild; Grade 2 scales as Moderate; Grade 3 scales as severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; Grade 4 scales as life-threatening consequences; and Grade 5 scales as death related to AE.</description>

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who has enrolled in a study; it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE was any AE that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event. TEAE was defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

          2. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related&#xD;
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may&#xD;
             be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must agree to undergo tumor homologous recombination deficiency/deficient&#xD;
             (HRD) testing, and this test result must show that participants have an HRD-positive&#xD;
             tumor (defined by the presence of a deleterious or suspected deleterious breast cancer&#xD;
             gene (BRCA) mutation or be positive for genomic instability) by the central laboratory&#xD;
             selected by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note 1: The study HRD test result must be received prior to enrollment. The tumor&#xD;
             sample may be submitted for HRD testing prior to the screening period (ie, within 40&#xD;
             days before Cycle 1 Day 1) if the consent has been obtained and it appears the&#xD;
             participant is likely to meet other eligibility requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note 2: If historic blood germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAmut) is detected by a prior&#xD;
             gBRCAmut testing, then tumor HRD sample test results are not required prior to&#xD;
             enrollment; however, HRD testing still needs to be performed.&#xD;

             abnormality (including active or uncontrolled myelosuppression [ie, anemia,&#xD;
             leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia]) that might confound the results of the&#xD;
             study, interfere with the participant's participation throughout the study period, or&#xD;
             study participation is not in the best interest of the participant.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

          <description>Response to last platinum-based therapy achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR), progressive disease (PD) or Stable Disease (SD) per RECIST v.1.1 CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters (SoD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline SoD. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in SoD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest (nadir) SoD since (and including) baseline. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>

        <description>DCR was defined as the percentage of participants achieving CR, PR or Stable Disease (SD) as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST v. 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters (SoD) of target lesions, taking as a reference the Baseline SoD. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD). PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SoD of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest (nadir) SoD since (and including) Baseline.</description>

          <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
          <description>PFS was defined as the time in months from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death as assessed by the RECIST version 1.1. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SoD (Sum of Diameters) of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest (nadir) SoD since (and including) Baseline.</description>
          <population>FAS included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and have measurable disease at Baseline.</population>
