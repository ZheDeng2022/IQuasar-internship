  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research Hypothesis Approximately 75% of patients with bladder cancer (BC) present with a&#xD;
      disease confined to the mucosa (stage Ta, CIS) or submucosa (stage T1) (non-muscle invasive&#xD;
      BC [NMIBC]). For high grade NMIBC, i.e. TaG3, T1G3 and CIS, intravesical bacillus&#xD;
      Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy is the treatment of choice, given that it prevents&#xD;
      recurrence and reduces the odds of progression to MIBC. However, since initial BCG therapy&#xD;
      fails in approximately 40% of patients over a 2-year period, new treatment options for these&#xD;
      patients are of utmost importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In that field of research durvalumab, a human monoclonal antibody that binds programmed cell&#xD;
      death ligand-1 (PD-L1), demonstrated meaningful clinical activity as well as manageable&#xD;
      safety profile in PD-L1-positive patients with BC, many of whom were heavily pretreated.&#xD;
      Certain studies using systemic administration of anti-PD1 agents for BCG refractory NMIBC are&#xD;
      ongoing. Nevertheless, intravesical administration may be advantageous, since selective&#xD;
      bladder tumor uptake of monoclonal antibodies following intravesical administration, while&#xD;
      this method results in negligible absorption in the circulation and, therefore, minimal risk&#xD;
      of systemic toxicity. This notion is supported by the findings of a recent study of&#xD;
      intravesical administration of recombinant adenovirus-mediated interferon-α2b gene therapy&#xD;
      (rAd-IFNα), No rAd-IFNα DNA was detected in the blood. Furthermore, no systemic toxicity was&#xD;
      reported in a phase II study using the same agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators, therefore, propose a phase II study of intravesical administration of&#xD;
      durvalumab in patients with BCG refractory NMIBC. Since no safety or efficacy data&#xD;
      specifically on intravesical administration of durvalumab exist, a run-in part will precede&#xD;
      the main phase II, in order to confirm safety of the procedure and to reject a futility&#xD;
      hypothesis, as described in the following sections of the protocol. Correlative studies of&#xD;
      potential biomarkers in tumor tissue before and after durvalumab instillation are also&#xD;
      proposed.&#xD;
