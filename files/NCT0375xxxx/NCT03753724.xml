  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the use of novel CT image analysis techniques to enable a better&#xD;
      characterisation of small pulmonary nodules. The study will incorporate solid and&#xD;
      predominantly solid nodules of 5-15 mm scanned using a variety of scanner types, imaging&#xD;
      protocols and patient populations. The investigators hope that the new image processing&#xD;
      techniques will improve the accuracy of lung nodule analysis which will in turn reduce the&#xD;
      number of unnecessary investigations for benign nodules and may increase the accuracy of the&#xD;
      early diagnosis of lung cancer in malignant nodules. This study aims to test this novel&#xD;
      analysis software to subsequently allow validation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the commonest cancer with 1.8 million cases diagnosed each year worldwide, early diagnosis&#xD;
      of lung cancer is important to reduce mortality. The early diagnosis of lung cancer is&#xD;
      contingent on both the detection of a small lung nodule and determining whether it is&#xD;
      malignant. Whilst computed tomography (CT) has proven to be a robust way of detecting lung&#xD;
      nodules, they are often discovered on routine scanning as an incidental finding or as part of&#xD;
      a lung cancer screening program. Hence, determining whether they are benign or malignant is&#xD;
      challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 75% of smokers scanned either as part of their clinical care or in lung cancer&#xD;
      screening trials have subcentimetre pulmonary nodules detected. This places a substantial&#xD;
      burden on scanning facilities, staff and patients. Current methods of determining if lung&#xD;
      nodules are benign or malignant are not standardised and unproven. The US National Lung&#xD;
      Screening Trial (NLST) showed that up to 95% of lung nodules detected on CT scans of the&#xD;
      chest were false positives i.e. they were not malignant. Detection of non-malignant nodules&#xD;
      have the unwanted consequences of unnecessary cost as they require follow-up scanning or&#xD;
      alternative methods of investigation, cause patient anxiety, may result in increased&#xD;
      morbidity potentially by biopsy or resection, and result in increased patient radiation&#xD;
      exposure due to follow-up CT scans or from PET-CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of standard care at present, patients with lung nodules greater than 4mm and&#xD;
      sub-centimetre are followed up with CT scan(s), up to 5 scans, for up to 24 months, according&#xD;
      to the internationally accepted Fleischner guidelines. Additional investigations, such as a&#xD;
      positron-emission tomography (PET-CT) scan and biopsy or resection may also be performed&#xD;
      based on the size and clinical risk profile of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that incorporating lung nodule characteristics such as size,&#xD;
      texture, growth rate, contrast enhancement can improve the accuracy of predicting the risk of&#xD;
      malignancy. This allows the stratification of lung nodules into different investigations&#xD;
      and/or follow-up pathways based on the predicted risk of malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test the use of novel CT image analysis techniques incorporated into a&#xD;
      clinical risk model to characterise small pulmonary nodules. The study will incorporate solid&#xD;
      and predominantly solid nodules of 5-15mm scanned using a variety of scanner types, imaging&#xD;
      protocols and patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scans from patients referred to the Lung Nodule Clinic or for review by a specialist in&#xD;
      nodule assessment as per current clinical practice will be reviewed. Patients who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be contacted by a member of the clinical care team and&#xD;
      study participation will be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the nodules detected, their management will be categorised as per standard care into the&#xD;
      following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1. On review of the scans by an expert, no further follow up or investigation is&#xD;
      required, as the nodule(s) has been categorised as benign. As the patient was unaware the&#xD;
      scan was being reviewed and no further investigations are required. Patient is invited to&#xD;
      take part in the study (by telephone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2. On review, the nodule is indeterminate and further scanning at a later date is&#xD;
      required. The patient is informed of this, usually via a telephone call from either the&#xD;
      doctor or nurse specialist working in the Lung Nodule Clinic (LNC) or site equivalent. This&#xD;
      LNC is usually a virtual clinic - no physical interaction with the patient - and the follow&#xD;
      up scan is reviewed and the patient contacted again via the virtual clinic. Patient is&#xD;
      invited to take part in the study (by telephone, by post or in clinic if appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 3. On review, the nodule is regarded as potentially malignant and further scans and a&#xD;
      clinic appointment is made for the patient. Patient is invited to take part in the study (in&#xD;
      clinic if appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from CT images routine care clinical information about the patient (e.g. age, sex,&#xD;
      smoking status, family history of lung cancer) and data on nodule characteristics derived&#xD;
      from the identified CT scan (and/or prior and subsequent) will be collected and used to test&#xD;
      the new software program that will stratify pulmonary nodules in terms of their probability&#xD;
      of being malignant or benign. All this data is routine and is collected as part of standard&#xD;
      care therefore no study visits will need to be arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the health economics assessment patients will be invited to complete the EQ-5D-5L&#xD;
      (quality of life), GAD-7 (anxiety), and productivity loss questionnaires. Patients will also&#xD;
      be asked questions about their health utilisation. This data may also be collected from&#xD;
      medical notes/electronic patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial questionnaires will be completed within 2 weeks (if possible) of having the first&#xD;
      scan and a follow-up will be carried out after 1 year for group 1 participants. Group 2 and 3&#xD;
      participants will also be invited to complete these questionnaires 3 months after their&#xD;
      initial scan as they will have undergone further investigations during that time. The&#xD;
      questionnaires will be completed over the phone for patients in groups 1 and over the phone&#xD;
      or face to face when attending routine clinic appointments for groups 2 and 3.&#xD;
