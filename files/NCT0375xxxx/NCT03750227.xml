    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies the side effects and how well stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)&#xD;
      works before or after surgery in patients with tumors that has spread to the brain or that&#xD;
      can be removed by surgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that&#xD;
      delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to&#xD;
      normal tissue.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine for patients with brain metastases meeting the inclusion criteria, whether&#xD;
      there is an increase in the time to a composite endpoint of adverse outcomes including the&#xD;
      first occurrence of either: local recurrence, leptomeningeal disease, or symptomatic&#xD;
      radiation brain necrosis in patients who receive SRS prior to surgery as compared to patients&#xD;
      who receive surgery prior to SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine for patients with brain metastases whether there is improved overall survival&#xD;
      for patients who receive SRS prior to surgery as compared to patients who receive SRS after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine for patients with brain metastases whether there are improved patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes including quality of life for patients who receive SRS prior to surgery as&#xD;
      compared to patients who receive SRS after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine if preoperative SRS increases rates of surgical morbidity including&#xD;
      postoperative complications such as wound infection, need for longer hospital stays, or&#xD;
      readmission compared to a surgery first approach for resectable brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine for patients with brain metastases whether there is a higher rate of&#xD;
      completion of planned therapies for patients who receive SRS prior to surgery as compared to&#xD;
      patients who receive surgery prior to SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine for patients with brain metastases whether there is a shorter time to&#xD;
      initiation or re-initiation of systemic therapy with pre-operative versus post-operative SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine for patients treated with pre-operative SRS whether there is a longer&#xD;
      interval to regional progression, any central nervous system (CNS) progression or need for&#xD;
      subsequent intracranial treatment compared to patients receiving post-operative SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine for patients with pre-operative as compared to post-operative radiation&#xD;
      whether there is a decreased rate of radiation necrosis, including asymptomatic and&#xD;
      symptomatic radiation necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To determine for patients with pre-operative as compared to post-operative radiation&#xD;
      whether there is a decreased rate of local recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To determine for patients with pre-operative as compared to post-operative radiation&#xD;
      whether there is a decreased rate of leptomeningeal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the genetic and molecular alterations of brain metastases seen after&#xD;
      radiation versus in the setting of resection alone, including early radiobiologic changes in&#xD;
      tissue treated with SRS 24 to 48 hours prior, and to investigate detection rate of&#xD;
      corresponding circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and/or inflammatory markers in&#xD;
      peripheral specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate the usefulness of biomarkers and response to radiation in predicting local&#xD;
      control and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To look at cell capture of tumor cells as well as cell free DNA in cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF) sampled at the time of surgery, comparing patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment to&#xD;
      those that have not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients undergo surgery on day 1. Within 2 weeks, patients undergo stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery on day 1. Within 4 weeks, patients undergo&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, every 3-4 months&#xD;
      for up to 2 years and then periodically for up to 3 years.&#xD;
