  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is an incurable hematological malignancy that affects older patients.&#xD;
      Currently, despite recent progress, the disease relapses more or less quickly after initial&#xD;
      treatment and requires the resumption of treatment with new drugs associated with cortisone,&#xD;
      whose side effects are important. The investigators propose to conduct a phase 2 testing the&#xD;
      combination ixazomib - daratumumab without dexamethasone.&#xD;

             and Daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for women of childbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not&#xD;
             rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had&#xD;
             menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman of childbearing potential must have 2 negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
                  tests at Screening, first within 28 days prior to dosing and the second within 48&#xD;
                  hours prior to dosing, and remain on a highly effective method of birth control.&#xD;
                  The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective&#xD;
                  method and one additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a&#xD;
                  qualified provider of contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples&#xD;
                  of highly effective and additional effective methods of contraception:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Highly effective methods: Intrauterine device (IUD) ; Hormonal (birth&#xD;
                       control pills, injections, implants) ; Tubal ligation ; Partner's vasectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Additional effective methods: Male condom ; Diaphragm CervicalCap&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum (urine in the case where serum is not possible in a timely manner)&#xD;
                  pregnancy test to be performed for all women of childbearing potential regularly&#xD;
                  during the study, In addition, a pregnancy test may be done at any time during&#xD;
                  the study at the discretion of the investigator if a subject misses a period or&#xD;
                  has unusual menstrual bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman of childbearing potential must remain on a highly effective method of&#xD;
                  birth control. Contraception must begin 4 weeks before initiating treatment with&#xD;
                  Ixazomib and Daratumumab, during therapy, during dose interruptions and&#xD;
                  continuing for 4 months following discontinuation of Ixazomib and Daratumumab.&#xD;
                  Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of&#xD;
                  infertility, unless due to hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A man who has not had a vasectomy and who is sexually active with a woman of&#xD;
                  childbearing potential must agree to use a barrier method of birth control eg,&#xD;
                  condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, and all men must also&#xD;
                  not donate sperm during the study, for 4 months following discontinuation of&#xD;
                  Ixazomib and Daratumumab. The exception to this restriction is that if the&#xD;
                  subject's female partner is surgically sterile, a second method of birth control&#xD;
                  is not required.&#xD;
