  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of bolus delivery of insulin when&#xD;
      delivered either intradermally (in the skin) or subcutaneously (under the skin) in diabetics.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient will participate in 10 visits of which the first, Visit 1, is a Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 will consist of a brief isoglycemic clamp with a single IV insulin challenge to&#xD;
      determine insulin sensitivity. A subsequent test meal and single SC insulin dose (off clamp)&#xD;
      will be done to determine the nominal coverage dose of insulin for a mixed meal containing&#xD;
      60g of carbohydrate. This nominal dose will form the basis of insulin bolus dosing for the&#xD;
      remainder of the study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Visits 3-9, patients will come to the institute in the early morning 24 hours prior to&#xD;
      the meal test for the application of a Continuous Glucose Monitor (Dexcom Seven Plus™,&#xD;
      Dexcom, INC). Subjects will receive standardized meals during the day and their blood glucose&#xD;
      will be stabilized overnight to a concentration of 115±15 mg/dL via IV insulin and/or glucose&#xD;
      infusions. The next morning the subjects will start the experimental intervention.&#xD;
      Immediately prior to standardized meals (2 minutes before eating) the patients will receive&#xD;
      insulin by either the ID or SC route, followed by the breakfast (rapidly absorbed carb) meal&#xD;
      at time point T0. Meal consumption will occur over a 10 to 15 min time interval. Blood&#xD;
      glucose excursions will be observed in the 6 hours thereafter (until T= 360 min). Between&#xD;
      hours 6 to 7, BG may be re-stabilized to starting values (115±15 mg/dL) by administration of&#xD;
      IV insulin or glucose if necessary. At that time a second insulin injection (same dose as at&#xD;
      time point T= -2 minutes) will be given and a second standardized lunch (mixed) meal will be&#xD;
      administered. Blood glucose excursions will be followed for an additional 6 hours thereafter&#xD;
      (T = 780 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions for Visits 3-8 will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Condition 1. Individualized Lispro ID dose (nominal dose based on prior insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity testing and patient-specific insulin-to-carb ratio) given immediately (2min)&#xD;
           prior to a breakfast meal containing predominantly rapidly absorbed carbohydrates (std&#xD;
           60 g CHO; approximately 70:15:15 CHO:protein:fat); a second lunch mixed meal given 7&#xD;
           hours later contains the same total number of carbohydrates (std 60 g mixed) but with a&#xD;
           mixed composition between carbohydrate, protein, and fat (ratio approximately 35:25:40).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Condition 2. Equivalent insulin dose and meal regimen as Condition 1 but given by the SC&#xD;
           route.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conditions 3 and 4. The meal regimen from Condition 1, with ID and SC doses increased&#xD;
           30% above the nominal dose to simulate inappropriate carb counting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conditions 5 and 6. The meal regimen from Condition 1, with ID and SC doses decreased&#xD;
           30% below the nominal dose to simulate inappropriate carb counting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition during each meal challenge the subject will be maintained on an Animas pump&#xD;
      intradermally delivering a combined bolus and basal profile of a placebo (5% dextrose for&#xD;
      injection solution) during the study period to evaluate flow biomechanics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 9 will examine a single earlier dose timing (determined by analysis of the glycemic&#xD;
      profile dataset from the prior 8 visits) relative to the two meals for the ID route only,&#xD;
      using the optimal target dose from conditions 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a final examination, Visit 10, immediately following Visit 9.&#xD;
