  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis for heart failure patients is bleak for the advanced stages of the disease,&#xD;
      with a reported 6-month mortality rate of almost 50% in patients treated with chronic&#xD;
      inotropic therapy. As well as its very severe prognosis, heart failure is a costly disease.&#xD;
      Heart transplantation remains the reference treatment for the terminal stage of the disease&#xD;
      but although this is an effective therapy, it does engender ethical, social, economic and&#xD;
      legal problems. It also requires irreproachable and costly logistics, immuno-suppressor&#xD;
      treatment and a lifetime of follow-ups. In particular, the number of donors has been going&#xD;
      down steadily for several years in most countries which offer a heart transplant programme&#xD;
      and some patients cannot take advantage of being added to a waiting list for a graft (age,&#xD;
      co-morbidities…).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is in this context that, alongside the medical treatments for cardiac insufficiency, other&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies were developed, including resynchronization and long-term mechanical&#xD;
      circulatory support. The progress made in resynchronization is at several levels: better&#xD;
      understanding of the action mechanisms, the development and improvement of equipment&#xD;
      specifically dedicated to resynchronization and prospective and randomized clinical trials&#xD;
      which have scientifically validated this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously, many studies were published evaluating long term support with mechanical&#xD;
      circulatory support (MCS), excluding light devices, as a bridge to transplant or an&#xD;
      alternative to a transplant. It is also recognized that mechanical circulatory support with a&#xD;
      new generation of continuous flow assist device improved the quality of life and functional&#xD;
      capacity, with a reduced risk of device failure and infrequent need for replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Achilles heel&quot; of cardiac resynchronization remains the 20 to 40% of patients who&#xD;
      respond barely or not at all. Among this population of patients, some are not candidates for&#xD;
      a transplantation and long-term mechanical circulatory support by axial pump is an&#xD;
      alternative to be considered. We elaborated an original randomized pilot study for these&#xD;
      patients in order to evaluate their survival and their quality of life, to define if they&#xD;
      should be proposed a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)or not.&#xD;
