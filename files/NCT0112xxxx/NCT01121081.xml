      This is a double blind, parallel group, randomized study with 12 weeks of daily oral&#xD;
      administration of Dunaliella or placebo in psoriasis patients undergoing phototherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for eligibility at the baseline visit for phototherapy and blood&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screen phase of maximum two weeks the subjects will be randomized at phototherapy&#xD;
      treatment no. 4 in to one of two treatments groups (2:1): Dunaliella or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will have a final evaluation 4 weeks after the end of study drug treatment .&#xD;
