  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with CLL are diagnosed with early stage disease (Binet stage A or&#xD;
      Rai stage 0/I). Standard management of such patients is observation, and with median age at&#xD;
      diagnosis of 72 and median time to progression of &gt;5-10 years, many will never require&#xD;
      treatment. In contrast, a proportion of patients have more aggressive disease, and over the&#xD;
      last decade, a number of molecular factors have been identified that may be used to identify&#xD;
      patients with poor prognosis disease . Each is associated with shortened time to treatment&#xD;
      (typically less than 3 years in patients with 2 of more factors), reduced survival, with in&#xD;
      the case of p53/ATM inactivation, resistance to treatment. Whether it is possible to improve&#xD;
      the outcome of patients with CLL and adverse prognostic factors by early intervention with&#xD;
      treatment is unknown. Several trials in the 1980's demonstrated that treatment of stage A CLL&#xD;
      with conventional chemotherapy (chlorambucil) did not alter the natural history of the&#xD;
      disease, although none of these studies stratified patients according to risk. The choice of&#xD;
      alternative potential therapeutic agents is limited; they should be effective in patients&#xD;
      with adverse prognostic factors, have acceptable toxicity, be able to overcome the drug&#xD;
      resistance associated with p53/ATM inactivation and ideally be orally administered. Two&#xD;
      recent phase II trials have demonstrated that Lenalidomide is effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory disease. Importantly, both studies included a high proportion of patients&#xD;
      with adverse prognostic factors including p53 inactivation. The principle objective of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the efficacy of Lenalidomide in achieving disease response (complete&#xD;
      remission and clearance of minimal residual disease) in patients with poor risk early stage&#xD;
      disease, together with assessment of safety and tolerability.&#xD;
