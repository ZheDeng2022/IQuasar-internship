      Our longitudinal aim is to reduce childhood obesity using our two-pronged intervention&#xD;
      program, which includes healthy food choices and increased physical activity initiated during&#xD;
      pregnancy and re-instated in the early period after delivery for overweight and obese women.&#xD;
      We will accomplish this with our family-based Nutrition and Exercise Lifestyle Intervention&#xD;
      Program (NELIP) to promote healthy family living. An intervention targeting school-aged&#xD;
      children on the importance of healthy lifestyles occurs too late to prevent childhood obesity&#xD;
      and establish lifelong healthy body weights. To break this spiraling cycle of generations of&#xD;
      unhealthy body weights in Canadian children, and to reduce the risk of future obesity-related&#xD;
      health problems, it is necessary to prevent excessive pregnancy weight gain, high blood&#xD;
      sugars in the mother and to promote a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy and early post&#xD;
      delivery. With our NELIP team as a cornerstone, and our pilot data already collected with&#xD;
      promising results, we foresee an opportunity over the next 3 years to contribute to changing&#xD;
      patient care with emphasis on disease prevention and healthy family lifestyle initiation&#xD;
      early in life to reverse the trend of childhood obesity. With a solid research-based&#xD;
      initiative from the lab to the community by educating health care providers, future health&#xD;
      care can be improved by putting prevention-based programs into practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy women = healthy babies = healthy families = healthy futures!!&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity have been identified as major neglected public health issues, as the&#xD;
      prevalence of unhealthy body weights is increasing world-wide at an alarming rate. There is a&#xD;
      robust link between the fetal environment and its long-term influence on health and&#xD;
      susceptibility to future chronic disease in the offspring. Obesity begets obesity, and an&#xD;
      unhealthy maternal metabolic state can have a profound influence on the risk of early obesity&#xD;
      development in the child. Excessive pregnancy weight gain and high pre-pregnant body-mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) have been linked to gestational diabetes (GDM) and macrosomic infants (birth&#xD;
      weight &gt;4.0kg. Since much of the influence of the intrauterine milieu is transmitted to the&#xD;
      next generation non-genetically, potentially deleterious effects can be reversed and&#xD;
      prevented. An intervention targeting school-aged children on the importance of healthy&#xD;
      lifestyles occurs too late to prevent childhood obesity and establish lifelong healthy body&#xD;
      weights. To break the spiralling cycle of generations of unhealthy body weights in Canadian&#xD;
      children, and to reduce the risk of future obesity-related health problems, it is imperative&#xD;
      to prevent excessive pregnancy weight gain, GDM and to promote a healthy prenatal and early&#xD;
      postnatal lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reversing the obesity epidemic will involve a lifetime of effort by the medical and research&#xD;
      communities, however, over the next 3 years, we believe that we may contribute to the&#xD;
      solution by using a two-pronged approach by first targeting pregnant overweight and obese&#xD;
      women with a healthy lifestyle approach called the Nutrition &amp; Exercise Lifestyle&#xD;
      Intervention Program (NELIP) combined with a Family-based Behavioural Treatment (FBBT) that&#xD;
      will prevent excessive weight gain and GDM, and promote a healthy fetal environment. The&#xD;
      second prong will use this healthy lifestyle (NELIP+FBBT) approach starting at 2 months&#xD;
      postpartum continuing to the first year, to minimize postpartum weight retention, encourage&#xD;
      breastfeeding, and promote a healthy family lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To prevent excessive pregnancy weight gain and GDM in order to decrease the incidence of&#xD;
           macrosomia and large for gestational age babies&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To prevent weight retention postpartum and encourage healthy infant feeding practices in&#xD;
           order to decrease the risk of developing obesity during the first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To track pregnancy weight gain and postpartum weight loss, gradually reducing body&#xD;
           weight as needed (0.5 kg per week) to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight in the&#xD;
           mother&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To track birth weight and infant growth within the first year of life (at 2, 6 and 12&#xD;
           months), including body weight, height, BMI, and body fatness, using the World Health&#xD;
           Organization growth charts as a standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the R. Samuel McLaughlin Foundation-Exercise and Pregnancy Lab at the University&#xD;
      of Western Ontario is the only research laboratory in North America actively investigating&#xD;
      metabolic changes in exercising pregnant and postpartum women. Our longitudinal aim is to&#xD;
      reduce obesity, and chronic disease risks (such as diabetes) in the offspring of overweight&#xD;
      and obese women using our two-pronged intervention program, which includes healthy food&#xD;
      choices and increased physical activity (NELIP and FBBT) initiated during pregnancy and&#xD;
      reinforced in the early postpartum period. With our NELIP team as a cornerstone, and our&#xD;
      pilot data already collected, we foresee an opportunity over the next 3 years to contribute&#xD;
      to intervention strategies and patient care with emphasis on disease prevention and healthy&#xD;
      family lifestyle initiation early in life to reverse the trend of childhood obesity. With a&#xD;
      solid research-based initiative from the lab to the community by knowledge translation to&#xD;
      health care providers, future health care costs can be reduced by putting prevention-based&#xD;
      programs into practice.&#xD;
