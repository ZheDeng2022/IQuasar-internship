      1. This will be a randomized, double blinded placebo controlled trial over a period of 3&#xD;
           months. Study subjects will be randomized into 2 groups: Those receiving drug (1gm of&#xD;
           estrogen vaginal cream [EVC] at bed time 3 times a week), and those receiving placebo.&#xD;
           Study subjects will be patients diagnosed with stress urinary incontinence by urodynamic&#xD;
           evaluation. They will have filled out the IIQ-7 and UDI-6 validated questionnaires as is&#xD;
           routine for all patients being evaluated for stress incontinence. After enrollment and&#xD;
           informed consent, their initial screening will include a Pap smear for vaginal&#xD;
           maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects will then be seen at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. At each visit, they will turn in their&#xD;
           medication tubes and receive new study medication. They will also be screened for any&#xD;
           adverse reaction to the study medication at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At the end of the study period, the subjects will fill out the same validated&#xD;
           questionnaire as they did at the beginning of the study and they will also have their&#xD;
           urethral pressure profile and PAP smear repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The urethral pressure profile is part of the standard complex urodynamic testing that&#xD;
           all patients undergo for evaluation and diagnosis of urodynamic stress incontinence.&#xD;
           Urethral Pressure Profile is a technique used to provide information about the ability&#xD;
           of the urethra to prevent leakage. The Urethral Pressure Profile is a specific study, in&#xD;
           which a special design catheter is pulled through the urethra at a slow, continuous&#xD;
           rate. The resulting &quot;bell shaped&quot; curve illustrates the function of the urethra from the&#xD;
           beginning of the bladder neck out through the meatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The placebo cream will be a pharmacologically inert formulation which will be packaged&#xD;
           similarly to the active premarin cream and visually indistinguishable from the active&#xD;
           drug to both the study subjects and researchers.&#xD;
