      The primary objective of this study is to determine the 6-month Progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) when intravenous (IV) AR-67 is administered in adults with confirmed recurrence of GBM&#xD;
      who have not recently (&gt; 90 days) recurred after treatment bevacizumab (including patients&#xD;
      who've received temazolamide, but no bevacizumab). The primary objective in the rapid&#xD;
      bevacizumab failure group (&lt; 90 days) is to determine the 2-month PFS.&#xD;
