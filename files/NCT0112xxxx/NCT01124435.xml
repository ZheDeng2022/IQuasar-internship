      The aim of this study is to evaluate the antitumor activity and potential adverse effects of&#xD;
      the combination celecoxib plus carboplatin in patients with recurrent, heavily pre-treated&#xD;
      Ovarian Cancer (OC). The potential changes induced by the experimental combination on&#xD;
      angiogenesis-related serum markers and quality of life measures will be also evaluated.The&#xD;
      main objective is to evaluate the response rate. Secondary objectives are the&#xD;
      following:toxicity;progression free survival;overall survival;duration of response;quality of&#xD;
      life;modulation of angiogenesis-related molecules.&#xD;

      This phase II prospective study will be conducted at the Gynecologic Oncology Units of the&#xD;
      Catholic University of Rome and Campobasso, Italy. The study is non-sponsored, investigators&#xD;
      initiated. The primary objective is to determine the tumor response rate by RECIST criteria.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives included duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall&#xD;
      survival (OS), toxicity assessment, and QoL measures.Patients are required to take celecoxib&#xD;
      (200 mg tablets by mouth twice daily, day 1 to 28), associated to intravenous carboplatin&#xD;
      (area under the curve (AUC) 5 over 30 to 60 minutes, every 28 days). Patients who will&#xD;
      develop carboplatin hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) will follow a desensitization protocol,&#xD;
      or alternatively will switch to cisplatin. Erythropoietic stimulating agent and myeloid&#xD;
      growth factors are not permitted for cycle 1 of study treatment, and their use will be chosen&#xD;
      by the treating physician, according to hospital policy.Treatment will be discontinued when&#xD;
      any of the following events occurs: radiographic or clinical evidence of cancer progression;&#xD;
      deterioration of health or intolerable toxicity; patient refusal. Before starting treatment,&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated by medical history, physical examination, cell blood count (CBC),&#xD;
      chemistry panel, Ca125, and either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to determine the overall response (OR) rate. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include the assessment of duration of response, PFS, OS, toxicity events and QoL scores. When&#xD;
      treatment will be discontinued, patients will receive a follow-up visit every 3 months&#xD;
