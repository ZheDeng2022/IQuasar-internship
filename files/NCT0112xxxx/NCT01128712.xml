      To prospectively demonstrate the superior anxiolytic effect of high dose pregabalin (PGB)&#xD;
      therapy (450 mg/day) compared to low dose PGB therapy (150 mg/day) in subjects with medically&#xD;
      refractory partial epilepsy not fully controlled despite treatment with 1-2 concomitant&#xD;
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interictal anxiety symptoms are reported in two-thirds of patients with epilepsy and&#xD;
      represent an underrecognized and undertreated aspect of the disorder. Interictal anxiety is&#xD;
      postulated to stem from both fear of seizure recurrence (&quot;seizure phobia&quot;) and dispersed&#xD;
      locus of control.In addition, anxiety and the most common forms of partial onset epilepsy are&#xD;
      viewed to arise from dysfunction in a common neurobiological substrate-the amygdala and other&#xD;
      structures within the limbic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background on Pregabalin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregabalin (CI-1008,Lyrica) is a chemical analogue of the mammalian neurotransmitter&#xD;
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA),although it does not bind to or activates GABA receptors or&#xD;
      inhibit GABA uptake. Pregabalin is an alpha-2-delta ligand that has analgesic, anxiolytic,&#xD;
      and antiepileptic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly used for mood disorders including anxiety.Pregabalin&#xD;
      (PGB) the most recently FDA-approved AED for add-on therapy for refractory partial seizures&#xD;
      also has demonstrated efficacy in Generalized Anxiety Disorder. PGB binds to the&#xD;
      alpha-2-delta subunit protein of voltage-gated calcium channels, and in animal models, has&#xD;
      anxiolytic and anti-epileptic effects via pre-synaptic inhibition of the release of several&#xD;
      excitatory neurotransmitters.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An IRB-approved consent form signed and dated by the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of partial epilepsy which is drug resistant according to the International&#xD;
             League Against Epilepsy criteria (Failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and&#xD;
             appropriately chosen and used AED schedules (whether as monotherapies or in&#xD;
             combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom). Furthermore to meet the ILAE&#xD;
             definition of drug resistance, subjects will have had breakthrough seizures occurring&#xD;
             at a frequency of less than 3 times the longest pretreatment interseizure interval or&#xD;
             every 12 months, which ever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects that score â‰¥18 on Beck Anxiety Inventory will be included in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
