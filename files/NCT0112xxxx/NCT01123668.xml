    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how nicotine, withdrawal from nicotine, and&#xD;
      methylphenidate (a drug used for the treatment of ADHD) affect the brain of smokers with and&#xD;
      without ADHD while doing tasks in an functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. compared to non-ADHD smokers, smokers with ADHD will exhibit greater abstinence-induced&#xD;
           decrements in response inhibition performance and reward and greater concomitant&#xD;
           disruptions of brain activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. administration of MPH to abstinent smokers will ameliorate response inhibition&#xD;
           performance and reward deficits and task-related brain activation and this effect will&#xD;
           be greater among ADHD smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. genetic markers of dopamine neurotransmission will moderate abstinence- and MPH -&#xD;
           induced changes in task-related brain activation across tasks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) smoke more than&#xD;
      the general population, initiate use at a younger age, and report more difficulty trying to&#xD;
      quit. The overarching goal of the present application is to use neuroimaging,&#xD;
      neuropharmacological and molecular genetic techniques to study the neurobiological basis of&#xD;
      abstinence-induced deficits in response inhibition in ADHD and non-ADHD smokers. Twenty&#xD;
      smokers with ADHD and 20 smokers without ADHD will undergo imaging during a Go/No-Go task&#xD;
      under the following conditions: 1) smoking as usual, 2) 24 hr smoking abstinence, and 3) 24&#xD;
      hr smoking abstinence + methylphenidate (MPH). We hypothesize that compared to smoking as&#xD;
      usual, 24 hr smoking abstinence will result in decrements in response inhibition and&#xD;
      disruption of task-related brain activation. These effects will be greater in ADHD as&#xD;
      compared to non-ADHD smokers. We further hypothesize that MPH administration during&#xD;
      abstinence will restore performance and brain indices of response inhibition and that the&#xD;
      magnitude of the effect of MPH will be greater among smokers with ADHD. In addition to the&#xD;
      above aims, we will preliminarily evaluate the moderating effects of the dopamine receptor D4&#xD;
      7-repeat allele on task-related brain activation following smoking abstinence and MPH&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, 101 subjects signed consents and 38 subjects completed the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>July 2009 through December 2013</time_frame>
    <description>Smokers will undergo three functional Magnetic Resonance Image scanning sessions while performing a task that measures response inhibition (Go/Go/No-Go task) Scanning will take place in the following conditions: smoking as usual + placebo pill, 24 hr smoking abstinence + placebo pill and 24 hr abstinence + methylphenidate (MPH). Methylphenidate is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and its administration will allow us to evaluate the role of dopamine neurotransmission on response inhibition in the context of smoking abstinence.</description>
