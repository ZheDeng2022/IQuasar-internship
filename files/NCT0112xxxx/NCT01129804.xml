  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Network Support project is part of an ongoing effort to improve treatment for alcohol&#xD;
      dependent patients. The Network Support Project is designed to help patients change their&#xD;
      social network from one that reinforces drinking behavior to one that reinforces sobriety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      160 patients will be assigned to one of two treatments. Each of the treatments will last 12&#xD;
      weeks. The first is a Network Support (NS) treatment designed to help patients develop new&#xD;
      acquaintances and social networks. It is expected that alcohol dependent patients will&#xD;
      benefit from increasing their contact with non-drinking people. This NS condition will be&#xD;
      compared to a packaged CBT program for alcoholics (PCBT) that is designed to teach a number&#xD;
      of skills to help people stop drinking, but does not address social networks per se.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to better understand what is happening to the investigators patients, the&#xD;
      investigators will be using daily computerized telephone calls to ask about people's&#xD;
      experiences. This will be done both before and after treatment. Patients will also be asked&#xD;
      to participate in follow-up interviews every 3 months for 2 years following the end of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Network Support treatment is aimed at helping patients change their social support network so that it supports abstinence. In this treatment patients will be encouraged to attend AA meetings and engage in other activities that would involve non-drinkers. These activities would be determined by the patient, with help from the therapist. Patients would learn about methods of avoiding drinking, making new friends, and getting enjoyment from activities other than drinking. In addition patients will learn specific skills intended to help them make new acquaintances and change their circle of friends.</description>

            <description>Network Support treatment is aimed at helping patients change their social support network so that it supports abstinence. In this treatment patients will be encouraged to attend AA meetings and engage in other activities that would involve non-drinkers. These activities would be determined by the patient, with help from the therapist. Patients would learn about methods of avoiding drinking, making new friends, and getting enjoyment from activities other than drinking. In addition patients will learn specific skills intended to help them make new acquaintances and change their circle of friends.&#xD;

            <other_analysis_desc>Multilevel longitudinal modeling (MLM) with random effects and maximum likelihood estimation (Proc MIXED; SAS Institute, 1999) was used to evaluate the effects of treatment over time for each of the continuously scaled outcome variables described above. The MLM approach was used because it employs maximum likelihood estimation of covariance matrices rather than raw data, allowing us to take advantage of all data collected for anyone randomized to treatment. Each repeated dependent variable was analyzed as a unction of treatment condition, time since intake (in months), and the interaction of treatment condition by time.</other_analysis_desc>
