  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune dysregulations, including cytokines and chemokines secretions occurs in alcoholic&#xD;
      liver disease. Serum levels and liver expression of CCL2 are increased in patients with&#xD;
      alcoholic hepatitis but the role of this chemokine in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver&#xD;
      disease is nevertheless unknown. The aim of the study is to analyze plasma level and liver&#xD;
      expression of CCL2 and their relation with liver disease severity and inflammatory infiltrate&#xD;
      in our cohort of alcoholic patients. We studied also the association between -2518 CCL2&#xD;
      polymorphism and the severity of alcoholic liver disease.&#xD;

        Consecutive patients undergoing transjugular liver biopsy for alcoholic liver disease will&#xD;
        be include in the study to measure plasma levels and hepatic expression of CCL2. We&#xD;
        determine also the rs1024611 polymorphism of these patients. All these parameters are&#xD;
        correlated to severity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The frequency of the presence of this polymorphism was also compared to a population of&#xD;
        healthy subjects.&#xD;
