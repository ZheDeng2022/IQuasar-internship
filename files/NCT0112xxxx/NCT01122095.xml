      Hypothesis 1: Patients with psoriasis will have clinical and laboratory assessments differing&#xD;
      from control patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Patients with psoriasis will have laboratory alterations that correlate with&#xD;
      other clinical characteristics of their psoriasis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Psoriasis was initially considered an inflammatory condition primarily of the skin. However,&#xD;
      advances in medical knowledge have allowed insight into the wide-ranging systemic effects of&#xD;
      long-term uncontrolled inflammation, thus shifting the concept of psoriasis from an&#xD;
      inflammatory disease restricted to the skin to a systemic process. Adults w/ psoriasis have&#xD;
      higher rates of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and smoking and the&#xD;
      prevalence of each risk factor increases as the extent of psoriasis increases.1 It is&#xD;
      uncertain if any of this relates to a behavioral reaction to having psoriasis or as a&#xD;
      separate part of the disease process. Inflammation has a role in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease most noted by multiple observational studies of psoriasis patients&#xD;
      which demonstrate an increased risk of arterial or venous events, notably myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, cerebrovascular events, pulmonary emboli, cardiovascular death or mortality&#xD;
      overall. Specifically, Gelfand et. al. show an increased relative risk for myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and an increased hazard ratio for mortality in patients with severe psoriasis, but&#xD;
      most notably, show highest risk in younger adult patients. There is a paucity of data on&#xD;
      risks with psoriasis in the pediatric and adolescent age group.&#xD;
