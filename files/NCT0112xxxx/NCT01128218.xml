  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extent of resection is a very important prognostic factor affecting survival in individuals&#xD;
      diagnosed with a malignant glioma. However, the infiltrative nature of the malignant glioma&#xD;
      tumor cells produces indistinct borders between normal and malignant tissues, and the lack of&#xD;
      easily identifiable tumor margins confounds attempts at total resection. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to identify the borders of malignant gliomas intraoperatively using oral&#xD;
      5-aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) which results in fluorescence of the malignant cells and&#xD;
      thereby provide an opportunity for more complete tumor resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When exogenous 5-ALA is provided at increased concentration the tumor cells will become&#xD;
      fluorescent under ultraviolet light. This feature identifies the tumor cells intraoperatively&#xD;
      and facilitates complete resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will include measurement of dose-limiting toxicity, tumor fluorescence, and&#xD;
      tumor density. Data analysis will evaluate toxicity, sensitivity, and specificity of 5-ALA.&#xD;
      Time-to-progression, one year survival rate and total survival will be measured as a function&#xD;
      of the extent of resection. (Details below in Detailed Description.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the phase 1 portion of this trial, an additional 15 subjects will be&#xD;
      entered at the recommended phase 2 dose level in order to further define the above parameters&#xD;
      at the recommended phase 2 dose level.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to investigate the utility, safety and efficacy of 5-aminolevulinic&#xD;
      acid (5-ALA) induced brain tumor fluorescence during malignant brain tumor resection.&#xD;
      Specifically this study is intended to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establish a safe dose for oral 5-ALA administration. Determine the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of 5-ALA mediated fluorescence for malignant glioma tissue in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the neurosurgeon's intra-operative estimate of the extent of malignant glioma&#xD;
      resection (as guided by tumor fluorescence) with the actual extent of resection determined by&#xD;
      post-operative imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare time-to-progression and survival to that in comparable cases performed without the&#xD;
      aid of 5-ALA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a considerable body of literature that suggests that completeness of resection is a&#xD;
      positive factor for longer term survival in individuals with malignant glioma. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      it is often difficult to completely remove a malignant brain tumor because during surgery it&#xD;
      is sometimes very difficult to distinguish tumor from normal brain. It would be very helpful&#xD;
      if there would be some way to help the surgeon make this distinction. Malignant glioma tumor&#xD;
      cells (more so than normal cells) contain the biosynthetic pathways to produce protoporphyrin&#xD;
      from a naturally occurring amino acid, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). Protoporphyrin is the&#xD;
      immediate precursor to hemoglobin (it is hemoglobin without the iron atom) and is fluorescent&#xD;
      under blue light. When exogenous 5-ALA is provided at increased concentration, protoporphyrin&#xD;
      concentration in the malignant cell increases at a rate far greater than normal brain cells&#xD;
      and renders the malignant cell fluorescent red under blue light. This feature distinguishes&#xD;
      the tumor cells from normal cells intraoperatively and facilitates complete resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies in Germany have confirmed the utility of pre-operative oral 5-ALA and&#xD;
      intraoperative brain tumor fluorescence in aiding the resection of brain tumors in&#xD;
      individuals with malignant brain tumors. These studies have led to oral 5-ALA to be approved&#xD;
      for this indication by the European Medicines Agency (The European Medicines Agency comments&#xD;
      and approval can be found at:&#xD;
      http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/gliolan/H-744-en6.pdf), but oral 5-ALA has not&#xD;
      been approved for this indication by the United States FDA. This proposal is a phase 1 and&#xD;
      phase 2 trial that will hopefully lead to FDA approval of oral 5-ALA for intra-operative&#xD;
      visualization of malignant brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Plan and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 1 part of this proposed study, a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 18 patients will&#xD;
      be administered oral 5-ALA 4 hours prior to surgery in cohorts of 3 at five escalating doses&#xD;
      of 5-ALA (10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose-limiting toxicity data; i.e., nausea, vomiting, liver function, photo-sensitivity,&#xD;
           survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor fluorescence assessed by neurosurgeon (0 to +++) in three distinct areas of&#xD;
           fluorescence (Strong fluorescence, Weak fluorescence, No fluorescence)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor density from biopsies obtained by the neurosurgeon in the same three distinct&#xD;
           areas of fluorescence and assessed by neuropathology (Solid tumor, Tumor mixed&#xD;
           infiltrating normal brain, No tumor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurosurgeon's intra-operative estimate of residual tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuroradiologist's estimate of post-operative residual tumor on MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to progression by MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival (time to progression, one year survival rate and total survival)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  single dose toxicity of oral 5-ALA given pre-operatively;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sensitivity and specificity of 5-ALA - Protoporphyrin IX (Pp IX) as an intraoperative&#xD;
           fluorescent detection agent and aid for resection of tumor tissue remaining in the walls&#xD;
           of the resection cavity of primary and recurrent malignant brain tumors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  relationship of the neurosurgeon's estimate of the extent of malignant glioma resection&#xD;
           (as guided by tumor fluorescence) to the actual extent of resection determined by&#xD;
           post-operative imaging;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time-to-progression, one year survival rate and total survival as a function of the&#xD;
           extent of resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the phase 1 portion of this trial, an additional 15 subjects will be&#xD;
      entered at the recommended phase 2 dose level in order to further define the above parameters&#xD;
      at the recommended phase 2 dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussions statisticians have led to the development of a number of 2x2 tables and 3x3&#xD;
      tables of data analysis that will lead to establishment of the sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      fluorescence-guided brain tumor resection compared to conventional brain tumor resection&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
