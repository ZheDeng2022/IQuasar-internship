  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study is the first step to determine if Opal immunotherapy may have potential&#xD;
      utility as a treatment for HIV. Although effective treatments for HIV infection exist, they&#xD;
      are limited by the requirement for life-long daily treatment, cost, side effects, and the&#xD;
      development of resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for therapeutic approaches that induce or enhance T-cell immunity to control&#xD;
      HIV disease. Overlapping Peptide-pulsed Autologous Cells (Opal) is a technique where&#xD;
      autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or whole blood is pulsed with sets of&#xD;
      overlapping peptides spanning whole proteins of HIV.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opal-HIV-Gag(c) is not for direct injection and is administered by ex vivo incubation of&#xD;
      whole blood or separated blood components (such as white blood cells or peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells) and reinfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a practical alternative to PBMC separation and to optimise vaccine presentation during the&#xD;
      ex vivo incubation, a blood cell separation device will be used to separate the whole blood&#xD;
      and enrich the white blood cell component. The device processes whole blood in a closed,&#xD;
      single use disposable kit. Reconstituted Opal-HIV-Gag(c)or matching placebo will be added to&#xD;
      the white blood cells, incubated for one hour and reinfused into the subject. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive 4 administrations at 4 weekly intervals. Subjects are followed for 12 weeks after the&#xD;
      final administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dose group will be enrolled sequentially, with a sentinel group for each dose group.&#xD;
      Satisfactory safety data from each cohort, reviewed by a Data Safety Monitoring Board, will&#xD;
      permit dose escalation.&#xD;
