  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaemia is a common complication of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) the management of which has&#xD;
      been aided by the use of synthetic recombinant human erythropoietin therapy (r-HuEPO). This&#xD;
      red cell stimulating agent creates the further complication of Functional Iron Deficiency&#xD;
      (FID) where, despite normal iron stores, patients fail to respond to therapy as they do not&#xD;
      possess enough available iron to meet the demand of increased red cell production. Effective&#xD;
      response to r-HuEPO therapy depends on an appropriate monitoring of 'available' iron levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research into the clinical utility of testing for reticulated haemoglobin&#xD;
      concentrations (Ret He) instead of Serum Ferritin and Transferrin Saturation analysis has&#xD;
      indicated an advantage as an iron deficient prognostic marker however, further knowledge is&#xD;
      required on the use of this new laboratory test (RetHe) to predict Functional Iron Deficiency&#xD;
      (FID) level and to study it's relationship with responses to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study aims to estimate a local working Normal (non deficient) and Iron&#xD;
      Deficient Reticulated Haemoglobin Content (RET He) reference range from surplus anonamous&#xD;
      samples. Routine monthly blood samples from Pre Dialysis and Haemodialysis patients will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the RET He test compared to current&#xD;
      laboratory tests and investigate its predictive ability for Functional Iron Deficiency in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studying , measuring and statistically analysing the change in the RET He parameters in&#xD;
      Haemodialysis and Pre Dialysis patients over 3 months will look for evidence of a direct&#xD;
      relationship between RET He values and the patients response to therapy. The data will be&#xD;
      used to provide a predictive picture of what levels of RET He indicate Functional Iron&#xD;
      Deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of this test (RetHe) may provide clinicians with a one sample/one test&#xD;
      control over iron therapies and ensure the patient gets the most benefit from erythropoietin&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      Reference Range Testing for new test RET-He will be performed on excess blood available on&#xD;
      randomly selected anonamised samples obtained from the daily workload of the laboratory once&#xD;
      all the clinically requested analysis has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 samples (50 men / 50 women)determined to have normal parameters(as defined by Dacie et&#xD;
      al, 10th Edition) and 100 samples (50 men / 50 women)determined to be iron deficient (as&#xD;
      defined by Dacie et al, 10th Edition)will be processed for new test parameter (RetHe) under a&#xD;
      coded number to ensure no identifying data is recorded. The samples will be archived and and&#xD;
      held within the lab for 24 hours prior to routine disposal in accordance with NHS Fife Waste&#xD;
      Management Policy.The data will be analysed using a paired t test to determine significant&#xD;
      differences and reference range inferred inferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of sensitivity / specificity of new Ret He test in determinimg iron deficiency and&#xD;
      functional iron deficiency and it's response to terapy will be tested using Haemodialysis and&#xD;
      Pre-Dialysis Patient Samples (~180 Haemodialysis Patients and ~250 Pre Dialysis Patients)that&#xD;
      are obtained during their normal renal unit / clinic appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consenting NHS Fife Haemodialysis /Pre Dialysis patients will be allocated a 'Subject&#xD;
      Identification Number' as part of this study (which will be noted at the top of their Consent&#xD;
      Form). This number will be used by the Student Investigator to generate a confidential Coding&#xD;
      Key which will be kept separate from data information and secure uner an NHS password&#xD;
      protected computer. This will ensure care of personal information and will be used&#xD;
      through-out the study by the student investigator to record all generated data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be grouped into categories such as Dialysis / Pre Dialysis on a coded SPSS&#xD;
      (statistical software) file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consenting patients will attend their routine scheduled Renal Clinic appointments as&#xD;
      normal (no additional appointments are necessary for this pilot study)and their response to&#xD;
      therapy will be observed using the new RetHe test parameter compared to existing laboratory&#xD;
      tests utlised (FBC,Ferritin and Transferrin Saturation Levels)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemodialysis Patients - June 2010, July 2010*, August 2010&#xD;
&#xD;
      (* NB: In July 2010 Haemodialysis patients are scheduled to have their Ferritin and&#xD;
      Transferrin Saturation Levels checked and therfore no additional sample will be required)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Routine venesection of EDTA (purple topped) sample for Full Blood Count (FBC) Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Routine venesection of Clotted (yellow topped) sample for Biochemistry Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Additional venesection of extra yellow topped sample for non routine Ferritin&#xD;
           Test(*usually scheduled every 3 months- routine date due: July 2010)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Renal Unit Staff label samples and complete request form:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Haematology section ticked for: FBC (as normal routine) , Retics (to allow addition of&#xD;
           new Ret He test to FBC analysis) and Ferritin (additional request in June and August)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Biochemistry section ticked for : All routinely requested Biochemistry tests (such as&#xD;
           Urea and Electrolytes) plus additional request for Transferrin Saturation Levels (in&#xD;
           June and August)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sample and Requests sent to Fife Area Lab for Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           The project will be carried out within NHS Fife Area Laboratory Haematology Department&#xD;
           and will involve the use of NHS premises, facilities and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Request checked at Laboratory Central Reception (sample and request form labelled with&#xD;
           unique positive barcode identification)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Request Forms sent to central request entry and samples delivered to appropriate&#xD;
           laboratories&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. FBC samples checked prior to analysis to check request details entered into Laboratory&#xD;
           Host Computer System&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. FBC sample loaded onto Sysmex XE2100 Haematology Analyser for testing&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Bidirectional Computer Link between Laboratory Host Computer System and Analyser ensures&#xD;
           sample tested for FBC and additionally requested RETIC (reticulocyte analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Sysmex XE2100 automatically analyses sample for Red Blood Cell Indices and additionally&#xD;
           uses fluorescent polymethine dye to stain for RNA/DNA content of reticulated cells&#xD;
           (early red blood cell precursors). The analyser uses inbuilt Flow Cytometry and measures&#xD;
           forward scatter to separate cells by size (this is reported as RBC-Y and RET-Y)&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Sysmex XE2100 RETIC Master software (recently upgraded packaged loaded onto NHS Fife&#xD;
           Analysers)uses an algorithm (RET-He = 5.5569e 0.001RET-Y) to convert RET-Y into a&#xD;
           reportable mean reticulocyte haemoglobin content (RET He) which is expressed in&#xD;
           picograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. The sample once analysed is removed from the analyser and the results are either&#xD;
           autovalidated and archived (if results are within normal range) or held for validation&#xD;
           by a NHS Fife qualified Biomedical Scientist.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. The routinely requested FBC results are available for clinicians within same timescale&#xD;
           as normal (no delay due to additional RetHe analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. The sample is archived under their unique identifying barcode numbers and held within&#xD;
           the lab for 24 hours prior to routine disposal in accordance with NHS Fife Waste&#xD;
           Management Policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. The new RetHe value will be held on Sysmex XE2100 analyser (not activated as a&#xD;
           reportable test to NHS Fife Biomedical Scientists or clinical staff.)&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. The Student Investigator will (on same day as analysis) retrospectively generate a Renal&#xD;
           Unit worklist from the Laboratory Host Computer System which will indicate: how many&#xD;
           samples received, barcode numbers, names of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
       18. The Student Investigator will (on same day as analysis) retrospectively use the&#xD;
           generated worklist to search the Sysmex XE2100 analysers for Ret-He test results and the&#xD;
           host computer system for results of Ferritin and Transferrin Saturation Levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
       19. The barcode number of the patient and their test results will initially be recorded in&#xD;
           the student investigators laboratory handbook (the generated worklist will be discarded&#xD;
           into NHS Fife Confidential Waste)&#xD;
&#xD;
       20. The student investigator will record the test values into a coded SPSS (statistical&#xD;
           software) file for appropriate analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
       21. The investigator will retrospectively match the test data with therapy regime data&#xD;
           provided by the Renal Unit (monthly meetings)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre Dialysis Patients: June 2010, July 2010, August 2010&#xD;
&#xD;
      (NB: Pre Dialysis Patients are tested 3 monthly so over period of study should get a baseline&#xD;
      sample from each consenting patient. Only those patients who are considered iron replete and&#xD;
      are placed on 5 week course of iron therpay will be further tested at their follow-up&#xD;
      appointments in order to measure response to therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Routine venesection of EDTA (purple topped) sample for Full Blood Count (FBC) Test,&#xD;
           clotted (yellow topped) for Ferritin and clotted (yellow topped)sample for Transferrin&#xD;
           Saturation Levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Renal Unit Staff label samples and complete request form:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Haematology section ticked for: FBC (as normal routine) , Retics (to allow addition of&#xD;
           new Ret He test to FBC analysis) and Ferritin (routine request)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Biochemistry section ticked for : All routinely requested Biochemistry tests (such as&#xD;
           Urea and Electrolytes) plus routine request for Transferrin Saturation Levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample and Requests sent to Fife Area Lab for Analysis&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two groups of random routine anonamised blood samples (for use in determinimg a local&#xD;
             normal range for the Reticulated Haemoglobin Content [RetHe])will be included in the&#xD;
             study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal red blood cell (RBC) Indices (Hb , Haematocrit, Mean Cell Volume ande Mean Cell&#xD;
        Haemoglobin Content) ; an attempt will be made to select an equal mixture of men / women&#xD;
        and an appropriate age spread to provide a valid control range for the group of test&#xD;
        subjects (renal patients) The student Investigator will ask Haematology staff to record&#xD;
        minimum details of iron deficient patients and &quot;normal&quot; test results noted at routine&#xD;
        validation [positive identification number (barcode)/ age / sex] - these samples will be&#xD;
