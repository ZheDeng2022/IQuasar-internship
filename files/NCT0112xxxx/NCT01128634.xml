             postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section&#xD;

             listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal spirometry (FEV1 ≥ 80% of predicted, FEV1/FVC ≥ 70%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-smokers (never smoked or not smoking for &gt;6 months with &lt;10 pack years history&#xD;
             (Pack years = (cigarettes per day smoked/20) x number of years smoked))&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Available to complete the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically important abnormality identified at the screening medical assessment&#xD;
             (physical examination/medical history), clinical laboratory tests, ECG (12-lead) or&#xD;
             from 24hr Holter monitoring. If the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree&#xD;
             that a finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere&#xD;
             with the study procedures a subject can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A mean QTc(B) value at screening &gt;450msec, or an ECG that is not suitable for QT&#xD;
             measurements (e.g. LBBB or poorly defined termination of the T wave).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of elevated resting blood pressure or a mean blood pressure higher than&#xD;
             140/90 mmHg at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A mean heart rate outside the range 40-90 bpm at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates and&#xD;
             benzodiazepines. The detection of drugs with a legitimate medical use would not&#xD;
             necessarily be an exclusion to study participation. The detection of alcohol would not&#xD;
             be an exclusion at screening but would need to be negative pre-dose and during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first&#xD;
             dosing day.&#xD;

             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical&#xD;
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, verapamil or components&#xD;
             thereof, known allergy or hypersensitivity to milk protein or the excipients lactose&#xD;
             monohydrate and MgSt, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is unable to use the novel dry powder inhaler correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;

             tiotropium, atropine and any of its derivatives.&#xD;
