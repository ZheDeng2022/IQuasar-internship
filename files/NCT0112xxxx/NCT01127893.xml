    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug, up to early termination (Day 107) that were absent before treatment in this study or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug, up to early termination (Day 107) that were absent before treatment in this study or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

        <description>The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis in the index joint in the past 48 hours. It is calculated as the mean of the scores from the 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

          <description>The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis in the index joint in the past 48 hours. It is calculated as the mean of the scores from the 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <description>The WOMAC stiffness subscale is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced in the index joint in the past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of the scores from the 2 individual questions scored on NRS of 0 to 10; where higher scores indicated more stiffness. Total score range for WOMAC stiffness subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated more stiffness. Stiffness is defined as a sensation of decreased ease in movement of the index joint.</description>
