    <textblock>
      The Novel Markers Trial will compare the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of two&#xD;
      different epithelial ovarian cancer screening strategies that use CA125 and add HE4 as either&#xD;
      a first or second line screen. This study is the next step in a larger research effort to&#xD;
      develop a blood test that can be used as a screening method for the early detection of&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is usually lethal unless it is diagnosed at an early stage,&#xD;
      thus early detection is likely to play an important role in reducing its mortality. Within&#xD;
      the Ovarian Specialized Programs of Research Excellence Pacific Ovarian Cancer Research&#xD;
      Consortium (POCRC) researchers have been working for a decade to discover, develop, and&#xD;
      validate biomarkers (proteins or substances found in blood) that could help save lives by&#xD;
      detecting EOC early. During the last five years several biomarkers, including CA125, have&#xD;
      been evaluated for their ability to detect EOC at an earlier stage. The best markers will now&#xD;
      be studied in a new randomized controlled trial of ovarian cancer screening.&#xD;
