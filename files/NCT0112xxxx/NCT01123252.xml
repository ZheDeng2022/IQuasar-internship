      The study aims to examine the effect of probiotics on the clinical symptoms of allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis and to elucidate some of the immunological mechanisms involved.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of atopic diseases (eczema, food&#xD;
      allergy, allergic rhinitis and asthma) has been rising over the last few decades. The rate of&#xD;
      increase precludes genetic make-up as the sole cause of the atopic epidemic and implicates&#xD;
      environmental factors instead. Currently, allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is one of the world's&#xD;
      most common chronic allergic diseases. It affects over 600 million people and often leads to&#xD;
      asthma. There are huge costs associated with the condition in terms of both health care and&#xD;
      work days lost, with British businesses estimated to lose Â£324 million this summer alone. For&#xD;
      the sufferers, the symptoms severely affect their quality of life. It disturbs their sleep&#xD;
      and impairs daytime concentration and performance at work or school. Currently there is no&#xD;
      cure for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of the gut microbiota in general well-being is evidenced by several&#xD;
      experimental observations. It is difficult to achieve oral tolerance in germ-free animals&#xD;
      [Sudo et al. 1997] while administration of lipopolysaccharide (a constituent of the outer&#xD;
      membrane of gram-negative bacteria) together with food antigens increases the tolerizing&#xD;
      effect of feeding [Kim &amp; Ohsawa 1995]. While able to assist in tolerance induction, bacterial&#xD;
      products may also break oral tolerance [Gaboriau-Routhiau et al. 1996]. These findings led&#xD;
      Wold to suggest in 1998 that an altered normal intestinal colonization pattern in infancy,&#xD;
      which fails to induce immunological tolerance, could be responsible for the increase in&#xD;
      allergies. Recent studies suggest that the effects of the gut microbiota may not only be&#xD;
      related to food antigens, but also to aeroallergens [Noverr et al. 2004, 2005]. Forsythe and&#xD;
      his colleagues (2007) managed to attenuate adverse airway responses in a mouse model of&#xD;
      allergic asthma through oral administration of probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms by which probiotics exert their effects are unknown at present, but&#xD;
      experiments in mice have documented improved gastrointestinal barrier function [Ewaschuk et&#xD;
      al. 2008]. Since these experiments have also revealed a strain-dependent heterogeneity in the&#xD;
      efficacy of probiotics [N.G. Hord 2008] it is unlikely that improved barrier function alone&#xD;
      is responsible for the beneficial effects noted. Given the sheer numbers of microorganisms&#xD;
      that inhabit our mucosal surfaces, it is likely that there are normally bidirectional&#xD;
      interactions between them and the epithelial, immune, neurologic and endocrine physiological&#xD;
      processes initiated by and between them. We hypothesize that a probiotic organism is ingested&#xD;
      in sufficient quantities to amplify its particular trait relative to the milieu of other&#xD;
      organisms present in relatively lower quantities, temporarily over-riding the diversity&#xD;
      present. In that case, the transfer of information between the probiotic organism and&#xD;
      cellular components of the gut has particular impact. In order to understand and manipulate&#xD;
      this probiotic-mucosa cross-talk towards therapeutic advantage, there is a need to focus on&#xD;
      the transfer of information between the microbiota and cellular components of the mucosal&#xD;
      immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have examined the effect of probiotics on allergic rhinitis and the studies that&#xD;
      have been performed [Helin et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2004; Xiao et al. 2006] are inconclusive.&#xD;
      In our own pilot study we tested the ability of Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) to alter&#xD;
      immunological events in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) [Ivory et al. 2008]. The study&#xD;
      format was double-blinded and placebo-controlled with ten SAR sufferers in each group. We&#xD;
      compared changes in immune status arising through the daily ingestion of a milk drink&#xD;
      supplied by Yakult, with or without live LcS, over a period of 5 months. Pre-, peak- and&#xD;
      post-grass pollen season blood samples were collected for determination of plasma grass&#xD;
      pollen-specific IgG and IgE levels by immunoassay. At the same time, cytokine levels were&#xD;
      determined by flow cytometric bead array technology following culture of peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells for six days in the presence or absence of specific grass pollen antigens.&#xD;
      We found that volunteers treated with LcS showed a significant reduction in levels of&#xD;
      antigen-induced IL-5, IL-6 and IFN- production compared to volunteers supplemented with&#xD;
      placebo. Meanwhile, levels of pollen-specific IgG increased and IgE decreased in the&#xD;
      probiotic group. Other changes in cytokine levels were seen but they did not attain&#xD;
      statistical significance, most likely due to the small number of volunteers tested. Our work&#xD;
      has established for the first time that probiotic supplementation modulates immune responses&#xD;
      in allergic rhinitis through down-regulation of both Th1- and Th2-type cytokines and to&#xD;
      beneficially alter the balance of pollen-specific IgG and IgE levels in allergic rhinitis&#xD;
      subjects. It has also suggested that the impact of probiotics reaches beyond the intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would now like to conduct another study to show that the immunological changes arising&#xD;
      through probiotic consumption have an impact on the clinical symptoms of hay fever. In&#xD;
      addition, we propose to elucidate some of the mechanisms involved that may contribute to the&#xD;
      health benefit. As far as we know there have not been any similar studies to date. The&#xD;
      ability to demonstrate clinical efficacy of dietary intervention for hay fever treatment has&#xD;
      obvious benefits for the relevant sufferers. Economic benefits would arise through the&#xD;
      relatively inexpensive 'treatment' that would be self-administered and likely lower&#xD;
      absenteeism from work. There is also a need for evidence-based viability for the many health&#xD;
      claims made for probiotic consumption that could result in clear guidance to the general&#xD;
      public.&#xD;
