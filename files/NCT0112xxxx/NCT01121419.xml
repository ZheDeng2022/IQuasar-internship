    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma (NB), a common cancer of early childhood originating from primitive sympathetic&#xD;
      neural precursors, is characterized by the remarkable heterogeneity of clinical behaviors&#xD;
      from spontaneous regression to rapid progression and death. The current therapeutic options&#xD;
      are developed according to the Children's Oncology Group (COG) risk stratification criteria&#xD;
      based on clinical and biological factors, including tumor stage, MYCN status, age at&#xD;
      diagnosis, histology, and ploidy status. 1-2 The treatment strategies ranging from&#xD;
      observation alone to intensive multimodality therapy depends on the risk stratification of&#xD;
      three subgroups of low, intermediate, and high risk of death. Despite a number of molecular&#xD;
      and biologic factors has been identified to predict the prognosis, MYCN amplification, which&#xD;
      occurring in roughly 20% of primary NB, is one of the most powerful prognostic factors.3 The&#xD;
      co-opting neurotrophin pathways including the neurotrophin receptors (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC)&#xD;
      and their ligands (NGF, BDNF, and neurotrophin-3, respectively), which regulate the&#xD;
      differentiation, apoptosis, and growth of neural cells, are also important molecules related&#xD;
      to the prognosis of NB.4 However, a proportion of patients with MYCN nonamplified NB still&#xD;
      presents clinically aggressive progression similar to those of MYCN amplified tumors,&#xD;
      suggesting that other unfavorable molecules exist for the inferior survival.5-6 The IGF-II&#xD;
      RNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3), also known as L532S or K homology domain-containing protein&#xD;
      overexpressed in cancer (KOC), is a member of RNA-binding protein family which includes IMP1,&#xD;
      IMP2, and IMP3. The IMPs are primarily expressed during early embryogenesis and have been&#xD;
      implicated in various post-transcriptional functions, including mRNA localization, cell&#xD;
      growth, and cell migration during early embryogenesis.7-8 The IMP3 orthologue Vg1-RBP in&#xD;
      Xenopus has also been described to promote migration of neural crest cells.9 Recently, the&#xD;
      IMP3 is considered an oncofetal protein by increasing proliferation and invasion in various&#xD;
      cancers including pancreas, kidney, and lung cancers.10-14 The expression of IMP3 is,&#xD;
      however, low or undetectable in adjacent benign tissues.13 These lines of evidence indicate&#xD;
      that IMP3 is capable of a potential biomarker to predict cancer progression and metastasis,&#xD;
      and may serve as a target molecule for cancer therapy.14&#xD;
&#xD;
      oligonucleotide microarray is a powerful tool to do a genome-wide screening of candidate&#xD;
      genes related to cancer prognosis.15 In this study, 22 primary NB tumors were subjected to&#xD;
      oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Among the differentially expressed genes according to&#xD;
      the patients' prognosis, IMP3 showed an especially high expression level in NB tumors&#xD;
      carrying unfavorable prognosis. Further evaluation of IMP3 expression in a large sample size&#xD;
      demonstrated that IMP3 expression could predict an unfavorable prognosis of NB patients&#xD;
      independent of other biomarkers. Targeting of IMP3 expression in a NB cell line did suppress&#xD;
      cell invasion ability, suggesting that IMP3 could not only be a prognostic factor, but also&#xD;
      be a potential therapeutic target of NB.&#xD;
