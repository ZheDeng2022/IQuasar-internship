      Atrophic vaginitis is a condition in which the skin lining of the vagina and labia becomes&#xD;
      thin and symptoms develop including vaginal itching, vaginal discomfort and dyspareunia.&#xD;
      These can significantly affect women's comfort, sexuality and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for this condition includes estrogen given in pill form, commonly known as hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy and local estrogen treatments, such as vaginal estrogen creams and&#xD;
      topical vaginal lubricants. Unfortunately, systemic estrogen is contraindicated in many women&#xD;
      with breast cancer. Some providers also feel that women who are taking aromatase inhibitors&#xD;
      for their breast cancer should also not use local estrogens as several small studies suggest&#xD;
      that these treatments might effect estrogen levels and thus might change how effective the&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors are. If these women choose not to use any form of estrogen therapy there&#xD;
      symptoms may not be well controlled with other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a vaginal testosterone cream might be a safe and effective&#xD;
      alternative treatment for these women. This small study is intended to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that testosterone cream will not increase estrogen (estradiol) levels and that it will&#xD;
      improve the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis including vaginal dryness, vaginal itching and&#xD;
      pain with intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll women in the trial who are taking an aromatase inhibitor and&#xD;
      have the symptoms mentioned above. They will receive a testosterone cream which will be&#xD;
      applied vaginally once a day for 28 days. If good results are found with a prespecified dose&#xD;
      of testosterone, a lower dose will be tested in the next group of women enrolled.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Atrophic vaginitis is a condition in which the skin lining of the vagina and labia becomes&#xD;
      thin, usually due to a decreased estrogen state - such as menopause. Symptoms of atrophic&#xD;
      vaginitis include vaginal itching, vaginal discomfort and dyspareunia and can significantly&#xD;
      affect women's comfort, sexuality and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for this condition includes estrogen given in pill form, commonly known as hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy and local estrogen treatments, such as vaginal estrogen creams and&#xD;
      topical vaginal lubricants. Unfortunately, systemic estrogen is contraindicated in many women&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. Does topical testosterone cream affect serum estradiol levels in women taking aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors for breast cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Can atrophic vaginitis and resultant symptoms of vaginal dryness, itching and&#xD;
      dyspareunia in women taking aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer be&#xD;
      improved with a topical testosterone cream?&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Does topical testosterone cream affect physical findings, pH and cytologic changes in&#xD;
      atrophic vaginitis?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schema:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention - Subjects will apply a testosterone cream to the vaginal area daily for one&#xD;
      month (28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation - Before and after the study intervention participants will have testosterone and&#xD;
      high-sensitivity estradiol tested. They will complete a questionnaire on symptoms of atrophic&#xD;
      vaginitis and have a gynecologic examination (with visual, speculum, pH and sample of vaginal&#xD;
      epithelial cells.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints - Serum estradiol levels Improvement in symptoms of atrophic vaginitis, as measured&#xD;
      by questionnaire. Atrophic vaginitis as measured by gynecological examination (including pH&#xD;
      and cytology to assess maturation index).&#xD;

    <description>Testosterone USP micronized powder at a dose of 1mg/gr will be made into a paste with polysorbate 80 NF liquid and will be placed in an emollient cream base. A calibrated applicator will be supplied to measure out doses containing 300mcg of testosterone for daily application. The cream will be applied daily for 28 days. As above if safety and efficacy endpoints are met at this dose a lower dose (150mcg) will be used and if in tun this meets safety and efficacy endpoints a lower dose (75mcg) will be used.</description>
