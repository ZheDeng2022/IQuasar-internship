  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to prospectively document the exposure to IMMUNINE and&#xD;
      to monitor FIX inhibitors over a period of approximately 20 to 50 exposure days while&#xD;
      receiving prophylactic treatment in up to 50 previously treated patients (PTPs) aged 12-64&#xD;
      years and approximately 20 pediatric PTPs up to 11 years of age with severe (FIX level &lt; 1%)&#xD;
      or moderately severe (FIX level &lt;= 2%) hemophilia B who are planned to enter BAX326 study&#xD;
      250901, provided all eligibility criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, thrombogenicity,&#xD;
      and health-related quality of life (HR QoL) of these subjects.&#xD;
