  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new mechanical device was developed in order to provide the surgeon with intraoperative&#xD;
      information about the mechanical strength of the cancellous bone within the vertebral body.&#xD;
      DensiProbe Spine is intended to be used in patients undergoing transpedicular stabilization&#xD;
      of the thoracolumbar spine. The objective of the DensiProbe Spine pilot study is to&#xD;
      investigate the handling and feasibility of the DensiProbe Spine measurement device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporotic fragility fractures often occur in the spine. A common surgical technique is the&#xD;
      transpedicular fixation using pedicle screws. A major complication of this treatment is a&#xD;
      cut-out or back-out of the screw due to insufficient anchorage of the implant in the&#xD;
      vertebral body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new mechanical device was developed in order to provide the surgeon with intraoperative&#xD;
      information about the mechanical strength of the cancellous bone. In cases of low bone&#xD;
      quality, the treatment can be adapted to the patient's condition, for example by augmentation&#xD;
      of the screw anchorage using bone cement. However, this treatment involves a risk of cement&#xD;
      leakage and subsequent pulmonary embolism or nerve damage. Furthermore, cement augmentation&#xD;
      is time-consuming. Therefore, there is a need for a diagnostic device that can&#xD;
      intraoperatively support the surgeon's decision on the appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DensiProbe Spine was developed accordingly to the clinically approved DensiProbe Hip, which&#xD;
      was designed for the same diagnostic reasons in patients with hip fractures undergoing&#xD;
      fracture fixation with the dynamic hip screw (DHS). However, the application of bone strength&#xD;
      measurements in the spine is in so far different to the hip as the anatomical dimensions in&#xD;
      the spine are much smaller and lower values of bone mineral density (BMD) and bone strength&#xD;
      are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this pilot study is to investigate the handling and feasibility of the newly&#xD;
      developed DensiProbe Spine measurement device. In case of a positive result of the pilot&#xD;
      study, a multicenter cohort study will be performed in order to clinically validate the&#xD;
      DensiProbe Spine device by assessing the correlation between DensiProbe Spine measurements&#xD;
      and the amounts of pedicle screw migration in patients undergoing transpedicular fixation.&#xD;
