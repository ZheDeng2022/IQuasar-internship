  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer often spreads through local invasion into local structures, including fat,&#xD;
      blood vessels, nerves, and nearby organs (stomach, duodenum, spleen, bile duct). Local&#xD;
      microscopic invasion is associated with recurrence of pancreatic cancer after pancreatic&#xD;
      resection, such that even if the original cancer is surgically removed, microscopic areas of&#xD;
      cancer often remain. Data on the patterns of local invasion by pancreatic cancer have not&#xD;
      been published. In this study, The investigators hope to investigate the frequency of the&#xD;
      various methods of local invasion of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This would help the&#xD;
      investigators better understand how pancreatic cancer spreads, and determine what cancers are&#xD;
      not resectable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the eighth most common malignancy, and the fifth leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer-related death, in the United States. Unfortunately, patients often present late in the&#xD;
      course of the disease. Accordingly, the 1- year survival rate is approximately 20%, and the&#xD;
      5-year survival rate is less than 4%. Even in patients with local disease who are surgical&#xD;
      candidates, survival at five years remains only 10-25%. Staging for pancreatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      typically utilizes the TNM classification, where &quot;T&quot; represents tumor size, &quot;N&quot; represents&#xD;
      regional lymph node metastasis, and &quot;M&quot; represents distant metastasis. This type of staging&#xD;
      can usually only be done after operative resection. Unfortunately, up to 25% of patients are&#xD;
      found to be unresectable at the time of surgical exploration. This is most often due to local&#xD;
      invasion or metastatic disease. Local microscopic invasion is associated with recurrence of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer after pancreatic resection. Comprehensive data on the patterns of local&#xD;
      invasion by pancreatic cancer have not been published. The investigators believe that it&#xD;
      would be beneficial to investigate the frequency of the various methods of local invasion of&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A clearer understanding of the natural history of local invasion&#xD;
      could potentially lead to a better determination of what constitutes unresectability.&#xD;

    <description>The clinical and pathology information from the CUMC surgical database will be reviewed to determine the frequency of the various modalities of local invasion of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This includes: peripancreatic fat invasion, neural/perineural invasion, vascular invasion, macrovascular invasion, duodenal invasion, bile duct invasion, splenic invasion,and gastric invasion.</description>
