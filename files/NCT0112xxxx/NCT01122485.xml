      The objective of this study was to explore the efficacy, dose-response and safety of PG201&#xD;
      tablet in Korean patients with osteoarthritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the PG201 extract, the study drug, was administered twice daily after a meal&#xD;
      to two investigational groups, the lower-dose group and the higher-dose group. The efficacy&#xD;
      of each of dose group was compared to that of the control group to determine if there was a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference between the investigational groups and the placebo&#xD;
      group. In addition, the efficacy between the lower dose group and the high dose group was&#xD;
      also compared to determine if there was a statistically significant difference.&#xD;
