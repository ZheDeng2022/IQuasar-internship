    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the overall effectiveness of Ondansetron as an&#xD;
      adjunctive or &quot;add-on&quot; medication in the treatment of Schizophrenia. This study is a double&#xD;
      blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 12 week trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ondansetron is a medication currently approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods&#xD;
      Administration for the treatment of drug-induced vomiting and nausea. Beyond this traditional&#xD;
      use there have been several case reports and small clinical trials advocating the use of&#xD;
      Ondansetron in the treatment of adult Schizophrenia. Overall these studies lend support to&#xD;
      the use of Ondansetron in conjunction with mainstream antipsychotic medication in improving&#xD;
      not only the positive symptoms associated with Schizophrenia but also the 'hard to treat'&#xD;
      negative and cognitive symptoms. Furthermore, Ondansetron may also have potential benefits in&#xD;
      reducing the adverse motor effects (e.g. tremor, uncontrolled muscle movements) associated&#xD;
      with the use of many antipsychotic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 participants aged 18-65 inclusive with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Schizophrenia,&#xD;
      Schizoaffective, or Schizophreniform disorder will be recruited. This study proposes to&#xD;
      conduct a randomized, controlled treatment trial to investigate the efficacy of ondansetron&#xD;
      as an adjunctive treatment in reducing negative and positive symptoms plus improving&#xD;
      cognitive symptoms. There will be an initial screening session to determine participant&#xD;
      suitability, a baseline session where the study medication (Ondansetron or Placebo) will be&#xD;
      dispensed, followed by three monitoring visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of Ondansetron will be evaluated by the following instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-Reactive protein (marker of systematic and brain specific inflammation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed through adverse event reporting using the Adverse symptom Checklist&#xD;
      (ASC), blood analysis, urinalysis, a 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) and a physical&#xD;
      examination. Adverse motor symptoms will also be assessed by the Abnormal Involuntary&#xD;
      Movement Scale and the Simpson-Angus Scale. In addition a safety and monitoring committee&#xD;
      consisting of research and medical staff external to the project will regularly review&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;

    <description>The PANSS is a widely used, drug-sensitive, valid and reliable measure of psychopathology in schizophrenia. The PANSS is a formal interview, from which 30 symptoms are rated along a 7 point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). Schizophrenia symptom severity will be assessed with the PANSS and monitored to determine change in total, positive, negative, cognitive or general psychopathology symptoms.</description>
