    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in Canada. Fifty percent of all&#xD;
      Tc-99m used in nuclear medicine is for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) with&#xD;
      SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The reduced supply of Tc-99m requires other tracers&#xD;
      to be investigated. Tl-201 SPECT is available but generally accepted to be inferior to&#xD;
      Tc-99m. Rubidium (Rb-82), a nonreactor produced tracer, is believed to have superior accuracy&#xD;
      compared to Tc-99m and Tl-201 SPECT, with 5-20 times lower radiation dose. In the U.S. Rb-82&#xD;
      generators have been FDA-approved since 1989 and are used increasingly for CAD diagnosis, but&#xD;
      are still considered investigational in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To demonstrate that Rb-82 PET MPI is i) an accurate, cost-effective alternative&#xD;
      to Tc-99m; ii) superior to Tl-201; iii) can be implemented in multiple Canadian centres for&#xD;
      the diagnosis and management of CAD. Short term clinical outcomes of Rb-82 will be evaluated&#xD;
      and compared to Tc-99m and Tl-201 SPECT MPI across Canadian imaging centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan: Rb-ARMI is an innovative multidisciplinary, multi-centre imaging research initiative&#xD;
      that builds on existing collaborative networks and Canadian industry partnership (DRAXIMAGE).&#xD;
      Rb PET will be implemented, standardized and validated in 4 overlapping phases over 2 years,&#xD;
      at 10 Canadian Centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: This project meets the expected goal to &quot;lead to clinical trial applications and&#xD;
      clinical validation studies which compare novel radiolabeled probes with those in current&#xD;
      practice&quot;, and to &quot;bring a new radiopharmaceutical to the clinic&quot; within a short time frame.&#xD;
      Increased use of Rb-82 PET MPI has the potential to reduce the demand for Tc-99m by 10-40%,&#xD;
      effectively increasing the available supply for other procedures, and improving the standard&#xD;
      of care for many Canadians at risk of heart disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in Canada. Half of all&#xD;
      the Tc-99m used in nuclear medicine is for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD)&#xD;
      with SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The reduced supply of Tc-99m requires other&#xD;
      tracers to be investigated. While Tl-201 SPECT is available, it is generally accepted to be&#xD;
      inferior to the Tc-99m tracers; low specificity may prompt further testing and increase&#xD;
      costs. Rubidium (Rb-82) PET MPI is believed to have superior accuracy compared to Tc-99m and&#xD;
      Tl-201, and 5-20 times lower radiation dose. Rb-82 is produced in a generator from the&#xD;
      cyclotron-produced (non-reactor) parent isotope Sr-82. In the U.S. Rb-82 generators have been&#xD;
      FDA-approved since 1989. Rb-82 PET MPI has been reimbursed in the U.S. since 1995 and is used&#xD;
      increasingly for CAD diagnosis, but is still considered investigational in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Primary: To demonstrate that Rb-82 PET MPI is i) an accurate alternative to&#xD;
      Tc-99m SPECT;ii) is superior to Tl-201; iii) can be implemented in multiple Canadian centres&#xD;
      for diagnosis and management of CAD. Secondary: To evaluate short-term clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of Rb-82 PET MPI for diagnosis and management of CAD compared i) to Tc-99m&#xD;
      and Tl-201 MPI and ii) across imaging centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: 1: Rubidium MPI can be standardized with highly repeatable interpretation across&#xD;
      multiple Canadian centres, using current 3D PET and 3D PET/CT imaging technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-A: Rubidium PET MPI has superior accuracy compared to Tl-201 SPECT MPI, using invasive&#xD;
      coronary angiography (ICA) as the gold-standard for diagnosis of CAD. (reference centre A -&#xD;
      Ottawa) 2-B: Rubidium PET MPI has comparable accuracy to Tc-99m SPECT MPI. (reference centre&#xD;
      B - Quebec) 3: Rubidium PET MPI has similar (non-inferior) accuracy across additional&#xD;
      Canadian imaging centres compared to the primary imaging centres 4-A: Rubidium PET MPI is&#xD;
      cost-effective compared to Tc-99m and Tl-201 SPECT MPI in the diagnosis and management of&#xD;
      CAD, in terms of tracer costs and down-stream resource utilization such as ICA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4-B: Rubidium PET MPI improves short-term clinical outcomes measured at 6 months, compared to&#xD;
      Tc-99m or Tl-201 SPECT MPI in the management of CAD, in terms of adverse cardiac events&#xD;
      including cardiac death, nonfatal MI, late revascularization and cardiac hospitalization.&#xD;
      4-C: Site-specific attributes will impact resource utilization and local Rb-82 PET costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: Rb-ARMI is an innovative multidisciplinary, multi-centre imaging research&#xD;
      initiative that builds on existing collaborative networks (ICT, IMAGE-HF, CAIN, CADRE) and&#xD;
      Canadian industry partnership (DRAXIMAGE). Rb-82 PET will be implemented, standardized and&#xD;
      validated in 4 overlapping phases over 2 years, in up to 10 centres across Canada, including&#xD;
      Ottawa, Quebec City, Montreal, Sherbrooke, Toronto, Hamilton, London, Thunder Bay, Halifax,&#xD;
      and Edmonton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is a knowledge translation and standardization phase (0-6 months). Qualifying scans&#xD;
      using cardiac phantoms will be performed to standardize imaging protocols across centres.&#xD;
      Site training and co-reading of an initial series of scans from each centre will be performed&#xD;
      by the reference site (Ottawa), to confirm low inter-operator variability (≤5%) in&#xD;
      interpretation (sum stress score and sum difference score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 is a matched-cohort comparative accuracy study (months 3-20). In the reference&#xD;
      centres, pre-test likelihood ± extent of CAD will be assessed in patients referred for&#xD;
      assessment of ischemia (N=200) undergoing dipyridamole Rb-82 PET MPI and coronary angiography&#xD;
      (ICA) within 6 months. These patients will be used to identify a matched group undergoing&#xD;
      Tl-201 SPECT to compare accuracy in 2A. A similar study will be performed to compare Rb-82&#xD;
      PET with Tc-99m SPECT MPI in centre B (the site most ready to start Rb-82 PET MPI) using the&#xD;
      same propensity-matched cohort design in 2B. All 800 angiography studies (+600 in phase 3)&#xD;
      will be co-read by the core lab in Montreal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 tests whether the implementation of Rb-82 PET across the additional imaging centres&#xD;
      in Canada can achieve comparable accuracy, again using ICA as the gold-standard in N=600&#xD;
      patients (months 4-20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4 is a cost-effectiveness study to evaluate short-term resource utilization (RU), cost&#xD;
      and outcomes at 6-month follow-up for: Rb-82 PET vs SPECT MPI (centres A and B) in 4A and 4B&#xD;
      (N=1000); Rb-82 PET in additional Canadian sites vs the primary centres in 4C (N=1000). RU&#xD;
      will be measured during follow up and unit costs estimated. Analysis will estimate&#xD;
      incremental costs associated with each of the outcomes within the composite endpoint, as well&#xD;
      as costs associated specifically with the imaging and subsequent diagnostic tests.&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken in accordance with Canadian guidelines for&#xD;
      economic evaluations. Database review, follow-up completion, data analysis and manuscript&#xD;
      preparation will be completed in the final 6 months of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: The project meets the expected goal of the RFA to &quot;lead to clinical trial&#xD;
      applications and clinical validation studies which compare novel radiolabeled probes with&#xD;
      those in current practice&quot;, and to &quot;bring a new radiopharmaceutical to the clinic&quot; within a&#xD;
      short time frame. Increased use of Rb-82 PET MPI has the potential to reduce the demand for&#xD;
      Tc-99m by 10-40%, effectively increasing the available supply for other procedures, and&#xD;
      improving the standard of care for many Canadians at risk of heart disease.&#xD;
