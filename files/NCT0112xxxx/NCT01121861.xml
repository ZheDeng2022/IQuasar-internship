    <textblock>
      Several methods have been developed to address and reduce preexisting astigmatism. The&#xD;
      refractive results associated with the use of toric IOLs are likely to be more predictable.&#xD;
      Other advantages of toric IOL include absence of need for any additional astigmatic&#xD;
      correction procedure during cataract surgery, faster visual recovery as well as the&#xD;
      reversibility of the procedure. There has not been any trial carried out to evaluate the&#xD;
      results of toric IOL in either the investigators local population or in East Asia. Hence, the&#xD;
      investigators set out to evaluate and compare the efficacy, safety, predictability and&#xD;
      stability of the STAAR and Alcon toric IOL in Asian eyes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The improvements in surgical technique as well as advances in technology employed during&#xD;
      modern cataract surgery have made it a safe procedure in routine cases. Moving forwards, the&#xD;
      single most pressing challenge facing cataract surgeons in the developed countries today is&#xD;
      the ability to achieve predictable and accurate refractive outcomes. Increasingly, surgeons&#xD;
      and patients alike have come to measure the success of their surgery by the refractive&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using partial coherence interferometry has led to more accurate biometry and consequently&#xD;
      more predictable spherical results. This also helped paved the way for satisfactory&#xD;
      correction of presbyopia with multifocal intraocular lenses (IOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Astigmatism is also an important component of the refractive equation. Estimates of the&#xD;
      incidence of significant, naturally occurring astigmatism vary widely from 7.5% to 75%1. It&#xD;
      is thought that 3% to 15% of eyes may have 2 or more diopters (D) of astigmatism2. Many&#xD;
      surgeons would agree that astigmatism of greater than 0.5 D will have visual consequences&#xD;
      such as symptoms of ghosting and shadows and they now aim for both spherical and astigmatic&#xD;
      outcomes of +/ - 0.5 D3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several methods have been developed to address and reduce preexisting astigmatism. While&#xD;
      corneal relaxing incisions for astigmatic correction can be unpredictable and highly surgeon&#xD;
      dependent, the opposite is true for toric IOLs. The refractive results associated with the&#xD;
      use of toric IOLs are likely to be more predictable as it is independent of corneal wound&#xD;
      healing. The implantation of an IOL is also less surgeon dependent. Other advantages&#xD;
      associated with toric IOLs include the absence of need for any additional astigmatic&#xD;
      correction procedure during cataract surgery, faster visual recovery as well as the&#xD;
      reversibility of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have been carried out to evaluate the efficacy and rotational stability of the STAAR&#xD;
      AA4203 TF/TL toric IOL since its FDA approval in November 1998. These trials have only been&#xD;
      carried out on Caucasian eyes and have shown a significant reduction in the pre-existing&#xD;
      refractive astigmatism, improvement of postoperative unaided visual acuity as well as&#xD;
      excellent refractive as well as rotational stability (latter especially so with the TL&#xD;
      model). Ruhswurm et al.6 reviewed 37 eyes with STAAR toric IOL over a mean duration of 20.3&#xD;
      months and found that 78.4% of eyes had residual refractive astigmatism within +/- 1.00 D and&#xD;
      48.6% within +/- 0.50D. 83.4% of these eyes achieved best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or&#xD;
      better. Sun et al.7 demonstrated improved unaided visual outcome between eyes with toric (130&#xD;
      eyes; 86.4% with visual acuity 20/40 or better) and spherical IOL (51 eyes; 76% with visual&#xD;
      acuity 20/40 or better). Similar results have also been obtained with the Alcon toric IOL. In&#xD;
      Horn et al.9, the clinical trial results of 250 patients with Alcon toric IOL have been&#xD;
      described, demonstrating good unaided visual acuity of 20/25 or better at the 6-month&#xD;
      postoperative visit (66% of patients with unilateral toric implant and 97% with bilateral&#xD;
      implants). 97% of these toric patients achieved spectacle freedom for distance vision,&#xD;
      compared to 50% of control patients. It is well documented that the rotational stability of&#xD;
      these toric IOL is crucial to the efficacy of astigmatic reduction. Theoretical calculations&#xD;
      show that an estimated 1/3 of astigmatic correction is lost if the IOL is rotated by 10&#xD;
      degrees off axis, as well as potential worsening of preoperative astigmatism in the presence&#xD;
      of more than 30 degrees of off-axis rotation. Toric IOL stability is dependent on multiple&#xD;
      factors, one of which is the capsular bag size. Vass et al.11 showed a good correlation&#xD;
      between axial length and capsular bag diameter (CBD), especially so in eyes with axial&#xD;
      lengths of less than 25.0mm. On the other hand, highly myopic eyes are not shown to have a&#xD;
      greater risk of having a larger CBD than those with normal axial lengths. A formula derived&#xD;
      to calculate a predicted CBD (CBDp) showed that values greater than 10.3mm are likely to have&#xD;
      existing larger CBD and hence benefit from implantation of longer toric IOL due to better&#xD;
      centration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there has not been any trial carried out to evaluate the results of toric IOL in&#xD;
      either our local population or in East Asia. There has also not been any prospective clinical&#xD;
      trial conducted to compare the difference (if any) between a plate-haptic and loop-haptic&#xD;
      toric IOL. Hence, we set out to evaluate and compare the efficacy, safety, predictability and&#xD;
      stability of the STAAR and Alcon toric IOL in Asian eyes.&#xD;
