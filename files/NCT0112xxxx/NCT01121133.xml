&#xD;
          -  Has a non-hematologic malignancy (radiographic, histologic, or cytologic&#xD;
             confirmation), or hematologic malignancy (histologic or cytologic confirmation) that&#xD;
             is either: relapsed or refractory to standard therapy, failed at least one prior&#xD;
             therapy or no known effective therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the investigator's opinion, the subject's life expectancy is at least 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If clinically indicated, (e.g., subjects over the age of 70) subjects must have&#xD;
             documented brain imaging (MRI or CT) negative for subdural or epidural hematoma within&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with brain metastases must have clinically controlled neurologic symptoms,&#xD;
             defined as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy followed by 21 days of stable&#xD;
             neurologic function and no evidence of CNS disease progression as determined by CT or&#xD;
             MRI within 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;

             requires anticoagulation therapy (e.g., warfarin at any dose) or any drugs or herbal&#xD;
             supplements that affect platelet function, with the exception of low-dose heparin used&#xD;
             to maintain the patency of a catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has used known inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) or inducers (e.g., rifampin and&#xD;
             carbamazepine) of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) within 1 week prior to first dose of&#xD;
