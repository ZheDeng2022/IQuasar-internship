  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer cachexia syndrome (CCS) is frequent, causing high morbidity and mortality in affected&#xD;
      ones. The mechanism is catabolism caused by the tumour. CRP is a surrogate marker for&#xD;
      catabolism. There are no effective treatment options against CCS. Lenalidomide, a derivate of&#xD;
      thalidomide, is an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD®). One of its' main effect is a decrease in&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines. As CCS treatment, thalidomide has shown in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to stabilize lean body mass. The effect of lenalidomide in solid tumour patients was&#xD;
      negligible although, there might be a decrease in tumour progression. However, even if&#xD;
      lenalidomide may be uninteresting as an anticancer treatment it might affect CCS dynamics.&#xD;
      Respective data are currently lacking. Therefore, a dose level where an anticancer effect&#xD;
      could be expected was chosen (group A). Relevant anti-inflammatory effect may occur below the&#xD;
      commonly used doses to achieve tumour control, which is expected to be the main anti-cachexia&#xD;
      effect. Therefore, a second CRP-response guided treatment arm (group B) was chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: To test whether the response rate under new standard basic cachexia management&#xD;
      will be at the estimated 5% and with lenalidomide (either fixed dose or CRP-guided dose) in&#xD;
      addition to basic cachexia management at least 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of lenalidomide on lean body&#xD;
      mass and handgrip strength in advanced solid tumour patients with inflammatory CCS.&#xD;
