    <textblock>
      Background: Excessive exposure to psychosocial stress can be a potent trigger for somatic&#xD;
      diseases and psychological disorders, a cause for missing work, and eventually lead to high&#xD;
      economic loss. Therefore, for health and economic reasons the assessment of effectiveness of&#xD;
      stress preventive interventions is of high relevance. According to several clinical studies,&#xD;
      Taiji, a Chinese form of mindful and gentle movements, can significantly reduce symptoms of&#xD;
      somatic diseases and psychological disorders. Some recently conducted Taiji-studies with&#xD;
      healthy subjects indicate a stress protective effect. However, the stress protective impact&#xD;
      of Taiji regarding psychosocial stress has not yet been examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate the efficacy of a 12 week Taiji training as a stress prevention&#xD;
      program by measuring psychosocial stress reactivity in a laboratory setting, as well as the&#xD;
      subjective perception of stress and coping-resources in daily life of 70 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Healthy subjects attending a 12 week Taiji course (frequency: twice a week for&#xD;
      1h) will show significantly reduced psychobiological reactivity, decreased stress perception&#xD;
      and increased coping-resources on a standardized psychosocial stress test compared with&#xD;
      healthy subject of the waiting list.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excessive exposure to psychosocial stress can be a potent trigger for somatic diseases and&#xD;
      psychological disorders, a cause for missing work, and eventually lead to high economic loss.&#xD;
      Therefore, for health and economic reasons the assessment of effectiveness of stress&#xD;
      preventive interventions is of high relevance. According to several clinical studies, Taiji,&#xD;
      a Chinese form of mindful and gentle movements, can significantly reduce symptoms of somatic&#xD;
      diseases and psychological disorders. Some recent Taiji-studies with healthy subjects&#xD;
      indicate a stress protective effect. However, since these findings mainly focus on effects&#xD;
      during or immediately after a Taiji training session, their study designs and outcome&#xD;
      measures are not comparable with existing stress prevention efficacy studies and their sample&#xD;
      sizes are generally too small, the present available results remain inconclusive. Also, the&#xD;
      impact of a Taiji training on psychosocial stress has not been assessed so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of a 12 week Taiji training as a stress&#xD;
      prevention program by measuring psychosocial stress reactivity in a laboratory setting,&#xD;
      subjective perception of stress and coping-resources of 70 healthy subjects in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) will be used to measure the psychobiological stress&#xD;
      reactivity. Salivary cortisol, alpha amylase, heart rate and heart rate variability will be&#xD;
      measured in each subject to asses stress reactivity, Also, the primary appraisal secondary&#xD;
      appraisal (PASA) questionnaire and the multidimensional mood questionnaire (MDBF) will be&#xD;
      used to assess psychological stress reactivity, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) to measure&#xD;
      perceived stressfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally to the TSST setting, pre-, post-intervention and 2 months follow up measurements&#xD;
      will be taken. The following tools will be used: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Stress&#xD;
      Reactivity Scale (SRS)(to assess perceived stress), and self-efficacy-expectancy&#xD;
      questionnaire (SWE), questionnaire for measuring wellbeing (FEW-16), Freiburg mindfulness&#xD;
      inventory (FMI) and self compassion scale (SCS) (to assess perceived coping resources).&#xD;
