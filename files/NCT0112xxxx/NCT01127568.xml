      Objective: To use propranolol to treat established chronic post traumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD) by reducing reconsolidation of the reactivated trauma memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A series of treatments with propranolol, in comparison to placebo, will produce a&#xD;
      significant reduction in PTSD symptom severity in participants with chronic PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Methodology:&#xD;
      Twenty-five participants per group with chronic PTSD will be recruited. On their first visit&#xD;
      psychodiagnostic and psychometric evaluation will take place. In addition, script-preparation&#xD;
      for the script-driven imagery procedure will occur. Following this, the participants will&#xD;
      return each week for a period of 6 weeks to participate in the reactivation sessions with&#xD;
      propranolol or placebo (participants assigned to the propranolol condition will receive&#xD;
      propranolol throughout, and participants assigned to the placebo condition will receive&#xD;
      placebo throughout). Two weeks later, the participants will return for a follow-up of the&#xD;
      psychodiagnostic and psychometric evaluation, as well as psychophysiological assessment using&#xD;
      script-driven imagery procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: A two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures will be&#xD;
      performed on study completers. The Drug factor will have two levels: propranolol and placebo.&#xD;
      The Time factor will have two levels: pre-treatment and post-treatment. We predict a&#xD;
      significant Drug x Time interaction, more precisely a greater decrease in PTSD severity in&#xD;
      the propranolol than in the placebo group. The psychophysiological data will be contrasted to&#xD;
      a normative cutoff score for PTSD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Historical background. Recent animal research indicates that retrieval returns a consolidated&#xD;
      memory, or some aspect(s) of it, to a labile state from which it must be restabilized in&#xD;
      order to persist. This process is called reconsolidation, although it is not identical to&#xD;
      consolidation. Support for reconsolidation comes from experiments in a variety of species&#xD;
      ranging from snails to humans; in appetitive, aversive and neutral tasks; and using a broad&#xD;
      range of approaches, including systemic or localized drug administration, gene manipulation,&#xD;
      and interference by new learning. Memory impairments due to blocked reconsolidation can be&#xD;
      long-lasting. Reconsolidation impairments are distinct from extinction in that they can be&#xD;
      made to occur even when a reinforced trial is used to reactivate the memory, do not show&#xD;
      renewal after contextual shift, can be double-dissociated from extinction, and have distinct&#xD;
      neurochemical signatures from extinction. To date there has only been a single, published,&#xD;
      controlled study supporting reconsolidation, and its blockade, in humans. That study involved&#xD;
      weakening the consolidated memory of a simple motor sequence by presenting a conflicting&#xD;
      sequence after reactivation of the memory of the original sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a translational model of the pathogenesis of post-traumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD), a psychologically traumatic event overstimulates endogenous stress hormones, which in&#xD;
      turn overly strengthen consolidation of the memory of the event, leading to an excessively&#xD;
      powerful and persistent memory that is too easily activated, with consequent anxiety and&#xD;
      dysfunction. Animal and human data indicate that the memory-modulating effects of stress&#xD;
      hormones are mediated by noradrenergic activity in the amygdala and can be opposed by a&#xD;
      β-adrenergic blocker such as propranolol. Administration of propranolol in the immediate&#xD;
      aftermath of a psychologically traumatic event reduces the strength of its memory, as&#xD;
      manifest in lower physiological responding during script-driven mental imagery of the event&#xD;
      measured 3 months later, and lower self-reported PTSD symptoms measured 2 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the above model, there exists a window of opportunity for influencing the&#xD;
      consolidation of the traumatic event into long-term memory. Once this window has closed, the&#xD;
      memory trace is no longer labile, and β-blockers would no longer be able to exert their&#xD;
      anti-PTSD effect. Attempting to prevent PTSD by blocking consolidation of the traumatic&#xD;
      memory (or some aspects of it) is subject to the formidable limitation that most cases are&#xD;
      unlikely to receive clinical attention until long after this window of opportunity has shut.&#xD;
      In persons who have developed PTSD, this would have happened weeks, months, or years earlier.&#xD;
      However, if a traumatic memory undergoes reconsolidation when it is reactivated, this could&#xD;
      re-open the window of opportunity to influence the memory pharmacologically. The&#xD;
      post-reactivation administration of propranolol could reduce the strength of a traumatic&#xD;
      memory by blocking reconsolidation in a manner parallel to reducing its strength immediately&#xD;
      following its occurrence by blocking consolidation. In support of this possibility,&#xD;
      consolidated memories for aversive tasks in animals have been shown to become sensitive to&#xD;
      β-blockade after reactivation. Specifically, administration of propranolol following&#xD;
      reactivation has been found to reduce inhibitory avoidance and auditory fear conditioning;&#xD;
      the latter impairment was stable for one month. These results demonstrate in rodents that&#xD;
      aversively conditioned memories when reactivated become sensitive to the effects of&#xD;
      propranolol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies supporting the proposed research. In a preliminary study, we employed a&#xD;
      validated psychophysiological script-driven imagery technique to study 19 participants with&#xD;
      chronic PTSD resulting from various psychologically traumatic events. Physiological responses&#xD;
      during traumatic imagery have been shown to reliably discriminate PTSD from non-PTSD&#xD;
      psychological trauma victims, leading to the inclusion of the PTSD criterion &quot;physiological&#xD;
      reactivity on exposure to internal cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic&#xD;
      event&quot; in the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition&#xD;
      (DSM-IV). Each participant described the traumatic event that caused their PTSD; this served&#xD;
      to reactivate the traumatic memory. Immediately thereafter, the participant received either&#xD;
      oral 40 mg short-acting propranolol followed 2 hours later by oral 60 mg long-acting&#xD;
      propranolol (n = 9), or look-alike placebo capsules (n = 10), randomized and double-blind.&#xD;
      Group demographic and psychometric means for the two groups were highly similar. A trained&#xD;
      research assistant composed scripts portraying the event in the participant's own words and&#xD;
      recorded them for playback in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week later, the participant listened to an audio recording of their personal traumatic&#xD;
      event in the psychophysiology laboratory and imagined the event as if it were happening to&#xD;
      them again, while heart rate (HR), skin conductance (SC), and left corrugator (facial&#xD;
      frowning muscle) electromyogram (EMG) responses were measured. Overall physiological&#xD;
      responding during mental imagery of the traumatic event was significantly smaller in the PTSD&#xD;
      participants who had received propranolol a week earlier compared to those who had received&#xD;
      placebo (multivariate p = .007). Drug condition accounted for an impressive 49% of the&#xD;
      variance in overall physiological responding. The univariate analyses indicated that HR and&#xD;
      SC, but not EMG, responses were significantly smaller in the propranolol compared to the&#xD;
      placebo participants. The mean HR and SC responses of the placebo participants were above the&#xD;
      normative cut-offs for PTSD (dashed lines), whereas the mean HR and SC responses of the&#xD;
      propranolol participants were below the normative PTSD cut-offs. The mean EMG responses of&#xD;
      both groups fell below the normative PTSD cut-off. The observed effect sizes (in terms of&#xD;
      Cohen's d, i.e., the difference in group means divided by the pooled standard deviation) were&#xD;
      all in the predicted direction. By conventional standards, these effect sizes were very large&#xD;
      for SC, large for HR, but small for EMG. The psychophysiological results of the present study&#xD;
      along with those of the previously reported study in which propranolol was administered in&#xD;
      the immediate aftermath of the traumatic event indicate that post-reactivation propranolol&#xD;
      recapitulates its effects on consolidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-reported PTSD symptoms measured by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised showed a&#xD;
      significant decline in the propranolol participants (19%), but not in the placebo&#xD;
      participants (11%). However, the Group x Time interaction was not statistically significant,&#xD;
      and the effect size was only moderate. Certainly the decline in self-reported PTSD symptoms&#xD;
      in the propranolol group was less than the &quot;decline&quot; in physiological responses during&#xD;
      traumatic imagery (taking the placebo group's responses as the comparison in the absence a&#xD;
      baseline physiological measurement). However, because of their subjective nature, symptom&#xD;
      self-reports are vulnerable to a number of potentially confounding factors, including demand&#xD;
      effects, long-standing beliefs and expectations about oneself and one's situation,&#xD;
      incorporating one's symptoms into one's identity, and secondary gain. All these factors may&#xD;
      make changing self-reports more difficult than changing physiological responses, which more&#xD;
      directly access changes in the strength of traumatic memories. It may be that anything&#xD;
      greater than moderate improvement in PTSD symptoms is too much to ask of a single session and&#xD;
      a single dose of propranolol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale behind the proposed research. The preliminary results described above suggest that&#xD;
      using pharmacological consolidation blockers in conjunction with memory reactivation could&#xD;
      have important implications for therapy. Currently cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which&#xD;
      relies heavily on exposure and extinction, is the psychotherapeutic treatment of choice for&#xD;
      anxiety disorders, including PTSD. However, its beneficial effects on PTSD -like those of&#xD;
      drug treatment- are partial, with only one-third of patients showing lasting, clinically&#xD;
      meaningful improvement. Modulating reconsolidation may have certain advantages over this&#xD;
      approach. Reconsolidation blockade targets the traumatic memory directly, whereas extinction&#xD;
      attempts to inhibit the traumatic memory through new (inhibitory) learning. There are two&#xD;
      important drawbacks to extinction as a therapy. First, because extinction only inhibits the&#xD;
      underlying fear memory, it will tend to spontaneously recover with the passage of time.&#xD;
      Second, extinction is context-dependent. Thus, cognitive behavioral therapists must find ways&#xD;
      of making extinction-based therapy context-independent and long-lasting. Otherwise,&#xD;
      beneficial effects acquired in the office will be lost at home or over time. In contrast,&#xD;
      reconsolidation has the theoretical advantage that impairments induced by its blockade are&#xD;
      context-independent and long-lasting. From the practical standpoint, CBT typically requires&#xD;
      periods of lengthy exposure to the traumatic memory or feared situation to promote&#xD;
      extinction. In the case of reconsolidation blockade, animal research suggests that briefer&#xD;
      exposure is more suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A report of a case series of 15 patients suffering from various mental disorders who were&#xD;
      treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) claimed that when the ECT was administered&#xD;
      during the reactivation of a memory, obsession, or hallucination, it was substantially more&#xD;
      effective. This is roughly consistent with the possibility that psychiatric symptoms can be&#xD;
      made to undergo reconsolidation blockade. However, the patients had a long history of&#xD;
      psychopathology and ECT treatment, which, along with the absence of quantitative outcome&#xD;
      measures and appropriate controls, precluded firm conclusions. Moreover, the treatment&#xD;
      involved administration of ECT to awake patients. The practical advantage of pharmacological&#xD;
      reconsolidation blockade over such a gross approach is obvious.&#xD;

According to, 40 mg of short-acting propranolol dose should produce a peak blood level of approximately 25 ng/ml at 2 hours, which the additional 60 mg long-acting propranolol should further increase by no more than 5ng. The decay of the blood level induced by the 40 mg short-acting dose after its 2-hour peak will outstrip the further rise induced by the 60 mg long-acting proposal dose, so that blood levels will not rise above this peak 30 ng/ml, which is within the therapeutic clinical range. If the participant tolerates the combination dose without any difficulty, during subsequent sessions, both the short- and long-acting doses will be given together immediately after memory reactivation.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Being between the ages of 18-65&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having gone through a potentially traumatic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not suffering from chronic PTSD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mm Hg;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heart rate below 55 beats per minute;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having a medical condition that contraindicates the administration of propranolol,&#xD;
             e.g., history of congestive heart failure, heart block, insulin-requiring diabetes,&#xD;
             chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or asthma. With regard to asthma, because many persons&#xD;
             who say they have had an asthma attack, especially as a child, may only have had hay&#xD;
             fever, another allergy, or another non-asthmatic episode, a blanket exclusion&#xD;
             criterion may be overly restrictive. Therefore, asthma attacks will only be&#xD;
             exclusionary if they a.) occurred within the past 10 years, b.) occurred at any time&#xD;
             in life if induced by a β-blocker, or c.) are currently being treated, regardless of&#xD;
             the date of last occurrence. Cardiological consultation will be obtained as necessary;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous adverse reaction to, or non-compliance with, a β-blocker;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of a medication that may involve potentially dangerous interactions with&#xD;
             propranolol, including, other β-blockers, antiarrhythmics, calcium channel blockers,&#xD;
             and potent P450 2D6 inhibitors, e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, miconazole, sulconazole,&#xD;
             metoclopramide, quinidine, ticlopidine, and ritonavir. Because the protocol does not&#xD;
             require to take large doses of propranolol on a daily basis, the decision to exclude&#xD;
             participants will be taken by the physician on a case-by-case basis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding. Although propranolol can be used during pregnancy we will&#xD;
             advise women not to participate in they are or become pregnant. Women breastfeeding&#xD;
             will also be advised not to participate because propranolol has been found in human&#xD;
             milk. That the quantity absorbed by the breast feeding infant is inferior to 1% of the&#xD;
