    <textblock>
      To evaluate the weight loss effect and safety of 400 mg velneperit and 120 mg orlistat&#xD;
      administered individually or combined three times per day for 24 weeks while on a reduced&#xD;
      calorie diet (RCD) and also to evaluate the steady-state trough concentrations of velneperit&#xD;
      (S-2367), velneperit (S-2367) tert-butyl OH, and velneperit (S-2367) tert-butyl OH-O&#xD;
      glucuronide following 400 mg of velneperit (S-2367) three times per day and 120 mg of&#xD;
