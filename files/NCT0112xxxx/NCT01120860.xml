  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to apply state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) techniques to measure changes over&#xD;
      time in the brain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We expect that MRI and MRSI techniques will be a useful adjunct in research efforts to&#xD;
      understand individual differences in performance of a complex attention-demanding task, such&#xD;
      as flying a plane or driving a car. Other predictors of change in performance of a complex&#xD;
      task may include simple tests of processing speed and working memory, past training and&#xD;
      recent practice of the task, and genetic risk factors for degenerative brain disease. In this&#xD;
      project, we will examine whether baseline MR measures are as useful as longitudinal MR&#xD;
      measures in predicting amount of change over time in task performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is part of a long-term effort to achieve earlier identification of individuals&#xD;
      at risk of decline and ultimately minimize loss of function.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be included if they have participated in the protocol &quot;Age-Related&#xD;
             Longitudinal Changes in Aviator Performance&quot; and agree to participate in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be excluded if they currently have a major neurological disease,&#xD;
             unstable/untreated medical disease (such as untreated hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In consideration of the magnetic fields in which subjects will be placed for the MR&#xD;
             scanning, we will also exclude subjects who are unable to safely and comfortably&#xD;
             complete the scanning session. This includes individuals who are wearing any metal&#xD;
             prosthesis or who have cardiac pacemakers or any other nonremovable metal objects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects reporting a history of severe claustrophobia or poorly controlled back pain&#xD;
             will be excluded because it is unlikely they could comfortably remain still in the MRI&#xD;
             scanner for the duration of the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition, subjects who do not fit in the apparatus will also be excluded.&#xD;
