      This study is designed as a prediction trial. That is, our primary purpose is to develop a&#xD;
      model that can be applied clinically as a user-friendly &quot;baseline&quot; questionnaire that is&#xD;
      capable of predicting &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot; based on a patient's pre-surgical expectations&#xD;
      of their final outcome. In the process, a secondary goal is to develop an outcomes measure.&#xD;

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a novel, psychometrically sound, trauma patient expectation instrument that:&#xD;
           a) demonstrates content validity; b) considers patient and surgeon expectations; c)&#xD;
           predicts orthopedic outcomes; d) is reliable; e) is patient friendly; and f) is easy to&#xD;
           score and interpret. This will be known as the Trauma Expectation Factor (TEF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To develop a novel, psychometrically sound, trauma patient outcomes instrument that: a)&#xD;
           demonstrates content validity; b) measures current condition in the same domains as the&#xD;
           expectation instrument; c) demonstrates construct validity; d) demonstrates criterion&#xD;
           validity; e) is reliable; f) is patient friendly; and g) is easy to score and interpret.&#xD;
           This will be known as the Trauma Outcomes Measure (TOM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H#1. A simple pre-surgical questionnaire that measures patient expectations (i.e., Trauma&#xD;
      Expectation Factor) after an ankle fracture requiring surgery will predict an &quot;expected&quot;&#xD;
      score on a standardized disease-specific ankle instrument (i.e., AAOS Foot and Ankle Core&#xD;
      Score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H#2. A similar instrument that is reworded to assess current condition (i.e., Trauma Outcomes&#xD;
      Measure) instead of expectations, is a valid, reliable, and responsive measure of a traumatic&#xD;
      patient's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H#3. Patient and surgeon expectations of final outcome status are different; however, the&#xD;
      differences get smaller over time.&#xD;
