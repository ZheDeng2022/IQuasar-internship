  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of zidovudine (AZT) alone vs. zidovudine plus&#xD;
      interferon (IFN) vs. interferon alone in reducing HIV viral load, lessening immune system&#xD;
      deterioration, and increasing the time to development of the first opportunistic infection in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected persons 18 years of age and older with a T4 lymphocyte count of 500/mm3 or more&#xD;
      and no current opportunistic infections may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests, chest X-ray,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, urinalysis, and, for patients with Kaposi s sarcoma lesions, measurement,&#xD;
      photographs, and biopsy of lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to receive treatment with either zidovudine alone, zidovudine plus&#xD;
      interferon or interferon alone. They will continue treatment until one of the following&#xD;
      occurs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unacceptable side effects, despite dose modifications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of an opportunistic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease in CD4 count by 20 percent or to an absolute count of less than 200/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rapid progression of Kaposi s sarcoma lesions, requiring alternative therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A decision is made to terminate the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed long term for viral load, immune function, development of&#xD;
      opportunistic infections, disease progression, and survival.&#xD;

      Initial Study: THREE ARM (INTERVENTIONAL) STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, controlled phase III protocol, initiated in 1988, was the first study to&#xD;
      examine intervention with antiretroviral therapy and alpha interferon in patients with HIV&#xD;
      infection. It evaluated the relative efficacy of zidovudine (AZT) vs. AZT + alpha interferon&#xD;
      (IFN) vs. IFN in increasing time to first opportunistic infection, reducing HIV viremia, and&#xD;
      lessening immune system deterioration in HIV-infected persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the AZT alone arm, AZT dosing consisted of the standard regimen of 200 mg q4h. Persons on&#xD;
      the AZT + IFN combination arm received AZT 100 mg q4h with IFN beginning at 1 million units&#xD;
      qd, escalating up to 2.5 million units at 2 weeks, then in increments of 2.5 million units&#xD;
      every 2 weeks. Patients on the IFN-alone arm began therapy at 5 million units qd and&#xD;
      escalated in 2.5 million unit increments every 2 weeks, unless escalations were precluded by&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients who had evidence of HIV infection and a CD4 countgreater than or equal to&#xD;
      500 were randomized to one of the three treatment groups. Patients were treated with their&#xD;
      assigned medication until intolerable toxicity, opportunistic infection, or progressive&#xD;
      Kaposi's sarcoma developed, or CD4 count declined to less than 200/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our statistically significant findings during this pre-HAART era study showed that&#xD;
      interferon-alpha decreased HIV RNA viral load levels, both alone and in combination with AZT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-up: EXTENSION PHASE (NATURAL HISTORY STUDY)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the intervention phase was completed, this protocol entered a long-term follow-up phase&#xD;
      and evolved into a longitudinal natural history study. As of 2013, this work earned the&#xD;
      distinction of following a cohort for 25 years or more. It continues to serve as an important&#xD;
      source of data regarding the long-term outcomes of patients receiving anti-HIV treatment, and&#xD;
      to provide information on the long-term consequences of therapy. In addition, stored blood&#xD;
      and cells enable the study of cutting edge research questions, such as those related to&#xD;
      immune activation, with new state-of-the-art laboratory assays.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Over 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        T4 lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 500/mm3.&#xD;

        culture or positive p24 antigen or positive polymerase chain reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absence of current opportunistic infection (defined for purposes of this study as:&#xD;
        candidiasis, cryptosporidiosis, mycobacterial infection, persistent herpes simplex&#xD;
        infection, isosporiasis, cytomegalovirus infection, toxoplasmosis, pneumocystosis,&#xD;
        salmonellosis, and cryptococcosis). Routine clinical methods and observations were&#xD;
        performed to exclude such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Afebrile (Temperature less the 38 degrees Centigrade orally) without antipyretics for at&#xD;
        least 72 hours prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performance status 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Relatively stable clinical condition, with no deterioration of performance status in the&#xD;
        month prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to give informed consent and willing to comply with all procedures and visits&#xD;
        scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Suitability of I.V. access for the scheduled blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal renal function as defined by BUN less than or equal to 30 and creatinine less than&#xD;
        or equal to 1.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal hepatic function with transaminases and alkaline phosphatase less than 5 times the&#xD;
        upper limit of normal range.&#xD;

        to 1250/mm(3), platelet count greater than or equal to 125,000/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No previous therapy for KS within the month prior to enrollment, and no prior exposure to&#xD;
        investigational agents. Prior exposure to AZT did not disqualify a patient; however&#xD;
        patients were stratified on this basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with malignancy other than Kaposi's sarcoma were specifically excluded from this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing potential who were not employing&#xD;
        effective means of contraception or abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients actively using illicit drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients receiving systemically and potentially myelosuppressive drugs (such as TMP/SMX,&#xD;
        pyrimethamine-sulfa or DHPG), nephrotoxic agents (such as amphotericin B or&#xD;
        aminoglycosides), or cytotoxic or experimental chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of significant depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subsequent Exclusion Criteria (Post Enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        After enrollment, a patient was excluded from further participation in the study for any of&#xD;
        the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serious infection not cleared by antibiotic therapy. The occurrence of a life-threatening&#xD;
        infection, whether or not considered to be opportunistic, will prompt a discontinuation of&#xD;
        therapy during the infection and for 2 weeks following its successful resolution. Therapy&#xD;
        was re-initiated unless (1) in the investigator's judgment re-treatment with either or both&#xD;
        of the study medications would be contraindicated for other reasons or (2) therapy had been&#xD;
        held for more than 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Decrease in percent CD4 to less than 20 percent or in absolute CD4 count to less than&#xD;
        200/mm(3) on 3 consecutive blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Systemic allergic reaction to either study medication, characterized by angioedema,&#xD;
        bronchial constriction, or anaphylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        It was the principal investigator's judgment that the patient was too ill to continue in&#xD;
        the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Toxicity necessitating withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient non-compliance: A patient not taking medication as directed or not keeping&#xD;
        appointments was not allowed to continue on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Rapid or life-threatening progression of KS such that the principal investigator believed&#xD;
        other therapies would be in the patient's best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Voluntary withdrawal: A patient could remove himself from study at any time. The patient&#xD;
        was allowed to withdraw without prejudice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Termination of the study by the principal investigator, sponsor, or the FDA.&#xD;
