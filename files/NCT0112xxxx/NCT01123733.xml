      This project aims to analyze and compare the prevalence of breastfeeding at one hour after&#xD;
      delivery, discharge from hospital, one month, two months, four months, and six months after&#xD;
      delivery and to examine factors associated with breastfeeding between baby-friendly hospitals&#xD;
      and non baby-friendly ones. Employing a prospective cohort design, the study population is&#xD;
      mothers who gave lived births in Taiwan area from August, 2009 to March, 2010. At least 11&#xD;
      hospitals both in non baby-friendly and baby-friendly hospitals from northern, middle,&#xD;
      southern and east areas will be asked for permission to join this study (totally 22&#xD;
      hospitals). The research assistants will contact each eligible participant in the hospitals&#xD;
      and explained the purposes and procedure of the study. Once permission was obtained, mothers&#xD;
      will be asked to write a questionnaire and their telephone numbers as well as address for&#xD;
      future contacts. After the individual case returned home, the collection of data was mainly&#xD;
      via telephone interviews. However, if the individual case could not be contacted more than&#xD;
      two times via telephone, she would be surveyed by questionnaire. The collection of data&#xD;
      showed the state of mother milk feeding one month, two months, four months, or six months&#xD;
      after delivery. 1, 000 effective questionnaires were expected to be returned (500 ones from&#xD;
      baby friendly hospitals; 500 ones, from non baby-friendly hospitals.) The survey include&#xD;
      questions on breastfeeding experiences (one hour after delivery, discharge from hospital, one&#xD;
      month, two months, four months, and six months), planned duration of breastfeeding,&#xD;
      socio-demographic information, perceived baby-friendly practices at hospital, social support&#xD;
      regarding breastfeeding, prior infant feeding method, maternal and infant health conditions,&#xD;
      mother's working plan, receipt of formula samples and commercial message during perinatal&#xD;
      period. The researcher hopes that based on the research results we can have a better&#xD;
      understanding of the influencing factors of promoting mother milk feeding in non&#xD;
      baby-friendly hospitals, and that we know how to raise the breastfeeding rate in Taiwan area,&#xD;
      which can serve as references for the governmental policies.&#xD;
