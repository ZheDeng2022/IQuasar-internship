    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if Group Health members who participate in the online&#xD;
      chronic disease self-management program will experience improved health outcomes, improved&#xD;
      health care utilization, and lower costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will pilot an evidence-based online program for chronic disease self-management that is&#xD;
      modeled after the widely-replicated in-person Chronic Disease Self-management Program (CDSMP)&#xD;
      developed at Stanford University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online CDSMP is an internet-based intervention for people with one or more chronic&#xD;
      conditions. It is built on self-efficacy theory and is structured around a formal curriculum&#xD;
      that emphasizes problem solving, decision making, and confidence building in weekly sessions&#xD;
      over six weeks. The curriculum addresses generic topics and skills that are relevant to&#xD;
      managing any chronic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program is structured around three components: 1) password-protected, interactive&#xD;
      web-based instruction; 2) web-based bulletin board discussion groups to enable participatory&#xD;
      learning and interaction; 3) and a reference book, Living a Healthy Life with Chronic&#xD;
      Conditions, that contains the program content and supplemental information. It is facilitated&#xD;
      by two trained lay moderators, at least one of whom has a chronic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Piloting the online CDSMP allows Group Health to learn about and maximize the program's&#xD;
      impact in the Group Health system before launching a full-scale program. Since web-based&#xD;
      interventions are increasingly recognized as holding promise in health care, our learnings&#xD;
      and recommendations will likely be applicable beyond this innovation. The pilot provides GH&#xD;
      the opportunity to explore the following about the online CDSMP and web-based tools, in&#xD;
      general:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Impact of the online CDSMP on participants' psychosocial and health status, health&#xD;
           behaviors, and health service utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Efficient processes for incorporating the online CDSMP into existing operations through&#xD;
           use of PDCA cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An understanding of demographic characteristics of members who are more likely to&#xD;
           participate in an online self-management program than an in-person program&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Effective recruitment and retention strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Feasibility of sustaining the program without external funding&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Recommendations for successful implementation of future innovations that utilize&#xD;
           web-based media, social networking technology, etc.&#xD;
