      The objective of this clinical trial is to in determining weight-bearing deficits following&#xD;
      anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.&#xD;

      Orthopedic surgeons and rehabilitation physicians frequently request limited weight-bearing&#xD;
      for prolonged periods following certain bony or soft tissue pathologies as well as certain&#xD;
      lower - limb surgical procedures. Walking, stair climbing, jogging, elliptical training and&#xD;
      running on treadmill are a common activity that the injured athlete will seek to return to as&#xD;
      soon as possible following injury or surgery. In order for the physician to be able to advise&#xD;
      regarding weight-bearing, the Percentage Body-Weight/Weight-Bearing (PBW/WB) values in&#xD;
      increasing walking, jogging speeds, elliptical training must be known. These parameters as&#xD;
      well as the gait distribution changes have eluded the rehabilitation community, mainly due to&#xD;
      the technical inability to measure these paradigms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no short-term studies quantifying weight-bearing deficits as well as weight-bearing&#xD;
      gait distribution characteristics following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR).&#xD;
      Furthermore, there are no published studies that have investigated whether differences exist&#xD;
      between various surgical procedures and replacement graft choices in the acute- phase (0-3&#xD;
      weeks) post surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive clinical trial. During their regular training the participants will use the&#xD;
      flexible, light weight, force-sensing insole for few minutes to receive the parameters 30&#xD;
      subjects. The test subjects will be instructed to walk at their normal speed on a solid&#xD;
      ground surface over a distance of 16 meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be analyzed and a table of normal values will be established including&#xD;
      average PBW/WB values for the entire, hind and fore-foot as well as gait distribution&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
