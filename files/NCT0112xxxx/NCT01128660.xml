  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to twofold. The investigators wish to introduce a new&#xD;
      patient-descriptive parameter, the 'Fidelity Coefficient', and use it to assess and compare&#xD;
      the overview of patient's medication possessed by the general practitioners and the&#xD;
      pharmacies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The fidelity coefficient, FC, is a measure of what proportion of individual patients'&#xD;
      medication that are accounted for by the most used prescriber and the most used pharmacy.&#xD;
      Each patient therefore has two values, one describing his fidelity towards his most used&#xD;
      prescriber, FCPresc, and one describing his fidelity towards his most used pharmacy, FCPharm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to assess this parameter in an observational population scale&#xD;
      database study, using standard descriptive statistics, and subsequently compare the obtained&#xD;
      average FCPresc and FCPharm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will analyze the two obtained FCs for dependency of a&#xD;
      predefined list of variables: age, gender, number of prescriptions, whether the most frequent&#xD;
      prescriber was a GP and whether the most used pharmacy was urban.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators intend to analyze which medications (grouped using the ATC-system&#xD;
      with 4 digits, e.g. C07A) that has the highest proportion of prescriptions that were either&#xD;
      issued by a non-main prescriber or redeemed at a non-main pharmacy, which roughly translates&#xD;
      into the most 'infidel' medications. To insure relevance we intend to use a cut-off-value of&#xD;
      the medication being prescribed at least 50.000 times, which equals about 85 % of the data&#xD;
      according to preceding analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data for this study will be obtained from the Odense University Pharmacoepidemiological&#xD;
      Database (OPED). In brief, it is a research database with full coverage of all reimbursed&#xD;
      prescriptions in the Region of Southern Denmark (1.2 million inhabitants). The data included&#xD;
      in each prescription record includes the prescription holder, the prescriber, the pharmacy,&#xD;
      the date of dispensing and a full account of the dispensed product, including substance,&#xD;
      brand name, route of administration, ATC-code and Defined Daily Dose (DDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some drugs are exempt from re-imbursement and thus not covered by the database, including&#xD;
      benzodiazepines, oral contraceptives, laxatives and certain antibiotics.&#xD;
