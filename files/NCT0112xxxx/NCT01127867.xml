  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if a supplement of an omega-3-fatty acid (docosahexaenoic - DHA)&#xD;
      lowers inflammation in human fat tissue thereby lowering estrogen production and the&#xD;
      potential risk for breast cancer. The investigators also aim to study how this occurs to&#xD;
      discover the basis for other potential treatments to lower estrogen production in fat tissue&#xD;
      and decrease the risk of breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the most frequently seen cancers in the United States. Breast cancer&#xD;
      occurs at all ages but is particularly common in post menopausal women. Obesity increases the&#xD;
      risk of breast cancer primarily of the type that is stimulated by the female sex hormone&#xD;
      estrogen. In obesity, fat cells produce estrogen which can alter breast tissue, while&#xD;
      lowering blood estrogen reduces the incidence of breast cancer. Inflammation of fat tissue,&#xD;
      the coronary blood vessels and the liver are also seen with obesity. Animal experiments have&#xD;
      shown the inflammation in fat tissue increases the production of estrogen, thus reducing&#xD;
      inflammation in fat tissue might lower estrogen levels and the risk of breast cancer in obese&#xD;
      women. A diet high in omega-3-fatty acids, such as those found in fish oil, has been shown in&#xD;
      mice to reduce inflammation and aromatase expression (rate limiting enzyme for estrogen&#xD;
      synthesis) in fat tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study of five obese, post-menopausal women and an additional 12 morbidly obese&#xD;
      post-menopausal women will include nutritional and medical evaluations, a four day inpatient&#xD;
      hospital stay on a regular diet, to measure the inflammation and the estrogen producing&#xD;
      machinery of each volunteer subject. Following these baseline measurements, subjects will be&#xD;
      provided DHA supplements to take daily for three months and requested to weigh themselves&#xD;
      twice weekly at home with the goal of maintaining their weight. Telephone interviews will be&#xD;
      performed at scheduled points to check-in with the subjects and after six weeks a return&#xD;
      visit to the OPRC will be conducted to assess progress and provide additional supplements. At&#xD;
      three months each subject will be readmitted to the hospital and repeat the tests performed&#xD;
      before starting on the DHA supplement. If the study shows feasibility and positive results it&#xD;
      will be extended to more subjects and other interventions in the future.&#xD;
