      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding participants experiences as research volunteers is critical to improving&#xD;
           the effectiveness of human participant protection programs and strengthening public&#xD;
           trust in clinical research. Historically, studies that evaluate participants&#xD;
           comprehension of the informed consent document or evaluate the informed consent process&#xD;
           have only indirectly measured the quality of a participant s experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Few studies have assessed the nature, quality and efficiency of the entire clinical&#xD;
           research process from the participant s perspective. To address this need, researchers&#xD;
           have developed a Clinical Research Participant Perception Survey to evaluate&#xD;
           participants overall perceptions of clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To validate the Research Participant Perception Survey questionnaire and revise it&#xD;
      accordingly to produce a questionnaire that other researchers can use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have participated in at least one research&#xD;
      protocol within the past 2 years. Participation may be completed or ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will receive a survey by mail and will be asked to complete it and&#xD;
           return it in the stamped envelope provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The survey will ask questions about the research protocol process, including&#xD;
           participants positive and negative experiences of participating in the research&#xD;
           protocol....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Understanding participants experiences as research volunteers is critical to improving the&#xD;
      effectiveness of human participant protection programs, and strengthening the public trust in&#xD;
      the clinical research enterprise. Institutional Review Boards, investigators and regulators&#xD;
      have few tools, little direct information, and no validated outcome measures in this regard.&#xD;
      Yet, to operate rationally, IRBs and investigations need not only data on local performance,&#xD;
      but also the critical ability to benchmark among peers and identify best practices.&#xD;
      Historically, studies evaluating participant s comprehension of the informed consent document&#xD;
      or evaluating the informed consent process have served, at best, as indirect measures of the&#xD;
      quality of the participant s experience, focusing primarily on the readability of text and&#xD;
      institutional process. Few if any studies have assessed the nature, quality and efficiency of&#xD;
      the entire clinical research process from the participant s perspective, nor produced results&#xD;
      that are actionable and relevant to the research participant experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the second phase of a two-part study designed to directly measure research&#xD;
      participants perceptions of the clinical research process as defined by what research&#xD;
      participants themselves have articulated in focus groups as the relevant aspects of their&#xD;
      clinical research experience. In the first phase of the project, from May 2008- November&#xD;
      2008, 89 research volunteers and 29 research professionals from eight academic research&#xD;
      institutions were enrolled into 18 focus groups to assess the key dimensions of the research&#xD;
      experience. Using qualitative research methods, the main themes of the research participant&#xD;
      experience were extracted from the analysis of the transcripts of those focus groups and a&#xD;
      draft survey was constructed. The current protocol describes the fielding and validation of&#xD;
      the Research Participant Perception Survey instrument in 15 academic research institutions&#xD;
      across the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) consortium. The scope of the&#xD;
      fielding and validation study is enhanced by the support of a CTSA Administrative Supplement&#xD;
      which facilitated the increase of the number of participating centers from 9 to 15&#xD;
      institutions, and enlarges the sample size of completed surveys from 3600 to 5400 completed&#xD;
      participant surveys (based on 340 completed surveys/institution for 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals.) Based on prior experience of 45% return rates, it is estimated that 10,000&#xD;
      surveys will be deployed across the 15 institutions in order to obtain the targeted 5400&#xD;
      completed surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leveraging the hospital survey expertise of our colleagues at NRC Picker, the fielding of the&#xD;
      draft survey instrument is designed to validate the instrument and to attain highly relevant,&#xD;
      actionable process and outcome measures. Survey data may be used for benchmarking and to&#xD;
      assist centers in identifying best practices to offer the consortium. Center-specific survey&#xD;
      data may be used to improve the clinical research participant experience, enhance public&#xD;
      trust, and to strengthen the clinical research enterprise. Information regarding the&#xD;
      processes of study design and implementation during this intra-consortium collaboration will&#xD;
      also be derived to streamline and improve such collaborations in the future.&#xD;
