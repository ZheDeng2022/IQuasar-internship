      Overall Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate impact of maternal educational strategies (teaching sessions by trained lady&#xD;
      health workers, verbal, pictorial and demonstrative) regarding appropriate complementary&#xD;
      foods of infants, and assess their impact on nutritional status of after six months of&#xD;
      educational intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objective • To determine the impact of maternal educational strategies regarding&#xD;
      complementary foods by assessing baseline weight, height and mid - upper arm circumference at&#xD;
      2.5 - 5 month of age and then comparing it at 3, 6 and 9 months after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Hypothesis; the investigators hypothesize that there will be a gain of 250 gram weight, 0.5&#xD;
      cm in length and 0.5 cm in MUAC in infants whose mothers received the special education&#xD;
      module for complementary feeding, as compare to the children whose mothers doesn't receive&#xD;
      education on complementary food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the impact of maternal educational strategies regarding complementary foods by&#xD;
      assessing morbidity (number of diarrhea and ARI episodes, at 2.5 - 5 month of age and at then&#xD;
      reporting at 3, 6 and 9 months after enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Hypothesis; the investigators hypothesize that there will be 10% decrease in incidence of&#xD;
      diarrhea episodes and ARI episodes in infants whose mother received the special education&#xD;
      module for complementary feeding, as compare to the children whose mothers doesn't receive&#xD;
      education on complementary food).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARI can be define as per IMCI guidelines. Increase breathing rate (age specific) along with&#xD;
      cough, cold and or wheezing.&#xD;

      Study population The study will be conducting in Bhainse colony (BC), Karachi. This is a&#xD;
      periurban community area, and catering population mainly belonging to low - middle income&#xD;
      households. The study population would be the mothers (having infant of 2.5 - 5 months of&#xD;
      age) and their infants in these two study areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants aged 2.5 - 5 months; who are either exclusively breast feed or partially breast&#xD;
           feed but have not started complementary feeding or have recently started complementary&#xD;
           food (less than 1 week)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent Exclusion Criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants found below 5th percentile on weight for age CDC growth charts 23 at baseline&#xD;
           will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of two or more hospital admissions for more than 7 days each&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of serious congenital anomalies (cleft palate, congenital heart disease, neural&#xD;
           tube defect) or other chronic conditions impairing feeding (e.g. cerebral palsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of acute illness requiring urgent hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants from families of very low socioeconomic status where adequate calorie-provision&#xD;
           is constrained (assessed by a questionnaire on household possessions of items such as&#xD;
           mobile phone, bicycle or other vehicle, TV, cemented construction, fuel used for cooking&#xD;
           - wood or gas/LPG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infant already enrolled in any trial with a nutritional intervention will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants who at initial clinical examination are found to be severely anemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data outcome measures Measuring Weight, height and Mid-upper arm circumference The&#xD;
      investigators measure serial height, weight and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) for each&#xD;
      subject at enrollment and subsequently in each visit. Each infant will be measured four times&#xD;
      during the study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height will be measured twice and the results averaged. Duplicate measures that exceed&#xD;
           predefined allowable variation will be resolved by the field supervisor, e.g., by&#xD;
           returning to the site with the interviewer to repeat the measurements. The height of&#xD;
           infants will be measured (to the nearest 0.1 cm) in the recumbent position using a board&#xD;
           with a fixed head and sliding foot piece.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a scale that is calibrated daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MUAC will be measure twice each time by using measuring tape. All anthropometric&#xD;
           measurements will be taken three times (in each visit) and the mean of the measurements&#xD;
           will counted as valid value. Each of the anthropometric indices will be expressed in&#xD;
           standard deviation units (SD) from the median of the NCHS/CDC/WHO International&#xD;
           Reference Population. Methods are adapted from How to Weigh and Measure Children:&#xD;
           Assessing the Nutritional Status of Young Children in Household Surveys, United Nations&#xD;
           Department of Technical Cooperation for Development and Statistical Office, 1986. The&#xD;
           height and weight measurements will later converted into WAZ, WHZ and HAZ score and the&#xD;
           difference in both groups will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ARI will be measured through standard IMCI guidelines. ARI could be assess by the&#xD;
                physician's visit and treatment prescribed.&#xD;

Ten important key messages developed based on recommended practices (WHO/UNICEF, 2000 &amp; 2006).&#xD;
First session --&gt; cover the importance of breast feeding, its continuation for whole two years, hand washing, hygiene and importance of CF initiation at 6 months of age.&#xD;
Second session --&gt;breastfeeding promotion, complementary food consistency, initial complementary food selection and age related complementary food education.&#xD;
Third session --&gt; previous sessions recall. protein based and iron rich food encouragement.&#xD;
