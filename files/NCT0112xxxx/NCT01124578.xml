      PURPOSE OF EVALUATION: This study will verify &amp; validate the acceptability of Egret's&#xD;
      extended use product as compared to the existing daily change-out product. Based on an&#xD;
      extensive in-vitro study, Egret's product confirmed significant kill for both positive and&#xD;
      negative gram bacteria. In addition to meeting all of the current product requirements, total&#xD;
      aerobic bio-burden on the catheters will be tested at various intervals for up to 10 days of&#xD;
      use. The current used product will be used as a control group that is to be changed out daily&#xD;
      as per current policy. The control group will be tested for total aerobic bacteria counts on&#xD;
      the last day of use.&#xD;

&#xD;
      I. PURPOSE OF EVALUATION: This test will verify &amp; validate the acceptability of Egret's&#xD;
      extended use product as compared to the existing Ballard's daily change-out product. In&#xD;
      addition to meeting all of the current product requirements, total aerobic bio-burden on the&#xD;
      catheters will be tested at various intervals for up to 10 days of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. BACKGROUND: Prior to this evaluation, a baseline study was conducted at Medical City to&#xD;
      determine the existing total aerobic bio-burden after one day of use, using 25 randomly&#xD;
      selected Ballard catheters as per the attached protocol. The data from the baseline study&#xD;
      were used to establish an appropriate sample size for the Extended Use Protocol. This data&#xD;
      gathered under this Extended Use Protocol will be compared to the baseline data to determine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of Egret's antimicrobial properties during extended use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. POTENTIAL RISK TO PATIENT: Closed endotracheal suction catheters are intended to&#xD;
      maintain a hermetical seal. However, such catheters have a propensity to build up bio- film&#xD;
      on the tip area and require saline rinsing and cleaning after use. Egret's catheter is&#xD;
      compounded with a non-leaching antimicrobial to address this issue. There is the possibility&#xD;
      that excessive patient secretions can over saturate any closed suction catheter. Egret has&#xD;
      addressed this concern by incorporating a unique squeegee-and-filter design that facilitates&#xD;
      tip cleaning and prevents debris from migrating from the cleaning chamber to the sleeve area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. BENEFTS OF THE EGRET MEDICAL DEVICE&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The catheter contains a non-leaching antimicrobial agent that enables product to be used&#xD;
           safely for up to fourteen (10) days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Based on previous in-vitro testing, the Egret product with BIOSAFE has been found to&#xD;
           reduce bacteria counts over extended time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Minimizing the frequency of change-out of the closed catheter system will reduce the&#xD;
           chance for cross-contamination since the air way will be opened less frequently, e.g.,&#xD;
           every five days versus daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Less frequent product change-out reduces the need to manipulate the ET-Tube. The more&#xD;
           the ET-Tube is manipulated, the greater the chance upper airway contents trapped above&#xD;
           the cuff can enter the pulmonary bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The catheter reduces bacteria colonization over the span of its use&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The swivel connector enables accessories to be easily connected and disconnected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. An integrated positive lock valve facilitates use and prevents gas from escaping when&#xD;
           not in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. A uniquely designed filter is incorporated into the device's manifold that provides a&#xD;
           95% BFE level to prevent cross-contamination to caregiver and patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Egret's devices are MRI safe - no metal parts are used in assembly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. PRODUCT to BE EVALUATED:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Code Description Size 454 Egret 14 Fr. T-Piece - Extended use 14 FR/4.6 mm 54 cm&#xD;
      (21.75&quot;) length&#xD;

      VIII. AFFLICATION OF APPLICANT Egret Medical Products Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. FUNDING AGIENCIES Egret Medical Products Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. ANTICIPATED TEST DATES April 2008-May 2008&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Egret will provide 100 units of product to support use testing requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An in-service meeting will be held by Egret facilitators prior to beginning the test to&#xD;
           ensure participants are aware of the use test requirements and responsibilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During the test period, the Egret product will be used instead of the specific normally&#xD;
           used for the procedure for up to 10 days if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. This device is to be used per existing Medical City Policy RCSCC12 with the exception&#xD;
           that change- out is not required daily, and that the Egret device can be used up to 10&#xD;
           days or until extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Careful instruction is to be given the caregiver on how catheter is to be flushed and&#xD;
           rinsed after suctioning. This step is essential to maintain the patency of the catheter&#xD;
           as well as to reduce bio- burden that the catheter must combat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Clinical Trial Subject Tracking - As per the attached spreadsheet, product installation&#xD;
           and usage is to be tracked by the investigator. Products provided from Egret will be&#xD;
           discreetly numbered 1 thru 100 on the bottom of each suction catheter valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Arrangements have been made with MicroChem Laboratory, Inc. to conduct total aerobic&#xD;
           bio-burden using the same the method used for the baseline study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. After product has been used, representative samples are to be red bagged and sent by&#xD;
           courier to MicroChem to conduct aerobic bacterial testing. Transportation and testing&#xD;
           requirements are clearly outlined in an approved test protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Egret personnel will be present at Medical City to facilitate and observe the use of the&#xD;
           test product for the duration of the test period.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. At the completion of the test period, healthcare participants will complete a&#xD;
           questionnaire concerning the Egret use test product as compared to the existing Ballard&#xD;
           product.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. All test products at the end of the test period will be return to Egret.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. During the evaluation, if a caregiver perceives defect or failure, the caregiver is to&#xD;
           contact the investigator for assessment. Products that are perceived as defective are to&#xD;
           be set aside for additional evaluation by Egret.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XII. DATA TO BE COLLECTED: After product has been used, the healthcare participants will&#xD;
      complete a written questionnaire concerning the test device as per attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XIII. DELIVERY OF PRODUCT: Available test product will be delivered to use-test site as per&#xD;
      Medical City instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XIV. RECOVERY OF PRODUCT: The investigator will be responsible for gathering all unused test&#xD;
      product and returning it to Egret.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XV. SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: Participants will be briefed on the specific features of Egret's&#xD;
      extended use product to be tested at their facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XVI. TEST FACILITATORS: Egret will provide on-site qualified personnel to assist with&#xD;
      resources as required by Medical City.&#xD;
