      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Researchers will evaluate and compare predictors of health-related quality of life (QOL)&#xD;
           among colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors who have Lynch syndrome (LS) with those patients&#xD;
           who have sporadic CRC using both quantitative and qualitative methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. In both CRC groups, researchers will evaluate cancer preventive and health behaviors,&#xD;
           including lifestyle factors and screening, psychosocial factors, including mood, family&#xD;
           functioning, coping style, anxiety, depression, and social resources, and health care&#xD;
           system factors, including interactions with health care providers and service&#xD;
           utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Researchers will compare the experience of first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients who&#xD;
           have LS with that of FDRs of patients who have sporadic CRC using both quantitative and&#xD;
           qualitative methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Researchers will evaluate all of the domains listed above, as well as anticipatory&#xD;
           grief, assessment of caregiving responsibilities, and fear of cancer in FDRs of patients&#xD;
           with LS-related and sporadic CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Researchers will examine CRC patients from both groups and their FDRs using dyadic&#xD;
           analyses in order to evaluate the similarities and differences in their survivorship&#xD;
           experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Researchers will evaluate the preventive and health behavior of patients who are&#xD;
           non-conclusive for Lynch syndrome and their family members. They will examine their&#xD;
           screening behavior and will explore how the interaction between the patients and their&#xD;
           relatives affects the relatives' screening behavior. They also will examine how these&#xD;
           non conclusive LS patients and their family members perceive their risk for LS-related&#xD;
           cancers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data will be collected primarily using a mailed self-administered questionnaire. A subset of&#xD;
      the participants who complete the mailed questionnaire will be recontacted and invited to&#xD;
      participate in an in-depth, semi-structured telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Mailed Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a questionnaire that contains questions about your experiences&#xD;
      living with colorectal cancer. The questionnaire should take 45-60 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 200 colorectal cancer survivors and up to 200 close relatives of colorectal cancer&#xD;
      survivors will take part in this portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phone interview, you will be asked some questions about your experiences living with&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. The phone interview should take 30-45 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 colorectal cancer survivors and up to 30 close relatives of colorectal cancer&#xD;
      survivors will take part in this portion of the study.&#xD;
