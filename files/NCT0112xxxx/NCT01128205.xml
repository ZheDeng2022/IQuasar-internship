      The objective of this study is to evaluate the level of control of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      risk factors, including blood pressure, blood lipid, and blood glucose, in out patients with&#xD;
      type 2 DM in 6 representative regions in China: Northeast, North, East, South, Southwest and&#xD;
      Northwest, measured by,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proportion of patients reaching adequate control of blood glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proportion of patients reaching adequate control of blood glucose and blood pressure, or&#xD;
           blood glucose and blood lipid&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Proportion of patients reaching adequate control of all 3Bs, i.e. blood glucose, blood&#xD;
           pressure, and blood lipid.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) worldwide has increased from 30&#xD;
      million in 1985 to 180 million at the present time. In China, the incidence of overweight,&#xD;
      obesity, and DM has increased rapidly due to the significant change of diet and lifestyle&#xD;
      resulted from rapid economic development. As estimated by International Diabetes Federation&#xD;
      (IDF), the number of the patients with DM was about 39.8 million in China in 2007, and it is&#xD;
      anticipated that the number would reach 59.3 million in 2025 [11]. At the same time there are&#xD;
      a similar number of pre-diabetes patients with risk factors of cardiovascular diseases in&#xD;
      China. DM and its associated microvascular and macrovascular complications could severely&#xD;
      affects patients' quality of life and duration of survival and lead to significant increase&#xD;
      in medical expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been a number of epidemiological surveys of diabetes conducted in other countries.&#xD;
      However, there is little specific data available on the status of DM control and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiovascular complications and other&#xD;
      microvascular complications in China. This has made it difficult for clinicians to&#xD;
      effectively make medical choices for patients with a variety of risk factors and&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is thus designed to assess the level of control of CVD risk factors, including&#xD;
      blood pressure, blood lipid, and blood glucose, in outpatients with type 2 DM nation-wide&#xD;
      across 6 representative regions in China: Northeast, North, East, South, Southwest and&#xD;
      Northwest. The difference in clinical outcomes between the regions and between the three&#xD;
      different tiers of hospitals, i.e. tier 3 (primary or teaching hospitals), tier 2 (secondary&#xD;
      or city level hospitals), and tier 1 (community hospitals/health centers), will be made. The&#xD;
      primary measurements include 1)Proportion of patients reaching adequate control of blood&#xD;
      glucose (1B); 2)Proportion of patients reaching adequate control of blood glucose and blood&#xD;
      pressure, or blood glucose and blood lipid (2B); and 3)Proportion of patients reaching&#xD;
      adequate control of all 3Bs, i.e. blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood lipid. Other&#xD;
      measurements include proportion of microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications, DM&#xD;
      treatment pattern and influence factors, physician prescribing behaviors, etc.&#xD;
