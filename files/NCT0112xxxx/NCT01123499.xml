      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Many treatments for immune system disorders involve the use of stem cells that have been&#xD;
           collected from blood marrow. To obtain these stem cells without surgery, individuals&#xD;
           receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to encourage the production of&#xD;
           stem cells that can be collected through blood donations. However, not all patients or&#xD;
           normal donors respond to G-CSF alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plerixafor, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is different from&#xD;
           G-CSF but also allows stem cells to be collected from donated blood. However, more&#xD;
           research is needed on the quality and viability of the stem cells collected after using&#xD;
           both G-CSF and plerixafor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect and study the blood cells produced after treatment with G-CSF and plerixafor in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age who are eligible to donate blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and initial&#xD;
           blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the start of the study cycle, participants will receive daily morning injections of&#xD;
           G-CSF for 5 days. These may be given at the clinical center or by the participant after&#xD;
           teaching, depending on the participant s preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the morning of Day 4, participants will visit the clinical center to provide a blood&#xD;
           sample after the injection. On the evening of Day 4, participants will receive an&#xD;
           injection of plerixafor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have the final injection of G-CSF on the morning of Day 5, and will&#xD;
           provide another blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 5, participants will have apheresis to separate the stem cells from the rest of&#xD;
           the blood. The apheresis may take up to 5 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will end after a follow-up phone call 7 to 14 days after the apheresis&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cells that have been mobilized from the bone marrow into the peripheral&#xD;
      circulation are readily collected by apheresis, and may be used for several purposes. They&#xD;
      are used for allogeneic and autologous transplantation and are often manipulated in various&#xD;
      ways depending on the goal of the transplant. Gene therapy for immunodeficiencies relies on&#xD;
      the collection of these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, mobilization has been done using granulocyte colony stimulating factor&#xD;
      (G-CSF). However not all patients or normal donors respond to GCSF alone. Plerixafor, a&#xD;
      recently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug, has a unique mode of action&#xD;
      distinct from that of GCSF, but also results in mobilization of peripheral blood progenitors&#xD;
      into the circulation, allowing their collection by standard apheresis. The quality of these&#xD;
      cells for transduction using viral vectors in anticipation of gene therapy uses has not been&#xD;
      thoroughly assessed, and there are theoretical considerations why vectors that use various&#xD;
      envelopes for cell binding may be affected by the use of this CXCR4 antagonist. In order to&#xD;
      be able to assess the transduction and engraftment of these cells in murine models, we will&#xD;
      perform collection and mobilization on 5 healthy volunteers at the NIH Clinical Center using&#xD;
      the FDA approved medications G-CSF and plerixafor.&#xD;
