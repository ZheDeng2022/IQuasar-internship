      Although mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenopathy is not rare in adults of such an&#xD;
      abnormality. Isolated mediastinal without a parenchymal lung lesion in adults is unusual with&#xD;
      the incidence of 0.25%-5.8%. It occurs most commonly in Asian and black people, and presents&#xD;
      a diagnostic problem. The definite diagnosis requires microbiology or pathology study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical mediastinoscopy remained the gold standard to sample the mediastnial lymph nodes,&#xD;
      but this technique can access lymph node station 1-4, 7 only. EBUS-TBNA allows the&#xD;
      mediastinal lymph nodes to be targeted in the areas accessible to cervical mediastinoscopy,&#xD;
      as well as some hilar nodes (lymph node stations 2-4, 7, 10-12). Currently, the main&#xD;
      indication of EBUS-TBNA is the mediastinal nodal staging of NSCLC after recent meta-analyses&#xD;
      established the comparable sensitivity and specificity of nodal staging by EBUS-TBNA and&#xD;
      cervical mediastinoscopy. Theoretically, mediastnial tuberculous lymphadenopathy could be&#xD;
      diagnosed by the method of EBUS-TBNA. Douglas F. Johnson was the first doctor to report 2&#xD;
      cases of mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenopathy diagnosed by EBUS-TBNA in 2009. There are&#xD;
      currently no much data on the use of this technique in this field. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      perform a prospective single-center study to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of&#xD;
      mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenopathy by sampling the culprit nodes via EBUS-TBNA.&#xD;
      Concomitant sputum specimen for acid-fast stain and mycobacterial culture were collected as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;

      Although mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenopathy is much more common as a manifestation of&#xD;
      primary tuberculosis in children, the presentation in adults of such an abnormality is not&#xD;
      rare. In a large series reported in 1959 by Lyons and coworkers, tuberculosis was the 5th&#xD;
      commonest cause of mediastinal enlargement, accounting for 6% of 782 cases. Intrathoracic&#xD;
      lymphadenitis had been found to be present in between 0.5% and 26%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, isolated mediastinal without a parenchymal lung lesion in adults is unusual with the&#xD;
      incidence of 0.25%-5.8%. It occurs most commonly in Asian and black people, and presents a&#xD;
      diagnostic problem. Although chest CT findings such as nodes with central low attenuation and&#xD;
      peripheral rim enhancement are suggestive, the definite diagnosis requires microbiology or&#xD;
      pathology study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical mediastinoscopy remained the gold standard to sample the mediastnial lymph nodes,&#xD;
      but this technique can access lymph node station 1-4, 7 only. EBUS-TBNA allows the&#xD;
      mediastinal lymph nodes to be targeted in the areas accessible to cervical mediastinoscopy,&#xD;
      as well as some hilar nodes (lymph node stations 2-4, 7, 10-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kazuhiro Yasufuku had published the first report of rear-time EBUS-TBNA in evaluating&#xD;
      mediastinal lymphadenopathy in 2004. Currently, the main indication of EBUS-TBNA is the&#xD;
      mediastinal nodal staging of NSCLC after recent meta-analyses established the comparable&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of nodal staging by EBUS-TBNA and cervical mediastinoscopy.&#xD;
      Efficacy in evaluation of other disease processes such as sarcoidosis and lymphoma has also&#xD;
      been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretically, mediastnial tuberculous lymphadenopathy could be diagnosed by the method of&#xD;
      EBUS-TBNA. Douglas F. Johnson was the first doctor to report 2 cases of mediastinal&#xD;
      tuberculous lymphadenopathy diagnosed by EBUS-TBNA in 2009. There are currently no much data&#xD;
      on the use of this technique in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to perform a prospective single-center study to investigate the diagnostic efficacy&#xD;
      of mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenopathy by sampling the culprit nodes via EBUS-TBNA.&#xD;
      Concomitant sputum specimen for acid-fast stain and mycobacterial culture were collected as&#xD;
