      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of alvespimycin&#xD;
      hydrochloride in treating patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small&#xD;
      lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), or B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL). Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as alvespimycin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 17-DMAG in patients with relapsed CLL/SLL&#xD;
      and B-PLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of 17-DMAG in patients with relapsed CLL/SLL&#xD;
      and B-PLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess preliminary efficacy of 17-DMAG in patients with relapsed CLL/SLL and B-PLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of 17-DMAG in patients with relapsed CLL/SLL and B-PLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the feasibility of measuring pharmacodynamic markers of 17-DMAG including&#xD;
      the Hsp90 client proteins Akt and IKK-alpha/IKK-beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine if FoxD3 and downstream genes such as EPHA7 and ID4 are re-expressed in CLL&#xD;
      cells following treatment with 17-DMAG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To correlate pharmacokinetic features of 17-DMAG with response, toxicity and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To correlate risk parameters such as ZAP-70 with response to 17-DMAG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive alvespimycin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 4,&#xD;
      8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 17-DMAG is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with 17-DMAG, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
