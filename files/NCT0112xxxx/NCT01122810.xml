  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary vasculopathy remains the leading cause of decreased survival after the first year&#xD;
      post-transplantation. It is mainly asymptomatic because of the denervation of the heart&#xD;
      transplant. Currently, annual invasive coronary angiogram is performed to ensure the lack of&#xD;
      coronary narrowing. But invasive coronary angiography caries risks of serious adverse events&#xD;
      and some concern rise from its repetition in that population. Recent advance in coronary&#xD;
      multidetector computed tomography (CT) may allow non invasive visualization of the coronary&#xD;
      tree. But, it remains unknown if the encouraging data observed in native coronary artery&#xD;
      analysis can be extrapolated to transplant heart recipients. Indeed, only very small sample&#xD;
      size studies (20 patients) have been conducted in this particular setting. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators decide to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the 64-row CT and 256-row CT&#xD;
      compared to the gold standard coronary angiogram in a larger sample size study. The practice&#xD;
      aim of this study is to determine if the conventional invasive coronarography can be switched&#xD;
      by the 64-row CT or the 256-row CT to assess coronary anatomy especially for the patient&#xD;
      without any coronary artery disease (CAD) or those with CAD not suitable for percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart transplantation is a major advance in the care of patient with terminal heart failure.&#xD;
      But, despite the spectacular prognosis improvement obtained with this treatment, coronary&#xD;
      vasculopathy remains the leading cause of decreased survival after the first year&#xD;
      post-transplantation (8% of death at 1 year, 42% at 5 years). This coronary artery disease&#xD;
      (CAD) has a particular feature involving immunological and inflammatory process, also&#xD;
      favoured by classical risk factors in the context of immunosuppression, with rapid and&#xD;
      diffuse involvement. Because of the denervation of the transplant heart, it remains mainly&#xD;
      asymptomatic and let non invasive stress tests with poor accuracy for CAD screening. It&#xD;
      explains the current use of systematic coronary angiogram to transplant heart recipient's&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But coronary angiogram remains an invasive technique and exposed to potential serious adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent advance in coronary multidetector computed tomography (CT) may allow non invasive&#xD;
      visualization of the coronary tree. Indeed, 64-row CT has already showed its accuracy for the&#xD;
      screening of CAD in symptomatic patient in sinus rhythm. However, they are very few studies&#xD;
      in the setting of heart transplantation with small sample size and mainly using 16-row CT.&#xD;
      Only two small sample size studies (20 patients each) have been conducted using 64-row CT in&#xD;
      the setting of heart transplant recipients. None of them compared X-Ray and contrast iodine&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary aim is to compare the diagnostic accuracy value of the 64-row CT and 256-row CT&#xD;
      to the gold standard (conventional coronary angiogram) in the setting of CAD screening in a&#xD;
      large population of heart transplant recipients (= 110 pts). We make the assumption that the&#xD;
      sensitivity of CT is enough to allow switching the coronary angiogram by CT for the screening&#xD;
      of asymptomatic CAD in heart transplant recipients without CAD or with CAD not suitable for&#xD;
      revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan also to compare X-Ray and contrast agent exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the transplant heart patients systematically followed in the cardiovascular and thoracic&#xD;
      surgery service will be prospectively included. All the patients will sign the informed&#xD;
      consent, then CT will be performed 24 H before the coronary angiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      multidetector coronary computed tomography : The Electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography will be performed&#xD;
      with a 64 or 256-row CT Philips, Brilliance. The contrast medium (Iomeron*, ioméprol,&#xD;
      Bracco-Altana Pharma GmbH) mean quantity used is 80-100 ml. The CT scan parameters, adapted&#xD;
      to the patient's weight, include 120 kV, 800mA, 0.625 mm slice thickness, 0.42-s rotation&#xD;
      time and 0.2 pitch. To determine X-Ray exposure, Dose Length Product (Gycm) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the scan, the reconstruction will be performed at 40 and 75 % of the cycle using ECG&#xD;
      gating. Additional reconstructions at different phase can be performed in case of coronary&#xD;
      calcification or motion artefacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A semi quantitative analyse (N=normal, I=intermediate, S=stenosis) of coronary narrowing will&#xD;
      be performed blindly to coronary angiogram results by two experienced radiologists. The CT&#xD;
      quality will be determined using a quality scale (scale from 1 to 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Calcification score will also be determined. A segment analyse will be performed according&#xD;
      to AHA classification (17 segments model). Only more than 1.5 mm diameter vessel segments&#xD;
      will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary angiogram :&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to good practice, patients will receive 0.9 % saline serum intravenously at a dose&#xD;
      of 1000 ml per 12 H before and 1000 ml per 12 H after contrast medium injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary angiogram will be performed according to standard protocol, using radial access with&#xD;
      4 or 5 French sheath under continuous invasive survey of blood pressure and ECG monitoring.&#xD;
      The contrast medium quantity used (Hexabrix*, sodium and méglumine ioxaglate, Guerbet) as the&#xD;
      X-Ray dose era product (Gy.cm²) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative coronary analysis will be performed by two experienced interventional&#xD;
      cardiologists blind to the CT results. Significant stenosis is defined by a &gt; 50% vessel&#xD;
      narrowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum creatinine will be controlled the day before, the day after and 72 H after the coronary&#xD;
      angiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of the two techniques will be done by segments, by artery and by patients with&#xD;
      determination of the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of CT&#xD;
      for the screening of significant coronary stenosis (&gt; 50%). Statistical analysis will be made&#xD;
      with Statview 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical comity :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patient receive and sign an informed consent. The ethical comity (CPP Ile-de-France&#xD;
      VI) approves the protocol and the French Society of Cardiology supported the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Calendar :&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to perform the CT during systematic annual hospitalisation for invasive coronary&#xD;
      angiogram. In the cardiovascular department, approximately 8 patients benefit from coronary&#xD;
      angiogram per week. Thus we plan to include 110 patients within 30 months, taking in account&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria and the availability of both techniques.&#xD;
