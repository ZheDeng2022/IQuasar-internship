      The investigators hypothesize IXO chemotherapy will have an improvement in response rate and&#xD;
      acceptable toxicity for uncurable metastatic gastric cancer compared to historical controls.&#xD;

      This is a single arm, open-label, multicentre, phase II trial in which patients with&#xD;
      metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma will be treated with the combination of irinotecan,&#xD;
      capecitabine, and oxaliplatin (IXO).Patients will receive the combination of irinotecan,&#xD;
      capecitabine, and oxaliplatin at the recommended phase II dose and sequence determined by the&#xD;
      completed phase I trial. Patients will be treated on study until disease progression,&#xD;
      overwhelming toxicity, or consent withdrawal.&#xD;

             palliative systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic disease based on the presence of clinically and/or radiologically&#xD;
             documented measurable disease based on RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0,1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of least 3 months based on discretion of treating oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy or radiation delivered as part of&#xD;
             initial curative therapy (i.e. neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy administered alone&#xD;
             and/or concurrently delivered with radiation and/or surgery) are permitted as long as&#xD;
             that treatment was completed at least 6 months prior to study start date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior palliative radiotherapy (unless radiation was&#xD;
             curative therapy to pelvis or to ≥25% of bone marrow stores) if this radiation was ≥ 4&#xD;
             weeks before study entry and patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of&#xD;
             this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior surgery if this surgery was ≥ 4 weeks before study&#xD;
             entry and patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have the ability to read, understand, and sign an informed consent and&#xD;
             must be willing to comply with study treatment and follow-up.&#xD;

             anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Curative radiation treatment to the pelvis or radiation therapy to ≥ 25% of bone&#xD;
             marrow stores.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of physical integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract, malabsorption&#xD;

             metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous of concurrent malignancies, excluding curatively treated in situ carcinoma of&#xD;
             the cervix or non-melanoma skin cancer, unless at least 5 years have elapsed since&#xD;
             last treatment and the patient is considered cured.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious medical condition within 6 months prior to study entry such as myocardial&#xD;

             who have treated brain metastasis and are off steroids, anticonvulsants, and have&#xD;
             documented stability of lesions for at least 3 months may be eligible. A CT scan or&#xD;
             MRI is NOT required to rule out brain metastases unless there is clinical suspicion of&#xD;
             CNS involvement.&#xD;
