  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes and obesity are both multifactorial diseases resulting from gene-environment&#xD;
      interactions. However, this interaction, as well as the specific effect of each polymorphism,&#xD;
      remains poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We now proposed a prospective cohort study to improve our understanding of the influence of&#xD;
      phenotypic characteristics on gene expression in tissues involved in glucose and/or lipid&#xD;
      metabolism by collecting different biological samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a disease commonly associated with obesity, which is an important&#xD;
      risk factor for this condition. More than 80% of the diabetic subjects are obese. By analogy&#xD;
      with the metabolic syndrome, the close association between obesity and T2D justifies the&#xD;
      recognition of a new disease entity named by the neologism &quot;diabesity&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the contribution of different genetic variants on &quot;diabesity&quot;&#xD;
      development, by integrating multiple genomics approaches (linkage analysis on whole genome,&#xD;
      transcriptomics and bioinformatics) and analysis of biological pathways in relevant animals&#xD;
      models and humans.&#xD;
