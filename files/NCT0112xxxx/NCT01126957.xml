      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous drugs and combinations of drugs are used for procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA)&#xD;
      in Emergency Departments, including propofol, ketamine, benzodiazepines, narcotics,&#xD;
      barbiturates, and others, but propofol has gained popularity despite its potential to cause&#xD;
      cardiac and respiratory depression. Obviously the optimal agent or combination of agents has&#xD;
      not been identified. There are reasons to believe that a combination of ketamine and propofol&#xD;
      may have advantages over other agents/combinations. These include better hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability at equal depth of anesthesia with a combination of ketamine/propofol than with&#xD;
      propofol alone, less respiratory depression with the combination in comparison to propofol&#xD;
      alone, and preservation of respiratory drive with the combination. There is one study of&#xD;
      ketamine/propofol in Emergency Department (ED) procedural sedation which demonstrated the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of the combination, but did not compare it to any other agents or&#xD;
      combinations. The investigators designed a randomized, placebo controlled study to compare&#xD;
      propofol to propofol and ketamine for adequacy of sedation and respiratory depression in&#xD;
      Emergency Department procedural sedation and analgesia. The investigators hypothesis was that&#xD;
      the combination of propofol/ketamine would produce better sedation and/or less respiratory&#xD;
      depression than propofol alone.&#xD;

      ketamine/propofol in Emergency Department (ED) procedural sedation which demonstrated the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of the combination, but did not compare it to any other agents or&#xD;
      combinations. We designed a randomized, placebo controlled study to compare propofol to&#xD;
      propofol and ketamine for adequacy of sedation and respiratory depression in Emergency&#xD;
      Department procedural sedation and analgesia. Our hypothesis was that the combination of&#xD;
      propofol/ketamine would produce better sedation and/or less respiratory depression than&#xD;
      propofol alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a randomized, prospective, double-blinded study of all patients receiving&#xD;
      procedural sedation. From May 2007 until March 2009 in the ED of a 274 bed university&#xD;
      teaching hospital. The study was approved by the University of Missouri's Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board and informed consent was obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting and population&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients requiring PSA in the ED were viewed as potential subjects unless they were&#xD;
      pregnant, less than 1 year of age, history of prior adverse reaction to anesthesia,&#xD;
      underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease, hepatic dysfunction, porphyria, psychiatric illness,&#xD;
      allergy to eggs/soybeans, increased intracranial or intraocular pressure, abnormal airway&#xD;
      pathology or an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 3 or greater. The&#xD;
      attending ED physician would then approach the patient to enroll them in the study. If the&#xD;
      patient accepted they were randomized by the hospital pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ED attending physician was dedicated to PSA throughout the procedure. Patients had EKG,&#xD;
      blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2)&#xD;
      monitored, had IV access obtained and were placed on nasal cannula oxygen supplementation.&#xD;
      All patients received pre-procedure analgesia with 0.5 to 1.5 mcg/Kg of fentanyl and all&#xD;
      patients had reflective sunglasses placed so as to obscure eye movements from the staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomized by the pharmacy in blocks of ten. Consecutively numbered pre-filled&#xD;
      3cc syringes were prepared by the pharmacy staff once they received a signed and dated study&#xD;
      enrollment sheet from the ER staff with the patients weight in kilograms provided. All&#xD;
      physicians, nurses, patients and study personnel were blinded to the contents of the syringes&#xD;
      which were hand delivered by pharmacy personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized to receive either 0.5 mg/Kg of ketamine or placebo (normal saline)&#xD;
      delivered to the emergency room sedating physician in a 3 cc syringe containing a&#xD;
      clear/colorless solution. This solution was delivered intravenously over a one minute&#xD;
      infusion. On completion of this infusion all patients received propofol starting at 1 mg/Kg&#xD;
      over 2 minutes and supplemented with repeated boluses of 0.5 mg/Kg to maintain adequate&#xD;
      sedation. Patients were felt to be adequately sedated once they received a Colorado&#xD;
      Behavioral Numerical Pain Scale (CBNPS) score of 0 to 113(table 1.) Patients were monitored&#xD;
      after the procedure until a normal level of consciousness was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantity of all drugs delivered were recorded. During the procedure all patients were&#xD;
      monitored for 5 respiratory depression markers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PetCO2 rise of ³ 5 mm/Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory rate &lt; 8 br/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) &lt; 90%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apnea ³ 15 seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Airway manipulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians were permitted to intervene and provide any supportive/resuscitative measures at&#xD;
      there discretion despite the pre-specified respiratory depression markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data were collected and recorded on standardized Hospital PSA forms. Data was collected&#xD;
      for the entire time frame of the individual procedural sedations. Following the completion of&#xD;
      the procedural sedation a second form was filled out by both the sedating physician and&#xD;
      monitoring nurse recording specifically any respiratory events/rescue interventions and&#xD;
      overall satisfaction with the procedural sedation. The overall quality of the PSA was&#xD;
      evaluated by the physician/nurse performing the sedation as one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Not satisfied&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Somewhat satisfied&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Satisfied&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Very satisfied&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Excellent&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data was recorded on a secure computer in spreadsheet form (Microsoft Excel 2003,&#xD;
      Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) for later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four endpoints were defined prior to study initiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory Depression. A difference in evidence of respiratory depression between the&#xD;
      groups. Respiratory depression was defined as the occurrence of any of the 5 markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfaction with PSA. A difference in the evaluation of the quality of the sedation by the&#xD;
      providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of PSA. Number of patients with a CBNPS of 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol usage. Did the addition of ketamine significantly reduce the amount of propofol&#xD;
      needed to produce adequate PSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis We plan to enroll 100 patients in each group. This is based on an estimate of a&#xD;
      40% incidence of respiratory depression with propofol alone, a reduction to 20% with the&#xD;
      combination of ketamine/propofol, an a of 0.05 and a power of 0.8.14-16. An interim analysis&#xD;
      was conducted at enrollment of 100 patients using a significance of 0.025 for difference in&#xD;
      respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory depression and CBNPS were compared using a chi-squared test and Satisfaction with&#xD;
      PSA and Quality of PSA were compared using a t-test. Tests were done with Primer of&#xD;
      Biostatistics (Version 6.0, Stanton A. Glantz, 2005).&#xD;
