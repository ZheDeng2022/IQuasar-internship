      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile of intra-arterial temozolomide&#xD;
      administration during Isolated Limb Infusion (ILI) by defining the dose limiting toxicities&#xD;
      associated with this treatment. This study also aims to determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      of intra-arterial administration of temozolomide during ILI that will be used in a phase II&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

      1. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety profile of intra-arterial&#xD;
           temozolomide administration during Isolated Limb Infusion (ILI) by defining the dose&#xD;
           limiting toxicities associated with this treatment and to determine the maximum&#xD;
           tolerated dose of intra-arterial administration of temozolomide during ILI that will be&#xD;
           used in a phase II efficacy trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Population will include patients who have undergone a previous Melphalan based regional&#xD;
           therapy for which they did not respond optimally and present with persistent,&#xD;
           progressive, or recurrent disease. Study activities include tumor tissue sampling, blood&#xD;
           sampling, and subjects will undergo an Isolated Limb Infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To define both response in-field (area of the limb below the tourniquet) and&#xD;
           out-of-field (any area outside the tourniquet) in patients treated with temozolomide&#xD;
           based ILI. Response in this trial will be defined by the RECIST criteria (CR, PR, SD, PD&#xD;
           at 12 weeks post ILI). A CR rate of 20% would be considered as preliminary evidence of a&#xD;
           promising approach in this group of patients that have had a previous melphalan regional&#xD;
           treatment. ILI with melphalan has a complete response rate of approximately 35% in naïve&#xD;
           patients and 20% in patients who have previously received melphalan based regional&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess if the proposed treatment has any effect on quality of life as measured by the&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Melanoma.&#xD;

    <description>Dose level selection will proceed according to the modified Accelerated Titration Design. The starting dose will be TMZ 200mg/m2 x 0.09 BSA for the upper extremity and 200mg/m2 x 0.18 BSA for the lower extremity. We will enroll one-patient cohorts with dose doubling between cohorts until 1st occurrence of a ≥ CTC (Common Terminology Criteria) grade 2 adverse event. At that time, the present cohort and all future cohorts will be extended to enroll 3 to 6 patients.</description>
