             of 60 days or greater prior to enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             condition other than venous insufficiency (e.g., diabetes, malignant ulceration&#xD;
             [Marjolin's ulcer], vasculitis, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has evidence of current clinical infection although colonization is not an exclusion&#xD;

             treatments, as specified in study protocol, section 9.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suffers from a condition, other than venous insufficiency or venous hypertension&#xD;
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject&#xD;
             and/or the quality of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suffers from a condition, other than venous insufficiency or venous hypertension&#xD;
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would seriously interfere negatively with&#xD;
             the normal wound healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has laboratory values at screening outside ± 20% of the institution's normal range for&#xD;
             any parameter other than HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If laboratory values are outside ± 20% but the investigator deems the subject&#xD;
             acceptable for enrollment, the Principal Investigator may approve the inclusion of the&#xD;
             subject as long as there is no evidence of any comorbid condition where comorbidity&#xD;
             could influence the trialIs using any of the prohibited concomitant medications or&#xD;
             treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Wound surrounding skin not intact or has signs of active dermatitis or infection&#xD;
