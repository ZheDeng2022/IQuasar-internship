  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to primarily assess the efficacy of an intensified&#xD;
      chemotherapy consisting of a combination of FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab. The main focus will be&#xD;
      laid on the rate of patients who achieve secondary complete (R0)-resectable metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FOLFIRI + bevacizumab as well as the FOLFOXIRI regimens have been shown previously to be&#xD;
      both effective in the treatment of advanced CRC with having manageable toxicities. Therefore,&#xD;
      an intensified chemotherapy combining these two standard regimens might be a promising&#xD;
      therapeutic approach improving the treatment of metastatic disease and outcome of CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma of UICC stage IV, and liver and/or lung&#xD;
      metasta¬ses only, which are not optimally resectable, will be enrolled in this single-arm&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 4 cycles (=8 weeks) of chemo¬therapy prior to surgery is mandatory for all&#xD;
      patients. However, patients may withdraw from the study at any time upon their own request.&#xD;
      Treatment with preoperative chemothera¬py will continue until 2-4 weeks prior to surgery with&#xD;
      the last application of bevacizumab (only FOLFOXIRI) 4 weeks before surgery, at longest 16&#xD;
      cycles (= 32 weeks) for candidates not eli¬gible for surgery. Treatment will be discontinued&#xD;
      prematurely at disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary endpoints the acute and perioperative toxi¬city of preoperative chemotherapy&#xD;
      according to NCI CTCAE v 3.0 including all peri-and post-surgical complications as well as&#xD;
      progression free survival and overall survival and quality of life will be assessed.&#xD;
