    <textblock>
      1. Interscalene continuous catheter is a very effective way of controlling pain in total&#xD;
           shoulder arthroplasty. To ensure proper placement, nerve stimulating catheter is quite&#xD;
           often used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ultrasound can help proper placement of catheter without relying on nerve stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The plan of the study is to compare two techniques head to head to see if they are&#xD;
           equally effective or one is better than others.&#xD;

      After consent patients will be randomized to one of the two groups: Control Group or the&#xD;
      Experimental Group. Patients will be blinded to the group assignment. As both catheters are&#xD;
      placed using almost the same technique, the subjects will be unable to tell type of catheter&#xD;
      they will be getting..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every procedure will be done after starting intravenous access and placing standard&#xD;
      anesthesia monitors (EKG, Blood Pressure Cuff and Pulse-Ox) on the patients. For comfort care&#xD;
      sedation will be titrated using accepted American Society of Anesthesiology and American&#xD;
      society of Regional Anesthesia Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Control Group the patient will have interscalene catheter placed using nerve&#xD;
      stimulation technique. Initially ultrasound guidance will be used to visualize brachial&#xD;
      plexus at the cricoid level with the intent to visualize upper trunks or roots. Then&#xD;
      following established guidelines a nerve stimulating catheter will be placed. This will be&#xD;
      done using an ARROW NERVE KIT. The kit is FAD approved for this purpose.. Following accepted&#xD;
      aseptic guidelines the nerves will be visualized at the base of the neck using ultrasound&#xD;
      machine. Once proper nerve roots or trunks visualized, kit provided 17gauge insulated Touhy&#xD;
      needle will be used to access the brachial plexus. Once twitches elicited in Deltoid, biceps&#xD;
      or triceps muscles at 0.5 mamp, catheter will be threaded via the needle while maintaining&#xD;
      twitch at 0.5 mamp or less. Once catheter is threaded 3 cm beyond the tip, Touhy needle will&#xD;
      be removed. Catheter will be tested for proper placement using lidocaine and epinephrine as&#xD;
      is recommended by Regional Anesthesia Society guidelines. Thereafter 3 mg/kg of 0.5 %&#xD;
      bupivacaine will be injected in small blouses via the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Experimental Group, after placement of monitors, the nerves will be visualized using&#xD;
      ultrasound machine. Once nerve visualized at the cricoids level, proper tip of Touhy needle&#xD;
      will be guided using hydro-dissection technique. Once in good place, catheter will be&#xD;
      threaded 3 cm into the space. They subjects will be dosed using 0.5% bupivacaine 3 mg/kg for&#xD;
      the surgery via the catheter. Adequacy of catheter placement will be judged by examining the&#xD;
      spread of local anesthetics around the plexus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extent of block before the surgery will be evaluated at 30 minutes post injection.&#xD;
      Surgery will be done with sedation. Conversion of anesthetic technique to general anesthesia&#xD;
      will be considered failure of the technique to provide adequate surgical anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the case the patient will be taken to recovery and will be evaluated for pain.&#xD;
      If patient is having pain of 3 or more then they will be treated as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each catheter group patient will be dosed with 10 ml 1% lidocaine. If it fails to provide&#xD;
      any relief then the catheter will be pulled back and another 10 ml1% lidocaine will be given.&#xD;
      If still not effective then it will be replaced. Refusal of patient to replace the catheter&#xD;
      will result in pt dropping out of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working catheter will be left in place for at least 48 hrs. Patients will be allowed to take&#xD;
      oral pain medicines as prescribed by their surgeons. The patient will be sent home with pain&#xD;
      pump to continuously give them 0.125% bupivacaine at 5 ml per hr with an option to get extra&#xD;
      dose of 5 ml every one hr if needed. The pain control will be monitored while in-house and by&#xD;
      phone daily till catheter comes out.&#xD;
