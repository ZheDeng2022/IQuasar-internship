  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this Proof of Concept study is to determine the therapeutic potential of the&#xD;
      L19SIP antibody, labeled with the radionuclide 131I in combination with external beam&#xD;
      radiation, for the treatment of patients with multiple brain metastases following the&#xD;
      promising results with this agent in previous clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The L19SIP antibody is a fully human antibody, capable of preferential localization around&#xD;
      tumor blood vessels while sparing normal tissues. The formation of new blood vessels is a&#xD;
      rare event in the adult (exception made for the female reproductive cycle), but is a&#xD;
      pathological feature in most aggressive types of cancer. The presented study follows a Phase&#xD;
      I and a subsequent Phase I/II dose finding and efficacy study with the same agent in patients&#xD;
      with a variety of cancers where 131I-L19SIP had shown an excellent tolerability and&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit for some patients enrolled in the study.&#xD;
