    <textblock>
      The accurate detection and therapy of adenocarcinoma originating from Barrett's oesophagus is&#xD;
      challenging as current endoscopic techniques are unreliable for both the detection of high&#xD;
      grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) within Barrett's mucosa and the correct measurement of&#xD;
      the dimension of such neoplastic lesions. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a promising&#xD;
      technology that could help to close this gap. Relying on first clinical trials of CLE, which&#xD;
      showed remarkable results for the detection of Barrett's associated neoplasia, the&#xD;
      investigators want to use CLE as targeting tool for endoscopic mucosal resection of HGIN in&#xD;
      patients suffering from Barrett's oesophagus. CLE-mapping of neoplastic lesions will be&#xD;
      documented and compared to the later performed histological evaluation of the resected&#xD;
      specimen. If CLE is passing our challenge this will be another valuable proof of its high&#xD;
      potential as reliable new endoscopic technology. Its usage could increase the en-bloc&#xD;
      resection rate and decrease the amount of repetitive resections, which would remarkably&#xD;
      improve the patients comfort.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barrett's oesophagus is a common complication in patients suffering from gastro-oesophageal&#xD;
      reflux disease (GERD). By means of chronic acid exposure the squamous epithelium of the&#xD;
      oesophagus turns into a specialised columnar epithelium (SCE) with goblet cells. This&#xD;
      histological change is prevalent in 1% of the normal population, and in up to 4, 9% of&#xD;
      patients with reflux symptoms [1]. Although the Barrett's epithelium itself does not&#xD;
      necessarily cause additional symptoms, its presence has to be diagnosed accurately, since&#xD;
      affected patients are at increased risk of 0.5% per year of developing Barrett's associated&#xD;
      cancer. An important prognostic factor is made up by the grade of dysplasia within the&#xD;
      Barrett's mucosa. While most patients with no dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia remain&#xD;
      clinically inconspicuous, the annual risk of developing cancer is up to 10% in those patients&#xD;
      with high-grade dysplasia. If a Barrett's associated neoplastic lesion is found during&#xD;
      endoscopy, Barrett's associated cancer is also present at another site of Barrett's&#xD;
      oesophagus in up to 30% [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, they undergo periodically screening, consisting of endoscopy of the oesophagus&#xD;
      with 4-quadrant biopsy every 2 to 3 cm or, in case of HGIN, local ablative therapy. The time&#xD;
      period between controls depends on the grade of dysplasia diagnosed at upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy. If no dysplasia is present, the recommended follow-up period is less than 5 years.&#xD;
      In case of low grade dysplasia endoscopic controls should be performed every year. Patients&#xD;
      with high grade dysplasia should be examined every 3 months or prepared for a therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection of Barrett's associated neoplasms, which can be histologically classified as&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma, has important therapeutic implications. Cancerous infiltration of submucosal&#xD;
      structures is associated with a significant risk of lymph node metastases and should be&#xD;
      therefore treated by surgery. However, oesophagectomy has been shown to suffer from mortality&#xD;
      rates between 3 and 12%, apart from substantial short- and long-term morbidity. Hence it is&#xD;
      essential to detect early neoplastic lesions to have a broader range of therapeutic options&#xD;
      at disposal. Patients with high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or mucosal cancer are&#xD;
      perfect candidates for curative endoscopic interventions like endoscopic ablation (with&#xD;
      radiofrequency, for example), endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) or endoscopic mucosal&#xD;
      resection (EMR). The latter techniques are preferred as the resected specimens can be&#xD;
      evaluated histologically, which provides definite information about the invasion depth and&#xD;
      whether the resection borders are free from neoplastic tissue. Because of high rates of newly&#xD;
      occurring neoplasia, remaining areas of Barrett's mucosa should be ablated or resected after&#xD;
      histological confirmation of Barrett's oesophagus associated neoplasia [3, 4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trying to improve the diagnostic yield in the surveillance of patients with high risk for&#xD;
      Barrett's oesophagus associated neoplasia, many new endoscopic inventions have been&#xD;
      introduced into the management of Barrett's oesophagus in order to optimize the detection&#xD;
      rates of early lesions. Among those are developments that improved the image quality of&#xD;
      conventional white light endoscopes like high-resolution and high-definition endoscopes.&#xD;
      Another approach, called chromoendoscopy, uses in vivo staining with methylene blue, indigo&#xD;
      carmine or acetic acid. These dyes help to increase the tissue contrast which leads to&#xD;
      improvement of detection rates comparable to high-resolution endoscopy. High contrast levels&#xD;
      without staining agents can be achieved by the use of narrow band imaging (NBI). This&#xD;
      technology additionally improves the visibility of capillaries, veins and other subtle tissue&#xD;
      structures by the use of light with wavelength restricted to small bands in the blue and&#xD;
      green spectrum. In a prospective randomized crossover study it showed equal results to&#xD;
      high-resolution endoscopy plus indigo carmine [4, 5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newest development that has been introduced in the endoscopic management of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract is the so called confocal laser endomicroscope (CLE). Confocal&#xD;
      microscopy was developed by Marvin Minsky in the late 1950s. Its principle is the microscopic&#xD;
      scanning of focal points below the surface of an object. In comparison to conventional light&#xD;
      microscopy it uses a special filter system to avoid image overlapping by surrounding tissue.&#xD;
      In detail, a light source (normally a laser) is focused by a microscope objective lens to a&#xD;
      diffraction limited spot on or inside the object. Light that is scattered, or fluorescence&#xD;
      excited (achieved through fluorescein staining, for example) and emitted, at the focus in the&#xD;
      sample will partially return back through the optics along the path from which it arrived. A&#xD;
      beam-splitter placed into the path reflects the return light towards a detector. The optics&#xD;
      will focus the light from the focal point in the specimen to its conjugate focus near the&#xD;
      detector (hence the technology is termed &quot;con-focal&quot;). Here a spatial filter (&quot;pinhole&quot;) is&#xD;
      used to extinguish all light deriving from areas outside the focal point. Light reflections&#xD;
      from the focal point itself will be forwarded to the detector which is connected to a&#xD;
      computer system that digitalises the optical signal and creates the in vivo histological&#xD;
      image [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focussing on its clinical impact, confocal microscopy is the first technique to allow in vivo&#xD;
      evaluation of tissue structures beneath their surface. Because of many breakthroughs in&#xD;
      miniaturisation (mostly in the 1990s) this technology could be applied for intraluminal use&#xD;
      in gastroenterology, integrated into a otherwise standard endoscope. It allows the in vivo&#xD;
      histological visualisation of the upper 250 micrometers of all walls within the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, additionally to the normal function of white light endoscopy&#xD;
      (provided by two separate screens on top of the workstation) [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using CLE in a first clinical approach, Kiesslich et al. found high sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity rates for the detection of Barrett's oesophagus as well as for the prediction of&#xD;
      Barrett's associated neoplastic changes - for both results CLE derived pictures were compared&#xD;
      to conventional histology [7]. In a first prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled,&#xD;
      crossover trial Dunbar et al. proved these findings, as CLE-targeted biopsies had a higher&#xD;
      diagnostic yield for Barrett's oesophagus associated neoplasia than standard endoscopy with&#xD;
      4-quadrant random biopsy [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our clinical investigation we want to use confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) to&#xD;
      accurately target Barrett's oesophagus associated neoplasia for subsequent endoscopic mucosal&#xD;
      resection (EMR). To our knowledge this combination is only documented in one case report so&#xD;
      far, describing the successful resection of a high-grade dysplastic Barrett-segment by the&#xD;
      use of CLE-targeted EMR [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to show that CLE is suitable to detect the exact borders of high grade&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia. In our experience this feasibility cannot be reliably provided by&#xD;
      any other established technique like chromoendoscopy or narrow band imaging, which often&#xD;
      causes the need for re-treatment or even surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To guarantee accurate documentation of mucosal CLE-mapping, the dimensions of the neoplastic&#xD;
      lesion will be marked in terms of colour, photographed by simultaneously available white&#xD;
      light endoscopy and finally evaluated by histological assessment of the specimen. Analysing&#xD;
      the borders of the resected specimen in concern of tumour infiltration we will be able to&#xD;
      calculate the en-bloc resection rate of CLE-targeted EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate CLE concerning true negative results we will resect all remaining&#xD;
      mucosal areas affected by Barrett within the second phase of the examination or (if the&#xD;
      lesions are too big for one-time resection) within a second examination. Once again, CLE will&#xD;
      be applied for all lesions to search for malignancies. If CLE detects further areas of&#xD;
      neoplasia, CLE-mapping as mentioned above will be performed. All resected tissue parts will&#xD;
      be evaluated histologically to check the results of CLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If CLE provides reliable data in our investigation this would be a big step on the way to&#xD;
      establishing this new technology within the pre-interventional endoscopic management of&#xD;
      patients suffering from Barrett's oesophagus. This could help to increase the en-bloc&#xD;
      resection rate, decrease the amount of repetitive resections and consequentially improve the&#xD;
      patients comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective clinical trial without randomisation or blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred to our department for endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of Barrett's&#xD;
      mucosa with high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) that has been detected during routine&#xD;
      upper endoscopy or Barrett's surveillance endoscopy at our department or at another hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients allergic to one of the drug components (including drugs used for conscious&#xD;
           sedation like propofol or midazolam as well as fluorescein, the fluorescent dye used for&#xD;
           CLE )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients presenting with contraindications to EMR (low platelet count, therapeutic&#xD;
           anticoagulation, coagulation disorders)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  refusal to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our investigation will be performed at the Medical University of Vienna, department of&#xD;
      medicine III, clinical division of gastroenterology and hepatology. Patient recruitment will&#xD;
      start on the 1st of July 2010. The study will last for two years. The number of patients&#xD;
      included within this period will be 40, based on the current number of EMR performed at our&#xD;
      department for Barrett's with intraepithelial neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who fulfil the listed inclusion criteria, will receive the patient information&#xD;
      form of this study together with the usual informed consent form of the respective endoscopic&#xD;
      examination they are about to undergo. Patient information will be done at least 24 hrs.&#xD;
      before the intervention, as practised at our unit. If the patient agrees to participate in&#xD;
      the study he will be prepared for endoscopy with our confocal laser endomicroscope (Pentax&#xD;
      EC3870K with the ISC-1000 confocal endomicroscopy processor - Pentax, Tokyo, Japan and&#xD;
      Optiscan Pty Ltd, Notting Hill, Victoria, Australia) by administration of intravenous&#xD;
      propofol and/or midazolam as routinely used for conscious sedation during endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures at our department. Additionally, 5-10 ml of a 10% solution of fluorescein sodium&#xD;
      will be administered intravenously to enhance tissue fluorescence during endomicroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All drugs will be administered by medical specialists (such as the project director),&#xD;
      assistant doctors (such as the project assistant) or registered nurses, as routinely&#xD;
      practised at our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical implications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confocal laser endomicroscopy is a safe new technique that has already been studied in&#xD;
      clinical trials [7, 8]. Its safety is being guaranteed by the use of low intensity laser&#xD;
      light that can at worst cause local bleaching of fluorescein containing cells, which is&#xD;
      harmless, reversible and even used as diagnostic sign in experimental conditions [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic mucosal resection is a well established technique for the minimal invasive,&#xD;
      non-surgical curative treatment of intramucosal neoplasia. It has been studied in many&#xD;
      clinical trials and is routinely performed at our unit for lesions in the oesoophagus, the&#xD;
      stomach, duodenum and colo-rectum. Although severe complications like prolonged bleeding or&#xD;
      perforations can potentially occur, the risk/benefit profile of this procedure is very good,&#xD;
      compared to surgical treatments of neoplastic diseases of the oesophagus [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study protocol has been submitted to the ethic commission of the Medical University of&#xD;
      Vienna (EK-Nr. 697/2009) and was handled at the meeting on the 8th of September 2009. A&#xD;
      positive vote was already delivered to our institution in written form.&#xD;
