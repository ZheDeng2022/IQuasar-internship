  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A protein called HIF is believed to be involved both in forming cancers and helping them to&#xD;
      grow after they are formed. EZN-2968 is a new type of cancer drug that goes into the cancer&#xD;
      cell and switches off the production of the HIF protein. Researchers are interested in&#xD;
      testing EZN-2968 in people who have liver cancer because studies have shown that this drug&#xD;
      travels to the liver and stays there when the drug is given through a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the safety and effectiveness of EZN-2968 on liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with liver cancer that has&#xD;
      not responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an initial screening visit with a physical examination, blood and&#xD;
           urine tests, and imaging studies to assess tumor size. Tumor biopsies may also be taken&#xD;
           for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an undefined number of 6-week treatment cycles of EZN-2968, given&#xD;
           once a week for 3 weeks followed by 3 weeks without the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During each cycle, participants will have additional blood tests and imaging scans to&#xD;
           assess tumor response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycles of treatment with EZN-2968 may continue until the treatment is not effective,&#xD;
           illness requires participants to stop taking the study drug, or the participant chooses&#xD;
           to withdraw from the study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) facilitates the adaptation of normal and tumor tissue&#xD;
           to oxygen deprivation. HIF-1 is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells, where it is&#xD;
           involved in the upregulation of many gene products essential for invasion, migration,&#xD;
           angiogenesis, and survival, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).&#xD;
           Blocking HIF-1 activity inhibits the expression of VEGF, resulting in the inhibition of&#xD;
           tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EZN-2968 is an antisense oligonucleotide that specifically targets HIF-1 alpha, one of&#xD;
           the subunits of HIF-1. Safety and preliminary suggestion of activity have been&#xD;
           demonstrated in two Phase I trials; one patient with hepatocellular carcinoma, one with&#xD;
           renal cell cancer, and one with angiosarcoma of the face treated with EZN-2968 had&#xD;
           objective evidence of shrinkage of large masses. In vivo data show evidence of&#xD;
           intracellular uptake of EZN-2968 into tumor cells, and in the Phase I trial, preliminary&#xD;
           data show that eleven patients had prolonged stable disease (&gt;90 days duration on&#xD;
           study), three of which had objective evidence of tumor shrinkage, thus demonstrating&#xD;
           proof of principle for this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Determine the modulation of HIF-1alpha mRNA in tumor biopsies pre- and post-administration&#xD;
      of EZN-2968.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety of EZN-2968 in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the modulation of HIF-1 alpha protein levels in tumor biopsies pre- and&#xD;
           post-administration of EZN-2968.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate anti-tumor response as determined by RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the expression of HIF-1 alpha target genes by real-time PCR in tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess tumor angiogenesis using DCE-MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed solid malignancies will be&#xD;
           included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have failed at least one line of prior therapy for metastatic disease or&#xD;
           have a disease for which no standard curative therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lesion must be amenable to biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EZN-2968 will be administered as a 2-hour IV infusion at a dose of 18 mg/kg once a week&#xD;
           for 3 consecutive weeks followed by a 3-week period without drug. Each cycle will be 6&#xD;
           weeks, i.e., 3 weeks of therapy followed by 3 weeks without drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsies and other correlative imaging and pharmacodynamic studies will be&#xD;
           performed at baseline and after the third dose. Tumor restaging will be performed every&#xD;
           2 cycles.&#xD;

        -  Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor.&#xD;
             The diagnosis should be confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease must be amenable to biopsy, and patients must be willing to undergo tumor&#xD;
             biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have failed at least one line of prior therapy for metastatic disease or&#xD;
             have a disease for which no standard curative therapy exists. Prior anti-angiogenic&#xD;
             therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age (Bullet)18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available&#xD;
             on the use of EZN-2968 in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study but will be eligible for future pediatric trials, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2 (Karnofsky (Bullet)60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        absolute neutrophil count (Bullet)1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
        platelets (Bullet)100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
        total bilirubin 1.5 X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        AST/ALT 2.5 X institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        creatinine clearance (measured) greater than or equal to 60 mL/minute for patients with&#xD;
        creatinine levels &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        INR 1.4&#xD;
&#xD;
        PTT 40 seconds unless due to lupus anticoagulant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urine protein should be screened by urine analysis for urine protein:creatinine (UPC)&#xD;
             ratio. For UPC ratio &gt;1, 24-hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should&#xD;
             be &lt;500 mg for patient enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of EZN-2968 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (abstinence; female use of hormonal methods, or barrier methods of birth control; male&#xD;
             use of a condom) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and&#xD;
             for 6 months after completion of study. Because there is a risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with EZN- 2968, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued while the patient is on this trial and for&#xD;
&#xD;
             30 days after completion of treatment on this trial. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to undergo tumor biopsies for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events to eligibility levels (by performance status and&#xD;
             laboratory criteria outlined above) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks&#xD;
             earlier. Patients may have received investigational agent(s) as part of a Phase 0&#xD;
             study (also referred to as an early Phase I study or pre-Phase I study where a&#xD;
             sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the PI's discretion, up to 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
             Patients whose brain metastatic disease status remains stable for (Bullet) 3 months&#xD;
             after treatment of the brain metastases without steroids or antiseizure medications&#xD;
             may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring therapeutic anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertension not controlled by medical therapy (hypertension defined as systolic blood&#xD;
             pressure &gt;150 mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg despite optimal medical&#xD;
             management).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to EZN-2968.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements. A history of hepatitis is allowed if, following consultation with&#xD;
             Liver Diseases Branch, it is felt to be clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because EZN-2968 has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             EZN-2968, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with EZN-2968.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with EZN-2968.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with surgical non-healing wounds. Patients with other non-healing wounds will&#xD;
             be evaluated and included at the PI s discretion if considered minor.&#xD;
