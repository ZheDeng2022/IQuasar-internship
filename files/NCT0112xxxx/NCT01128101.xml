    <textblock>
      Several studies indicate that chronic kidney disease patients give a high cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      and have an intrinsic relationship with hypertension and cardiomyopathy: characterized by&#xD;
      left ventricular hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. The reversal of left ventricular&#xD;
      hypertrophy is associated with increased life expectancy in these patients. The renin&#xD;
      angiotensin aldosterone system plays an important role in blood pressure control. Even&#xD;
      patients using converting enzyme inhibitors inhibitors or angiotensin II blockers may&#xD;
      experience the so called aldosterone breakthrough phenomenon (inappropriately called&#xD;
      aldosterone escape). This phenomenon is documented in patients with heart disease and in&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease. Spironolactone is a synthetic steroid that acts as an antagonist of&#xD;
      aldosterone, which has historically avoided in chronic kidney disease patients, given the&#xD;
      risk of hyperkalemia. However, its active metabolite, canrenone and spironolactone, are able&#xD;
      to antagonize the binding of ouabain, a Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor, to its receptor. The&#xD;
      Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition results in changes in sodium gradients, and increases the calcium&#xD;
      influx through the transporter Na+/Ca+ in specific regions of the membrane. Spironolactone&#xD;
      and canrenone in previous research were able to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy in&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease patients on conservative treatment, which turn this drug and its&#xD;
      metabolite potential tools for reversion of left ventricular hypertrophy in chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease. The aim of this study is to verify the safety, tolerability and efficacy in the&#xD;
      reversal of target organ damage from the use of spironolactone added to conventional&#xD;
      antihypertensive therapy in chronic kidney disease patients on hemodialysis, in addition to&#xD;
      measuring its ability to reduce left ventricular hypertrophy and arterial stiffness indices.&#xD;
      Interventional randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comprising two groups: one&#xD;
      that will take 25mg of spironolactone associated with conventional antihypertensive therapy&#xD;
      and another that will take spironolactone placebo associated with conventional&#xD;
      antihypertensive therapy. Each group will consist of 30 patients. Clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      investigations, as well as home monitoring of blood pressure, echocardiography, determination&#xD;
      of pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, and central blood pressure measurement of serum&#xD;
      aldosterone will be are evaluated before and after treatment that will last 12 months.&#xD;

      Materials and Methods: will be conducted an interventional, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study. The series will consist of patients with at least 18 years old,&#xD;
      suffering from chronic kidney disease stage V on dialysis and mean residential blood pressure&#xD;
      superior to 135 x 85 mm Hg with left ventricular mass indexed for height to the 2.7 power&#xD;
      greater than 51 g/m2,7. This protocol follows the guidelines of resolution 196/96 of the&#xD;
      Brazilian National Health Council and is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of&#xD;
      Medicine of Botucatu - UNESP Protocol (CEP 3439-2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will give informed consent in writing. Exclusion criteria will be thew&#xD;
      following: history or evidence of angina or myocardial infarction, heart failure, peripheral&#xD;
      vascular disease, Hyperkalemia, valvular disease, atrial fibrillation, anemia (hemoglobin &lt;10&#xD;
      g / dl) doses of parathyroid hormone (PTH) greater than 300 pg / mL, patients in treatment&#xD;
      with spironolactone and Patients who have suspended or initiated the use of inhibitors of&#xD;
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and renin blockers in&#xD;
      the last six months. Patients will be assessed at baseline (before the run-in phase), weekly&#xD;
      in the first month and monthly thereafter until one year, or 52 weeks. Will be include&#xD;
      clinical examination at each visit and laboratory tests. In the visits of weeks zero, 26 and&#xD;
      52 will be held monitoring home blood pressure, echocardiography, determining the of pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity, central arterial pressure and augmentation index. Aldosterone an ouabaín will&#xD;
      be monitored immediately before run-in fase and at 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups: Patients will be randomly divided into two groups: active drug and placebo groups.&#xD;
      One group will receive spironolactone and the other placebo spironolactone. It is important&#xD;
      to note that placebo therapy is only of spironolactone and not other anti-hypertensive drugs,&#xD;
      so patients will not in any way deprived of the benefit established in the literature which&#xD;
      is the reduction of blood pressure. Physicians' assistants enrolled will be free to prescribe&#xD;
      any antihypertensive medication except the study drug. In the active treatment group, the&#xD;
      dose employed will be 25 mg each other day and titrated to 25 mg daily according to the&#xD;
      potassium. Patients with potassium between 5.5 and 5.9 mmol/L will have reduced&#xD;
      spironolactone to 25 mg each other day if they are in use 25 mg daily or will not increase&#xD;
      the dose. These patients receive pharmaceutical care and nutritional guidance according the&#xD;
      routine of the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo group will receive placebo with the same protocol. These patients also receive&#xD;
      pharmaceutical care and nutritional guidance, beyond any conventional antihypertensive&#xD;
      treatment. The pharmaceutical form of placebo will consist of colloidal silicon dioxide,&#xD;
      cornstarch, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate, inert&#xD;
      excipients according to reference literature. The pharmaceutical form of the active drug will&#xD;
      consist of spironolactone 25 mg and the other components of the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laboratory tests will be performed as routine in our dialysis unit, which follow the&#xD;
      rules of operation of hemodialysis established by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, as&#xD;
      follows: blood samples are collected immediately before the start of hemodialysis for routine&#xD;
      hematology (red blood cells, platelets white blood cell count) and biochemical (urea,&#xD;
      creatinine, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and venous blood&#xD;
      gas) monthly. Will be held quarterly glycosylated hemoglobin for diabetics, total proteins&#xD;
      and fractions, alkaline phosphatase, transferrin, serum iron, ferritin, C-reactive protein,&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone and lipid levels, the dosage of uric acid is each six months and aluminum&#xD;
      will be annual. Measurement of plasma renin, aldosterone, angiotensin II and ouabaín will be&#xD;
      held at time zero and after 52 weeks. Urine collections in 24 hours will be obtained for&#xD;
      measurement of residual urea clearance and calculation of protein nitrogen appearance in&#xD;
      weeks zero, 26 and 52. Will be collected monthly samples of urine after dialysis for&#xD;
      determination of fractional clearance of urea (dialysis dose) that will be determined by the&#xD;
      Daugirdas's formula (1995). Prior to collecting samples for measurement of plasma renin, the&#xD;
      patient should be 2 h in the supine position (stabilization of serum and standardization of&#xD;
      interpretation of results).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for determination of potassium will be collected weekly in the first four&#xD;
      weeks, fortnightly during the second month and thereafter will be held monthly dosages. All&#xD;
      antihypertensive medications will be maintained and titrated according to patients' needs to&#xD;
      achieve the target of 135x85 mm Hg in residential blood pressure monitoring. Criteria for&#xD;
      suspension therapy: patients are withdrawn from the protocol if develop severe hyperkalemia,&#xD;
      defined as one serum potassium concentration equal or superior than 6.5 mmol/L in an isolated&#xD;
      or repeated measures equal to or greater than 6.0 mmol/L. Each death will be analyzed by an&#xD;
      independent committee and in the event of a statistical difference in the mortality of active&#xD;
      drug compared to placebo, the work will be suspended immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography: The procedure for echocardiography will be performed according to&#xD;
      previously standardized technique. The following data are recorded: heart rate, systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic pressures obtained during the examination, systolic and diastolic dimensions of&#xD;
      left ventricular posterior wall thickness and septum, internal dimensions of left atrium and&#xD;
      aorta, stroke volume, ejection time of LV peak mitral flow velocity (E), peak velocity of&#xD;
      atrial filling (A), deceleration time of E wave; slope of the deceleration ramp of the E wave&#xD;
      and isovolumic relaxation time. These data will be used to calculate the relative thickness&#xD;
      of the left ventricle, the left atrium/aortic diameter, left ventricular mass index, left&#xD;
      ventricular mass, fractional shortening of the ventricular diameter, meridian end-systolic&#xD;
      stress, cardiac output index, heart rate, left ventricular stroke work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home monitoring of blood pressure: will be conducted with equipment validated by the BHS and&#xD;
      AAMI (Omron model HEM 781 INT). Patients will receive guidance to carry out three&#xD;
      measurements in the morning upon waking and fasting and three measures at bedtime during a&#xD;
      week exempting Saturday and Sunday. The measures will be undertaken with the patient seated,&#xD;
      back supported, arm at heart level, the forearm in the supine position. Will use the upper&#xD;
      limb that showed the highest blood pressure measurement in the office, except if the patient&#xD;
      has vascular access in one of the arms which will require taking the measurements in the&#xD;
      contralateral arm. The patient will be instructed to not perform measurements of any other&#xD;
      person with the same apparatus. After one week the patient will bring the unit back and the&#xD;
      device memory will be analyzed. Will be taken as representative value of the average home&#xD;
      blood pressure of all valid measurements, except for the first day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse wave velocity, central arterial blood pressure and augmentation index will be performed&#xD;
      by applanation tonometry. The patient should be fasting on exam day and will remain at rest&#xD;
      for five minutes before the start. The analysis of PWV will be held simultaneously with&#xD;
      checking blood pressure. Begins the reading with the placement of the forearm without&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula on support equipment, palpation to the radial artery and apply the&#xD;
      tonometer sensor. The corresponding central waveform is generated by the use of a validated&#xD;
      transfer function (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia). Will be collected waves&#xD;
      pulse for 10 seconds at least twice, which will be recorded directly on a laptop. After at&#xD;
      least 20 recorded waveforms, the average of peripheral, as well as their corresponding&#xD;
      central, and also an average of measurements of systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The sample size of 24 patients in each group (active drug and placebo&#xD;
      groups) is sufficient to detect a difference of 15g/m2 in left ventricular mass index with&#xD;
      standard deviation of the differences estimated in 23g/m2, statistical power of 0.8 and p&#xD;
      &lt;0.05. However, as the expected mortality of up to 20% per year, the total sample is&#xD;
      comprised of 30 patients in each group. The results will be quantified and analyzed&#xD;
      descriptively, initially through the observation of minimum and maximum values, and the&#xD;
      calculation of averages and their standard deviations. To investigate the behavior of groups,&#xD;
      will be used the techniques of analysis of variance parametric and nonparametric, followed by&#xD;
      a posteriorly tests appropriate to the characteristics of each variable evaluated.&#xD;
