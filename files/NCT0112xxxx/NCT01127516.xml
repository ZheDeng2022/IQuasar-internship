  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this investigation is that rate of isolation of resistant nosocomial&#xD;
      pathogens can be explained by a combination of measures that include, among other things,&#xD;
      antimicrobial drug use, infection control efforts, patient mix and antimicrobial stewardship&#xD;
      efforts. The short term goal of this investigation is to improve our understanding of the&#xD;
      relationships between antimicrobial stewardship program efforts (and actual antimicrobial&#xD;
      drug use), and infection control efforts to the incidence rates of MSSA, MRSA, h-VISA and&#xD;
      SA-MICcreep. The long term goal of this investigation is to design interventions that will&#xD;
      improve antimicrobial drug use and decrease cross-transmission of resistant bacteria,&#xD;
      resulting in a decrease in the rates of infection caused resistant hospital organisms.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to survey clinical pharmacists, infectious diseases practitioners and clinical&#xD;
      microbiologists at these 53 hospitals during the summer of 2009 to characterize the hospital&#xD;
      policy toward isolation of SA-MICcreep and to investigate the relationship of SA-MICcreep to&#xD;
      vancomycin use. Specifically, we will determine (1) if the hospital attempts to isolate&#xD;
      SA-MICcreep (2) the method(s) of testing SA susceptibility to vancomycin, (3) interpretative&#xD;
      criteria for MICs to vancomycin and whether there is a policy toward differential treatment&#xD;
      of isolated with SA-MICcreep. In addition we will determine (1) the relationship of&#xD;
      SA-MICcreep to vancomycin use and (2) the relationship to other hospital and patient&#xD;
      demographics to SA-MICcreep. A pilot study (Dec. 2008) found that 7 of 8 hospitals surveyed&#xD;
      do determine the vancomycin MIC for Staphylococcus aureus. However the interpretation of&#xD;
      these findings, and the action taken, differ between hospitals. This may be because this is a&#xD;
      newly described phenomenon, and professional organizations have not yet issued guidelines&#xD;
      regarding the interpretation of these isolates (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have measured vancomycin use by the following methods at each hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days of therapy/1000 patient days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean duration of vancomycin therapy (days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of adult patients who receive vancomycin (%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vancomycin &quot;Intensity Index&quot;: The product of #2 and #3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also measure the use of other antibacterial drugs that are used to treat infections&#xD;
      caused by Staphylococcus aureus including linezolid and daptomycin as these drugs may reduce&#xD;
      the isolation of SA-MICcreep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey instrument will include requests for the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Does the clinical microbiology laboratory make an attempt to identify MIC creep for&#xD;
      clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus?&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If yes, when did this policy begin?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are all Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested (i.e., MSSA and MRSA) or only MRSA?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are all clinical isolated routinely tested, or only selected isolates (e.g., only by&#xD;
           request from ID, or only blood isolates, or only isolates from ICU patients, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What method(s) is used to determine the MIC to vancomycin?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What MIC is thought to warrant concern? (e.g., 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 mcg/ml) ?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What action, if any, is taken as a function of the MIC to vancomycin?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Is &quot;more aggressive&quot; therapy with vancomycin attempted if an isolate of concern is&#xD;
           identified, or is alternative therapy recommended or routinely implemented?&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. If alternative therapy is routinely administered, what is that therapy?&#xD;
