  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to understand the safety of a new radiation treatment called&#xD;
      &quot;Multi-Beam Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy&quot; ( IMRT). Currently, the standard way of&#xD;
      giving radiation is with &quot;simplified&quot; IMRT, which uses only 2 beams of radiation.&#xD;
      &quot;Multi-beam&quot; IMRT works by using 6-12 small radiation beams to give a more &quot;tailored&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;customized&quot; radiation dose to the breast, chest wall, and the lymph nodes. At the same time,&#xD;
      multi-beam IMRT may allow the dose to the heart, lungs, and nearby tissue to be lowered,&#xD;
      especially when the internal mammary lymph nodes need to be targeted by radiation.&#xD;

    <description>The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of utilizing multi-beam IMRT in the adjuvant treatment of the breast and regional lymph nodes of women with node-positive breast cancer requiring coverage of the internal mammary lymph nodes. A feasibility rate of at least 90% is required, ie, treatment can be successfully planned and delivered for at least 90% of the patients.</description>
