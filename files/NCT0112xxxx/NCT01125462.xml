  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of recombinant DNA technology, culminated in the introduction of the first&#xD;
      recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r hFSH), Gonal-f, which further developed to&#xD;
      become Gonal-f Filled-by-Mass (FbM) pen has been used in the fertility treatment since many&#xD;
      years. It has been found that subjects using the pen found it less stressful, easier to use&#xD;
      and more convenient than a conventional syringe and would recommend the prefilled pen to&#xD;
      another woman considering gonadotropin treatment. However, the use of the Gonal-f (FbM) pen&#xD;
      between Serbian subjects is on a very low level though the Gonal f vials with the 75 IU of&#xD;
      follitropin alfa have been present in Serbian market since 2003. On the contrary from the&#xD;
      clinical practice in European countries, Serbian subjects usually receive daily dose of&#xD;
      injectable gonadotropins at the IVF clinics or by partner/family member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label, multicentric, observational non-interventional study is designed with the&#xD;
      aim to know the reason of Serbian subjects not injecting themselves with Gonal f and the&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL) of Serbian women/couples with the infertility problem.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fertility is the ability to conceive or induce conception. A normal fertile couple has about&#xD;
      a 20% chance of achieving pregnancy in any one month of unprotected intercourse. Infertility&#xD;
      is defined as the failure to conceive after 12 months of unprotected intercourse. It is&#xD;
      generally estimated that about 10% to 15% of couples can be classified as having conception&#xD;
      difficulties. About 30% of these are as a result of female factors, 30% as a result of male&#xD;
      factors and a further 30% are due to a combination of both male and female factors. In about&#xD;
      10% of cases, the underlying cause is not found (unexplained fertility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follicle-stimulating hormone is one of the key hormones regulating reproductive functions&#xD;
      both in females and males. In females, it stimulates the development of ovarian follicles&#xD;
      which carry the oocytes, while in males it promotes spermatogenesis. Follicle-stimulating&#xD;
      hormone binding to its receptor triggers intracellular mechanisms that regulate&#xD;
      steroidogenesis, cell replication and expression of specific proteins and growth that&#xD;
      modulate gametogenesis. Complete or partial deficiencies in FSH secretion are common causes&#xD;
      of infertility in both women and men. Administration of FSH, either alone or in combination&#xD;
      with luteinizing hormone (LH), has been used successfully to treat these infertility&#xD;
      problems. Nearly 40% of women who are infertile have an ovulatory problem. These disorders&#xD;
      may originate in the pituitary, the hypothalamus, the ovaries, or the anatomy of the&#xD;
      reproductive system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 50 years the quality of FSH used in fertility treatment for inducing follicular&#xD;
      development has improved via several distinguishable steps. For many years only human&#xD;
      menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), a mixture of human LH and FSH extracted from the urine of&#xD;
      post-menopausal women, was available for treatment of infertility. However, Merck Serono has&#xD;
      developed the recombinant human FSH (r-hFSH) for clinical use, which has been in the market&#xD;
      for several years. This development has been guided by the quest for control over the&#xD;
      variability in urinary derived drugs. The recombinant system is a well-defined and controlled&#xD;
      manufacturing process, which means that the content of these recombinant gonadotropins is&#xD;
      consistent from batch-to-batch, accurately measured and filled-by-mass (i.e. in terms of&#xD;
      weight in micrograms). This allows precise dosing control in both ovulation induction (OI)&#xD;
      and assisted reproduction techniques (ART). Recombinant human fertility hormones are&#xD;
      considered to have consistency of the source material and of the active product, the purity&#xD;
      and specific activity of the protein, a good efficacy, safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ease-of-use of Gonal-f (FbM) in a prefilled pen in normal clinical&#xD;
           practice conditions under different protocols of follicular stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the local tolerability (incidence of local reaction at the injection site)&#xD;
           to drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned to be conducted in 3 IVF/ART clinics in Serbia recruiting approximately&#xD;
      20 subjects per centre (10 to each group) giving a total of 60 subjects. Subjects with&#xD;
      previous stimulation treatment by the use of some injectable gonadotropins and not the&#xD;
      stimulation with clomiphene citrate will be enrolled in this study. Depending on the kind of&#xD;
      gonadotropin used in the previous stimulation treatment the subject has been treated with&#xD;
      (meaning either Gonal-f ampules or urinary derived drugs), subjects will be stratified into&#xD;
      two groups. The first group will include subjects who have undergone at least one treatment&#xD;
      cycle with Gonal f powder and solvent for solution for injection within the past 12 months&#xD;
      (equivalent to 75 IU/ml, 450 IU/0.75ml or 1050 IU/1.75 ml). The second group will include&#xD;
      subjects which had undergone at least one treatment cycle with urine-derived FSH therapy with&#xD;
      vials within the past 12 months. Subjects in both groups included in the study will be&#xD;
      treated according to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and according to clinical&#xD;
      practice at each site. These subjects will also answer on questions from the first&#xD;
      internationally validated QoL questionnaire called FertiQoL. The FertiQoL is the instrument&#xD;
      that surveys infertile subjects to assess their QoL. Each and every subject will undergo one&#xD;
      stimulation treatment cycle and each subject should be followed for approximately 2 weeks or&#xD;
      until chemically proven pregnancy. After treatment, subject satisfaction with the Gonal f&#xD;
      (FbM) prefilled pen will be measured using a post-treatment questionnaire in which&#xD;
      participants will be asked to compare their treatment experiences and choose a preferred&#xD;
      injection method.&#xD;
