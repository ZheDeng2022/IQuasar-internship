  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avoiding nausea and vomiting is one of the most important for patient comfort and&#xD;
      satisfaction, and preventing unplanned overnight stays in hospital following surgery. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that increased amounts of intravenous fluid during surgery prevent nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting after operations. This effect lasted for up to 48 hours after the surgery. Other&#xD;
      unpleasant side effects of dehydration that delay recovery including headaches and dizziness&#xD;
      can be prevented with fluid treatment during the operation. It is unclear if this effect&#xD;
      happens with all types of fluid. The investigators propose to examine the effect of 2 types&#xD;
      of intravenous fluids on recovery from anaesthesia. Each group will be given a different&#xD;
      fluid while using our usual anaesthetic technique. The investigators will ask questions about&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting after surgery (primary outcomes), and other factors relating to patient&#xD;
      comfort such as headache and dizziness (secondary outcomes)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is extremely important for patient&#xD;
      comfort and satisfaction after surgery.1 There has been a recent change in emphasis from&#xD;
      inpatient to day care surgery and anaesthesia with attendant increased interest in the&#xD;
      problem of PONV. The incidence of PONV following day case gynaecologic surgery is 40% to&#xD;
      90%.2,3 Postoperative nausea and vomiting has the potential to cause delays in meeting&#xD;
      discharge criteria both from the recovery room to ward, and from the day ward to home. On&#xD;
      rare occasions, it may lead to unanticipated overnight hospital admission which leads to an&#xD;
      increased emotional cost to the patient and economic cost to the healthcare provider. The&#xD;
      efficacy of routine use of prophylactic antiemetics remains controversial.4 Pharmacologic&#xD;
      prophylaxis has limited effect and increases the risk of adverse drug effects for the patient&#xD;
      in addition to increasing overall cost of care.5,6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies suggest that increased crystalloid infusion for day case gynaecologic procedures in&#xD;
      healthy patients reduces the incidence of nausea, vomiting and antiemetic use.7,8 The&#xD;
      suggested mechanism is an improvement in gastrointestinal mucosal perfusion that mitigates&#xD;
      the both the deleterious effects of preoperative fasting and consequent dehydration,9 and&#xD;
      those of raised intra-abdominal pressure and surgical manipulation of bowel during&#xD;
      laparoscopic procedures. However, excessive fluid administration in major surgery has been&#xD;
      shown to have a negative effect on postoperative gastrointestinal function (causing an&#xD;
      increased incidence of postoperative ileus) due to bowel oedema.10 It has been demonstrated&#xD;
      that colloid causes less bowel oedema than equivalent volumes of crystalloid.11 Moretti et al&#xD;
      showed that intraoperative colloid administration reduces PONV and improves the quality of&#xD;
      postoperative recovery versus crystalloid solutions.¹² Clearly, there is an optimum&#xD;
      perioperative fluid balance to reduce PONV without the risk of additional gastrointestinal&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An arbitrary perioperative fluid load measured in ml.kg-1 does not take account of the&#xD;
      individual fasting period and resultant preoperative fluid deficit for each patient, which&#xD;
      can vary substantially depending on early or late (morning or afternoon) operating time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to prospectively examine the effect of intravenous fluids on PONV in a&#xD;
      double-blind study, utilizing a standardised anaesthetic technique as normally carried out in&#xD;
      this hospital. We hypothesise that replacement of preoperative fluid deficit with colloid&#xD;
      will reduce the incidence of PONV versus crystalloid solution. We further propose to examine&#xD;
      secondary outcomes relating to patient wellbeing such as headache and dizziness which are&#xD;
      symptoms of dehydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy patients should not experience any cardiorespiratory effects associated with&#xD;
      administration of intravenous fluids to correct dehydration due to preoperative fasting.&#xD;
      There may however be subclinical effects which can be detected by sensitive pulmonary&#xD;
      function testing. Patients will be asked to perform a simple bedside lung function test&#xD;
      before surgery and 2 hours after surgery. This will be done with a portable spirometer&#xD;
      (Micromedical Micro Lab Spirometer), which is used routinely in our anaesthesia preoperative&#xD;
      assessment clinic to evaluate lung function. Forced expiratory volume in the first second&#xD;
      (litre) (FEV1), forced vital capacity (litre) (FVC) and peak flow rates (l/min) will be&#xD;
      measured at a 45 degree position of recumbency. The best of three attempts will be chosen for&#xD;
      further analysis as recommended by the British Thoracic Society.&#xD;

      generator&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUPS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be allocated to one of two groups according to randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will receive 1.5 ml.kg.hr-1 of fasting time of intravenous Hartmann's solution&#xD;
           perioperatively (Crystalloid solution)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will receive 1.5 ml.kg.hr-1 of fasting time of intravenous Voluven® (6% Hydroxy&#xD;
           Ethyl Starch) solution perioperatively (Colloid solution)&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLINDING&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All fluid administration will be completed in theatre&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neither the patient or the investigator will be aware of group assignment&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANAESTHETIC TECHNIQUE The anaesthetic technique will be standardised as follows: Intravenous&#xD;
      access will be obtained after local anaesthetic infiltration of the skin. Once the fluid has&#xD;
      been started all patients will undergo a standardised induction of anaesthesia, consisting of&#xD;
      Fentanyl 1.5 mcg.kg-1, Propofol 2-3 mg.kg-1 and Atracurium 0.35 mg.kg-1 to facilitate airway&#xD;
      control. All patients will be mechanically ventilated via a laryngeal mask airway LMA&#xD;
      Supreme™ to maintain isocapnia with tidal volume (Vt) 4-6 ml.kg-1, maximum airway pressure (P&#xD;
      max) 30 cm H2O and a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O. Anaesthesia will be&#xD;
      maintained with Sevoflurane 1-3% in a mixture of O2 and air to achieve a FiO2 of 0.5. Muscle&#xD;
      relaxation will be antagonised with Neostigmine 2.5 mg and Glycopyrrolate 0.5 mg at the end&#xD;
      of surgery. Before discontinuation of anaesthesia, each patient will receive rectal&#xD;
      Diclofenac 100mg and 1000mg Paracetamol i.v.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care will also be standardised. Patients complaining of pain will be given 25&#xD;
      mcg of Fentanyl intravenously as required (in PACU), Pethidine 50mg intramuscularly or simple&#xD;
      oral analgesics (Paracetamol/Codeine 500-1000mg/8-16mg) every 6 hours in the ward area.&#xD;
      Rescue antiemetics in the form of boluses of Ondansetron 4mg intravenously (to a maximum&#xD;
      total dose of 16mg) and Cyclizine 50mg intramuscularly every 8 hours can be given. Patients&#xD;
      will be prescribed oral Paracetamol/Codeine 500-1000mg/8-16mg every 6 hours and Diclofenac&#xD;
      50mg every 8 hours to take at home if required.&#xD;

      TREATMENT OF DATA The data will be collected by a single investigator at the specified time&#xD;
      points and documented on a patient data collection sheet (see appendix 2). Once data&#xD;
      collection is complete, all data of the patient sheets will be transferred onto a spreadsheet&#xD;
      and anonymised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      USE OF DATA The data will be presented at a national or international meeting and in&#xD;
      peer-reviewed medical journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STORAGE OF DATA All data will be stored for five years and only Dr. Conan McCaul and Dr. Ivan&#xD;
      Hayes will have access to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL PROCEDURES Statistics will be performed using a standard statistical program&#xD;
      (Sigma Stat, Jandel Scientific). Demographic data will be analysed using Student's t-test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Repeated measures ( VAS scores) will be analysed by&#xD;
      repeated measures analysis of variance with further paired comparisons at each time interval&#xD;
      performed using the t-test, with corrections for multiple comparisons where appropriate.&#xD;
      Categorical data will be analysed using χ² analysis or the Fisher's exact test where&#xD;
      applicable. Normally distributed data will be presented as means +/-SEM, non-normally&#xD;
      distributed data will be presented as medians +/- quartiles (interquartile range), and&#xD;
      categorical data will be presented as raw data and as frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE Postoperative nausea and vomiting incidence from day case laparoscopic&#xD;
      gynaecologic procedures (primary outcome) both with and without single agent antiemetic&#xD;
      prophylaxis varies from 40 -90%.2,3,7 To detect a clinically significant difference of 25%&#xD;
      reduction in mean nausea scores based on a PONV incidence of 40% without antiemetic&#xD;
      prophylaxis, we calculate a sample size of 60 patients per group (a = 0.05, β = 0.2).&#xD;
