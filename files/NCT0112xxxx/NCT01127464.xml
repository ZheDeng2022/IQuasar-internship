  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DCVax-001 is a recombinant protein vaccine designed to prevent and potentially treat human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The vaccine is composed of a fusion protein&#xD;
      containing a human monoclonal antibody specific for the dendritic cell receptor, DEC-205&#xD;
      (CD205), and the HIV gag p24 protein. The vaccine is designed to target HIV antigens directly&#xD;
      to endocytic pathways in dendritic cells (DCs) that allow for efficient processing and&#xD;
      presentation of multiple HIV peptides on both MHC class I and II products, which will induce&#xD;
      HIV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. This vaccine candidate must be combined with appropriate&#xD;
      immunostimulants (adjuvants) to induce immunity to the antigen. In the proposed clinical&#xD;
      trial we will use poly ICLC (Hiltonol) from Oncovir, Inc as the adjuvant.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate whether delivery of HIV antigens via immunization with&#xD;
      anti-DEC-205 p24 monoclonal antibody plus poly ICLC, as an adjuvant, is safe and induces&#xD;
      either cellular or humoral immunogenicity in healthy volunteers. We propose to assess the&#xD;
      quality of immunity elicited by DEC targeted vaccines in humans. Immunogenicity after HIV&#xD;
      antigen delivery directly to dendritic cells could provide the proof-of-concept that&#xD;
      dendritic cell targeted protein vaccines may serve as a stand-alone vaccine strategy or in&#xD;
      combination with other vaccine modalities against HIV or other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of this study is to assess the delivery of HIV antigens via immunization&#xD;
      with anti-DEC-205 p24 monoclonal antibody (DCVax-001) plus poly ICLC (Hiltonol) is safe and&#xD;
      induces either cellular or humoral immunogenicity in HIV-uninfected, healthy volunteers.&#xD;
