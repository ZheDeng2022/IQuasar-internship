  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifetime prevalence of major depression is estimated at 28% by age 18 (Lewinsohn et al.,&#xD;
      1999), with higher cumulative rates in females (35%) than males (19%). Approximately 17% of&#xD;
      children and adolescents in the United States are obese as defined by a BMI above the 95th&#xD;
      percentile, with more than 30% falling between the 85th and 95th percentiles (Ogden et al.,&#xD;
      2008). Overweight children and adolescents are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (Pinhas-Hamiel et al., 1996) and overwhelming risk for adult obesity (Guo et al., 1994).&#xD;
      There is a substantial percentage of adolescents who are both overweight and depressed with&#xD;
      estimates from clinical samples averaging 25%. Treatment of teens with comorbid medical and&#xD;
      psychiatric conditions such as overweight/obesity and depression has received little to no&#xD;
      attention in the psychosocial treatment research literature. Due to the large number of&#xD;
      adolescents who are both depressed and overweight, developing a behavioral treatment that&#xD;
      addresses both problems simultaneously has important public health significance. The purpose&#xD;
      of this proposal is to combine treatments for depression and overweight to address these&#xD;
      co-occurring conditions in one intervention. The long-term objectives of this research are to&#xD;
      develop efficient and effective treatments for co-occurring physical and emotional disorders.&#xD;
      The research program will be divided into 3 major phases: a development phase (Stage 1a), a&#xD;
      pilot study phase (Stage 1b), and a revision phase. During the development phase (Stage 1a),&#xD;
      a treatment for overweight teens and CBT treatment for depressed teens will be adapted into&#xD;
      one integrated protocol that addresses depression using CBT techniques, an exercise&#xD;
      component, and advice regarding healthy eating. As part of this phase, we will adapt existing&#xD;
      intervention manuals and therapist training materials, and gain some initial clinical&#xD;
      experience with the intervention via an open trial with 6 teens. During the randomized pilot&#xD;
      study phase (Stage 1b), the integrated intervention will be compared to a control group&#xD;
      receiving CBT treatment for depression alone (N=40 in total). During the pilot phase, the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of administering the program will be assessed. In addition, we&#xD;
      will compare change in depressed mood at end of treatment and 6 month follow-up periods&#xD;
      across the two groups. During the revision phase, the intervention manual will be further&#xD;
      developed and refined, based on experiences and observations made during the development and&#xD;
      pilot study phases.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adolescents must: 1) be between the ages of 12 and 18 years (18 year olds must still be in&#xD;
        high school and living at home); 2) be at or above the 85th percentile with reference to&#xD;
        age and gender-specific Body Mass Index (BMI); 3) have at least one parent available to&#xD;
        participate in the treatment protocol; 4) speak English; 5) agree to study participation&#xD;
        and random assignment; and 6) be available for follow-up. In order to meet the depressed&#xD;
        mood criterion, adolescents must have a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder&#xD;
        (single or recurrent), based on the KSADS-PL with a CGI-Severity ≥ 3 for depression and&#xD;
        CDRS ≥ 36. Participants must be healthy, as established by their primary care physician, in&#xD;
        order to participate in the exercise program -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adolescents will be excluded if: 1) they are currently receiving psychotherapy or&#xD;
        participating in another weight loss program (only can have been in a weight loss program&#xD;
        in the past); 2) they have a medical condition that would interfere with the prescribed&#xD;
        dietary plan or participation in physical activity; 3) they are developmentally delayed&#xD;
        such that the intervention materials will not be appropriate; 4) they are actively suicidal&#xD;
        at intake; 5) they have not been on a stable dose of a psychostimulant for 6 months to&#xD;
        ensure that a recently prescribed psychostimulant is not contributing to weight loss; 6)&#xD;
        teens on an SSRI will not be allowed to participate due to potential effects of medication&#xD;
        on weight loss; 7) they have a substance abuse or dependence diagnosis; or 8) they have&#xD;
        failed a medication or psychotherapy trial for depression in the past.&#xD;
