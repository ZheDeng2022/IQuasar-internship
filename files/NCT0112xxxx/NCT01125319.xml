  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophagocytic lymphohisticytosis (HLH) is a rare and severe disease of genetic origin in&#xD;
      children (familial-HLH, F-HLH) or affecting adults secondary to infections, hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies or auto-immune diseases (secondary_HLH, S-HLH). F-HLH are due to genetic&#xD;
      mutations affecting the genes of perforin or proteins involved in its secretion, resulting in&#xD;
      the complete loss of lymphocyte cytotoxicity without affecting lymphocyte number. In S-HLH,&#xD;
      the investigators have observed a severe NK cell lymphopenia and a transient loss of&#xD;
      cytotoxicity of unknown mechanism. In this study, the investigators will dissect macrophage&#xD;
      activation mechanisms as well as NK cytotoxicity inability in adults patients suffering of&#xD;
      S-HLH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macrophage activation could result from the loss of the retro-control normally exerted by NK&#xD;
      cells, thus the investigators will analyze reciprocal interactions of macrophages and NK&#xD;
      cells during the acute phase and after recovery of S-HLH.&#xD;
