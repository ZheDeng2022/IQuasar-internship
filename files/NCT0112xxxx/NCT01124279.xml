             disorders as determined by the investigator in consultation with the Amgen physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females must be of non-reproductive potential (ie, postmenopausal by history - no&#xD;
             menses for 1 year - and FSH consistent with postmenopausal status per laboratory&#xD;
             ranges; or history of hysterectomy; or history of bilateral tubal ligation; or history&#xD;
             of bilateral oophorectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical examination, clinical laboratory test values and ECGs are clinically&#xD;
             acceptable to the investigator and Amgen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males must agree to use highly effective methods of birth control for the duration of&#xD;
             the study and continuing for 12 weeks after the last dose of AMG 853. Highly effective&#xD;
             methods of birth control (i.e., those with a failure rate of less than 1% per year)&#xD;
             include sexual abstinence, vasectomy or a condom supplemented with the use of a&#xD;
             spermicide, where available, in combination with one of the following methods used by&#xD;
             the female partner: in regions where spermicide is available, diaphragm or&#xD;
             cervical/vault caps supplemented with spermicide, hormonal birth control (implants,&#xD;
             injectables, or combined oral contraceptives), intrauterine devices (IUDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects whose partners become pregnant during the study will not receive&#xD;
             subsequent scheduled doses, must practice sexual abstinence or use a condom for two&#xD;
             weeks following the last dose, and will be followed for safety through end of study.&#xD;
             The pregnant partner information will be reported to Amgen as per the Pregnancy&#xD;
             Notification Worksheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index between 18 and 30 kg/m2, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of clinically significant disorder, condition or disease that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator or Amgen physician, would pose a risk to subject&#xD;
             safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures, or completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance within the screening period of less than 80 mL/min as calculated&#xD;
             by the Cockcroft-Gault method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History suggestive of esophageal, gastric, or duodenal ulceration or bowel disease&#xD;
             (including but not limited to peptic ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcerative&#xD;
             colitis, Crohn's disease, or irritable bowel syndrome), or a history of&#xD;
             gastrointestinal surgery other than uncomplicated appendectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any positive test for cotinine (tobacco use) on the day before dosing of each&#xD;
             treatment period (day -1, 7, 14 and 21). A positive cotinine level is defined as any&#xD;
             level exceeding the upper limit of normal per local laboratory reference ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known substance abuse (eg, alcohol, licit or illicit drugs) within 1 year of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any positive test for drugs and or alcohol use on the day before dosing of each&#xD;
             treatment period (day -1, 7, 14 and 21). Alcohol should not be consumed within 48&#xD;
             hours of day -1 and throughout the study.&#xD;

             the subject within 30 days prior to the first dose of investigational product and&#xD;
             continued use, if appropriate, will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and the&#xD;
             Amgen Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to sulfonamide drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
