    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare a regimen of tenofovir/lamivudine/lopinavir-ritonavir&#xD;
      to the WHO-recommended and locally practiced standard of care regimen consisting of&#xD;
      zidovudine/lamivudine/lopinavir-ritonavir during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy&#xD;
      in HIV and HBV co-infected women. This is a phase II study evaluating the safety of the test&#xD;
      regimen in pregnant women and their newborns. While the study is not powered to examine&#xD;
      efficacy, preliminary estimates of transmission of HIV and HBV to the infants and of the rate&#xD;
      of resistance development will be obtained.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Great progress has been made in preventing mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV in&#xD;
      resource-rich settings with the use of combination antiretroviral regimens during pregnancy&#xD;
      and peripartum. In the resource-limited world simple inexpensive regimens administered&#xD;
      peripartum, such as single dose nevirapine to mothers and infants, have been effective in&#xD;
      reducing transmission but at the cost of development of resistance. Strategies that will&#xD;
      allow women to preserve their antiretroviral options when they will need therapy for their&#xD;
      own HIV disease and will improve efficacy are urgently needed. Moreover, co-infection with&#xD;
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a problem for a substantial proportion of HIV-infected pregnant&#xD;
      women. HIV alters the course of HBV disease by increasing levels of HBV DNA replication and&#xD;
      thus risk of transmission to the newborn. HBV immunization in the infant with the first dose&#xD;
      started soon after birth has decreased the bulk of such transmission, but the risk remains,&#xD;
      particularly for mothers with HBe antigen positivity. Ideally an antiviral regimen&#xD;
      administered during pregnancy with activity against both viruses would minimize transmission&#xD;
      of both HIV and HBV to the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to study a combination of tenofovir/lamivudine/lopinavir-ritonavir&#xD;
      started between 14 and 28 weeks of pregnancy in HIV and HBV co-infected women. This regimen&#xD;
      provides potent antiviral activity for prevention of MTCT. In addition, tenofovir and&#xD;
      lamivudine both have activity against HBV, and could play a role in decreasing transmission&#xD;
      of HBV to the infant. This regimen will be compared to the WHO-recommended and locally&#xD;
      practiced standard of care, consisting of zidovudine/lamivudine/lopinavir-ritonavir, also&#xD;
      starting at 14-28 weeks of pregnancy. This will be a phase II study evaluating the safety of&#xD;
      the test regimen in pregnant women and their newborns, in particular renal, bone mineral&#xD;
      density and hepatic toxicity (including hepatic flares post discontinuation of therapy). The&#xD;
      study will recruit 80 pregnant women of at least 20 years of age in China and follow them and&#xD;
      their infants for 12 months post-delivery. The investigators will recruit from prenatal&#xD;
      clinics in some of the districts most heavily affected by HIV in the Guangxi province in&#xD;
      China. China is selected for this study as it is hyperendemic for hepatitis B and has a&#xD;
      rising HIV epidemic. Although not powered to examine efficacy, preliminary estimates of&#xD;
      transmission of HIV and HBV to the infants and of the rate of resistance development will be&#xD;
      obtained. The study will be done in collaboration with CDC-GAP China and the Chinese Ministry&#xD;
      of Health-National Center for AIDS, which will coordinate recruitment, study visits and data&#xD;
      collection through the local HIV/AIDS coordinators.&#xD;
