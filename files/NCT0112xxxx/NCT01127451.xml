    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Patients with Stage IIIC and Stage IV&#xD;
      Melanoma experience benefit when treated with Denileukin diftitox in two different dosing&#xD;
      schedules.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose/schedule and clinical efficacy study in patients with&#xD;
      Stage IIIC and Stage IV melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-Schedules: This is a schedule, dose, and pharmacodynamic study of Denileukin diftitox in&#xD;
      in patients with Stage IIIC and Stage IV melanoma. Two arms of 40 patients each were&#xD;
      originally planned (see below) for a total of 80 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      1 of 2 arms: 1. 12 mcg/kg/day on Days 1 through 4 of each 21-day treatment cycle, for a total&#xD;
      of 4 cycles (12 weeks); 2. 12 mcg/kg/day on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day treatment cycle,&#xD;
      for a total of 4 cycles (12 weeks). Patients will be evaluated for (clinical response, safety&#xD;
      and tolerability, and pharmacodynamic measures of ONTAK activity. An optional substudy will&#xD;
      be conducted that will involve collection of serial tumor biopsies at study entry and Day 84&#xD;
      in order to assess tissue pharmacodynamic markers of ONTAK activity (Treg depletion in tumor,&#xD;
      appearance of melanoma antigen-specific CD8+lymphocytes, and other markers of mucosal&#xD;
      immunity and inflammatory response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an amendment, patients will be enrolled in Arm 1 only (expanded to a total of 55&#xD;
      patients) and Arm 2 was closed. According to the original design, if two responses or less&#xD;
      were observed among 22 patients on either arm, that arm would be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients experiencing clinical benefit (immune-related stable disease [irSD], immune-related&#xD;
      partial response [irPR], or immune-related complete response [irCR] per irRC) after 4 cycles&#xD;
      of treatment, may continue their denileukin diftitox treatment for up to 8 cycles&#xD;

denileukin diftitox was originally administered by intravenous infusion over 30-60 minutes according to 1 of 2 treatment arms:&#xD;
12 mcg/kg/day on Days 1 through 4 of each 21-day treatment cycle, for a total of 4 cycles (12 weeks);&#xD;
12 mcg/kg/day on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day treatment cycle, for a total of 4 cycles (12 weeks)&#xD;
ARM 2 is now closed. Patients experiencing clinical benefit (irSD, irPR, or irCR per irRC) after 4 cycles of treatment, may continue their denileukin diftitox treatment for up to 8 cycles.</description>
