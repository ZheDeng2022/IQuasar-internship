  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is will examine the pathways involved in allergic response, primarily in&#xD;
      food allergy; specifically peanut allergy. We will also study non-allergic donors as well as&#xD;
      patients with atopic disorders, primarily as control subjects. We believe that this study&#xD;
      will lead to discovery of significant pathways involved in the allergic pathway that can be&#xD;
      explored in more detail during follow-up studies in order to address mechanistic questions&#xD;
      that cannot be answered in a pilot trial. We believe that such a pilot study represents the&#xD;
      ideal approach to identify effective therapeutic interventions and to simultaneously better&#xD;
      understand the underlying mechanistic properties involved in the allergy cascade. We think&#xD;
      that this study forms the basis for a novel avenue of research into the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      allergic pathways, a disease that is still associated with significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study aims to characterize the pathways involved in the allergic response, primarily in&#xD;
      food allergy; specifically peanut allergy. We will also study non-allergic donors as well as&#xD;
      patients with atopic disorders, primarily as control subjects. All eligible study&#xD;
      participants will have documented elevated total IgE levels, peanut positivity or another&#xD;
      antigen/allergen specific elevated IgE (ie common indoor/outdoor allergens) prior to being&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Our study will focus on allergic as well as non-allergic individuals.&#xD;
      We plan on collecting samples from a total of 60 patients during one time point (peanut&#xD;
      allergic individuals, non-atopic/allergic individuals, atopic individuals-other than peanut&#xD;
      allergy). We believe that such a pilot study represents the ideal approach to identify&#xD;
      effective therapeutic interventions and to simultaneously better understand the underlying&#xD;
      mechanistic properties involved in the allergy cascade. We plan to obtain a detailed history&#xD;
      prior to enrollment as well as objective data (ie SPT as well as Immunocap testing results).&#xD;
      There will be 3 study groups and studies will be performed on approximately 20 peanut&#xD;
      allergic patients, 20 non-allergic controls, and 20 allergic/atopic (non-peanut allergic, but&#xD;
      allergic to indoor/outdoor allergen) individuals. There will be one blood draw required at&#xD;
      each visit (weeks 0, 4, 8). Each blood draw will require 105 ml of whole blood to be&#xD;
      collected in ten heparinized 10-mL tubes and one EDTA tube. We plan to assess the levels of&#xD;
      total IgE and IgG as well as antigen specific IgG and IgE in the peripheral blood of&#xD;
      patients. We will specifically perform ELISA testing that detects these levels. We will also&#xD;
      perform in vitro CD4+ T cell proliferation assays. For this purpose, patients' peripheral T&#xD;
      cells will be isolated with a combination of magnetic beads and flow cytometric sorting.&#xD;
