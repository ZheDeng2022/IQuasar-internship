      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to investigate brain function. Researchers want to&#xD;
      use MRI to better understand the function patterns and connections between brain regions in&#xD;
      healthy people. This might help people with brain diseases in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate MRI methods performed twice on the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate brain function using positron emission tomography (PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and interview about&#xD;
           drug and alcohol use and psychiatric history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will give blood and urine samples. Their breath will be tested for alcohol and&#xD;
           smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have urine collected. They will have MRI scans, some while resting,&#xD;
           some while doing tasks on a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on&#xD;
           a table that slides in and out of the cylinder, with a coil over their head.&#xD;
           Participants will get earplugs for loud noises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have urine collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A needle will guide a thin plastic tube (catheter) into each arm. The needle will be&#xD;
           removed, leaving the catheter in the vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then have a PET scan. They will get the chemical 18FDG in the&#xD;
           catheter. They will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the PET scanner, with a cap&#xD;
           on their head.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have tests of memory, attention, concentration, and thinking. They may&#xD;
           complete interviews, questionnaires, tests on paper or computer, and simple actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will wear a device for 1 week between visits to measure activity and sleep.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Objectives: The overarching goal of this study is to quantify the reproducibility of multiple&#xD;
      measures of brain functional connectivity (FC) during resting conditions and during task&#xD;
      performance. Secondary objectives are to assess the dynamic properties and energy&#xD;
      requirements of the human brain connectome as well as the effects of physiologic noise,&#xD;
      gender and aging on measures of brain functional connectivity at rest and during task&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 60 healthy males and 60 healthy females 18 years or older will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Participants will undergo two MRI/MRS sessions to evaluate test-retest reliability of&#xD;
      FC at rest as well as during task performance, and one 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET&#xD;
      session to assess the association between FC and glucose metabolism in the human brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters: The variability of the gender and aging effects on FC measures (lFCD, L,&#xD;
      C, and S) collected in RS and TS conditions , which will be quantified using volxelwise ICC&#xD;
      (3,1). The variability of brain metabolite concentrations in precuneus.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Older than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide written informed consent as determined by physical examination and&#xD;
             verbal communication. Capacity to consent will be determined by those obtaining the&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast feeding. Females of childbearing potential must have negative urine&#xD;

        determined by history and clinical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or past DSM-IV or DSM-5 diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder as determined by&#xD;
             history and clinical exam including substance use disorder (except for&#xD;
             nicotine/caffeine), alcoholism and alcohol dependence. Past history of a mental&#xD;
             disorder as defined by DSM-IV or DSM-5 will be excluded only if it required&#xD;
             hospitalization (any length), or chronic medication management (more than 4 weeks),&#xD;
             and that could impact brain function at the time of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with a binge drinking history every month continuously for the last 10 years&#xD;
             will also be excluded. Binge drinkers are those who being female consume 4 or more&#xD;
             drinks and males consume 5 or more drinks in one occasion at least once a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major medical problems that can impact brain function at the time of the scan&#xD;
             (including but not limited to HIV; central nervous system including seizures and&#xD;
             psychosis; cardiovascular including hypertension and arrhythmias; metabolic,&#xD;
             autoimmune, endocrine) as determined by history and clinical exam. Participants aged&#xD;
             60 and older with any medical problems that are controlled will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;

             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had previous radiation exposure (from X-rays, PET scans, or other exposure) that,&#xD;
             with the exposure from this study, would exceed NIH annual research limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Head trauma with loss of consciousness for more than 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of ferromagnetic objects in the body that are contraindicated for MRI/MRS of&#xD;
             the head (pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some&#xD;
             types of dental implants, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, permanent eyeliner,&#xD;
             implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments), fear of enclosed spaces, or other&#xD;
             standard contraindication to MRI/MRS (self-report checklist).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cannot lie comfortably flat on back for up to 2 hours in the PET and MRI/MRS scanners.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt; 250 kg. This is the upper limit that the bed of the MR scanner can&#xD;
             accommodate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NIH employees who are study investigators, as well as their superiors, subordinates&#xD;
             and immediate family members (adult children, spouses, parents, siblings).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-English speakers (subjects must be able to read and comprehend English).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects will not be excluded from enrollment onto this study if their urine test&#xD;
                  is positive for drugs. However, if they test positive on scheduled study&#xD;
                  procedure days involving study imaging (MRI/MRS and PET) and Neuropsychological&#xD;
                  testing, the procedures will be postponed and rescheduled. We will allow for up&#xD;
                  to 3 rescheduled study days that were the result of positive urine drug screens.&#xD;
                  If the drug test is positive on the third rescheduled visit, the participant will&#xD;
                  be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The intent of the research has no prospect of direct benefit to the subject. Therefore, we&#xD;
        are excluding non-English speakers in this research study since it includes the&#xD;
        administration of questionnaires, surveys and assessments that are validated for English,&#xD;
        although some are available in Spanish.&#xD;
