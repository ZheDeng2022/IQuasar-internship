  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gene transfer is a process in which the DNA (genetic material) of certain cells is changed.&#xD;
      In this study, gene transfer will be performed on a type of white blood cell (called T cells)&#xD;
      to recognize leukemia cells in the same person the T cells were collected from.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it is safe to give these&#xD;
      genetically-changed T cells back to patients with CLL/SLL. Researchers also want to learn if&#xD;
      these cells can help to attack CLL/SLL cells.&#xD;

      Standard Blood Draw or Leukapheresis (to collect T cells):&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have T cells collected&#xD;
      from your blood. This will be done by a standard blood draw or a procedure called&#xD;
      leukapheresis. Your doctor will determine which is the best method is to collect your T&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If blood is collected through a standard blood draw, blood (less than 7 tablespoons) will be&#xD;
      drawn over 1-2 days using one or more needle sticks in your arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are going to have leukapheresis, you may visit the Apheresis Clinic at MD Anderson.&#xD;
      For the leukapheresis procedure, you will need to stay seated in a chair and keep both arms&#xD;
      still for about 3 hours. Blood will be drawn from 1 arm, white blood cells will be separated&#xD;
      from the rest of the blood cells in the leukapheresis machine, and the red cells, platelets,&#xD;
      and plasma (liquid part of the blood) will be returned through your other arm. The&#xD;
      leukapheresis procedure may require a total of 4-6 hours each day for up to 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your white blood cell sample will be sent to a lab at MD Anderson so the genetically-changed&#xD;
      T cells can be grown in the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will take up to about 4 weeks to change and grow enough genetically-changed T cells. If&#xD;
      researchers are unable to create a high enough dose of T cells for you in the lab, you may&#xD;
      have more blood collected or you will be taken off study. You may have other treatment for&#xD;
      CLL/SLL while you wait for production of the genetically-changed T cells. The study doctor&#xD;
      will discuss other possible methods of treatment with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to a level of genetically-changed T cells based on when you join this&#xD;
      study. Up to 3 levels of genetically-changed T cells will be tested. Up to 6 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled at each level. The first group of participants will receive the smallest&#xD;
      number of T cells. Each new group will receive a higher level than the group before it, if no&#xD;
      intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable level of&#xD;
      genetically-changed T cells is found, or the highest level being tested is reached (whichever&#xD;
      happens first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the highest level is found, an additional 12 patients will receive genetically- changed&#xD;
      T cells at that level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 4 or 5 days before you receive your T cell infusion, you will receive 1 of 3 different&#xD;
      FDA approved, standard combinations of chemotherapy, chosen by your doctor for you. These&#xD;
      combinations are each given over 2-3 days, and must be completed before you receive your T&#xD;
      cells. The days before you receive your T cells will be referred to as negative days (for&#xD;
      example, 5 days before you receive your T cells will be called Day -5). The drug combinations&#xD;
      are known as FCR, FBR, and BR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you receive FCR, you will receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide by vein, both over at&#xD;
      least 30 minutes each day on Days -5, -4, and -3. You will also receive rituximab by vein&#xD;
      over at least 4 hours on Day -5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you receive FBR, you will receive fludarabine and bendamustine by vein, both over at least&#xD;
      30 minutes each day on Days -5, -4, and -3. You will also receive rituximab by vein over at&#xD;
      least 4 hours on Day -5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you receive BR, you will receive bendamustine by vein over at least 30 minutes each day on&#xD;
      Days -4 and -3. You will also receive rituximab by vein on Day -4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No matter what you receive, you will then rest 2 days in which you receive nothing before&#xD;
      your T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T cell Infusion(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before your infusion of genetically-changed T cells, you will be given standard drugs to help&#xD;
      decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the&#xD;
      drugs are given and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive your genetically-changed T cells over about 30 minutes on Day 1. During the&#xD;
      infusion, your vital signs (including your temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and&#xD;
      breathing rate) will be measured every 15 minutes for the first hour, then every 30 minutes&#xD;
      for the second hour, and then about 1 hour after that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are still T cells left over after your infusion, and no intolerable side effects are&#xD;
      seen during the first 4 weeks after your infusion, you may receive a second infusion. If you&#xD;
      do, you may also receive another course of chemotherapy (as described above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 14 days (+/- 7 days) before receiving your T cell infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw&#xD;
           will include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because the gene transfer process uses mouse antibodies, this may cause your body to&#xD;
           make human antibodies to the mouse-based antibody. These antibodies are called HAMA.&#xD;
           Part of the routine blood sample described above will be used to compare against a&#xD;
           sample of your blood collected after the treatment is complete, to check if you&#xD;
           developed an immune system reaction against these mouse protein antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for baseline research tests to study how your&#xD;
           immune system responds after receiving the T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have computed tomography (CT) scans,&#xD;
           positron emission tomography - CT (PET-CT) scans, and/or a bone marrow biopsy to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be performed within 24 hours after your T cell&#xD;
      infusion, daily (not including weekends or holidays) for the first week after the infusion,&#xD;
      then 1, 2, and 3 weeks (+/-3 days), as well as 1 month (+/- 5 days), and 3, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
      (+/- 14 days) after the infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Part of this blood sample&#xD;
           will be used to check for HAMA immune system reactions 1, 2, and 3 weeks, as well as 1,&#xD;
           3, 6, and 12 months after your T cell infusion. If you leave the study early, then your&#xD;
           blood will be checked for HAMA at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for research tests to study how your immune&#xD;
           system is responding to the T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you may need CT scans, PET-CT scans, and/or a bone&#xD;
           marrow biopsy to check the status of the disease (3, 6, or 12 months after the last T&#xD;
           cell infusion only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 2 T cell infusions, depending on how many T cells are produced. You&#xD;
      will not receive a second T cell infusion if the disease gets worse, you have intolerable&#xD;
      side effects, or you have difficulty following the study directions. Your participation on&#xD;
      this study will be over when you have completed the study visit at 12 months after the last T&#xD;
      cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons, the FDA requires that patients who receive infusions of stem cells&#xD;
      treated with a gene transfer procedure must have long-term follow-up for at least 15 years&#xD;
      after receiving the gene transfer. After you have received an infusion of the T cells you&#xD;
      will be asked to sign a separate consent form for a long-term follow-up named &quot;Long-Term&#xD;
      Follow-Up Study of Recipients of Gene Transfer Research Protocols&quot; (Protocol 2006-0676).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The chemotherapy drugs in this study are commercially&#xD;
      available and FDA approved. The gene transfer and infusion with genetically-changed T cells&#xD;
      are not commercially available or FDA approved for use in this type of disease. Their use in&#xD;
      this study is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 48 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
