      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of carboxylesterase-expressing&#xD;
      allogeneic neural stem cells when given together with irinotecan hydrochloride in treating&#xD;
      patients with high-grade gliomas that have come back. Placing genetically modified neural&#xD;
      stem cells into brain tumor cells may make the tumor more sensitive to irinotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride. Irinotecan hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural&#xD;
      stem cells and irinotecan hydrochloride may be a better treatment for high-grade gliomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the recommended phase II doses (RP2D) of intracranially administered&#xD;
      carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cells (hCE1m6-NSCs) in combination with&#xD;
      intravenous irinotecan in patients with recurrent high grade glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the relationship between hCE1m6-NSC dose and liposomal SN-38 (SN-38)&#xD;
      concentrations in brain interstitium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of&#xD;
      irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) and SN-38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate the biologic activity of hCE1m6 NSCs by comparing SN-38 concentrations in&#xD;
      the brain after treatment with hCE1m6-NSCs and irinotecan versus irinotecan alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess for possible development of adenovirally transduced neural stem cell (NSC)&#xD;
      immunogenicity after first exposure and with repeat doses of NSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To describe the clinical benefit (defined as stable disease, partial response, or complete&#xD;
      response) in patients who receive treatment with repeat cycles of NSCs and irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine, at time of autopsy, the fate of the NSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural&#xD;
      stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cells intracranially over&#xD;
      1.5-4.5 hours on days 1 and 15 (day 1 only for patients at dose level 1) and irinotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 3 and 17. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 3 and 6 months, and&#xD;
      then annually thereafter for a minimum of 15 years.&#xD;
