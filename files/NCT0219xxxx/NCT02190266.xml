      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Coccidioidomycosis is caused by a fungus that grows in the southwest United States and&#xD;
      parts of Mexico and South America. This disease is caused by breathing dust containing the&#xD;
      fungus. It can lead to serious lung and breathing problems. Rarely, the fungus can infect&#xD;
      other body parts. This is called disseminated coccidioidomycosis (DCM). If the fungus stays&#xD;
      in the lungs for more than 6 months, it is called refractory coccidioidomycosis (RCM). People&#xD;
      with DCM or RCM may have difficulty fighting off infection because of immune system problems.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study the immune systems of people with DCM or RCM, to learn more about&#xD;
      the disease and the best ways to treat it. They also want to learn more about the types of&#xD;
      people that get DCM or RCM and about the fungus that causes it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about DCM and RCM, the fungus that causes these diseases, and the people who&#xD;
      get them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People over age 2 with DCM or RCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the initial visit, participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests. Some blood may be used for genetic testing. The samples will not&#xD;
           include participants names. Participants will be notified only if the tests show&#xD;
           something urgent about their DCM/RCM. Researchers think this sort of problem will be&#xD;
           rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire about their DCM/RCM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sputum (mucus) collection. They will spit into a cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 1 follow-up visit per year for up to 5 years. They will have&#xD;
           blood tests. They may have other procedures to treat their DCM/RCM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coccidioidomycosis (CM) is a fungal disease endemic to the southwestern United States,&#xD;
      Northern Mexico, and parts of South America. About 150,000 CM infections are estimated to&#xD;
      occur in the United States each year, of which 60% are thought to be asymptomatic.&#xD;
      Symptomatic patients typically present with a respiratory syndrome likened to&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia, while less than 1% of infected individuals are thought to&#xD;
      develop refractory disease with or without dissemination. Disseminated infection rarely&#xD;
      resolves spontaneously and, although any organ can be affected, tends to involve the skin,&#xD;
      lymph nodes, central nervous system and/or the skeletal system. While the risk of&#xD;
      disseminated infection is increased in immune suppressed patients, many individuals with no&#xD;
      significant prior history have developed debilitating, widespread infection. Causes of&#xD;
      refractory and/or disseminated disease in previously healthy individuals have only recently&#xD;
      begun to be elucidated, including mutations in the IFNy/IL-12 pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We seek to better characterize the genetic predisposition and treatment of refractory&#xD;
&#xD;
      and/or disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Specifically, we will examine multiple immune&#xD;
      factors, characterize the demographics of patients afflicted with this disease, and examine&#xD;
      the phylogeny of the infecting organisms. This information will reveal endogenous pathways&#xD;
      that might be targets for therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
