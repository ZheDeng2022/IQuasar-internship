      -  To evaluate the effects of a 32-weeks resistance and stretching training program applied&#xD;
           in Physical Education classes on forward head and protracted shoulder Portuguese&#xD;
           adolescents (15-17 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate on adolescents submitted to strength and stretching exercises the effects of&#xD;
           a 16-week detraining period after the end of the intervention protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized and controlled study will be conducted over a 12 month period, with&#xD;
      adolescents of two public secondary schools, in Lisbon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning, a total of 275 adolescent students aged 15-17 years old will be evaluated&#xD;
      with photogrammetry. The students will be screened by measuring the cervical (CV) and&#xD;
      shoulder (SH) angle with photogrammetry. If the CV and SH angle were less than 50º and 52º&#xD;
      respectively, the adolescent was considered to have forward head posture (FHP) and protracted&#xD;
      shoulder (PS) and was selected to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be excluded if their CV and SH angle was equal or higher than 50º and 52º&#xD;
      respectively, if they had visual deficits, diagnosed balance disorders, musculoskeletal&#xD;
      pathologies, such as a history of shoulder surgery, cervical or thoracic fracture, were&#xD;
      non-ambulatory, displayed functional or structural scoliosis, or had excessive thoracic&#xD;
      kyphosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After these the eligible students will be randomly assigned to the control or interventional&#xD;
      group. The intervention group will begin a 32-week stretching and strengthening program to be&#xD;
      performed in the last part of the Physical Education (PE) classes. The control group will&#xD;
      only participate in the PE classes. Since the 32th week until the 48th week the experimental&#xD;
      group will not follow the interventional training program and both groups will only&#xD;
      participate in PE classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program will be constituted by four strengthening exercises and three stretching&#xD;
      exercises and is designed based on the assumption that the use of therapeutic exercise is&#xD;
      effective in the correction of specific neck and shoulder postures. The training exercise&#xD;
      protocol will be designed for the correction of the FHP and PS, targeting to the selective&#xD;
      activation of lower trapezius, middle trapezius and rhomboids, to the lengthening of the&#xD;
      pectoralis major, pectoralis minor and sternocleidomastoid and to the improvement of the deep&#xD;
      cervical flexor function This program is going to be applied in the last 15-20 minutes of&#xD;
      each PE class, twice a week, with the supervision and help of the PE teacher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postural assessment of the groups will be performed in the beginning and after 36 and&#xD;
      48-weeks intervention period.&#xD;
