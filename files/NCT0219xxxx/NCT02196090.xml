    <textblock>
      Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a condition associated with recurrent intrusive&#xD;
      distressing thoughts, images and urges compelling the person to perform neutralizing acts or&#xD;
      thoughts to the extent of significantly interfering with their daily activities. The symptoms&#xD;
      of OCD are associated with both subjective and objective signs of distress. Treatment for&#xD;
      Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is often associated with significant subjective distress with&#xD;
      high dropout rates and often only limited improvement. Attempts to reduce distress in anxiety&#xD;
      often focus on re-establishing the sympathovagal balance by enhancing the vagal or&#xD;
      parasympathetic tone and it has been suggested that this can reduce the mobilization&#xD;
      behaviours of fight or flight response and improve emotion regulation. This study will&#xD;
      investigate the effect of a procedure potentially reducing distress and improving outcome of&#xD;
      treatment in inpatients admitted for treatment for OCD to the Anxiety Disorders Residential&#xD;
      Unit. The procedure will be based on increasing vagal tone by application of cold face mask&#xD;
      on 3 consecutive days in addition to the standard Exposure and Response Prevention therapy&#xD;
      (ERP).&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a condition associated with recurrent intrusive&#xD;
           distressing thoughts, images and urges compelling the person to perform neutralizing&#xD;
           acts or thoughts to the extent of significantly interfering with their daily activities.&#xD;
           The symptoms of OCD are associated with both subjective and objective signs of distress.&#xD;
           Psychophysiological studies of OCD and other anxiety disorders often report abnormal&#xD;
           sympathovagal balance with decreased parasympathetic or vagal tone and increased&#xD;
           sympathetic tone (Hoehn-Saric et al 1995, Broderick et al 2013, Kawano et al 2012,&#xD;
           Pittig et al 2013, Buhlmann et al 2007, Blechert et al 2007, Friedman and Thayer 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first line treatment of OCD is Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) which includes&#xD;
           Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) when the patient tests out their fears without&#xD;
           responding by compulsive act (NICE Clinical Guideline 31). ERP treatment itself is often&#xD;
           associated with significant subjective distress (Kellner et al 2012) with dropout rates&#xD;
           up to 20% and only minimal improvement in another 20% of patients (Foa 2010). Various&#xD;
           modalities of treatment reducing the subjective and physiological distress have been&#xD;
           used in treatment of anxiety disorders and symptoms (Streeter et al 2012, Miu et al&#xD;
           2009, Gorman et al 2000) and similar approach could increase the rates of improvement&#xD;
           and adherence to ERP treatment in OCD. Most of the attempts to reduce distress in&#xD;
           anxiety focus on re-establishing the sympathovagal balance by enhancing the vagal or&#xD;
           parasympathetic tone and it has been suggested that this can reduce the mobilization&#xD;
           behaviours of fight or flight response and improve emotion regulation (Austin et al&#xD;
           2007). Disgust is an emotion implicated to have significant role on anxiety disorders&#xD;
           such as OCD with contamination fears (Moretz and McKay 2008). It has been shown to have&#xD;
           only limited response to exposure therapy (Olatunji et al 2009) and can be associated&#xD;
           with increased avoidance and reduced compliance with exposures (Olatunji et al 2007)&#xD;
           possibly contributing to poorer treatment outcome. Disgust can be associated with&#xD;
           changes in sympathovagal balance (Ottaviani et al 2013) but the effect of manoeuvres&#xD;
           affecting this balance has not been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vagal tonus can be increased with specific procedures called vagal manoeuvres. These&#xD;
           include the diving reflex, Valsalva manoeuvre, pressure on the eyeball and carotid sinus&#xD;
           massage, with the diving reflex being one of the most effective (Arnold 1999). The&#xD;
           diving reflex is a phylogenetically ancient physiological phenomenon believed to&#xD;
           facilitate survival after immersion in cold water through bradycardia and peripheral&#xD;
           vasoconstriction redistributing blood flow to vital organs (Gooden 1994). The combined&#xD;
           bradycardia and vasoconstriction effect indicates on complex sympathovagal activation&#xD;
           and the bradycardia itself is believed to be due to central vagal activation (Stemper et&#xD;
           al 2002). The natural trigger for diving reflex includes change in body position, apnoea&#xD;
           and sensation of cold and wet surface on the face and a cold sensation on the face is&#xD;
           sufficient to induce the vagal response. This is believed to be transmitted by the&#xD;
           ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve and can be achieved by using cold compressions&#xD;
           or cold face gel masks (Khurana et al. 1980).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The physiological response during diving reflex can be measured by recording standard&#xD;
           physiological measures such as heart rate, blood pressure or skin conductance. Heart&#xD;
           rate and its interpretation in terms of heart rate variability is becoming more&#xD;
           frequently utilized to evaluate the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic&#xD;
           nervous system. Most frequently used is the frequency domain approach which allows&#xD;
           differentiating specific frequency bands. The low frequency (LF) band groups the&#xD;
           variability between 0.05-0.15Hz and is believed to represent the sympathetic cardiac&#xD;
           control with slower unmyelinated nerve fibres while the high frequency (HF) band&#xD;
           including frequencies between 0.15-0.4Hz reflects the parasympathetic or vagal control&#xD;
           with faster myelinated nerve fibres (Berntson et al 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a simple vagal manoeuvre, that is a cold&#xD;
      face gel mask application, on subjective measures of Anxiety, Disgust, Strength of belief in&#xD;
      obsession, Strength of urge to carry out the compulsion, Strength of belief in Theory A/B and&#xD;
      an increase in Feeling of being supported, Readiness to face the fear during the ERP&#xD;
      treatment of OCD by using a single-case series experimental design and to explore the&#xD;
      relationship between subjective measures and sympathovagal balance measured by heart rate&#xD;
      variability. Our hypothesis is that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ERP with application of cold gel face mask (Condition B) will be associated with faster&#xD;
           reduction of visual analogue scales of Anxiety, Disgust, Strength of belief in&#xD;
           obsession, Strength of urge to carry out the compulsion, Strength of belief in Theory&#xD;
           A/B and an increase in Feeling of being supported, Readiness to face the fear compared&#xD;
           to ERP as usual with simply resisting the compulsive behaviour (Condition C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase in vagal tonus as documented by heart rate variability measures will correlate&#xD;
           with the effect on visual analogue scales of Anxiety, Disgust, Strength of belief in&#xD;
           obsession, Strength of urge to carry out the compulsion, Strength of belief in Theory&#xD;
           A/B, Feeling of being supported and Readiness to face the fear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Participants: Participants will be recruited from the Anxiety Disorders Residential Unit&#xD;
      (ADRU), Bethlem Royal Hospital. All patients admitted to ADRU have the opportunity to consent&#xD;
      to be contacted about participating in research studies. Only patients admitted to ADRU for&#xD;
      treatment of OCD who provided such initial consent will be approached by Dr Roman Duncko&#xD;
      regarding the written informed consent to participate in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Procedure and Design: On each day of the study, therapy will begin with the Baseline&#xD;
      phase (Condition A) and record the psychological (visual analogue scales of Anxiety, Disgust,&#xD;
      Belief in obsession, Strength of urge for compulsion, Strength of belief in Theory A/B,&#xD;
      Feeling of being supported, Readiness to face the fear) and physiological measures (HR&#xD;
      recording) on 3-5 consecutive 5min intervals or until stable baseline measures are achieved.&#xD;
      After that, the participant will proceed with the Intervention phase by applying ERP with the&#xD;
      use of triggers as identified on their individual hierarchy. Each ERP session will follow the&#xD;
      same structure by first obtaining the session baseline at 3 time points, then exposure to&#xD;
      trigger and continue with preventing the response while applying the cold face mask for 5&#xD;
      minutes (Condition B) or without using the face mask (Condition C). Psychological and&#xD;
      physiological measures will be obtained in 5 minute intervals until return to session&#xD;
      baseline. ERP sessions will follow in alternating order for 4 sessions per day (Day 1: ABCBC,&#xD;
      Day 2: ACBCB, Day 3: ABCBC). All baseline and exposure measures will be recorded by the&#xD;
      investigator who will by accompanying the participant during the procedure. Cold face gel&#xD;
      masks will be stored in refrigerator at the ADRU and will be available to the participant as&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Psychological measures: Visual analogue scales for measurement of severity of Anxiety,&#xD;
      Disgust, Strength of belief in obsession, Strength of urge to carry out the compulsion,&#xD;
      Strength of belief in theory A/B, Strength of belief in Theory A/B, Feeling of being&#xD;
      supported, Readiness to face the fear will be used by the participant at time points as&#xD;
      specified above. In addition to this the participant will be assessed for their clinical&#xD;
      symptoms (YBOCS, OCI) on weekly basis as part of their standard treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the last day of the study, participants will be asked to complete the Client Satisfaction&#xD;
      Questionnaire based on (Larsen et al 1979) to explore the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      the cold face gel mask application during ERP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Physiological measures: Heart rate variability analysis will be performed on data&#xD;
      recorded with a Polar RS800CX heart rate monitor using a H2 chest sensor. Polar monitors have&#xD;
      been tested against standard clinical ECG equipment and found to be suitable for heart rate&#xD;
      variability analysis (Vanderlei et al 2008). In the morning of the study day, the&#xD;
      participants will place the Polar heart rate sensor on their chest using the elastic strap.&#xD;
      They will be instructed how to use the heart rate monitor watch Polar RS800CX to record the&#xD;
      heart rate and press the mark recording button at specific times during each procedure. At&#xD;
      the end of each study day, the data will be downloaded from the heart rate monitor watch and&#xD;
      3 time intervals of 2 minutes will be identified: at the beginning of the condition - time 0,&#xD;
      at the beginning of the procedure - time 15, at the end of the condition - time 45. Time&#xD;
      intervals will be screened for artefacts and used for heart rate variability analysis using&#xD;
      standalone analysis software (Niskanen et al 2004). Variables selected for analysis will&#xD;
      include heart rate per minute, time domain measures (RMSSD, NN50) and frequency domain&#xD;
      measures (nLF at 0.05-0.15Hz, nHF at 0.15-0.04Hz, LF/HF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. Data analysis: Data will be initially evaluated by visual inspection for each participant&#xD;
      individually. After that, values obtained for a specific time interval and phase will be&#xD;
      averaged among all participants and again evaluated by visual inspection. Percentage of&#xD;
      non-overlapping data analysis will be performed to detect statistically significant change&#xD;
      between the baseline and intervention phase. Pearson's correlation will be used for&#xD;
      correlation analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Project timetable&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is planned to run for 6-12 months depending on the rate of recruitment of&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Expertise in team&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr David Veale is a consultant psychiatrist in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy at the South&#xD;
      London and Maudsley Trust and a Honorary Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry,&#xD;
      Kings College London. Specialisms include obsessive compulsive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr Roman Duncko, PhD is a ST5 trainee in General Adult Psychiatry at the South London and&#xD;
      Maudsley Trust with long-term research interest in anxiety disorders and autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ethical considerations are outlined in the Participant Information and Consent Form that&#xD;
      will be distributed to participants. All patients admitted to ARDU who fulfil the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be approached about participating in the study. All participants will require&#xD;
      signing an informed consent to participate. All information and data obtained during the&#xD;
      study will be kept in strict confidence. Upon recruitment, every participant will be assigned&#xD;
      an anonymous code and the lists linking the code with personal identifying information will&#xD;
      be kept secure and separate from the data. Only the Principal Investigator and researchers&#xD;
      authorized by the PI will have access to the identifying lists. Every participant will&#xD;
      undergo the same procedures with slightly variable order. No deception will be used and&#xD;
      participants will be informed as to exactly what the study is about. All participants will be&#xD;
      informed at the time of providing consent to participate that they can withdraw from the&#xD;
      study at any time and that this will not affect the care they will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Dissemination and implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the study will be used for poster and/or oral presentations at suitable&#xD;
      conferences and for preparing a manuscript for submission in a scientific journal. Depending&#xD;
      on the outcome of the study further research will be planned to evaluate the effect of cold&#xD;
      face gel mask in a study with randomized control trial design.&#xD;
