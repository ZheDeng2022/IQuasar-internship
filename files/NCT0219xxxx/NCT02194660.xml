      Aims: to Establish the FLS services at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and its&#xD;
      Beihu Branch (BB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: From Jan., 2014, two related fracture liaison services (FLSs) following the 13&#xD;
      'Capture the Fracture Best Practice Standards' were implemented at the National Taiwan&#xD;
      University Hospital (NTUH) health care system. The main hospital (MH) program enrolled&#xD;
      patient with 1) new hip fracture 2) newly identified radiographic vertebral fractures or 3)&#xD;
      clinical vertebral fractures from both inpatients and outpatients. The Beihu branch (BB)&#xD;
      program enrolled only the later two types of patients from outpatients. During the whole&#xD;
      study period, two programs planed to enroll 600 fracture patients. Each patient would be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, and every 4 month for at least one year.&#xD;

      Background:The Asia Fracture Gap Taiwan Study (AFGTS) showed that among fragility fracture&#xD;
      sufferers, only 1/4 of them underwent bone mineral density (BMD) tests and 1/3 of them&#xD;
      received treatments for osteoporosis. Secondary fragility fracture prevention services are&#xD;
      needed to improve the care gaps&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Aims: to Establish the FLS services at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and&#xD;
      its Beihu Branch (BB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The FLS was designed following the 13 'Capture the Fracture Best Practice Standards'.&#xD;
      The National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) institutional review board approved the study&#xD;
      in Jan., 2014. Patients were eligible to be enrolled into the main hospital (MH) service if&#xD;
      they had&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. new hip fracture in orthopedic ward&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. newly identified radiographic vertebral fractures from plan films in geriatric ward or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. clinical vertebral fractures in outpatient clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in outpatient clinics of BB were eligible to be enrolled if they had (1) clinical&#xD;
      vertebral fractures or (2) newly identified asymtomatic radiological vertebral fractures by a&#xD;
      routine weekly review of every plan film of thoracic or lumbar spine regardless of the reason&#xD;
      for it.They were excluded from the service if they had life expectancy shorter than 2 years&#xD;
      of life or not be able to complete study assessments for communication or cognitive problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis-related assessments, treatments, consultations on diet, medications, exercise,&#xD;
      fall prevention were given mainly by care managers. A system is set up to remind patients to&#xD;
      take their medications at home or to return to clinic for regular injections of medications.&#xD;
      Follow up assessments included adherence to education instructions, medications, fall and&#xD;
      fracture incidences. During the whole study period, we planed to enroll 600 fracture&#xD;
      patients. Each patient would be assessed at baseline, and every 4 months last for two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establish domestic FLS model and database Publish preliminary results at the 2014 the IOF 5th&#xD;
      Regionals Asia Pacific Meeting in Taipei in November.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating physicians and care managers will learn new skills in managing osteoporosis&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application for Best Practice Recognition for the IOF Capture the Fracture Campaign&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have enrolled 371 eligible patients into FLS services. From the NTUH program, BMD tests&#xD;
      were completed within 8 weeks for over 90% of participants. Also, anti-osteoporosis&#xD;
      medication (AOMs) were prescribed to about 90% of participants eligible for National Health&#xD;
      Insurance reimbursements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014, National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and its BeiHu Branch (BB) were awarded&#xD;
      the gold medal and silver medal accredited best practice programs from the 'Capture the&#xD;
      Fracture' campaign from International Osteoporosis Foundation, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary results were presented at annual scientific meeting of the Taiwanese&#xD;
      Osteoporosis Association, at Madrid, Spain, and the IOF 5th Regionals Asia Pacific Meeting in&#xD;
      Taipei, Taiwan, and the World Congress on Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal&#xD;
      Diseases, at Milan, Italy.&#xD;
