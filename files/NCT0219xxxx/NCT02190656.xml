  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK in both males and females. The rectum&#xD;
      is the most commonly affected part of the bowel. Improvements in surgery have meant that many&#xD;
      patients with rectal cancer can now undergo surgery that removes the rectum and avoids a&#xD;
      permanent stoma. The operation that most patients have is an anterior resection of the&#xD;
      rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately this surgery frequently leads to a change in bowel function, with patients&#xD;
      suffering from incontinence, urgency and unpredictability a problem known as anterior&#xD;
      resection syndrome. These problems are believed to be fairly common following surgery but&#xD;
      follow up appointments have traditionally concentrated on ensuring that the cancer has not&#xD;
      returned and have not reviewed functional outcomes in enough detail. Because of this we are&#xD;
      unsure exactly how common the problems described are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will allow us to determine how many patients have ongoing symptoms&#xD;
      following their surgery for rectal cancer. It will also allow us to use a newly developed&#xD;
      scoring system the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) score for the first time in a UK&#xD;
      population, to ensure that it can accurately be used in the future to measure the problem and&#xD;
      aid development of new therapies. An appreciation of the impact of symptoms on postoperative&#xD;
      quality of life will encourage routine assessment of functional outcomes in clinical&#xD;
      practice, allowing identification of patients who may benefit from treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the main aims when carrying out surgery for rectal cancer is to avoid patients ending&#xD;
      up with a permanent stoma. The current standard operation for resection of the rectum is an&#xD;
      anterior resection. A large proportion of the patients undergoing this procedure develop&#xD;
      anterior resection syndrome, with significant alteration of their bowel habit, including&#xD;
      urgency, incontinence and unpredictability. Many definitions for this problem have been used&#xD;
      and until recently there was no specifically designed tool for measuring it. There has never&#xD;
      been a large scale study in the UK to tell us how common the problem is. A meta-analysis&#xD;
      combining results from small studies show marked variation in the frequency of symptoms&#xD;
      ranging from 285%, mainly because of the different methods of assessment used in the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LARS score was recently developed by a research group in Denmark. Their results show that&#xD;
      45.9% of patients had major LARS at 12 months following surgery. This is nearly half of all&#xD;
      patients in their sample and clearly represents an important problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior resection syndrome is known to have a negative effect on quality of life. It is a&#xD;
      multifactorial condition and is increased in patients have chemotherapy and radiotherapy.&#xD;
      There are treatments available and also in development which may help patients. However in&#xD;
      clinical practice, patients are not routinely asked about their functional outcome and the&#xD;
      effect that these symptoms can have on patients' lives is often not discussed. The urgent&#xD;
      need for further research into the longterm functional effects of treatments for cancer has&#xD;
      been acknowledged by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the&#xD;
      National Cancer Survivorship Initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining baseline prevalence in the UK and validating the LARS score will allow accurate&#xD;
      preoperative counselling of patients about functional outcomes following surgery for rectal&#xD;
      cancer. It will facilitate comparison between populations, further helping to determine risk&#xD;
      factors and aiding in development of therapeutic interventions. An appreciation of the impact&#xD;
      of anterior resection syndrome on postoperative quality of life will encourage routine&#xD;
      assessment of functional outcomes in clinical practice, allowing identification of patients&#xD;
      who may benefit from treatment.&#xD;
