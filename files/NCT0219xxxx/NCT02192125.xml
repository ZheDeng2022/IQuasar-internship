      The study examines the possible application of the rehabilitation platform REWIRE.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The REWIRE rehabilitation platform consists of three hierarchical components: the &quot;Patient&#xD;
      Station&quot; (PS), which is installed in the home environment of the patient; the &quot;Hospital&#xD;
      Station&quot; (HS), which allows an exchange of information with more horsepower and is served by&#xD;
      the therapists in the hospital; and the &quot;Networking Station&quot; (NS), which allows a combination&#xD;
      of a plurality of HS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PS consists of a standard laptop with a specifically created for the rehabilitation&#xD;
      REWIRE platform and pre-installed software (Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy, Applied&#xD;
      Intelligent Systems Laboratory Department of Computer Science). In the context of a training&#xD;
      system connected to the computer, the software enables the collection of data, which are&#xD;
      recorded as part of the training. In this study only exercises for balance ability are part&#xD;
      of the training program. The training system consists of a so-called Tymoplate® (Tyromotion,&#xD;
      Austria), a medical device class 1 with CE certification and approval by the FDA for use in&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation after stroke. The Tymoplate® is connected to the computer and allows by&#xD;
      means of a base plate with integrated pressure sensors and custom-developed training&#xD;
      software, various postural biofeedback exercises. In combination with 3D cameras (Kinect®,&#xD;
      PrimeSense, CA, USA), the patient sees him-/herself or an avatar in real time on a screen&#xD;
      which moves in the virtual training environment. By various, attractive and entertaining&#xD;
      designed training games as well as provided audio-visual feedback and balanced score system,&#xD;
      patients should be maximum motivated to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HS enables the interaction between patient and therapist and essentially consists of a&#xD;
      MySQL database with web-based interface. The data collected on each PS can be retrieved from&#xD;
      the HS and can be used by therapists in order to set up the training program on the PS to&#xD;
      control and to adjust the difficulty level of the exercises to the individual performance of&#xD;
      each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NS also consists of a database. It links collected training data and the associated&#xD;
      epidemiological data of different HS at the regional level (potentially also between&#xD;
      different health institutions) to identify on the application of statistical algorithms&#xD;
      general models for the description of relaxation processes in rehabilitation medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this simple way a frequent and intensive training is without direct therapeutic help in&#xD;
      the home setting at low cost possible. By attractive and entertaining designed training games&#xD;
      as well as interaction and feedback by the therapist, patients are motivated to train each&#xD;
      day with the system and to continually improve in the games. The supervision of the training&#xD;
      by the therapist with the rehabilitation platform REWIRE additionally serves to recognize&#xD;
      improvements of the individual performance or problems and to adapt the difficulty level of&#xD;
      the exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Patient Registries&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient recruitment Suitable stationed patients at Cereneo in Vitznau will be informed&#xD;
           about the possibility of participation in the study. If interested, the patients will&#xD;
           receive the patient information and can decide within a week whether they will&#xD;
           participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection We will collect data on daily usage of the patient as well as hospital&#xD;
           stations. Patient usage will be regressed on the patient's deficit severity, age and&#xD;
           gender to gather preliminary knowledge on whether certain subgroups of patients accept&#xD;
           the system better than others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      System usability During and after the pilot trial all involved physicians and physical&#xD;
      therapists will answer a standardised questionnaire on system usability. Specifically we will&#xD;
      look at the number of instructions and therapy modifications given to the patient and whether&#xD;
      the therapist giving the instruction thinks that the patient has reacted accordingly. REWIRE&#xD;
      will be also evaluated, in terms of usability of software instruments, degree of control of&#xD;
      the rehabilitation process and value of the results reported by REWIRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Data management The investigators will use paper case report forms (CRF), one for each&#xD;
      enrolled study participant, to be filled in with all relevant data pertaining to the subject&#xD;
      during the study. The investigator will document the participation of each study subject on&#xD;
      the enrolment log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All requested information in the CRF should be completed in a neat legible manner. Use of a&#xD;
      black ball pen is recommended to ensure clarity of reproduced copies in the CRF. All&#xD;
      corrections in a paper CRF must be made in a way that does not obscure the original entry.&#xD;
      The correct data must be inserted, dated and initialled by the investigator Data that are not&#xD;
      available or not done should be made clear by adding NA or ND. A declaration ensuring&#xD;
      accuracy of data recorded in the case report forms must be signed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRFs will be kept current to reflect subject status at each phase during the course of study.&#xD;
      Subjects will not to be identified in the CRF by name. Appropriate coded identification (e.g.&#xD;
      subject number) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be assured that any authorised person, who may perform data entries and changes in&#xD;
      the CRF, can be identified. A list with signatures and initials of all authorised persons&#xD;
      will be filed in the study site file and the trial master file, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documented medical histories and narrative statements relative to the subject's progress&#xD;
      during the study will be maintained. These records will also include the following: originals&#xD;
      or copies of laboratory and other medical test results which must be kept on file with the&#xD;
      individual subject's CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CIP will specify what will be maintained for each subject. The investigators assure to&#xD;
      perform a complete and accurate documentation of the subject data in the CRF. All data&#xD;
      entered into the CRF with exception of (for which data the CRF will be source data to be&#xD;
      specified for each study) must also be available in the individual subject file either as&#xD;
      print-outs or as notes taken by either the investigator or another responsible person&#xD;
      assigned by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data which is not included in the CRF will be stored in a secured access database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Essential documents must be retained for at least 10 years after the regular end or a&#xD;
      premature termination of the respective study (VKlin Art. 25). Essential documents will be&#xD;
      retained according to local law in case of international multicentre studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient files and source data must be archived for the longest possible period of time&#xD;
      according to the feasibility of the investigational site, institution or private practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reporting for adverse events Adverse events will be reported to the Ethics Committee&#xD;
           northwest/ central Switzerland EKNZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change management Sample size assessment to specify the number of participants or&#xD;
           participant years necessary to demonstrate an effect Number of patients: 15 stroke&#xD;
           patients. Due to the likely large heterogeneity of the study population (different&#xD;
           weights severity of paresis and ataxia, as well as partly cognitive deficits) a&#xD;
           sufficiently large number of patients must be tested. Currently, there are no data which&#xD;
           would allow a power analysis with respect to the primary or secondary end point. In case&#xD;
           of premature withdrawl from the study, those participants will be replaced so that at&#xD;
           least 16 participants carry out the 3-month training program completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data to address situations where variables are reported as missing,&#xD;
      unavailable, &quot;non-reported,&quot; uninterpretable, or considered missing because of data&#xD;
      inconsistency or out-of-range results If in individual clinical tests the data is missing,&#xD;
      the concerning test cannot be analysed and will not be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan describing the analytical principles and statistical techniques to&#xD;
      be employed in order to address the primary and secondary objectives, as specified in the&#xD;
      study protocol or plan Primarily, the feasibility of the technical and practical&#xD;
      implementation of the rehabilitation REWIRE platform will be evaluated in the&#xD;
      home-environment of the study participants. Furthermore, the satisfaction and patient&#xD;
      compliance and acceptance of the system by the attending physicians and therapists will be&#xD;
      measured. Therefore, structured-standardized questionnaires are used and the quality (if&#xD;
      numerically tangible) will be evaluated by means of Likert scales. Secondary, the effects to&#xD;
      use the training system on the functional recovery and quality of life as well as on the&#xD;
      structural plasticity of the brain will be evaluated. In terms of functional recovery and&#xD;
      quality of life correlation analyses will be performed. Related data from stroke patients&#xD;
      (from the stroke registry ZORRO, KEK-ZH-E-08/2009) will be compared with those from the&#xD;
      REWIRE-study. The evaluation of the data measured by means of magnetic resonance imaging,&#xD;
      require before carrying out a correlation analysis the application of parametric statistical&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
