    <measure>Number of Times Vomiting Occurs After Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The number of times vomiting occurs after chemotherapy for each participant during 0-120 hours. The evaluator completed daily diaries for each time point.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rhodes Index of Nausea, Vomiting and Retching</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The RINVR scale has 8 items . The scale divides the occurrence of nausea , vomiting , and retching within 12 hours of tumor chemotherapy patients into 5 grades , which are scored from 0 to 4 points . The lower the score , the better . The RINVR scale can be divided into three dimensions : symptom experience time , symptom frequency and symptom severity .</description>

The total FACT-G score ranges from 0 to 108 and is calculated by the sum of the subscales, with higher scores indicating greater functional status</description>

    <description>Assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS scale). It includes fourteen items, seven of which assess anxiety and the other seven assess depression (30). The total scores range from 0 to 21 for depression and anxiety, respectively, with higher scores indicating more depression and anxiety.</description>

Standard antiemetics for all groups are based on American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline. 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) antagonist (Ramosetron , Tropisetron)and dexamethasone are supplied from the first day of chemtherapy,and lasting for 3-5days. If nausea and/or vomiting is persistent and failed to respond to the antiemetic treatment , based on the experience of each clinician, the other advanced 5-HT3 antagonist or a neurokinin 1 antagonist(NK-1) will be chosen.</description>

    <description>All participants were supine in the hospital bed. A disposable sterile acupuncture needle (ø 0.30 × 40 mm, Hwato) was inserted vertically at approximately 20-30 mm until &quot;De Qi&quot; (sensation of soreness, numbness, distension, etc. around the acupoint) was reported by the participants. Then, the needle handle was clamped via a metal clip to connect to the positive electrode of the electric acupuncture apparatus (Huatuo, SDZ-V model, Suzhou Medical Appliance). Another reference electrode was placed 1 cm above the CV12 acupoints of the stimulation point, where no acupoints or meridians passed through. A dilatational wave at a frequency of 2/10 Hz and a current intensity at the highest level tolerated by the patient, with a maximum intensity no more than 10 mA, were used to deliver the EA stimulation. People in the intervention groups were offered a standardized 30-minute EA session once daily from the 1st day of the four-day chemotherapy cycle.</description>

          <description>The control group will receive standard antiemetics alone. Standard antiemetics for all groups are based on American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline. 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) antagonist (Ramosetron , Tropisetron)and dexamethasone are supplied from the first day of chemtherapy,and lasting for 3-5days. If nausea and/or vomiting is persistent and failed to respond to the antiemetic treatment , based on the experience of each clinician, the other advanced 5-HT3 antagonist or a neurokinin 1 antagonist(NK-1) will be chosen.&#xD;
