             pressure greater than 90 mm Hg [NCI-CTCAE v4.0] on mean of 3 consecutive readings&#xD;
             despite optimal medical management. Hypertension may be corrected by adding or&#xD;
             adjusting anti-hypertensives prior to the initiation of treatment at the discretion of&#xD;
             the practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or clinically significant cardiac disease including congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, or unstable angina.&#xD;

             surviving a cancer that was curatively treated and without evidence of disease more&#xD;
             than 1 year before randomization are allowed. All cancer treatments must be completed&#xD;
             at least 1 year prior to start of study treatment.&#xD;

             a random urine sample. If the result is normal then no additional testing is required.&#xD;
             If the result is abnormal, a 24 hour urine will be collected to determine if&#xD;
             proteinuria is less than Grade 3.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of another investigational drug or device during, or within 3 weeks of&#xD;
             starting study treatment.&#xD;
