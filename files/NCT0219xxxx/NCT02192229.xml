      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the proposed study is to examine the Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of&#xD;
      the Dose Regimen of Vitamin D 50,000 IU (Biodal) tablet supplementation in the treatment of&#xD;
      population with vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, double-blind placebo, Parallel design comparing vitamin D with Placebo will be&#xD;
      conducted on 60 Healthy males and females with vitamin D deficiency, age from 18 to 49 years&#xD;
      who attend the rehabilitation clinics at Jordan University Hospital .Participants who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be asked to sign an informed witnessed consent form. Results obtained&#xD;
      are expected to assess the safety and efficacy of the dose regimen used in this study as per&#xD;
      Biodal SmPC. This study will also contribute to the global body of knowledge in this field.&#xD;
      The major findings generated from this study could open certain avenues for further research&#xD;
      through the association of the status of vitamin D in serum .&#xD;

      The study design will be a prospective randomized double blind parallel design comparing&#xD;
      Vitamin D with Placebo. This study will be conducted in Jordan University Hospital (JUH). The&#xD;
      participants will be Healthy males and females with vitamin D deficiency (18 to 49 years&#xD;
      old). All eligible males and females who agree to participate in the study will sign an&#xD;
      informed witnessed consent form at the beginning of the study. The expected duration of&#xD;
      participants participation will be around 120 days and the number of visits for each&#xD;
      participant will be 6 visits divided as follows; the first visit will be before 7 days of the&#xD;
      initiation of the trial (screening period), the second on day zero of the treatment period,&#xD;
      the third on day 30, the fourth on day 60, the fifth on day 90 and the sixth or the last&#xD;
      visit will be on day 104 (after 14 days of the last treatment). Therefore the treatment&#xD;
      period will be 90 days and the post treatment follow up period will be 14 days.&#xD;
