      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-year adherence to oral anti-osteoporosis medication (AOMs) was only about 30%. In recent&#xD;
      years, efforts have been made to change the delivery of these medications from oral form to&#xD;
      injection form every, 3, 6 or 12 months to increase adherence. However, both patients and&#xD;
      providers are sometimes confused about the multiple choices. Also, patients may receive extra&#xD;
      medications if providers did not keep tract of their previous AOM uses or patients may&#xD;
      changes providers. There were urgent needs to provide AOM monitoring and management services&#xD;
      to improve cares.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish a anti-osteoporosis medication management service at National Taiwan University&#xD;
      Hospital and its BeiHu Branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating physicians will select those eligible for services and refer to study&#xD;
      coordinators. Study coordinators will conduct baseline assessments on osteoporosis/fracture&#xD;
      risks, record medical conditions, AOMs, provide educations on osteoporosis, fracture,&#xD;
      sarcopenia, fall, medications, nutrition, and exercise. They also arrange return clinic&#xD;
      visit, telephone reminder and follow up for patients, and communicate with providers on&#xD;
      regular bases. the investigators plan to enroll 500 patients with 18-month follow up for&#xD;
      each.&#xD;

    <description>Medication adherence will be assessed at 4, 8, 12, 18 months after enrollments. Final results will be reported at 18 month. If the patient changes medication, all AOMs adherence will be combined.&#xD;
Specific formula is as below:&#xD;
for oral medications, adherence is defined as # medication taken/ #medication prescribed within past 3 months for injection medications, adherence is defined as # of injection/ # of due injection since baseline or last follow up phone call.&#xD;
Statistics: Simple counts of adherence % among all participants.</description>
