  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to monitor far field sensing artifacts of CRM devices in the presence of the&#xD;
      IMED-4&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The implanted CRM device will have shock therapy and rate sensor temporarily deactivated or&#xD;
      placed in magnet mode during the time the IMED-4 is activated. The IMED-4 will be activated&#xD;
      for a time not to exceed 15 minutes. During the time the IMED-4 is active, the CRM device&#xD;
      programmer will print the voltage sensing of the implanted lead in real-time. The printout&#xD;
      will be examined for the presence of far-field sensing artifacts.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects &gt; 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are ambulatory not requiring assistance for ambulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have been informed of the nature of the study and agree to its provisions&#xD;
             and have provided written informed consent as approved by the IRB&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant or lactating or who have been pregnant within the past three&#xD;
             months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have tattoos on the back in the electrode patch placement region&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had a past allergic reaction to adhesives&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have poor general physical/mental health that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, will not allow the subject to be a good study candidate (i.e. other&#xD;
             disease processes, mental capacity, substance abuse, shortened life expectance, etc.)&#xD;
