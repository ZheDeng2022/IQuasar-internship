      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the efficacy of adjuvant nivolumab monotherapy in completely resected Merkel cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (MCC) patients; i.e. the primary endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS) in arm A&#xD;
      at 12 months, defined as the number of patients alive and free of disease at 12 months after&#xD;
      randomization compared to DFS in arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess safety and additional efficacy parameters of the nivolumab treatment in MCC, as&#xD;
      well as to characterize potential biomarkers; secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Adverse events according to CTCAE, Version 4.0 criteria, that are definitely, probably,&#xD;
      or possibly related to the administration of nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Overall survival rate at 12 months, defined as the number of patients surviving at 12&#xD;
      months after randomization divided by the total number of patients randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) DFS rate at 12 months, defined as the number of patients alive and free of disease at&#xD;
      12 months after randomization divided by the total number of patients randomized&#xD;

      This is a national, open-label, randomized, multicenter phase II study to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      of adjuvant therapy with immune checkpoint blocking antibodies in completely resected Merkel&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (MCC) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCC is a rare (incidence of 0.44 per 100,000), highly aggressive form of skin cancer. Indeed,&#xD;
      MCC has a dramatically higher mortality rate after initial diagnosis than malignant melanoma&#xD;
      (37 vs. 15 percent). Almost half of the patients with completely resected MCC will relapse&#xD;
      with loco-regional or distant metastases within the first two years after initial diagnosis&#xD;
      of this highly immunogenic cancer. This high mortality rate is largely due to the fact that&#xD;
      to date there is no established adjuvant therapy for completely resected MCC, and none of the&#xD;
      until recently available therapeutic interventions was able to improve overall survival of&#xD;
      patients suffering from metastatic disease. Consequently, new therapeutic strategies both for&#xD;
      the adjuvant as well as the palliative setting are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the European Commission granted a clinical trial for metastatic MCC within the FP7&#xD;
      HEALTH2011.2.4.1-1 call. The present proposal aims at using this newly established network to&#xD;
      investigate an adjuvant immune therapy for MCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologic data suggest that there are approximately 2500 new MCC cases per year within&#xD;
      the EU (European Union), more than 1000 of these patients will die from their disease. MCC&#xD;
      usually affects the elderly. The median age at diagnosis is 70 years, and there is a 5- to&#xD;
      10-fold increase in incidence after age 70 as compared with an age less than 60 years. Thus,&#xD;
      with an ageing European population the impact of this deadly cancer will increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As compared to most cancers, MCC is particularly linked to immune suppression. Indeed, 7.8%&#xD;
      of MCC patients are profoundly immune suppressed, with a 16-fold over-representation of MCC&#xD;
      compared with the normal incidence. Notably, the impact of immune surveillance on the course&#xD;
      of MCC is much more pronounced than on that of melanoma: while the ratio of melanoma to MCC&#xD;
      is 60:1 in the normal population, it is 6:1 in the immune suppressed population. Moreover,&#xD;
      there are more than 20 reported cases of complete spontaneous regressions of confirmed MCCs,&#xD;
      which suggest the ability of the immune system to exert a sudden immune recognition and&#xD;
      clearance of this tumor. Notably, regressions may also be induced by cessation of immune&#xD;
      suppression. Another line of evidence for the immunogenicity of MCC is the observation, that&#xD;
      a strong inflammatory infiltrate, particularly CD8+ T cells, within the tumor is associated&#xD;
      with a favorable prognosis. The immunogenicity of MCC can be explained by the recently&#xD;
      recognized viral pathogenesis of this tumor entity. Indeed, preliminary data from our MCC&#xD;
      research network suggest that immune dominant T-cell epitopes derived from the oncogenic&#xD;
      virus elicit spontaneous immune responses in MCC patients. Consequently, immune modulating&#xD;
      strategies are particularly attractive for the therapy of MCC and may improve the&#xD;
      disease-free survival as well as the overall survival of MCC patients if given in an adjuvant&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PD-1 immune checkpoint pathway, which comprises the PD-1 T-cell coinhibitory receptor and&#xD;
      its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressed on tumor and immune cells in the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment, mediates local immune resistance. Monoclonal antibodies blocking this&#xD;
      pathway are active against advanced tumors of several different types, providing a &quot;common&#xD;
      denominator&quot; for cancer therapy. PD-L1 expression in pretreatment tumor specimens may&#xD;
      identify patients and tumor types that are more likely to have a response to PD-1 pathway&#xD;
      blockade. An elevated tumor mutational burden or association with viral carcinogenesis,&#xD;
      creating new determinants for immune recognition, has also been associated with tumor&#xD;
      regressions in individual patients and the responsiveness of tumor subtypes to anti-PD-1&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial trial design, the immune modulating treatment was based on CTLA-4 blockade by&#xD;
      ipilimumab; however, the advent of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in the palliative treatment of MCC&#xD;
      (presented at AACR, ASCO and ESMO) dramatically changed the treatment environment to an&#xD;
      extent that applying treatments other than by PD-1/PD-L1 blockade had become very difficult.&#xD;
      Moreover, the side effects of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking are far less frequent than side effects of&#xD;
      ipilimumab. Consequently, randomization into the previous Ipilimumab treatment arm A will be&#xD;
      stopped. New patients will be randomized to nivolumab treatment instead. Patients randomized&#xD;
      already into the Ipilimumab-arm will be evaluated descriptively. Patients randomized into the&#xD;
      observation arm (arm B) will be evaluated together with the newly randomized arm B-patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (HuMAb), which binds to&#xD;
      PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. It is authorized in the EU&#xD;
      since 19.06.2015 for monotherapy of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma and after&#xD;
      prior chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Clinical activity was noted across a range of doses&#xD;
      (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg). The safety profile of nivolumab&#xD;
      monotherapy is manageable and generally consistent across completed and ongoing clinical&#xD;
      trials with no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) reached at any dose tested up to 10 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab/Yervoy® is a new therapeutic strategy targeting an immune checkpoint (CTLA-4),&#xD;
      which has provided significant benefit in overall survival in two phase III trials in&#xD;
      patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma. In the adjuvant treatment of&#xD;
      melanoma, ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg is currently being tested in patients of the clinical stages&#xD;
      IIIA to IIIC (EORTC 18071; ECOG 1609). Although the 10 mg/kg dose regimen has been shown to&#xD;
      be the most efficacious in phase II trials in stage IV melanoma patients (CA 184-022,&#xD;
      CA184-008, CA184-007), the 3 mg/kg regimen also provides clinical responses with a much lower&#xD;
      rate of severe adverse events. Indeed, the 3 mg/kg dosage was used in one of the two positive&#xD;
      phase III trials on in metastatic melanoma. Due to its safer toxicity profile, 3 mg/kg&#xD;
      ipilimumab is probably best suitable for an adjuvant use in patients with completely resected&#xD;
      MCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both drugs have demonstrated a manageable safety profile, which however, is more preferable&#xD;
      for nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore new patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive nivolumab instead of&#xD;
      ipilimumab treatment versus observation.&#xD;
