    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject, male or female, must be between 6 and 17 years of age, inclusive, at the time of&#xD;
        consent. Note: Subjects who are 17 years of age at time of consent must not have a birthday&#xD;
        within the following 4 weeks in order to be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition;&#xD;
             Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for a primary diagnosis of ADHD (inattentive,&#xD;
             hyperactive, or combined subtype) established by a comprehensive psychiatric&#xD;
             evaluation that reviews DSM-IV-TR criteria prior to Screening. Diagnosis is confirmed&#xD;
             at Screening using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and&#xD;
             Adolescents (MINI-KID).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's parents/legal guardians must give written informed consent, including&#xD;
             privacy authorization, prior to study participation. The subject will complete an&#xD;
             informed assent prior to study participation. Note: Informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
             from both parents unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or when one&#xD;
             parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject and the subject's parents/legal guardians must be judged by the investigator&#xD;
             to be willing and able to comply with the study procedures and visit schedules,&#xD;
             including venipuncture, overnight stay (recommended for parent/legal guardian to&#xD;
             remain overnight with the subject), and follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject, if female, must not be pregnant or breastfeeding, and if ≥ 8 years of age&#xD;
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with female partners of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to use an effective and medically acceptable form of&#xD;
             birth control throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be in general good health (defined as the absence of any clinically&#xD;
             relevant abnormalities as determined by the investigator) based on screening physical&#xD;
             and neurological examinations, medical history, and clinical laboratory values&#xD;
             (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis). Note: If any of the hematology, chemistry, or&#xD;
             urinalysis results are not within the laboratory's reference range, then the subject&#xD;
             can be included only if the investigator determines the deviations to be not&#xD;
             clinically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is within 3rd to 97th percentile for gender specific body mass index&#xD;
             (BMI)-for-age from the World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts (Appendix VI) and&#xD;
             weighs at least 25 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must report a history of being able to swallow capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject and subject's parents/legal guardians must be able to fully comprehend the&#xD;
             informed consent/assent form, understand all study procedures, and be able to&#xD;
             communicate satisfactorily with the investigator and study coordinator.&#xD;

             or history of a condition (eg, malabsorption, gastrointestinal surgery) that may&#xD;
             interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history or presence of abnormal ECGs, which in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion is clinically significant. Screening ECGs will be centrally over-read, and&#xD;
             eligibility will be determined based on the over-read report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a documented history of Bipolar I or II Disorder, major depression,&#xD;
             conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (other&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has organic brain disease, for example, traumatic brain injury residua, or a&#xD;
             history of febrile seizures. Subjects taking anticonvulsants for seizure control&#xD;

             specific plan and intent) on the C-SSRS Children's Lifetime/Recent assessment at&#xD;
             screening. Subjects who have significant findings for suicidal ideation upon&#xD;
             completion of the C-SSRS must be referred to the investigator for follow-up&#xD;
             evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has any history of attempted suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;

             a washout equal to a minimum of 5 half lives of that medication prior to Visit 2. If&#xD;
             the half life of a medication is unknown, for example, herbal products, then the&#xD;
             subject should have a 28 day medication washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is currently taking an antidepressant medication (eg, bupropion, selective&#xD;
             serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI]/ serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor&#xD;
             [SNRI], monoamine oxidase [MAO] blocker, tricyclic, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject or subject's family anticipates a move outside the geographic range of the&#xD;

             criteria or has a positive urine drug screen (UDS), cotinine test, or breath alcohol&#xD;
             test at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is taking any disallowed medications for chronic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has experienced significant blood loss within 60 days or has donated plasma&#xD;
