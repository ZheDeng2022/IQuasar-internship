      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a standard volume replacement called&#xD;
      HES 130/0.4 (Voluven) during surgery on recovery. HES 130/0.4 (Voluven) may offer an&#xD;
      alternative to pure fluid replacement solutions that are associated with problems after&#xD;
      surgery including fluid overload and respiratory difficulties. The safety of HES 130/0.4&#xD;
      (Voluven) will be evaluated by examining its effects on kidney function, and coagulation&#xD;
      parameters and platelet (part of the blood that help it clot) function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized (like flipping a coin) to receive one of two possible volume&#xD;
      replacements during surgery, if fluid volume decreases enough to need replacement with one of&#xD;
      the fluids. The two possible volume replacements are Voluven (a starch-containing fluid) or&#xD;
      human albumin 5% (a protein-containing solution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine kidney function, urine will be-sampled when the participant is put under general&#xD;
      anesthesia, before surgical incision, within one hour of arrival to the ICU and 24 hours&#xD;
      after completion of surgery. Two tubes (2 teaspoons) of blood (from an already established&#xD;
      line) will be taken the morning of the surgery, within one hour of arrival to the ICU, 24&#xD;
      hours after surgery and every morning during the participants postoperative ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, health and recovery information will be recorded from the participant's medical&#xD;
      record. We will phone participants around 90 days and one year after surgery to ask a few&#xD;
      questions about one's health and recovery. We will also record blood sample analysis results&#xD;
      from follow up appointments within the first year after surgery. If this analysis is not&#xD;
      conducted at the Cleveland Clinic, with permission, we will obtain the results from a&#xD;
      treating physician.&#xD;

    <description>To assess the safety of HES 130/0.4 (Voluven) versus albumin 5% on renal function we will measure urinary concentrations of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), an important marker of renal function, measured at baseline (following anesthetic induction and prior to surgical incision), within one hour of arrival to intensive care unit (ICU), and 24 hours following completion of surgery compared with baseline.</description>

To assess the safety of HES 130/0.4 (Voluven) on additional measures of renal function, we measure urinary concentrations of interleukin (IL)- 18 at baseline (following anesthetic induction and prior to surgical incision), within one hour of arrival to ICU, and 24 hours following completion of surgery. We will also measure daily serum creatinine and need for renal replacement therapy platelet function and coagulation [Time Frame: 24 hours following completion of surgery] [ Designated as safety issues: Yes] To assess the safety of HES 130/0.4 versus albumin 5% as measured by coagulation parameters and Platelet function measured at baseline, within one hour of arrival to ICU, and 24 hours following surgery as well as clinical outcomes including coagulation paramenters and measures of platelet aggregation.</description>
