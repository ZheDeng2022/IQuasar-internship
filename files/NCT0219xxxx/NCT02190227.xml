  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal time to use the Tumor RNA Disruption&#xD;
      Assay (RDA) as a predictor of pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is important because the earlier non-responders are identified, the greater is the&#xD;
      impact of reducing side effects of ineffective treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the RDA score will accurately predict for tumor response after&#xD;
      one cycle of chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective clinical trial will determine if the tumor RDA score can predict for pCR&#xD;
      after the first, second, and third cycles of chemotherapy in women with breast cancer treated&#xD;
      with neoadjuvant therapy. Tumor RDA score will also be measured after the first dose of any&#xD;
      new chemotherapy agent if residual palpable disease is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected until accrual target of 30 patients is met. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      core needle biopsy of the breast tumor and analysis of ER, PR, and HER-2-Neu receptors.&#xD;
      Patients will receive neoadjuvant therapy as recommended by their treating physicians. All&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens will be acceptable for participation in this study. Usually, these&#xD;
      regimens are between 6 to 8 cycles, often with a switch of chemotherapy regimens after 3 to 4&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of tumor size will be determined by 2 axis tumor measurement performed prior to,&#xD;
      and after each chemotherapy treatment. The Tumor RDA score will be evaluated by performing&#xD;
      fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies under local anesthetic, if the tumor is clinically&#xD;
      palpable, after the first, second, and third cycles of chemotherapy. Tumor RDA score will&#xD;
      also be determined if palpable tumor is present after the first cycle of any second&#xD;
      chemotherapy agent.&#xD;
