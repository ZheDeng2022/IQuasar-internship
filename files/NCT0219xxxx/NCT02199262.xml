      Agitation in the intensive care unit can have multiple consequences. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that agitation and its consequences can be reduced by the introduction of a&#xD;
      reminder aiming at guiding the management of agitation. The investigators also hypothesize&#xD;
      that they can prevent agitation and its consequences by acting on patients environment with&#xD;
      reafferentation and relaxation methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' objectives are to test within a quality improvement project by a&#xD;
      prospective randomized study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If by reducing the number of agitation episodes we reduce the number of harmful&#xD;
           consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the introduction of reafferentation and relaxation methods (music therapy or&#xD;
           reflexology) can prevent the occurrence of agitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the introduction of a reminder on management of agitation can reduce the number of&#xD;
           agitation episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted in an18 general surgical ICU beds receiving 1600 patients / year for&#xD;
      a total of 6900 hospital /days /year, in a tertiary teaching hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is organized in 3 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First phase: Baseline phase (Prospective analysis of the present situation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second phase: Learning phase (Implementation of a reminder about the management of&#xD;
           agitation and delirium )&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Third phase: Randomized Intervention (reminder alone vs addition of music or&#xD;
           reflexology)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implementation of a reminder of guidelines of agitation diagnosis and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Music intervention( see description below) + reminder&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reflexology (see description below)+ reminder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agitation is monitored with two scales SAS and CAM-ICU(description below) . Harmful&#xD;
      consequences and complications are systematically registered as well as medication and the&#xD;
      use of contention methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to the implemented monitoring and interventions is also regularly checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are daily collected (see details below) Statistical analysis and power calculation (see&#xD;
      below)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Agitation in the intensive care unit (ICU) can be described as an excessive, usually no&#xD;
      purposeful motor activity associated with internal tension.Agitation can have multiple&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of agitation episodes is a problem recognized for several years and already&#xD;
      widely discussed in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium is a reversible, global impairment of cognitive processes, usually of sudden onset,&#xD;
      coupled with disorientation, impaired short term memory, altered sensory perception&#xD;
      (hallucinations), abnormal thought process, and inappropriate behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the literature and a previous pilot study in the unit brought us to the&#xD;
      consideration that a quality assessment and improvement project should be started aiming at&#xD;
      monitoring and influencing the occurrence of agitation and their consequences such as the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of the patients, the impact on care delivery and maybe the economic&#xD;
      repercussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesized that agitation and its consequences can be reduced by the&#xD;
      introduction of a reminder aiming at guiding the management of agitation. While the&#xD;
      optimization of the management of the related states (such as delirium, pain and anxiety) is&#xD;
      crucial, investigators hypothesized that we could prevent agitation and its consequences by&#xD;
      acting on patients environment with reafferentation and relaxation methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' objectives will be to test within a quality improvement project by a&#xD;
      prospective randomized study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If by reducing the number of agitation episodes we reduce the number of harmful&#xD;
           consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the introduction of reafferentation and relaxation methods (music therapy or&#xD;
           reflexology) can prevent the occurrence of agitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the introduction of a reminder on management of agitation can reduce the number of&#xD;
           agitation episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      18 general surgical ICU beds receiving 1600 patients / year for a total of 6900 hospital&#xD;
      /days /year, in a tertiary teaching hospital. The ICU is divided in 6 rooms with 3 beds: 1 at&#xD;
      the window, 1 in the middle of the room and 1 by the room door. Each room has one clock in&#xD;
      front of the central bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurse to patient ratio is during daytime 1:1.5 and 1:2 during nighttime. Nurses working&#xD;
      shifts are organized in 3 times 8 hours every day. This study has been approved by the head&#xD;
      of division and will be conducted solely inside the surgical ICU. As a quality improvement&#xD;
      program, no consent by patients is required, according to the CEREH /HUG recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will enroll every patient older than 18 years staying more than 24 hours in the&#xD;
      ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First phase: Baseline phase (Prospective analysis of the present situation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second phase: learning phase (Implementation of a reminder about the management of&#xD;
           agitation and delirium )&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Third phase: Randomized Intervention (reminder alone vs addition of music or&#xD;
           reflexology)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reminder :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The care giver will be helped in the diagnosis of the cause, the management of and the&#xD;
      treatment of agitation and delirium by a reminder. This reminder has been adapted from the&#xD;
      guidelines from the ACCP and SCCM comity. It has been adapted on local needs by a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary group including nurses and physicians from the ICU. Investigators will&#xD;
      instruct nurses and physicians on the use of the reminder 3 times a week for 20 min during 1&#xD;
      month. Investigators will provide pocket reminders for every care giver and display posters&#xD;
      of the reminder in key points of the ICU. The reminder will also be available on the intranet&#xD;
      site and introduced in the SISIF system (bedside computerized patient chart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The music intervention consisted in two daily sessions of at least 20 minutes music listening&#xD;
      ( classical and soft background music ) .The music intervention was delivered by compact disc&#xD;
      players with headphones with disposable ear pads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reflexology is a feet massage technique consisting in massages and pressures on precise&#xD;
      points of the feet.This therapy was applied for 20 minutes each day to the ICU patients by a&#xD;
      certified specialist in reflexology massage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indicators :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indicators of agitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Sedation Agitation scale (SAS) and Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU): The SAS&#xD;
      scale is recognized for its reliability and validity for the sedation and agitation&#xD;
      assessment. It is a single item scale graded from 1 (coma) to 7 (extremely agitated.&#xD;
      Agitation is diagnosed if SAS &gt;4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAM-ICU score is a modified version of the CAM scale adapted to intensive care patients.&#xD;
      This scale assesses delirium (positive CAM-ICU test) by considering four different parameters&#xD;
      that mostly focus on patient's cognitive state . It is also validated and recognized for its&#xD;
      high specificity and sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will analyze the presence or absence of delirium at each evaluation judged&#xD;
      necessary by the nurse, at least once by shift (every 8 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will then investigate whether 1. the positive CAM-ICU will precede the&#xD;
      occurrence of agitation defined as SAS&gt;4, 2. whether low values of SAS, &lt;4 or &gt;4 precede&#xD;
      higher values of SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indicators of the harmful consequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complications : Investigators will register the events related to an agitation episode&#xD;
           or delirium and classify them in three groups. The three groups are determined by the&#xD;
           potential life threatening character of the event. One event can be considered as severe&#xD;
           i.e. really life threatening (self extubation, ventilator disconnection, central&#xD;
           catheter removal, chest tube removal, trauma, falling from bed), moderate (removal of&#xD;
           nasogastric tube, peripheral venous or arterial catheter) or mild i.e. not life&#xD;
           threatening (contortion of the patient in his bed, patient's aggressiveness toward the&#xD;
           staff, urethral catheter removal, electrode or saturation monitoring removal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medication : Investigators will register the patient's medication in a daily total dose&#xD;
           (mg /patient/day/drug) of 3 drug groups in relation with agitation. Investigators will&#xD;
           compare the use of medication during the different study phases and between the 3&#xD;
           different groups during the third phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           sedatives: oxazepam, lorazepam,midazolam, propofol analgesics: acetaminophen, ibuprofen,&#xD;
           morphine, fentanyl, ketorolac antipsychotics: haloperidol, thioridazine&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The use of contention methods will be registered will be compared for each phase of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indicators of adherence:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adherence to the implementation of monitoring (SAS, CAM-ICU) during the 3 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adherence to the reminder&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adherence to intervention (reflexology and music therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indicators of safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will assess the occurrence of adverse events potentially related to the therapy&#xD;
      or management of agitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intubations: the study team will register the number of intubations related to&#xD;
           agitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Antagonist drugs: the study team will register the use of antagonist drugs such as&#xD;
           naloxone chlorhydrate (Narcan®), flumazenil (Anexate®) and biperidene(Akineton®)&#xD;
           following the treatment of agitation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection First phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 24 hours after ICU admission, the study team will assess the demographic and actual&#xD;
           diagnostic data, the past medical history, the usual and actual treatment, the current&#xD;
           smoking history, alcohol and drug abuse, the invasive equipment and the APACHE II score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Daily investigators will also assess the treatment and equipment modifications, the&#xD;
           laboratory values of variables potentially related to agitation (sodium, glucose,&#xD;
           calcium, urea, creatinine, bilirubin, oxygen saturation, FiO2), fever, the occurrence of&#xD;
           infections, the introduction of therapeutic antibiotics. The bed location in the room&#xD;
           will be specified (door, middle, window). Investigators will also daily record the&#xD;
           consequence (annex 7) and safety indicators . No additional test or exam will be&#xD;
           performed for the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Three times a day (once by nurse shift) the nurses will assess agitation and delirium by&#xD;
           SAS and CAM-ICU. Each time the attending nurse notices a modification of degree of&#xD;
           agitation, she will register the concomitant SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At the end of each patient stay investigators will calculate the total dosage&#xD;
           (mg/kg/day) p.o. or i.v of sedatives (benzodiazepines, propofol or others), analgesics&#xD;
           (acetaminophen, NSARs, morphine, fentanyl or others) or antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol&#xD;
           or others) delivered to every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second phase In addition to all the data collected during the first phase, investigators will&#xD;
      register the adherence to the reminder at each agitation episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third phase Same data as during the second phase. In addition, investigators will note daily&#xD;
      the correct delivery of the allocated intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni's post-test or&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis where appropriated. Proportions will be analyzed by Pearson's 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoint of the study is to reduce the occurrence of the consequences of agitation and/or&#xD;
      delirium. The sample size is calculated to detect a minimum mean difference of 50% of the&#xD;
      number of patient days with occurrence of the consequences of agitation and delirium. In a&#xD;
      preliminary study, investigators assessed the occurrence of &quot;consequences&quot; in about 20% of&#xD;
      patient/days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number (=n) of patients needed to detect a minimum mean difference of 50% between the&#xD;
      baseline and the learning phase is 219 (a 0.05, power 80% two sided), and 219 in the three&#xD;
      randomization groups. 80 patients per month present the inclusion criteria for the study.&#xD;
      Thus, we need 2.7 months in the Baseline, a minimum of 2.7 months in the Learning and 8.1&#xD;
      months for the Randomization Intervention periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All continuous variables will be expressed as mean SD (normally distributed) or medians and&#xD;
      range (non normally distributed). A p value &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
