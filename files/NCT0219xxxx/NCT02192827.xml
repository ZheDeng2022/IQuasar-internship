  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of a single dose of dexamethasone vs.&#xD;
      two doses of dexamethasone in mild and moderate asthma exacerbations pediatric patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The emergency department (ED) physician will follow the standard asthma care path to manage a&#xD;
      pediatric asthma patient whether the patient meets study criteria or not. Patients' legal&#xD;
      guardian will be approached for consent if patient meets the study criteria. Once the consent&#xD;
      is obtained, the patient will be randomized into one of the two study groups according to a&#xD;
      randomization table generated by a statistician. The first group will receive a single dose&#xD;
      of dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection (0.6 mg/kg with max of 16 mg) mixed with&#xD;
      equivalent volume of cherry syrup given orally in the ED. The second group will receive a&#xD;
      first dose of dexamethasone with cherry syrup (also 0.6 mg/kg with max of 16 mg) in the ED,&#xD;
      and a second dose will be prescribed to the patient at home on the day following the ED&#xD;
      visit. This dose will be the same dosage of dexamethasone, but may be a pill or liquid form.&#xD;
      Patients will continue their previously prescribed asthma regimen and albuterol as needed.&#xD;
      Children who vomit the steroids in the ED will be re-dosed. Children who vomit the steroid a&#xD;
      second time will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Data collection. Demographic information such as age, race, duration of asthma symptoms,&#xD;
      number of previous hospitalizations, and current medication will be collected on an ED data&#xD;
      collection form. Pertinent exam findings such as patient's vital signs, pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      Pediatric asthma severity score (PAS), patient asthma severity self-assessment sheets (PSAS),&#xD;
      and ED treatment will also be collected on an ED data collection form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from the ED, patients will be instructed to complete the PSAS on a daily&#xD;
      basis for 5 days. The data will be documented on a home patient self-assessment sheet by the&#xD;
      legal guardian. The investigators will train the legal guardians on how to complete the PSAS&#xD;
      in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Phone follow-up All patients will be contacted by phone by a research assistant 5 days&#xD;
      after the ED visit. Information collected during the phone interview will include PSAS,&#xD;
      unexpected visits to medical providers (ED, primary care or urgent care) for asthma symptoms,&#xD;
      school days missed due to asthma exacerbation, length of time symptoms persisted, compliance&#xD;
      with the recommended steroid regimen, vomiting, other side effects or medication&#xD;
      administration problems caused by the steroids.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children aged 2 to 20 years, from all race and ethnicity groups, with a known history&#xD;
             of asthma who present to the Emergency Department of Women and Children's Hospital of&#xD;
             Buffalo with an acute exacerbation of mild or moderate asthma are potentially eligible&#xD;
             for the study. Patients with severe asthma exacerbations will require intravenous&#xD;
             steroid therapy, therefore, they will not be enrolled in the study. The investigators&#xD;
             plan to enroll patients from winter of 2014 to fall 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of asthma is defined by physician diagnosis of at least 1 prior episode of wheezing&#xD;
        which responded to beta agonist medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mild asthma is defined as: Pediatric Asthma Score (PAS) of 5 to 7; Moderate asthma is&#xD;
        defined as: PAS of 8 to 11; Severe asthma is defined as: PAS of 12 or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
