      In the palliative care unit, certain patients suffer from pain associated with medical&#xD;
      procedures/care which is poorly controlled by antalgics. These situations may necessitate&#xD;
      temporary sedation to improve comfort and facilitate treatment. No proven consensus exists,&#xD;
      either in the literature or in clinical studies conducted, on the choice of sedative agent&#xD;
      however Midazolam is the general recommendation.&#xD;

      In the palliative care unit, certain patients suffer from pain associated with medical&#xD;
      procedures/care which is poorly controlled by antalgics. These situations may necessitate&#xD;
      temporary sedation to improve comfort and facilitate treatment. No proven consensus exists,&#xD;
      either in the literature or in clinical studies conducted, on the choice of sedative agent&#xD;
      however Midazolam is the general recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that Propofol could be used in this instance. The arguments in&#xD;
      favour of Propofol include its pharmaco-kinetic characteristics and the fact that it is&#xD;
      currently used in other circumstances. Propofol has an action delay which is more rapid that&#xD;
      Midazolam therefore its effect is seen 1 minute after a bolus and 5 minutes after for&#xD;
      Midazolam. The effect after a short administration lasts only a few minutes however the&#xD;
      effect of Midazolam is more prolonged (sometimes several hours). As with Midazolam, a&#xD;
      titrated use in weaker doses, should allow sufficient sedation, in the context which&#xD;
      interests us, without marked secondary effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not unreasonable to think that the short action duration of Propofol could minimise&#xD;
      respiratory risks in the hours after the treatment compared to Midazolam. With Propofol, the&#xD;
      patient wakes as soon as the painful medical procedure has finished, with Midazolam sedation&#xD;
      may be prolonged to several hours leading to a risk respiratory depression or secretion&#xD;
      retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons; the investigators would like to verify that the use of Propofol is&#xD;
      feasible in the context of refractory pain associated with medical procedures (dressing&#xD;
      changes, movement during personal care tasks e.g. washing) in the palliative care unit. This&#xD;
      is a preliminary study prior to completion of a more extensive multi-centre research project&#xD;
      on the role Propofol could play in this situation.&#xD;
