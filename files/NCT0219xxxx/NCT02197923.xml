  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenomyosis is characterized by the appearance of endometrial cells in the muscular layer of&#xD;
      the uterus. It affects about 15-20% of the female population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptoms of adenomyosis are heavy menstrual bleedings and painful menstruation&#xD;
      (dysmenorrhea) and in addition chronic pelvic pain. Subfertility and infertility have been&#xD;
      correlated with adenomyosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parity, age and uterine abrasion increase the risk of adenomyosis. Hormonal factors such as&#xD;
      local hyperestrogenism and elevated levels of prolactin (PRL) have been identified, but&#xD;
      autoimmune and mechanical factors are also hypothesized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding treatment, the most effective measure is hysterectomy. As this is a very drastic&#xD;
      measure in younger women, levonogestrel-releasing intrauterine devices, Gonadotropin&#xD;
      releasing hormone (GnRH)-analogues, Danazol, uterine embolization and endometrial ablation&#xD;
      have been tried, but studies are few in number, retrospective, and have small sample sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenomyosis has so far not been subject to extensive research efforts. The pathogenesis of&#xD;
      adenomyosis remains still unclear, there are not many satisfying treatment options and&#xD;
      diagnostics include mostly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a series of 3 studies with a broad approach in understanding&#xD;
      adenomyosis. This is part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators take both tissue samples and blood samples that will be&#xD;
      investigated in order to understand the basic processes leading to adenomyosis.&#xD;

      Biopsy of focal adenomyosis of the myometrium:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an extension of the NAPPED1-study. The investigators will perform&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided transvaginal biopsies of the myometrium and collect venous blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As recent studies have suggested abnormalities in the regulation of specific genes in the&#xD;
      development of adenomyosis, the investigators want to investigate differentially expressed&#xD;
      genes in adenomyosis compared to eutopic endometrium. Using microarrays, the investigators&#xD;
      can simultaneously screen differences in expression of thousands of genes in samples from the&#xD;
      two groups. Profiling studies performed on endometrium of healthy individuals and of&#xD;
      endometriosis show results that enable identification of biological processes and molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms. Expression profiles can be used to identify molecular targets for therapeutic&#xD;
      purposes. There are some very interesting studies that investigate drug treatment on a&#xD;
      molecular level e.g. the effect of Danazol treatment on eutopic and ectopic endometrial&#xD;
      tissue, but intramural adenomyosis has not been subject to gene profiling yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue samples can be easily obtained after hysterectomy, but those samples will only&#xD;
      represent older women, and cannot be used for consecutive monitoring of biochemical effects&#xD;
      of treatment, as the uterus is removed. In order to investigate the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      adenomyosis in younger women, and compare it to those in older individuals, as well as to&#xD;
      evaluate effects of treatment, it is necessary to be able to obtain in-vivo samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is therefore to take transvaginal, ultrasound-guided biopsy-samples from the uterus&#xD;
      (myometrium) of all included patients at the beginning of their surgery, when the patient is&#xD;
      under full anesthesia. The safety of comparable procedures has been shown in prior studies,&#xD;
      but the investigators will further validate the safety of this method. The investigators&#xD;
      believe that an in-vivo biopsy is a safe measure, and that representative samples of&#xD;
      adenomyosis can be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenge with adenomyosis is that it is located intramyometrially. A transcervical&#xD;
      biopsy will contaminate the sample with eutopic endometria, therefore it is most meaningful&#xD;
      to take the biopsy transvaginally, but not through the cavity. After obtaining the biopsy&#xD;
      sample, it will be examined histologically by imprint, to confirm if glandular cells are&#xD;
      contained where expected. When good routines show a reliable level of specificity, the&#xD;
      investigators will go further by selecting approximately 10 patients for gene profiling of&#xD;
      adenomyosis. The investigators will also use endometrial biopsies (Pipelle) from those&#xD;
      patients to see if there is a difference between intramural adenomyosis and their eutopic&#xD;
      endometria. Most patients that undergo hysterectomy have taken a pipelle-biopsy routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The levels of prolactin, Anti-m√ºllerian hormone (AMH), Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),&#xD;
      luteinizing hormone (LH) and estrogen will also be taken, in order to determine if the&#xD;
      severity of adenomyosis is only related to age as shown before, or also to hormonal activity.&#xD;
