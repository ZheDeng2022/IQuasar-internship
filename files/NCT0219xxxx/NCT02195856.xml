      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediterranean style diets and diets rich in green leafy vegetables protect against the risk&#xD;
      of developing type 2 diabetes and a wide range of cardiovascular disease. These diets are&#xD;
      rich in nitrate. Numerous studies have shown that nitrate from the diet can have a wide range&#xD;
      of beneficial effects. These include relaxing blood vessels and improving their function. It&#xD;
      has been shown that following a meal with added nitrate, blood flow to the stomach increases&#xD;
      more than would be expected if the same meal is given without nitrate. This is because when&#xD;
      we eat nitrate the body concentrates it and recycles it through the digestive system. As it&#xD;
      cycles through it is converted into nitrite and nitric oxide which cause blood vessels to&#xD;
      relax. The nitrite and nitric oxide also seem to protect against infection from food sources&#xD;
      such as E.coli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What we do not know is whether this nitrite and nitric oxide has any effect on the small&#xD;
      intestine and the liver. Some nitrite reaches the small intestine and may have the same&#xD;
      effect on blood flow there as it does in the stomach. This could be very important because&#xD;
      the small intestine releases hormones called incretins which we now know play a very&#xD;
      important role in controlling blood sugar every time we eat. These incretin hormones regulate&#xD;
      insulin release and the body's sensitivity to insulin. When we eat blood containing the&#xD;
      substances we have absorbed from the gut, such as sugars and fats, goes to the liver for&#xD;
      processing. The blood then leaves the liver and enters the circulation. This means the blood&#xD;
      supply to the liver will have much higher concentrations of nitrite than the blood&#xD;
      circulating in the rest of the body. High concentrations of nitrite appear to cause blood&#xD;
      vessels to open up. This means more blood vessels in the liver should be opened after a&#xD;
      nitrate rich meal. It seems likely that this will help the liver to control blood sugar more&#xD;
      effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose To find out if supplementation by inorganic nitrate as found in beetroot or green&#xD;
      leafy vegetables increases liver (hepatic) microvascular perfusion and increases incretin&#xD;
      secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 16 individuals for each of the three groups (Young adults, older adults and&#xD;
      individuals with type 2 diabetes). Participants will be recruited from a database of&#xD;
      volunteers who have consented to being contacted for research studies which are held by the&#xD;
      NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility. This is a double blind, placebo controlled crossover&#xD;
      design study (nitrate rich beetroot juice vs a placebo, nitrate depleted beetroot juice).&#xD;
      Three visits will be required for participants to complete this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1. Screening and consent. The experimenter will explain to the participant what the&#xD;
      study is designed to test. If the participant is completely clear on the study and understand&#xD;
      what they are agreeing to, they will sign a consent form. In addition a standard medical&#xD;
      history and clinical examination will be undertaken by a research nurse and or Anthony&#xD;
      Shepherd. A venous blood sample will be taken using standard aseptic procedures. Following&#xD;
      consent participants will be assigned a study number. Study numbers will be previously&#xD;
      assigned (by a research statistician) to a randomisation order to begin either the beetroot&#xD;
      juice or placebo arm of the study first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2. Visit 2 will require the participant to fast over night from 10pm. Only water will&#xD;
      be admissible from this time. The following morning participants will arrive at the&#xD;
      laboratory in a fully hydrated and rested state at ~ 7.30am. This visit will take ~ 5 hours&#xD;
      and will require 4 MRI scans. Participants will have the first MRI scan after a short&#xD;
      acclimatisation period. Participants will then be provided with a concentrated 140 mL nitrate&#xD;
      drink or placebo with a standardised breakfast (2 slices of toast with butter). Three&#xD;
      subsequent MRI scans will be required (one per hour for three hours). Venous blood samples&#xD;
      taken from cannulas will be sampled, in order to assess glucose, insulin, incretins and&#xD;
      nitrate/nitrite prior to each scan. Visit 3. Visit 3 will take place after a minimum washout&#xD;
      period of 7 days from Visit 2. Visit 3 will be identical in nature to visit 2; however, it&#xD;
      will be with the opposite supplement (either nitrate rich or placebo beetroot juice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary nitrate appears to offer a simple, low cost means of modifying cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
      This study will deepen our understanding of the role of the nitrate/nitrite/nitric oxide&#xD;
      pathway in normal physiology. By understanding what effect inorganic nitrate from the diet&#xD;
      has on hepatic perfusion and other pathways involved in glucose homeostasis this may lead to&#xD;
      a range of simple, low cost therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inorganic nitrate from the diet, following conversion to nitrite and nitric oxide via the&#xD;
      pathways described above will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increase hepatic microvascular perfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase GLP-1 secretion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increase pancreatic insulin secretion&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reduce the area under the curve for glucose post meal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose To find out if inorganic nitrate found in green leafy vegetables protect against the&#xD;
      risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease by increasing hepatic&#xD;
      microvascular perfusion and increasing incretin secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The purpose of this study is to see if inorganic nitrate from the diet modulates hepatic&#xD;
      perfusion and other pathways involved in post-prandial glucose homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI Hepatic micro vessel perfusion of the liver and portal vein diameter will be measured by&#xD;
      Dr. Jon Fulford at the Peninsula Magnetic Resonance Research Centre, St Luke's Campus.&#xD;
      Following initial survey images to obtain anatomical information apparent diffusion&#xD;
      coefficients (ADC) are calculated in the posterior right lobe of the liver. Diffusion images&#xD;
      are acquired with a single shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with 15 directions and b&#xD;
      values of 200 and 800 s mm-2. Images are acquired during a single breathe-hold at an&#xD;
      axial-oblique orientation with a repetition time (TR) of 1500 ms an echo time of 57 ms, an&#xD;
      in-plane resolution of 4 x 4 mm and a slice thickness of 10 mm with fat suppression and 3&#xD;
      signal averages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADC is given by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADC = 1/(b200-b800) Ln (S800/S200) where S800 is the signal with a diffusion b-value of 800 s&#xD;
      mm-2 (b800) and S200 is the signal with a diffusion b-value of 200 s mm-2 (b200).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed by an experienced and trained&#xD;
      researcher and statistical advice will be available from Prof. Angela Shore from within the&#xD;
      team and Beverly Shields from the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility. Data will be&#xD;
      assessed for normality. Depending on the normality of data the differences between the groups&#xD;
      will be assessed by either unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Sixteen participants would need to be recruited per group in order to detect a&#xD;
      1SD difference between groups data with 80% power and an a of 0.05. Twenty participants would&#xD;
      be recruited in order to account for drop outs.&#xD;
