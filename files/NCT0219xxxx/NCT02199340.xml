  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The progression of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) results inevitably in a reduction in&#xD;
      exercise capacity. The assessment of fitness and exercise capacity in CF is an important&#xD;
      measure of the impact of the disease process, particularly if it is repeated over time. With&#xD;
      recent advances in clinical management, CF lung disease in children can be relatively mild&#xD;
      and exercise tolerance good. The currently available field tests e.g. 3 minute step test, are&#xD;
      often completed too easily. These tests provide limited information relating to maximal&#xD;
      exercise performance. By contrast, the maximal CardioPulmonary Exercise Test (CPET), a&#xD;
      progressive, incremental, gold standard exercise test with breath by breath analysis of&#xD;
      expired gas, has proved to be a valuable means of assessing exercise response in patients&#xD;
      with CF. Its only limitation is the requirement for specialist laboratory facilities,&#xD;
      equipment and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new field test for evaluating exercise capacity in children is needed. This should be&#xD;
      portable, easy to administer and simple to perform by young children, while providing a&#xD;
      higher intensity of exercise which correlates with day to day activity patterns of children,&#xD;
      and clinically relevant information in the short term and longitudinally. This test needs to&#xD;
      be a good surrogate measure of exercise capacity when formal CPET is unable to be undertaken.&#xD;
      By providing accurate and useful information the results can be used to prescribe and train&#xD;
      individuals with CF safely and effectively and can also be used in the short and long term&#xD;
      for guidance of the medical management of these complex patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to develop and validate the use of a new incremental step test to&#xD;
      assess exercise tolerance/capacity in children with CF, compare this with the gold standard&#xD;
      CPET and to provide normative healthy control comparison data The main objectives of the&#xD;
      study are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop an incremental step test to assess exercise tolerance / capacity in children&#xD;
           with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the incremental step test with the gold standard CPET&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the level of exercise response produced by the incremental step test&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the correlation between independent variables of lung function measurements,&#xD;
           age, weight and height with VO2peak and other exercise test outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the repeatability and evaluate the normal variability of the new incremental&#xD;
           step test&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To provide healthy control normative data for comparison&#xD;
