      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children with Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DBMD) slowly lose muscle function. They&#xD;
      usually die at a young age. Some mothers adapt to the demands of caring for a child with this&#xD;
      disease better than others. Studies show that a person s hope may positively affect how they&#xD;
      cope and adapt. Researchers want to find out more about this. They want to develop ways to&#xD;
      improve caregivers overall wellness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the relationships between uncertainty, hope, and coping ability in mothers of&#xD;
      children with DBMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women in the United States 18 years and older. They must be biological mothers of a living&#xD;
      child with DBMD and be able to answer a survey in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study is part of a larger study that examines the well-being of mothers with sons&#xD;
           who have DBMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take a questionnaire. The questionnaire can be done on paper or on a&#xD;
           computer. It will take 30 45 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The questionnaire will include basic demographic questions about the participant and the&#xD;
           child. There will also be questions about how the participant copes with the stress and&#xD;
           uncertainty of DBMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For most of the questions, participants will rate their feelings on a scale. There will&#xD;
           also be four open-ended questions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to examine the relationships between maternal uncertainty, hope, and&#xD;
      coping efficacy in mothers of children with Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DBMD). DBMD&#xD;
      is described as a complex chronic condition causing challenges exemplified by both chronic&#xD;
      and terminal illnesses. Parental adaptation to a child s DBMD diagnosis is multifaceted due&#xD;
      to the evolution of the disease and uncertain timing of the progressive losses the child and&#xD;
      family face. In addition to prognostic uncertainty associated with DBMD, there is uncertainty&#xD;
      about the management of the condition, future and reproductive planning, the family s social&#xD;
      connections, and the existential meaning of the child s life. It is not fully understood how&#xD;
      mothers of children with DBMD appraise, cope with, and ultimately adapt to their child s&#xD;
      condition in light of this uncertainty. While high degrees of perceived uncertainty may be&#xD;
      seen as a threat to coping and adaptation, there is evidence that caregivers may find&#xD;
      benefits in uncertainty. The theoretical literature suggests that a person s hope may&#xD;
      influence the appraisal of uncertainty, as well as have therapeutic value in positively&#xD;
      affecting coping and ultimately, adaptation. This study s conceptual framework is based on an&#xD;
      integrated model from Lazarus and Folkman s Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, Mishel&#xD;
      s Perceived Uncertainty in Illness Theory, and Dufault and Martocchio s Model of Hope. The&#xD;
      proposed study uses a cross-sectional research design to explore the relationships between&#xD;
      maternal uncertainty, hope, and coping efficacy and is nested within a larger longitudinal&#xD;
      study designed to examine the predictors of wellbeing among mothers of boys with DBMD. In&#xD;
      addition, open-ended questions will be used to describe the uncertainty the mothers perceive&#xD;
      and the impact uncertainty has had on their life. Participants were recruited through the&#xD;
      DuchenneConnect registry, Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD), and Cincinnati Children s&#xD;
      Hospital Medical Center Neuromuscular Clinic. Additional mothers will be recruited through&#xD;
      the DuchenneConntect registry, PPMD, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.&#xD;
