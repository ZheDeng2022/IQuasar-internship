      -  The measurement of hindfoot alignment is a technical challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Today, hindfoot alignment is typically measured on hindfoot alignment view radiographs&#xD;
           or long axial view radiographs. Measurements on both types of radiographs are hampered&#xD;
           by technical shortcomings such as minimal rotational misplacement of the foot at the&#xD;
           time of image acquisition. In previous publications our study groups demonstrated&#xD;
           substantial measurement errors due to these shortcomings as well as bad interreader&#xD;
           agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hindfoot alignment measurement is feasible on MR images but hampered by the&#xD;
           non-weight-bearing position of the patient and therefore not suited for pre-treatment&#xD;
           evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In an ex vivo study using plastic phantoms of a foot our research group could&#xD;
           demonstrate superior interreader agreement and complete correction for foot misplacement&#xD;
           at the time of image acquisition using a 3D secondary measurement technique based on&#xD;
           biplanar low dose radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Image acquisition using biplanar low dose radiographs is associated with a substantial&#xD;
           reduction (about 1/7) of radiation dose applied to the patient compared to standard&#xD;
           radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therefore the question arises if these excellent ex vivo results can be confirmed in a&#xD;
           prospective clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of technical feasibility of 3D hindfoot alignment measurements based on&#xD;
           biplanar radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reproduction of superior interreader agreement of measurements based on biplanar&#xD;
           radiographs compared to measurements on conventional radiographs.&#xD;

      Additional information to the brief summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome(s): Hindfoot alignment measurement on standard radiographs and biplanar radiographs.&#xD;
      The hindfoot angle is measured between the tibial axis and the calcaneal axis in degrees.&#xD;
      Measurement results on plain films and based on 3D reconstructions will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion: All patients referred for hindfoot alignment radiographs. These are all&#xD;
           adults having suffered severe trauma or suffering from osteoarthrosis of the ankle&#xD;
           joint. No inclusion of vulnerable participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria: Prior surgery, prior fracture, children and adolescents younger than&#xD;
           the age of 20 years, known pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and Procedures: Measurement of hindfoot alignment based on conventional&#xD;
      radiographs and based on biplanar radiographs by two independent radiologists. Comparison of&#xD;
      measurement results (paired-t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and calculation of interreader&#xD;
      agreement (Intraclass correlation coefficient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product / Intervention: EOS low-dose biplanar x-ray scanner, EOS imaging, Paris, France&#xD;
      One scan of the ankle joint to obtain an antero-posterior and lateral view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Intervention: Conventional x-rays of the ankle joint (a.p., lateral, long axial or&#xD;
      hindfoot alignment view) as referred from the clinician for treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Participants: 50 adults Based on a power analysis we think that this number of&#xD;
      patients will enable reliable results. Because we do not know how big the differences between&#xD;
      the measurements on standard radiographs and measurements on biplanar radiographs will be it&#xD;
      is very difficult to perform a reasonable power analysis. In prior studies comparing torsion&#xD;
      measurements on biplanar radiographs with CT measurements we were able to produce reliable&#xD;
      results with the same number of patients.&#xD;
