  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if using the tracer (liquid used in&#xD;
      imaging scans) [18F]fluciclatide in positron emission tomography / computed tomography&#xD;
      (PET/CT) scans will help researchers learn more quickly if the disease is responding to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      PET/CT Scans:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will have a PET/CT scan at your&#xD;
      treatment baseline visit, about 1 week before your first cycle of chemotherapy. You will then&#xD;
      have a second PET/CT scan at the end of your first cycle of chemotherapy (about 3-4 weeks&#xD;
      after starting chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For up to 6 hours before the PET/CT scan, you must not eat or drink anything except water. A&#xD;
      small needle and tube will be placed in your arm, and you will receive an injection of a very&#xD;
      small amount of a mildly radioactive material into your bloodstream (the investigational&#xD;
      tracer, [18F]fluciclatide). The radioactive nature of this injected material allows the&#xD;
      scanner to &quot;see&quot; it in certain places in your body. After the injection, you will need to&#xD;
      rest quietly until it is time for the scan. The amount of rest time may vary, but be prepared&#xD;
      to wait for between 45 and 90 minutes. During the scan, you will lie flat on your back on a&#xD;
      table. The scan itself may last up to 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each PET/CT imaging session will last about 4 hours total from the time you arrive at the&#xD;
      clinic until you are discharged and allowed to go home. You may be discharged 30 minutes&#xD;
      after the scan is complete, if the doctor thinks you are clinically stable and it is safe for&#xD;
      you to leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the following tests are already being performed as part of the clinical research study you&#xD;
      are participating in or as part of standard care, they will not need to be repeated for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit (before the first PET/CT is performed):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. To take part&#xD;
           in this study, you must not be pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Cycle 1 (before the second PET/CT is performed):&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 24 hours after each PET/CT is performed, the study staff will call you by telephone to&#xD;
      ask about your health status and any side effects you may be experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anytime within the next month after the second PET/CT scan, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will&#xD;
      be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When your chemotherapy is over, you will have a third PET/CT scan as part of your standard&#xD;
      care, and an FDG tracer will be used for that scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your study participation will end about 6 weeks after your second PET/CT scan is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. [18F]Fluciclatide is not FDA approved or commercially&#xD;
      available. At this time, it is only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 patients will take part in this research study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Tumor Uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>After 2, four week chemotherapy cycles</time_frame>
    <description>Primary efficacy endpoint is change in tumor uptake of investigational agent [18F]Fluciclatide, as measured by standardized uptake value (SUVFluciclatide) from before treatment to after one cycle of treatment but before the second cycle starts. This determined from investigational agent [18F]Fluciclatide PET scans. Changes in SUVFluciclatide compared to standard tumor's response measured after completion of 2 cycles of treatment as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) as well as tumor size change as a continuous variable measured by the standard CT or PET/CT scans. Tumor size can also be measured by the WHO two-dimensional measurement in addition to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), one-dimensional measurement. Changes in SUVFluciclatide after one cycle also compared to tumor volume and tumor size as continuous variables after two cycles.</description>
