  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two primary objectives to be addressed in this study: to assess the differential&#xD;
      response in bioavailability and metabolic pathways between lean and obese individuals exposed&#xD;
      to acute, short term (14 day), and long-term (10-week) consumption of polyphenol-rich fruits&#xD;
      (berries and apple), and beverages (tea); and to determine the differential systemic and gut&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory response between obese and lean individuals exposed to polyphenol-rich&#xD;
      fruits (berries and apple), and beverages (tea).&#xD;

    <description>Volunteers will be provided a controlled diet during the entirety of the 10 week treatment period. Meals will be prepared using traditional American foods.&#xD;
The controlled diet will include polyphenol-rich foods, including apples, berries, and green tea. A blend of multiple polyphenol-rich foods was chosen to investigate whole foods, multiple commodities, and multiple bioactives.</description>
