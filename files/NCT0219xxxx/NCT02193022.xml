      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oral treatment with Miltefosine in children with PKDL at allometric daily dose (based on&#xD;
           body weight and height) for 12 weeks is safe with a cure rate of ≥95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Development of PKDL in children and adolescent is genetically predisposed and is&#xD;
           associated with IL-10 &amp; IFN-gamma gene polymorphism causing high and low serum level of&#xD;
           IL-10 and IFN-gamma respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nutritional &amp; environmental factors such as low serum vitamin E, A, D, Zn &amp; arsenic&#xD;
           exposure are associated with PKDL.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visceral leishmaniasis also known as kala-azar is a neglected tropical disease affecting the&#xD;
      poorest of the poor living in the rural areas of Bangladesh, Nepal, India, South Sudan, Sudan&#xD;
      and Brazil with an annual incidence of 500,000 new cases with 10% mortality. Since 2008, the&#xD;
      first oral drug Miltefosine (MF) has been introduced for the treatment of VL in Bangladesh,&#xD;
      India and Nepal as part of the National VL / Kala-azar (KA) Elimination Program (NKEP) in&#xD;
      these three countries. The duration of treatment is 28 days at a dose of 100 mg / day or 50&#xD;
      mg / day for adult with body weight ≥25 KG and&lt; 25 Kg respectively. For children, it is ≤ 2&#xD;
      mg/Kg/24h. The efficacy of MF for VL is 87%, but we have observed that 15% of those develop&#xD;
      Post-kala-azar Dermal (PKDL) Leishmaniasis with an annual incidence of about 300 cases,&#xD;
      mostly in the Mymensingh district of Bangladesh (the most VL endemic district in the&#xD;
      country). The clinical manifestation of PKDL is macular/papular/nodular /mixed lesions.&#xD;
      Children and adolescents with PKDL are otherwise clinically healthy, but these patients&#xD;
      continue to carry the parasites for years and can transmit the parasites to others through&#xD;
      sand fly bite. In this way these patients play a role as inter-epidemic reservoirs and can&#xD;
      initiate new outbreaks of VL in the community. The only current treatment option is 120&#xD;
      injections with SSG (one injection per day for 20 consecutive days in a month for 6 months).&#xD;
      Injections are very painful and associated with risks including sudden heart failure from&#xD;
      cardiac arrhythmias and death. Therefore, PKDL patients usually do not seek treatment and the&#xD;
      compliance is very low, when they take treatment with SSG. Thus, a safe and effective&#xD;
      treatment which can ensure better compliance is urgently needed. Recent studies in India&#xD;
      showed that 12 weeks treatment with MF of adult PKDL patients is effective (94%) and safe.&#xD;
      However, the study reported only 24 adult PKDL cases. Similar results have been observing&#xD;
      with adult PKDL patients in Nepal. There is no information about the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      12 weeks MF treatment of children with PKDL and about pharmacokinetics of MF among these&#xD;
      children. It is established that exposure to MF in VL children was less to oral MF at&#xD;
      conventional dose of 2.5mg/Kg/day, thus allometric dosing of MF is now recommended by&#xD;
      experts. A study is therefore urgently needed for efficacy and safety of allometric daily&#xD;
      dose of MF for 12 weeks for treatment of PKDL in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors for PKDL are poorly investigated. Younger age of VL patients and genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility to PKDL are found to contribute to PKDL. Exposure to arsenic through drinking&#xD;
      water and protein-energy malnutrition are public health problem in Bangladesh. Both arsenic&#xD;
      and vitamin E and other nutrients deficiency may contribute to PKDL directly or in&#xD;
      combination, because they inhibit innate and adaptive immunity to infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis(es) and Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Oral treatment with Miltefosine in children with PKDL at allometric daily dose for 12&#xD;
      weeks is safe with a cure rate of ≥95%; 2. Development of PKDL in children and adolescent is&#xD;
      genetically predisposed and is associated with IL-10 &amp; IFN-gamma gene polymorphism causing&#xD;
      high serum level of IL-10 and low serum level of IFN-gamma; 3. Nutritional &amp; environmental&#xD;
      factors such as low serum vitamin E &amp; arsenic exposure are associated with PKDL .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a cross sectional survey for suspected PKDL patients among children&#xD;
      treated for VL in the past, followed by an open clinical trial with MF with 12 months follow&#xD;
      up after treatment and a simultaneous case-control study for PKDL risk factors.&#xD;
      Parasitologically confirmed (demonstration of parasite in skin specimens by microscopy and /&#xD;
      qPCR) PKDL children will be subjects of the open clinical trial with oral Miltefosine (MF) at&#xD;
      allometric daily dose. In the case-control component of the study, confirmed PKDL children&#xD;
      will be cases. Children treated for VL in the past and currently without skin lesions will be&#xD;
      the controls and will be matched with cases by geographic area, age, sex and time of VL&#xD;
      treatment. Inclusion criteria are: a child treated for VL in the past, aged more than 2 years&#xD;
      old and less than 18 years old, either sex, fulfill case definition as PKDL case / control,&#xD;
      parents / guardian consent for participation of the child in the study. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      are: do not fulfill all inclusion criteria for a case/control, with skin fungal infection /&#xD;
      leprosy, without clinical evidence for arsenic dermatosis, negative for rK39 rapid test,&#xD;
      control child who will develop PKDL during follow up. Based on expected 95% cure rate, a&#xD;
      sample size of 73 PKDL children would produce a two-sided 95% confidence interval with an&#xD;
      estimated precision of 5%. Allowing for an attrition rate of 10%, the final sample size is 80&#xD;
      children in each group and the total sample size is 160. Blood, urine and hair specimens will&#xD;
      be collected from cases before treatment and at 12 months follow up, and from controls at&#xD;
      baseline only. Primary outcome is safety and cure rate of 12 weeks treatment with MF. Cure&#xD;
      will be defined by resolution of skin lesions by ≥90% and skin and blood specimens negative&#xD;
      for LD bodies and leishmania DNA at 12 months after treatment. Safety will be measured by&#xD;
      frequency of adverse events (AEs). We expect transient AEs like vomiting and diarrhea in less&#xD;
      than 30% and serious adverse event in none.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 12 weeks treatment with MF at allometric daily dose is found safe and effective for&#xD;
      treatment in children with PKDL, then it will be scale up through the National VL Elimination&#xD;
      Program. Through the case-control component, we may find nutritional / environmental risk&#xD;
      factor for PKDL which will help to design preventative strategy against PKDL.&#xD;
