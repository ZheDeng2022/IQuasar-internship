      Objectives: To assess immunogenicity and safety of the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal&#xD;
      vaccine (PPV23) in JIA patients with and without anti-TNF therapy. The influences of&#xD;
      demographic data, disease activity and treatment on immune response and the potential&#xD;
      deleterious effect of vaccine on disease itself were also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 17 JIA patients immediately pre-etanercept (Group 1) and 10 JIA patients on stable&#xD;
      dose of methotrexate (Group 2) will receive one dose of PPV23. All patients will be evaluated&#xD;
      pre-vaccination, 2 months and 12 months post-vaccination for seven pneumoccocal serotypes.&#xD;
      Serology will be performed by enzyme immunoassay and the immunogenicity endpoints will&#xD;
      include seroprotection (SP), seroconversion (SP) and geometric mean concentration of&#xD;
      antibodies (GMC). Clinical and laboratorial parameters of JIA will be evaluated before and&#xD;
      after vaccination.&#xD;

      Seventeen JIA patients (International League Against Rheumatism criteria) followed at the&#xD;
      Pediatric Rheumatology Unit of Children's Institute of Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de&#xD;
      Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo and who are refractory to methotrexate [median dose 0.9&#xD;
      mg/kg/week (0.7 - 1)] will be included immediately before the association of anti-TNF&#xD;
      (etanercept 0.8 mg/kg/week, Group 1) to the previous therapy. The control group (Group 2)&#xD;
      consist of 10 JIA patients on stable dose of methotrexate [median dose 0.8 mg/kg/week&#xD;
      (0.3-1.0)]. One intramuscular dose of PPV23 (Sanofi Pasteur), lot B0381-3, at the&#xD;
      immunization center of the same hospital will be given to each study subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are ≥ 5 and ≤ 18 years old and patients with previous vaccination against S.&#xD;
      pneumoniae will be excluded. This study was approved by the Local Ethical Committee of our&#xD;
      University Hospital and an informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal&#xD;
      guardians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine immunogenicity Blood samples will be collected pre-vaccination, 2 months and 12&#xD;
      months post-vaccination for 7 pneumoccocal serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F). Samples&#xD;
      will be centrifuged and serum will be frozen and stored at -70 ◦C until tested. In order to&#xD;
      eliminate non-specific antibodies that may exhibit cross-reactivity, the samples will be&#xD;
      pre-absorbed with the C-polysaccharide and with the heterologous serotype 22F.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serology for each serotype will be performed by enzyme immunoassay and immunogenicity&#xD;
      endpoints will include seroprotection rate (SP) (percentage of subjects achieving antibodies&#xD;
      titers ≥1.3 micrograms/mL), seroconversion rate (SC) (percentage of subjects with a minimum&#xD;
      of 2-fold rise in post-vaccination antibodies titers) and the geometric mean concentration of&#xD;
      antibodies (GMC). Adequate vaccine response will be considered when SC occur for at least 50%&#xD;
      of all seven vaccine serotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the period of one year after PPV23 vaccination, all upper and lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections will be weekly recorded during clinical appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: The number of participants with local and systemic adverse events will be assessed as&#xD;
      a measure of safety and tolerability. Local reactions were considered to be related to the&#xD;
      PPV23, while systemic adverse events were analyzed individually to determine their causality.&#xD;
      Severe adverse events were defined as those requiring hospitalization or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical, laboratorial and therapy assessment: All patients will be evaluated on the day of&#xD;
      vaccination, 2 months and 12 months after immunization for clinical and laboratorial&#xD;
      parameters: number of active joints (swelling within a joint, or limitation in the range of&#xD;
      joint movement with joint pain or tenderness), number of limited joints, morning stiffness,&#xD;
      patient and physician global assessment of arthritis activity measured with pain scores on&#xD;
      the Visual Analog Scale&quot; (VAS) and validated Brazilian version of Childhood Health Assessment&#xD;
      Questionnaire (CHAQ). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was evaluated according to&#xD;
      Westergreen method and C-reactive protein (CRP) according to nephelometry. The Juvenile&#xD;
      Arthritis Disease Activity Score with 27-joint reduced count (JADAS-27), defined as the&#xD;
      linear sum of the scores of 4 components [physician global assessment of disease activity&#xD;
      (measured on a 10-cm VAS), parent/patient global assessment of well-being (measured on a&#xD;
      10-cm VAS); number of active joints (0-27 joints); and ESR] (range: 0 - 57 points), will be&#xD;
      calculated in all JIA patients. Current concomitant treatment with non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug, prednisone, methotrexate, leflunomide and cyclosporine will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Immunogenicity and safety analyses will be descriptive and data will be&#xD;
      presented as number (%) or median (range). The GMCs will be compared between JIA patients&#xD;
      with and without anti-TNF therapy using a two-sided Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test&#xD;
      on the log10-transformed titers. The prospective analysis of GMCs for each of seven&#xD;
      pneumococcal serotypes will be performed by Friedman Repeated Measures ANOVA on Ranks.&#xD;
      Categorical variables (rates of seroprotection and seroconversion, prednisone and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs use) will be compared using Fisher's exact test. The prospective&#xD;
      analysis of seroprotection and seroconversion rates for each of seven pneumococcal serotypes&#xD;
      will be performed by McNemar's Test. The effects before and after vaccination on disease&#xD;
      activity will be analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. The statistical significance&#xD;
      was set at p value &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
