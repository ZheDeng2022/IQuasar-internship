      The purpose of this study is to assess the influence of simultaneous CYP3A4 and&#xD;
      p-glycoprotein inhibition on lenvatinib pharmacokinetics following a single oral dose of 5 mg&#xD;
      lenvatinib.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, two-period, crossover study consisting of&#xD;
      two phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase will have two&#xD;
      periods: Screening and Baseline 1. The Randomization Phase will have two periods: Treatment&#xD;
      Period 1 and Treatment Period 2 with a Baseline 2 assessment prior to Treatment Period 2. In&#xD;
      the Randomization Phase, subjects will be randomized to one of two possible treatment&#xD;
      sequences (placebo/ketoconazole or ketoconazole/placebo). Ketoconazole 400 mg or placebo will&#xD;
      be orally administered once daily for the first four days of each treatment period. On the&#xD;
      fifth day of each treatment period, in addition to ketoconazole/placebo, 5 mg lenvatinib will&#xD;
      be orally administered. Ketoconazole/placebo administration will then continue for 13&#xD;
      additional days. Subjects are crossed over from Treatment Period 1 to Treatment Period 2&#xD;
      after a 2-week washout.&#xD;

             intrauterine device [IUD], condom + spermicide or condom + diaphragm with spermicide,&#xD;
             a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive; or have a vasectomized partner)&#xD;

             tubal ligation with surgery at least 6 months prior to dosing, hysterectomy, or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy with surgery at least 2 months prior to dosing). All women who&#xD;

             diaphragm with spermicide, IUD) starting for at least one menstrual cycle prior to&#xD;
             starting study drug(s) and throughout the entire study and for 30 days after the last&#xD;
