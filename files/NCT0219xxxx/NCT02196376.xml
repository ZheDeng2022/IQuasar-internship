      In this pilot study, the investigators will test the hypothesis that patients with postural&#xD;
      tachycardia syndrome will have an elevated percentage of functional antibodies to adrenergic&#xD;
      receptors compared with control subjects without POTS. The investigators further hypothesize&#xD;
      that the percentage of POTS patients with antibodies will be higher in those patients with a&#xD;
      viral infection at the onset of their illness than in those patients with other or undefined&#xD;
      illness onsets.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is poorly understood. Many of these patients have&#xD;
      elevated levels of plasma norepinephrine, particularly when upright One subgroup of patients&#xD;
      has a primary hyperadrenergic state. The majority of patients have a marked deficit in plasma&#xD;
      blood volume compared to healthy control subjects. The investigators have previously reported&#xD;
      that some patients suffer paradoxically from a partial dysautonomia affecting the lower&#xD;
      limbs. Most patients seem to suffer from either a primary or secondary increase in central&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system drive. Recent data have shown that patients with postural&#xD;
      orthostatic tachycardia syndrome have a lower cardiac stroke volume than their healthy&#xD;
      counterparts and this low stroke volume may drive their orthostatic tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical examination will include (at minimum):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Orthostatic vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure) Supine and Standing for up to 10&#xD;
           minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beighton Criteria for Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (Ehlers-Danlos III)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dependent acrocyanosis (during stand test)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Heart Rate and Blood Pressure Recording A subset of subjects will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to also have continuous recordings of heart rate and blood pressure for 5-10&#xD;
      minutes while lying down quietly. They will be instrumented with EKG patches on their body&#xD;
      and a finger blood pressure cuff, and these data will be digitally sampled and acquired on a&#xD;
      dedicated laptop computer for later offline analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an optional rider on the consent form to allow the patient to consent to this&#xD;
      portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood work&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn for future assay and analysis of the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antibodies regulating cardiovascular function&#xD;
&#xD;
           o The clinical significance of these antibodies is unknown. The investigators will share&#xD;
           the results of the antibody panel with the subject, but with the caveat that no clinical&#xD;
           interpretation or comment on significance can be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammatory markers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total amount of blood drawn for this project will be less than 15 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RAND-36&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health Thermometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chandler Fatigue Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily diary of Fatigue Symptoms - Fibromyalgia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain Detect Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Orthostatic Grading Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COMPASS-31&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Structured History (including some of the elements from section 6.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      These questionnaires will be completed directly online (web-based interface) using a&#xD;
      personalized link that will be provided to the subjects after they give their informed&#xD;
      consent. These will be created in a REDCap-Survey environment, with the data collected and&#xD;
      stored on a password-protected, HIPAA-compliant, secure computer server.&#xD;

        Chronic orthostatic intolerance, sometimes known as the postural tachycardia syndrome&#xD;
        (POTS), is the most common disorder among patients seen at several centers specializing in&#xD;
        diseases of the autonomic nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        excessive increase in heart rate [&gt;30 min-1] on standing associated with orthostatic&#xD;
        symptoms [including palpitation, chest pain syndrome, dyspnea on standing, mental clouding&#xD;
        and difficulties with concentration], in the absence of orthostatic hypotension.&#xD;
        Orthostatic tachycardia can produce substantial disability among otherwise healthy people.&#xD;
        Patients typically feel tired and run down. Many also report a myriad of symptoms that are&#xD;
        hard to categorize, often involving fatigue. We and others have reported that patients had&#xD;
        a diminished quality of life.&#xD;
