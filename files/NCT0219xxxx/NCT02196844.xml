  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this behavioral research study is to learn the opinion of patients and their&#xD;
      caregivers about a couple-based Hatha Yoga program (Group 1) during treatment for cancer.&#xD;
      Researchers also want to learn the effect of this program on lung function, distress,&#xD;
      biological function, and quality of life. For comparison purposes, there will also be a group&#xD;
      of participants (Group 2) that does not take part in this program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You and your caregiver/family member will have about a 50/50 chance of being assigned to each&#xD;
      group. The groups are randomly assigned, but it is also based on other factors such as your&#xD;
      age and the status of the disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caregiver:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, your demographic information (such as your age, sex,&#xD;
      and race) will be recorded. You will then be assigned to 1 of 2 study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will take part in the couple-based Hatha Yoga program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will not take part in the couple-based Hatha Yoga program but&#xD;
           will complete the same study procedures as Group 1. You will be given the option to take&#xD;
           part in the couple-based Hatha Yoga program (off study) after you finish your last&#xD;
           questionnaire packet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You and the patient will have about a 1 in 2 chance of being assigned to each group (as in&#xD;
      the flip of a coin). The groups are randomly assigned, but the assignment will also depend on&#xD;
      the age, sex, and status of disease of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yoga Sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you will take part in up to 15 sessions of Hatha yoga with the patient&#xD;
      over the course of radiation therapy (2-3 weekly sessions). Each 45- to 60-minute session&#xD;
      will be guided by an instructor. You should attend each session with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the yoga sessions, you will be asked to do deep-breathing exercises and perform&#xD;
      different stretching and movement exercises. The movements are designed not to be difficult,&#xD;
      and you will sit on the floor or in a chair while you do them. You can move through the&#xD;
      exercises at your own pace. The instructor will be available to answer any question you may&#xD;
      have about the practice of Hatha yoga. Most of the yoga sessions may be videotaped. This is&#xD;
      so the researchers can keep track of the quality of the sessions. Only the study staff will&#xD;
      be able to view this videotape. The video files are digital and will be deleted after all the&#xD;
      data are studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At your fifth session, you will be given a CD and instructions for practicing Hatha yoga at&#xD;
      home. While the patient is receiving radiation therapy, you will be asked to practice at home&#xD;
      1 time a day either with him/her or alone on the days you do not have a session at the&#xD;
      clinic. Your answers to the questions will not be shared with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each week of radiation therapy, you will also complete a questionnaire about your&#xD;
      feelings about the Hatha Yoga sessions. You will be asked to list what you liked or disliked,&#xD;
      what you found most and least useful, and how you would rate the instructor. You will also be&#xD;
      asked about how often you practice outside of class and if you think you are benefitting from&#xD;
      the Hatha Yoga program. It should take about 5 minutes to complete this questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires for All Study Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete about 10 questionnaires before the patient's first radiation treatment, at&#xD;
      the end of the treatment (usually 6 weeks later), and then again 3 months later. The&#xD;
      questionnaires have questions about your mood, your quality of life, your feelings about&#xD;
      being a caregiver, and your relationship with the patient. It should take about 45 minutes to&#xD;
      complete these questionnaires each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also complete about 5 questionnaires halfway through the radiation treatment&#xD;
      schedule. These questionnaires have questions about your quality of life. These should take&#xD;
      about 20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva Testing for All Study Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your first visit, at the end of the patient's radiotherapy, and 3 months after the&#xD;
      radiation, you will be asked to provide saliva samples to measure the level of cortisol (a&#xD;
      stress hormone). These saliva samples will be collected 4 times a day for 2 days in a row.&#xD;
      You will be asked to collect the samples when you first wake up, about 45 minutes later,&#xD;
      about 10 hours after waking, and then at bedtime. To collect each saliva sample, you will&#xD;
      chew on a cotton ball for a few seconds and then put the cotton in a small plastic tube. You&#xD;
      will write down the times at which you took these samples. You will then either bring the&#xD;
      samples into the clinic or mail the samples back to MD Anderson in postage-paid envelopes&#xD;
      that will be provided to you. The supplies needed for this testing will also be provided at&#xD;
      no cost to you. These saliva samples will be destroyed after being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Phone Calls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, after you have completed the weekly yoga classes, you will receive&#xD;
      phone calls from a study team member asking about your at home Hatha Yoga practice. You will&#xD;
      be called every other week between the end of your radiotherapy and your final visit with the&#xD;
      study. This will be about 5-6 phone calls and they will last approximately 10 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over when you have completed the questionnaires at&#xD;
      the time of the patient's 3-month follow-up appointment in the thoracic clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 patients and their family members, for a total of 100 participants, will take part&#xD;
      in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part, your medical history and demographic information (such as your&#xD;
      age, sex, and race) will be recorded. By signing this consent, you also agree that your&#xD;
      caregiver will be approached to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your first visit, you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of dice) to 1 of 2&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will take part in the couple-based Hatha Yoga program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will not take part in the couple-based Hatha Yoga program but will complete the&#xD;
           same procedures as group 1. Participants in this group will be given the option to take&#xD;
           part in the couple-based Hatha Yoga program (off study) after they finish their last&#xD;
           questionnaire packet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hatha Yoga Sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You and your caregiver have a 50/50 chance to be assigned to the intervention group or to the&#xD;
      usual care group. If you are assigned to the intervention group, you will take part in up to&#xD;
      15 sessions of Hatha yoga over the course of radiation therapy (2-3 weekly sessions). Each&#xD;
      45- to 60-minute session will be guided by an instructor. You should attend each session&#xD;
      together as a couple.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the yoga sessions, you will be asked to do deep-breathing exercises and perform&#xD;
      different stretching and movement exercises. The movements are designed not to be difficult,&#xD;
      and you will sit on the floor or in a chair while you do them. You can move through the&#xD;
      exercises at your own pace. The instructor will be available to answer any questions you may&#xD;
      have about the practice of Hatha yoga. Most of the yoga sessions may be videotaped. This is&#xD;
      so the researchers can keep track of the quality of the sessions. Only the study staff will&#xD;
      be able to view this videotape. The video files are digital and will be deleted after all the&#xD;
      data are studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At your fifth session, you will be given a CD and instructions for practicing Hatha yoga at&#xD;
      home. While you are receiving radiation therapy, you will be asked to practice at home 1 time&#xD;
      a day either with your caregiver or alone on the days you do not have a session at the&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to the yoga group, during each week of radiation therapy, you will also&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire asking your feelings about the Hatha Yoga sessions. You will be&#xD;
      asked to list what you liked or disliked, what you found most and least useful, and how you&#xD;
      would rate the instructor. You will also be asked about how often you practice outside of&#xD;
      class and if you think you are benefitting from the Hatha Yoga program. It should take about&#xD;
      5 minutes to answer this questionnaire. Your answers to the questions will not be shared with&#xD;
      your caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 1 and 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete about 10 questionnaires before your first radiation treatment and again&#xD;
      after you complete your treatment schedule (usually 6 weeks later) and then again 3 months&#xD;
      later. The questionnaires ask about your health, any symptoms you may be having, your mood,&#xD;
      your level of fatigue, your sleeping habits, your relationship, and your quality of life. It&#xD;
      should take about 45 minutes to complete these questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also complete about 5 questionnaires again halfway through your radiation treatment&#xD;
      schedule. These questionnaires ask about your quality of life. These should take about 20&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Phone Calls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, after you have completed the weekly yoga classes, you will receive&#xD;
      phone calls from a study team member asking about your at home Hatha Yoga practice. You will&#xD;
      be called every other week between the end of your radiotherapy and your final visit with the&#xD;
      study. This will be about 5-6 phone calls and they will last approximately 10 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your baseline visit, at the end of treatment, and 3 months after radiotherapy, you will&#xD;
      be asked to provide saliva samples to measure the level of cortisol (a stress hormone). These&#xD;
      saliva samples will be collected 4 times a day for 2 days in a row. You will be asked to&#xD;
      collect the samples when you first wake up, about 45 minutes later, about 10 hours after&#xD;
      waking, and then at bedtime. To collect each saliva sample, you will chew on a cotton ball&#xD;
      for a few seconds and then put the cotton in a small plastic tube. You will write down the&#xD;
      times at which you took these samples. You will then either either bring the samples into the&#xD;
      clinic or mail the samples back to MD Anderson in postage-paid envelopes that will be&#xD;
      provided to you. The tubes will also be provided at no cost to you. These saliva samples will&#xD;
      be sent to These saliva samples will be destroyed after being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung Function tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Function tests (PFTs) are part of your standard treatment as a patient at MD&#xD;
      Anderson. We will request copies of these, as available, from your electronic medical records&#xD;
      at baseline and 3 months after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also complete the 6-minute walking test. The six-minute walk test measures the&#xD;
      distance you are able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal&#xD;
      is to walk as far as possible in six minutes. You will be allowed to self-pace and rest as&#xD;
      needed during the walk along a marked walkway. You will complete a 6-minute walk at baseline,&#xD;
      at the end of radiotherapy, and 3 months after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over when you have completed the questionnaires at&#xD;
      the time of your 3-month follow-up appointment in the thoracic clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 patients and their caregivers, for a total of 100 participants, will take part in&#xD;
      this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
