  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of AZD2014, a novel&#xD;
      anticancer agent, in combination with paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD2014 will be given orally, twice daily at a starting dose of 25 mg per day for 3 days on,&#xD;
      4 days off with a weekly infusion of 80 mg of paclitaxel for 6 weeks followed by a treatment&#xD;
      break of one week, therefore each cycle will be 7 weeks long. Cohorts of three patients will&#xD;
      be treated at this dose of AZD2014 and then at 50mg and 75 mg providing is it safe to do so.&#xD;
      Once we have determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using the 3 days on, 4 days off&#xD;
      schedule of AZD2014, patients will be given AZD2014 2 days on, 5 days with their paclitaxel&#xD;
      infusion. Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of three to evaluate three escalating doses of&#xD;
      AZD2014 to determine the MTD for the 2 days on, 5 days off schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On completion of the dose escalation phase of the study patients with ovarian cancer and&#xD;
      squamous cell lung cancer will be treated at the MTD established for each dosing schedule. A&#xD;
      minimum of 10 ovarian cancer patients and 15 squamous cell lung patients will be enrolled to&#xD;
      the 3 days on, 4 days off schedule. Whilst a minimum of 10 squamous cell cancer patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled to the 2 days on, 5 days off schedule to further assess the tolerability of the&#xD;
      combination of AZD2014 and paclitaxel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, Phase I clinical trial of the combination of AZD2014 and weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two intermittent BD dosing schedules of AZD2014 in combination with paclitaxel will be&#xD;
      evaluated. The 3 days on 4 days off schedule will examine 3 continuous days of AZD2014 per&#xD;
      week in combination with weekly paclitaxel. The 2 days on 5 days off schedule will examine 2&#xD;
      sequential days of AZD2014 dosing in combination with weekly paclitaxel. For both schedules,&#xD;
      a dose escalation 3+3 design will be used to establish the MTD and the recommended Phase II&#xD;
      dose. Approximately 15 patients with solid tumours will be entered into each schedule during&#xD;
      the dose escalation of this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expansion part of the trial will be used to further assess the tolerability of AZD2014 in&#xD;
      combination with weekly paclitaxel. For the 3 days on 4 days off schedule 10 patients with&#xD;
      ovarian cancer and 15 patients with squamous lung cancer will be enrolled and treated at the&#xD;
      MTD established from the dose escalation phase. Accrual to these expansion arms may commence&#xD;
      as soon as the MTD is determined and proceed in parallel with the dose escalation phase of&#xD;
      the 2 days on 5 days off schedule. Once the MTD has been determined for the 2 days on 5 days&#xD;
      off schedule 15 patients with squamous lung cancer may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the MTD and decision to enter the expansion phase for each schedule will be&#xD;
      made by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) taking into consideration the safety data and&#xD;
      available PK/PD data.&#xD;
