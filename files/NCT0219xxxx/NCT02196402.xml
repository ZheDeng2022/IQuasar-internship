    <textblock>
      Several reports have suggested that an endoscopic diagnosis of adenoma, by means of narrow&#xD;
      band imaging (NBI), might allow the determination of polyp management and surveillance&#xD;
      interval, particularly in patients with diminutive polyps (&lt; 5mm), in which the advanced&#xD;
      histological features are uncommon and the prevalence of invasive cancer is negligible (1).&#xD;
      On this basis, the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) has set an&#xD;
      initiative evaluating the applicability of real-time endoscopic polyp assessment in clinical&#xD;
      practice (1), which states that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. for diminutive polyps to be resected and discarded without pathologic assessment,&#xD;
           endoscopic technology (when used with high confidence) used to determine histology of&#xD;
           polyps &lt; 5mm in size, when combined with the histopathologic assessment of polyps &gt;5 mm&#xD;
           in size, should provide a &gt; 90% agreement in assignment of post-polypectomy surveillance&#xD;
           intervals when compared to decisions based on pathology assessment of all identified&#xD;
           polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In order for a technology to be used to guide the decision to leave suspected&#xD;
           rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps &lt;5 mm in size in place (without resection), the&#xD;
           technology should provide &gt; 90% negative predictive value (when used with high&#xD;
           confidence) for adenomatous histology&#xD;
&#xD;
      This strategy could potentially exert a significant impact on colonoscopy practice, by&#xD;
      decreasing at some extent pathology-associated costs, although those related to histological&#xD;
      analysis of &gt;5mm polyps is maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study performed in our Centre (2), we restricted the application of the resect&#xD;
      and discard strategy to patients with small or diminutive polyps only, achieving an&#xD;
      accordance between endoscopy-directed and histology-directed surveillance strategy of about&#xD;
      85% in both populations. This approach, where decisions on patient management are driven only&#xD;
      by the &quot;in vivo&quot; endoscopic assessment, provides on one hand a slightly lower accordance than&#xD;
      the threshold of 90% set by the PIVI, but on the other one it allows the complete spare of&#xD;
      pathology related costs, although for a smaller proportion of patients. Moreover we observed&#xD;
      a negative predictive value of 86% for the presence of adenoma within the diminutive polyps&#xD;
      cohort, although a separate analysis for left sided ones was not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIms of this single center, prospective, observational study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To prospectively evaluate the accordance between the endoscopy-directed and&#xD;
           histology-directed surveillance strategies by applying the resect and discard strategy&#xD;
           for diminutive polyps according to the PIVI statements&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the economic impact of the resect and discard strategy when applied either&#xD;
           according to the PIVI statements or to restrictedly to subjects with diminutive polyps&#xD;
           only&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To provide a temporary validation of diagnostic performances of the resect and discard&#xD;
           strategy for our group and the potential presence of a learning effect for the&#xD;
           methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Accordance between endoscopists' and nurses' categorization of adenomas according to&#xD;
           standardized criteria (see below)&#xD;
