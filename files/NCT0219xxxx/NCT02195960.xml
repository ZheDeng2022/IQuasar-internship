  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention has been focused recently on the development of modalities that can protect healthy&#xD;
      organs from the harmful effects of radiation applied during different cancer treatment&#xD;
      schedules. As radiation-induced DNA damage involves oxidative stress, the protective role of&#xD;
      antioxidants has been tested in different dietary studies. Previous experience by the&#xD;
      collaborative team of the principal investigator and radiotherapists at the Catholic&#xD;
      University of Campobasso has shown in a retrospective study that moderate wine consumption&#xD;
      can reduce the side-effects of radiation therapy in patients with breast cancer. This effect&#xD;
      was presumably due to the polyphenol non alcoholic fraction of wine, a finding in agreement&#xD;
      with a cross-over intervention study in adult male volunteers, on protection by&#xD;
      de-alcoholized red wine from ex vivo radiation-induced DNA damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical trial will be to test the impact of supplementation with&#xD;
      anthocyanin-enriched food on the acute and medium-term side effects of radiotherapy in breast&#xD;
      cancer patients, in a prospective study design. Therefore a double blind, randomised,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial will be organised by assigning patients with breast cancer&#xD;
      scheduled for radiotherapy to a diet supplemented with an anthocyanin soluble extract.&#xD;

      Detailed Description&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Attention has been focused recently on the development of modalities that can protect&#xD;
           healthy organs from the harmful effects of radiation applied during different cancer&#xD;
           treatment schedules. As radiation-induced DNA and cellular damage involve oxidative&#xD;
           stress, the protective role of antioxidants will be tested on the toxic condition&#xD;
           induced by radiotherapy in breast cancer treatment. Consumption of polyphenol-rich&#xD;
           foods, such as fruits and vegetables, and beverages derived from plants, such as cocoa,&#xD;
           red wine and tea, may represent a beneficial diet in terms of oxidative protection.&#xD;
           Indeed, a retrospective study reports that that moderate wine consumption can reduce the&#xD;
           side-effects of radiation therapy in patients with breast cancer. This effect was&#xD;
           presumably due to the polyphenol non alcoholic fraction of wine, a finding in agreement&#xD;
           with a cross-over intervention study in adult male volunteers, on protection by&#xD;
           de-alcoholized red wine from ex vivo radiation-induced DNA damage. However, there are no&#xD;
           studies that address the relationship of polyphenol-rich food consumption with the toxic&#xD;
           effects of radiations in patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim of the study. The main objectives of this study are to evaluate the association&#xD;
           between the effect of polyphenol-rich food supplementation and toxicity of radiotherapy&#xD;
           for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design: Randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial with 2 parallel arms:&#xD;
           soluble corn flour at high content in anthocyanins and placebo. Placebo consists of&#xD;
           soluble corn flour poor in anthocyanins. The treatment will start one week before&#xD;
           starting radiotherapy, and continue during all radiotherapy treatment (of 3 or 5 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Population and recruitment: A total of 300 consecutive breast cancer patients&#xD;
           eligible for radiotherapy. Participants will be identified at the Department of&#xD;
           Radiotherapy of the Giovanni Paolo II Foundation of Campobasso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be recruited at their first consultation and subsequently referred to&#xD;
      the research investigators. The research staff in charge of the recruitment will pre-screen&#xD;
      participants on the basis of inclusion/exclusion criteria and will explain the study at this&#xD;
      time.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient must consent to be in the study and must have signed an approved consent&#xD;
             form conforming with institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must be ≥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. On histological examination, the tumor must be DCIS or invasive carcinoma of the&#xD;
             breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Surgical treatment of the breast must have been lumpectomy or quadrantectomy. The&#xD;
             margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of tumor (DCIS and&#xD;
             invasive). Reexcision of surgical margins is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with invasive breast cancer are required to have axillary staging which can&#xD;
             include sentinel node biopsy alone (if sentinel node is negative), sentinel node&#xD;
             biopsy followed by axillary dissection or sampling with a minimum total of 6 axillary&#xD;
             nodes (if sentinel node is positive), or axillary dissection alone (with a minimum of&#xD;
             6 axillary nodes). (Axillary staging is not required for patients with DCIS.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient must be randomized within 45 days following the last surgery for breast&#xD;
             cancer (lumpectomy, re-excision of margins, or axillary staging procedure) or within&#xD;
             30 days following the last chemotherapy cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been&#xD;
             disease-free for 5 or more years prior to randomization and are deemed by their&#xD;
             physician to be at low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are&#xD;
             eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the&#xD;
             cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Axillary nodes with definite evidence of microscopic or macroscopic extracapsular&#xD;
             extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. One or more positive non-axillary sentinel node(s). (Note that intramammary nodes are&#xD;
             staged as axillary nodes.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Palpable or radiographically suspicious ipsilateral or contralateral axillary,&#xD;
             supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or internal mammary nodes, unless there is&#xD;
             histologic confirmation that these nodes are negative for tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Suspicious microcalcifications, densities, or palpable abnormalities (in the&#xD;
             ipsilateral or contralateral breast) unless biopsied and found to be benign.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Non-epithelial breast malignancies such as sarcoma or lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Proven multicentric carcinoma (invasive cancer or DCIS) in more than one quadrant or&#xD;
             separated by 4 or more centimeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Paget's disease of the nipple.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Synchronous bilateral invasive or non-invasive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Surgical margins that cannot be microscopically assessed or are positive at pathologic&#xD;
             evaluation. (If surgical margins are rendered free of disease by reexcision, the&#xD;
             patient is eligible.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Breast implants. (Patients who have had implants removed are eligible.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Prior breast or thoracic radiation therapy for any condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Collagen vascular disease, specifically dermatomyositis with a creatine phosphokinase&#xD;
             level above normal or with an active skin rash, systemic lupus erythematosus, or&#xD;
             scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. Women of reproductive&#xD;
             potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.&#xD;
