  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether weight reduction decreases intramyocellular&#xD;
      (IMCL) and hepatic lipid content, and improves insulin sensitivity of muscle and fat tissue&#xD;
      in people who are insulin resistant and have a family history of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will examine whether a small weight loss in lean, insulin-resistant&#xD;
      offspring of type 2 diabetic patients will improve insulin resistance. The control group will&#xD;
      consist of subjects matched for gender, age and body weight with no family history of&#xD;
      diabetes. Before and after weight loss, rates of basal and insulin stimulated whole body&#xD;
      glucose metabolism will be measured using [6,6-2H] glucose during a 3 hour basal period and a&#xD;
      4 hour euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (20 mU/m2-min) clamp. Rates of whole body lipolysis will&#xD;
      be determined using [2H5] glycerol, localized rates of lipolysis will be measured using the&#xD;
      microdialysis technique and muscle PI 3-kinase activity will be assessed in muscle biopsies.&#xD;
      FFA metabolites (fatty acyl CoA, ceramides, diacylglycerol) will be measured in fat tissue&#xD;
      collected from the abdominal subcutaneous fat cell depot. Body composition will be determined&#xD;
      with bioelectrical impedance and whole body MRI; IMCL will be measured with MRS. Before and&#xD;
      after weight loss, insulin secretion will be measured with the hyperglycemic clamp (as&#xD;
      described under Day 2 Hyperglycemic Clamp).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>On Jan 29, 2019 the study was approved by the Yale IRB to add the option of a cross-over study for participants, who are interested and willing to do so.&#xD;
On June 9, 2020 the study was approved to allow participants to complete only one arm of the double blind cross-over design study and to add Arm 3, which is a 48-week open label extension study to examine whether lowering of liver lipid content will be sustained safely over the longer-term treatment with GS-0976.</intervention_model_description>
