  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II trial studies the overall tumor response of vaccine therapy in patientswith&#xD;
      previously untreated Stage III or IV, asymptomatic, non-bulky follicular lymphoma. The&#xD;
      vaccine contains an extract of the patient's own cancer cells and the immunostimulant&#xD;
      protein, interleukin-2 (IL-2). It is hoped that when injected under the skin, the vaccine&#xD;
      will enable the patient's immune system to recognize and destroy the cancer cells. The trial&#xD;
      will also assess the safety of the vaccine, the time from vaccine treatment until the patient&#xD;
      requires another type of anti-lymphoma treatment, progression-free survival, and the&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm open-label pilot Phase II study. Following informed consent, eligible&#xD;
      subjects will undergo excisional biopsy of a lymphoma-containing lymph node for diagnosis and&#xD;
      for generation of the Oncoquest-L vaccine. Patients will receive subcutaneous injections&#xD;
      consisting of their autologous tumor-derived Oncoquest-L vaccine starting at approximately 4&#xD;
      to 8 weeks after the biopsy. The first two doses will be given at a 2-week interval and the&#xD;
      remaining 3 doses at monthly intervals. Patients will be monitored for response by performing&#xD;
      imaging studies at baseline and 1 month after the fifth vaccination (Week 19). Additional&#xD;
      imaging studies will be performed every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months during&#xD;
      the second year until relapse or disease progression whichever occurs sooner.&#xD;

    <description>Safety parameters (e.g., adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory test results) will be recorded from the time patient signs informed consent, at every clinic visit during study treatment, 4 weeks after the 5th vaccination, and thereafter every 3 months during the 1st year and then every 6 months during the 2nd year.</description>

    <description>Antibody production will be reported as increased titers of antibodies, B cells will be expressed as % B cell populations, T cell responses will be expressed as increases of tumor-specific T cells and changes in expression and quantity of cytokines (proteins that indicate changes in the immune response). Blood samples will be collected within 8 weeks prior to the 1st vaccination (baseline); within 7 days prior to the 5th vaccination; and 4 weeks after the 5th vaccination.</description>
