  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have noticed a group of patients presenting with a longstanding wet cough which has often&#xD;
      been treated as asthma. The cough is productive of sputum which frequently contains bacteria,&#xD;
      but does not resolve with standard antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A very similar cough is seen in subjects who smoke, have exposure to airbourne dusts or&#xD;
      chemicals or have a condition known as bronchiectasis, but these problems have already been&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have found that prolonged treatment with an antibiotic called azithromycin is very&#xD;
      effective but using azithromycin in this way is not licensed and there is currently no trial&#xD;
      evidence to support its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will evaluate the clinical benefit of low dose azithromycin to determine if&#xD;
      this is an effective and safe treatment for these patients. It will also involve a detailed&#xD;
      investigation of these patients to determine whether they have enough in common to believe we&#xD;
      are describing a new condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We and others have observed a cohort of patients, mainly referred with either poorly&#xD;
      controlled asthma despite high dose treatment or suspected bronchiectasis, who give a history&#xD;
      of chronic (often 3 months or more) productive cough which improves with antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      but quickly relapses. Most deny wheeze and on examination there are often transmitted sounds&#xD;
      from mucus in the large airways but no expiratory wheeze typical of asthma. Investigations&#xD;
      including spirometry, bronchial challenges, chest X-ray, screen for immunodeficiency and high&#xD;
      resolution CT (HRCT) scan exclude recognised causes of productive cough but sputum culture is&#xD;
      often positive for Haemophilus influenzae although sometimes demonstrates normal respiratory&#xD;
      flora despite being markedly purulent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to their efficacy in cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis we have empirically tried&#xD;
      treatment with low dose macrolide antibiotics over 3-6 months often with dramatic benefit.&#xD;
      This is however an unproven and unlicensed indication which needs to be more thoroughly&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key objective of the study is to determine if 12 weeks treatment of patients with chronic&#xD;
      productive cough with low dose azithromycin is both effective and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to describe the clinical and pathological features&#xD;
      of a cohort of patients who present with chronic productive cough (with no evidence of&#xD;
      bronchiectasis, smoking-related chronic bronchitis or immunodeficiency) to determine if these&#xD;
      are sufficiently similar to justify a new diagnostic label.&#xD;
