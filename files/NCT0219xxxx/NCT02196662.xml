    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the rate and extent of absorption of&#xD;
      mesalamine-sodium hyaluronate 200 mg-28.75 mg delayed-release capsule (IBD98-M, Test) versus&#xD;
      Delzicol 400 mg delayed-release capsule (mesalamine Reference), administered as a single oral&#xD;
      dose of 2 x 200 mg-28.75 mg delayed-release capsule (total dose of 400 mg-57.50 mg) or 1 x&#xD;
      400 mg delayed-release capsule under fasting conditions.&#xD;

      Safety population The safety population is defined as all subjects who received at least one&#xD;
      dose of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic Population The pharmacokinetic population will include all subjects&#xD;
      completing at least 2 periods and for whom the pharmacokinetic profile can be adequately&#xD;
      characterised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any subject with pre-dose concentrations for mesalamine will be excluded from the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic population for this analyte if the pre-dose concentration is greater than 5%&#xD;
      of the Cmax value of that period for this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from subjects who experienced emesis during the sampling interval and who were not&#xD;
      withdrawn as per criterion established under section 9.10 may be evaluated after completion&#xD;
      of the pharmacokinetic analysis. Any subject who experienced emesis within 2 times median&#xD;
      Tmax of the current study (based on the Reference product) will be excluded from the&#xD;
      statistical analysis. Data (concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters) from subjects&#xD;
      excluded due to a pre dose concentration greater than 5% of their Cmax or from subjects&#xD;
      withdrawn due to adverse events or vomiting episodes will be presented but excluded from&#xD;
      descriptive statistics.&#xD;
