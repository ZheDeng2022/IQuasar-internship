      To determine the prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection (NTM) in pediatric&#xD;
      patients with cystic fibrosis in the State fo Florida. HYPOTHESIS: There is high prevalence&#xD;
      of NTM in CF pediatric population in the State of Florida, and likely higher than in the rest&#xD;
      of the country.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) are a heterogeneous group of organisms that have been&#xD;
      increasingly reported in North America 1, 2 and recognized to be a pulmonary pathogen in non&#xD;
      immunocompromised persons, in middle age-elderly people, non smoking women, apart from the&#xD;
      high risk population with underlying lung disease, and also in Cystic fibrosis (CF)&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasians, a result&#xD;
      of mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) gene. The carrier rate is&#xD;
      estimated at 1:25, and 1:3500 live births in Caucasians are affected with CF. A broadening&#xD;
      spectrum of mutations of the CFTR gene has been identified in recent years and a widening&#xD;
      array of disorders, particularly of the respiratory system, is expected to be associated with&#xD;
      some of these genetic abnormalities. The predisposition to specific airway infections may be&#xD;
      a feature of some of these mutations as well as many modifying genes that could alter the&#xD;
      course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease predominantly affects the GI tract and the respiratory system. Infectious&#xD;
      complications of the latter are the predominant determinants of morbidity and life expectancy&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cystic fibrosis are also at high risk of suffering from chronic airway&#xD;
      infections, and one of the increasingly identified microorganisms is non-tuberculous&#xD;
      mycobacteria. NTM has been shown to be a potential contributor to the decline in lung&#xD;
      function, the major determinant of outcome and longevity of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since patients with CF have chronic bacterial pulmonary infections as their disease&#xD;
      progresses, the clinical signs and symptoms of NTM are often difficult to distinguish from&#xD;
      the underlying disease. Such potential underestimation of the contribution of NTM to the&#xD;
      decline of lung function in cystic fibrosis may be an added risk to the eventual outcome of&#xD;
      these patients. A variety of microorganisms traditionally considered colonizers of the&#xD;
      airways, have been increasing in frequency and assuming new clinical significance5, 6, and&#xD;
      previously unknown types of known organisms are taking on a new and ominous clinical&#xD;
      significance.7 To the practicing clinician NTM appears to be increasing in incidence among&#xD;
      the CF population, but the significance of this observation has not been firmly established.&#xD;
      The concept of &quot;colonization,&quot; defined as the isolation of the organism from the respiratory&#xD;
      tract without evidence of tissue invasion, was supported by several investigators in the&#xD;
      past, mainly in association with M. avium-complex infection.8, 9 With the emergence of high&#xD;
      resolution CT scanning (HRCT), it now appears that many of these patients have features of&#xD;
      parenchymal involvement, usually of a nodular pattern, suggesting that the term&#xD;
      &quot;colonization,&quot; at least in some patients, may be erroneous10, this notion has also been&#xD;
      supported by direct bioptic evidence11, indicating the possibility that the full significance&#xD;
      of infection with NTM may be underappreciated in patients with CF. It has been proposed that&#xD;
      rather than using terminologies such as colonization and active disease, the distinction&#xD;
      should be between patients who require immediate therapy on the basis of the rapid&#xD;
      progression of their disease and those in whom the decision can be delayed.12 The repeated&#xD;
      isolation of the same Mycobacterium from a patient with CF may be indicative of indolent&#xD;
      infection and these patients may be at risk of developing clinical symptoms that will&#xD;
      ultimately require treatment. This observation is supported by a series of autoptic studies13&#xD;
      indicating that patients with CF who have multiple positive sputum cultures for NTM are more&#xD;
      likely to have histologic evidence of granulomatous mycobacterial disease. An additional&#xD;
      study11 reports of a patient who had bioptic evidence of granulomas with NTM infection&#xD;
      resulting in fulminant disease some 14 years later, suggesting that frank infections may be&#xD;
      subclinical for a long period of time. The predictable but variable progression of the lung&#xD;
      disease inherent to CF cannot be easily uncoupled from a possible contribution that chronic&#xD;
      infection with NTM may add to the slope of such decline. Thus the role of such silent&#xD;
      infections in exacerbating the decline of pulmonary function in such patients remains to be&#xD;
      elucidated. From the clinical perspective subtle changes on serial high resolution&#xD;
      computerized tomography of the chest (HRCT) may enable earlier diagnosis and intervention&#xD;
      prior to the development of cavitation and/or irreversible lung damage.10 Of the NTM,&#xD;
      Mycobacterium abscessus is a member of the rapidly growing mycobacteria. With improvements in&#xD;
      identification, it is now known that this organism accounts for approximately 80% of&#xD;
      rapidly-growing mycobacterial respiratory disease isolates.9 Prior to the 1990s, there were&#xD;
      few reports of clinically important NTM infection complicating CF of which seven were cases&#xD;
      of M. abscessus.11 Although the natural history of this disease can vary, it appears to&#xD;
      follow a more fulminant course in patients with underlying lung diseases such as cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis.14 The treatment of M. abscessus is complex. The isolates are uniformly resistant to&#xD;
      standard antituberculosis drugs and are generally susceptible only to parenteral antibiotics&#xD;
      and the newer oral macrolides. The organism is notoriously difficult to eradicate. In a&#xD;
      report of 154 patients infected with rapidly growing mycobacteria14, only 10 patients&#xD;
      infected with M. abscessus exhibited a &quot;cure,&quot; the latter being defined as a return of&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms to baseline and reversion of sputum to smear and culture negativity for&#xD;
      at least 1 year. It has been noted for many years that the rates of infection and morbidity&#xD;
      with and from NTM in non-CF patients have been increasing.1, 9 This notion has been recently&#xD;
      supported by a report on the prevalence of mycobacterial infection in Ontario. The prevalence&#xD;
      rose significantly (p&lt;0.001) from 9.1/100,000 in 1997 to 16.5/100,000 in 2002, and&#xD;
      14.2/100,000 in 2003. A coincidental significant (&lt;0.001) decline in the rate of M.&#xD;
      tuberculosis infection from 6.9/100,000 in 1997 to 5.4/100,00 in 2003 was noted15. Whether&#xD;
      such a trend of increasing prevalence of NTM also occurs in CF has not been formally&#xD;
      addressed in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies from the US and Europe addressing the epidemiology of NTM in cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis has been published. These studies suggest a large variability in the incidence and&#xD;
      the nature of the infecting organisms between various regions of the world, and various&#xD;
      institutions. While the clinical impression would support a trend of increasing prevalence of&#xD;
      NTM in CF parallel to non-CF patients, the absence of repeated studies and the limitations&#xD;
      imposed by the inconsistencies amongst centers and regions, does not allow a firm statement&#xD;
      on this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increasing rates of infection and morbidity from NTM in non-CF patients 1, 2 is likely&#xD;
      similarly trending amongst patients with CF. In the US, a 1992 study from the University of&#xD;
      North Carolina at Chapel Hill 3 revealed a high prevalence of CF patients with NTM infection&#xD;
      in the southeastern United States. Of 87 patients studied 17 (19.5%) had at least one&#xD;
      positive culture for NTM. A 1993 study was reported from the University of Washington 4&#xD;
      revealing a prevalence of 12.5% amongst their 64 adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key publications on prevalence of NTM in patients with CF in the US by Olivier et al5&#xD;
      revealed an overall prevalence of 13%, with the most common organisms in adults being M.&#xD;
      avium- complex (MAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the prevalence and significance of NTM infections in younger patients with CF are&#xD;
      less clear. Several studies suggest that NTM infection in CF pediatric population is low 3-7&#xD;
      but the numbers vary around the globe. A study from Necker Hospital for Sick Children in&#xD;
      Paris8 revealed a prevalence of 5 % in children with a mean age of age 11.9 y o (2.5 to 22 y&#xD;
      o). It also revealed that M. abscessus was the prevailing organism among the pediatric&#xD;
      population, rather than MAC, the commonest organism in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Olivier studies 5 confirmed that the prevalence of NTM is particularly high in the&#xD;
      southeastern USA, as previously suggested by a study from the adult CF center of the&#xD;
      University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 3 that revealed a prevalence of 19.5%. It is&#xD;
      therefore of particular interest that a recent pediatric study from the same medical center 9&#xD;
      retrospectively reviewed CF patients younger than 12 years old and found 6.1% overall&#xD;
      prevalence of NTM in BALs over 3 years, and 3.9 % using medical record examination over a 10-&#xD;
      year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information that is collected will help to deepen the understanding of the nature of the&#xD;
      microbiology of our CF pediatric population, and to what extent NTM play a role in the&#xD;
      colonization and possible disease causation in this region of the country. The investigators&#xD;
      think this role is underestimated. Once the information becomes available, The investigators&#xD;
      will be able to make better plans of dealing with this infection.&#xD;
