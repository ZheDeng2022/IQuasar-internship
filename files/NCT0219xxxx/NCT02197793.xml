  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a community mobilization intervention&#xD;
      on the uptake of HIV testing, linkage to and retention in HIV care using a community, cluster&#xD;
      randomized trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eight of 16 intervention naïve communities in the Agincourt HDSS will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive the CM intervention to activate TasP based on the investigators CM conceptual&#xD;
      framework. The 16 villages will be randomized based on the &quot;restricted randomization&quot;&#xD;
      approach, a stratification method to ensure overall balance between intervention and control&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention activities will map onto the investigators six mobilization domains identified&#xD;
      in the investigators preliminary work as key components for communities to mobilize for&#xD;
      change around HIV prevention. These activities will support communities to: 1) identify a&#xD;
      shared concern around testing, linkage and retention in care; 2) enable communities to&#xD;
      develop critical consciousness around TasP; 3) facilitate identification and development of&#xD;
      structures and networks to disseminate information and activities around TasP; 4) identify&#xD;
      and engage community leadership around TasP; 5) take collection action to support TasP; and&#xD;
      6) build community cohesion to address the HIV epidemic and support access to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the impact of the intervention using a linked data set&#xD;
      including electronic clinic records and the HDSS census data, which will allow us to&#xD;
      determine whether people in the intervention communities test at higher proportions than&#xD;
      those in control communities, whether individuals who test positive in the intervention&#xD;
      communities are more likely to receive CD4 testing and initiate treatment within 3 months&#xD;
      than the control communities, and whether those who are eligible and not eligible for&#xD;
      treatment are retained in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will implement a representative cross-sectional survey in all 16 villages&#xD;
      prior to and following the intervention in order to examine changes in CM domains across&#xD;
      villages and the mechanisms through which the intervention affects HIV testing, linkage and&#xD;
      retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, intervention progress and dosage will be carefully monitored through a tracking&#xD;
      system to document all workshops and activities that are carried out in each village.&#xD;
