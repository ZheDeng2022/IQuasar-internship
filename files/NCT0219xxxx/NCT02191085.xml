      Access to medical care for patients with breathing disorders during sleep is a major problem&#xD;
      for Canadians. Recently, there has been increasing interest in how health care providers who&#xD;
      are not physicians can help to improve access to medical care for these patients, but it is&#xD;
      unclear whether patients with severe sleep-disordered breathing who receive care from these&#xD;
      non-physician providers have the same response to treatment as patients who receive care from&#xD;
      physicians. Since these severe have a high risk of developing cardiac and respiratory&#xD;
      complications and of being hospitalized, an initiative to improve access such as the use of&#xD;
      non-physician providers could be of great benefit to individual patients and the health care&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine whether patients with severe breathing disorders during sleep have the same&#xD;
           response to treatment when cared for by non-physician health care providers (respiratory&#xD;
           therapists) as they do when cared for by physicians;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the effects of non-physician health care provider treatment to patient&#xD;
           access;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to determine health care utilization and related costs associated with non-physician&#xD;
           health care provider treatment.&#xD;

      The difficulty in providing timely access to sleep specialists is widespread. These delays&#xD;
      are particularly important for patients with severe SDB due to the increased risk of adverse&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and potential associated healthcare costs. The lack of timely access has&#xD;
      sparked an interest in the use of alternate care providers (ACPs) to manage patients with&#xD;
      SDB. Our group and others have demonstrated that ACPs are an effective and efficient&#xD;
      substitute for physicians for patients with uncomplicated SDB. However, the role of ACPs in&#xD;
      the management of patients with severe SDB remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prompted by wait times that far exceed current Canadian guidelines, we have recently&#xD;
      implemented an ACP-led &quot;Fast Track&quot; clinic for patients who are referred to the Foothills&#xD;
      Medical Centre (FMC) Sleep Centre with suspected severe SDB. In this clinic, patients with&#xD;
      suspected severe SDB are assessed by a sleep-trained registered respiratory therapist&#xD;
      functioning as an ACP. Decisions regarding further sleep testing and treatment are made by&#xD;
      the patient and ACP, under the guidance of a sleep physician. This model of care differs from&#xD;
      a physician-led model that is used at the FMC Sleep Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate this novel care delivery model, we have designed a randomized trial comparing&#xD;
      outcomes for patients in the &quot;Fast Track&quot; clinic to those who undergo conventional,&#xD;
      physician-led care. The specific goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to compare the clinical effectiveness of an ACP-led clinic for patients with suspected&#xD;
           severe SDB to physician-led management;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine whether cycle times from referral to diagnosis and treatment for patients&#xD;
           referred with suspected severe SDB can be reduced by an ACP-led clinic;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to determine the impact of an ACP-led clinic on the demand for sleep physicians, ACPs&#xD;
           and diagnostic testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to compare the cost-effectiveness of these models of care using data on healthcare&#xD;
           utilization, costs, and patient reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the &quot;Standard Management&quot; arm will be assessed by a sleep respirologist and&#xD;
      follow a management plan that is determined by the sleep physician and patient. This plan may&#xD;
      involve polysomnography or the initiation of PAP therapy. If further testing is ordered,&#xD;
      follow-up may occur with the physician or with an ACP, at the physician's discretion. For&#xD;
      patients initiating PAP therapy, the decision to delegate follow-up to an ACP will be left up&#xD;
      to the physician, as the intent of this study is to observe real-world practice and not to&#xD;
      change the management of individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the &quot;Fast Track&quot; arm, an ACP will perform the initial assessment and will determine the&#xD;
      management plan with the patient. To ensure patient safety, the management plan will be&#xD;
      discussed with a sleep respirologist, who will be designated as the patient's primary sleep&#xD;
      physician. This sleep physician will be available at the FMC Sleep Centre during the &quot;Fast&#xD;
      Track&quot; clinic to assist with the assessment of patients who appear unwell (e.g. severe&#xD;
      hypoxemia, decompensated cardiorespiratory failure, etc.). As in the &quot;Standard Management&quot;&#xD;
      arm, follow-up visits to review test results, discuss and initiate treatment, or to assess&#xD;
      treatment response may occur with the ACP who performed the initial assessment or may be&#xD;
      delegated to any other ACP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As is usual procedure at the FMC Sleep Centre, ambulatory sleep test requisitions will be&#xD;
      completed by ACPs or physicians, whereas all polysomnogram requisitions will be completed by&#xD;
      the primary sleep physician to ensure adequate blinding of patient assignment. The research&#xD;
      associate will ensure that all tests are interpreted in advance of clinic visits. Patients&#xD;
      who are followed by ACPs in either arm can be referred to the primary sleep physician for&#xD;
      assessment of non-respiratory sleep disorders, or for persistent symptoms such as daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness.&#xD;
