      The primary hypothesis the investigators will test is that that improving asthma guideline&#xD;
      implementation and providing patients with a unified asthma management plan using a&#xD;
      multi-component and multilevel intervention will improve patient-centered asthma outcomes&#xD;
      compared to health plan case management, passive guideline dissemination and provider&#xD;
      education.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study will use a factorial randomized controlled design to assess the comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness of the following interventions among 8 community health centers and 550&#xD;
      patients with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health plan enhanced intervention plus traditional provider education: Health plans will&#xD;
           enhance case management support, monitor medication fills, and increase passive&#xD;
           guideline dissemination. Traditional provider education will consist of implementation&#xD;
           of the PACE asthma education program. Note that all participants and clinics will&#xD;
           receive this intervention. In effect, this will be the base active comparator arm of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Home visit intervention: Community health workers will provide in-home tailored asthma&#xD;
           support: assess asthma self-management knowledge and skills, conduct a home&#xD;
           environmental assessment focused on asthma triggers, and conduct follow-up visits to&#xD;
           support patient actions to improve asthma control based on unified asthma management&#xD;
           plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enhanced clinic intervention with system integration: Clinics will implement a&#xD;
           multi-component intervention that includes decision support, audit and feedback,&#xD;
           provider and staff education, team-based care, and training and feedback in implementing&#xD;
           office spirometry and allergy testing. EHR enhancements and clinic systems redesign will&#xD;
           support this work. The EHR will also provide a platform for sharing a common asthma&#xD;
           management plan and enhancing communications among care team members (clinicians, CHWs,&#xD;
           plan case managers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All four intervention groups will receive enhanced health plan intervention + provider&#xD;
      education. The four study arms will receive the following additional different interventions:&#xD;
      (a) usual clinic care; (b) a + home visit, (c) enhanced clinic care + system integration, and&#xD;
      (d) c + home visit.&#xD;
