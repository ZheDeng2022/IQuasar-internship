      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial proportion of children and teenagers with suspected inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
      (IBD) referred for endoscopy do not have the disease. The investigators designed a clinical&#xD;
      decision rule that included a calprotectin stool test to discern which patients require&#xD;
      further investigations. The accuracy of this diagnostic strategy is 88.5% with a low risk of&#xD;
      missing IBD cases. Although the number of negative endoscopies was reduced after introduction&#xD;
      of this strategy, still 22% of the referred children and teenagers underwent an unnecessary&#xD;
      invasive test. S100A12 (calgranulin C) is a cytoplasmic protein secreted exclusively by&#xD;
      activated neutrophils and this stool marker may be more IBD-specific than calprotectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether the specificity of S100A12 is superior to the specificity of&#xD;
      calprotectin without sacrificing sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of the calgranulin C stool test will improve the specificity of the&#xD;
      screening-strategy.&#xD;

      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective diagnostic accuracy study in several outpatient clinics for general paediatrics&#xD;
      and several tertiary care hospitals in the Netherlands and Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible for inclusion are consecutive children and teenagers between 6 and 18 years who&#xD;
      consult their pediatrician and have gastro-intestinal symptoms suggestive of IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be managed according to a calprotectin-based-referral strategy. Those with an&#xD;
      elevated calprotectin level without colon pathogens are considered to have a high probability&#xD;
      of IBD and may require referral for endoscopy (the preferred reference standard). Patients&#xD;
      with confirmed gastrointestinal infection are advised to have their stools retested. Patients&#xD;
      with normal calprotectin levels are considered to have a low probability of IBD and will&#xD;
      therefore have a low change to be subjected to endoscopy. In these patients with low&#xD;
      probablity of IBD an alternative reference standard may be performed, being clinical&#xD;
      follow-up for 6 months. The decision for endoscopy or clinical follow up is up to the&#xD;
      clinician's discretion, based on the combination of all symptoms, physical examination, blood&#xD;
      results, fecal markers and colon pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next to calprotectin, also S100A12 will be measured in all stool samples. We will perform a&#xD;
      post hoc scenario analysis to compare the test characteristics of both fecal markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the difference in specificity between FC and S100A12 among the&#xD;
      total number of non-IBD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We adjusted our previously formulated outcome measure, being the proportion of patients with&#xD;
      non-inflammatory conditions among the total number of patient subjected to endoscopy, for two&#xD;
      reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During an interim analysis in August 2016 the proportion of patients subjected to&#xD;
           endoscopy was lower as expected (34% instead 46%). To reach the required amount of&#xD;
           patients with the reference standard (endoscopy) we needed to extend the study for&#xD;
           several months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Triggered by a recently published paper by Naaktgeboren et al in the BMJ, we realized&#xD;
           that our initial design would lead to biased results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are the difference in sensitivity among the total number of patients with&#xD;
      IBD and the diagnostic accuracy characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive&#xD;
      predictive value, negative predictive value, area under the curve, best cut-off point) for&#xD;
      both markers individually. All diagnostic accuracy characteristics will be calculated with 1)&#xD;
      a pre-specified cut-off value based on literature, 2) the best cut-off point calculated with&#xD;
      the data from this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER/DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of our trial we defined a sample size calculation, based on the previously&#xD;
      described outcome measure including only patients with endoscopy. Based on a previous cohort&#xD;
      study we expected that 46% of the recruited patients would undergo endoscopy. Using a sample&#xD;
      size calculation based on independent samples calculated with a Fisher's exact test, we&#xD;
      calculated that with 154 patients subjected to endoscopy the study would have 80% power to&#xD;
      detect a 50% relative reduction of the primary outcome from 22% false positives with FC to&#xD;
      11% false positives with S100A12, at a one-sided alpha level of 0.05. The total number of&#xD;
      patients to be recruited for this diagnostic accuracy study was therefore calculated at 335.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the slipstream of the adjustment of the primary outcome measure, we adjusted our sample&#xD;
      size. We now use McNemar's test for paired samples to compare the proportion of concordant&#xD;
      and discordant results between FC and S100A12 in all patients with the disease or without the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the new sample size we used a specificity of FC of 0.70, based on recent&#xD;
      individual patient data meta-analysis of Degraeuwe and we expected S100A12 would lead to 50%&#xD;
      relative improvement. A sample size of 130 subjects achieves 80% power to detect a difference&#xD;
      of 0,15 between the two diagnostic tests whose specificities are 0,70 and 0,85. This&#xD;
      procedure uses a two-sided McNemar test with a significance level of 0,05. The prevalence of&#xD;
      non-IBD in the population is 0,64. The proportion of discordant pairs is 0,23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center in Groningen has granted&#xD;
      exemption from WMO-approval, as it involves the collection of data generated by routine&#xD;
      medical care. After measurement of calprotectin levels and testing for microbial gut&#xD;
      pathogens the residual material will be used for the measurement of calgranulin C levels.&#xD;
      When patients and their parents give permission, residual feces will be stored for a maximum&#xD;
      period of 15 years for future diagnostic research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIME SCHEDULE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total running time is 30 months, including 6 months to complete the follow up and 2 months&#xD;
      for analysis and reporting.&#xD;
