  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of an improved rapid diagnostic test using venous whole blood and&#xD;
      fingerstick whole blood. The clinical performance of Reveal G4 Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test will&#xD;
      be determined by comparing the results with patient infected status for HIV-1 (human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus type 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a single one-hour visit, at which time blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected and tested with the investigational device (Reveal G4) and FDA approved comparator&#xD;
      assays for detection of HIV-1 antibodies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a multi-center study to assess the performance characteristics of a&#xD;
      rapid in vitro diagnostic assay, the Reveal G4 Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test (Reveal G4).&#xD;
      Specifically, the objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      Reveal G4 in finger stick and venous whole blood, relative to FDA approved reference assays&#xD;
      for the detection of HIV-1 antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1500-2000 subjects in total will be enrolled in the study across all sites,&#xD;
      into three different study populations. Population 1 will be comprised of at least 500&#xD;
      subjects from a population at risk of infection with HIV. Population 2 will be comprised of&#xD;
      at least 500 subjects that are known HIV positive individuals. Population 3 will be comprised&#xD;
      of at least 500 subjects from a population at low risk of HIV infection. Reveal G4 will be&#xD;
      used to test fingerstick whole blood and venous whole blood samples from all study subjects.&#xD;
      For enrolled subjects in Populations 1 and 3, who are of unknown HIV antibody status, a&#xD;
      plasma sample prepared from the venous whole blood sample will also be tested with an&#xD;
      algorithm of FDA-approved assays for the detection of HIV-1 antibodies. For Population 2&#xD;
      subjects who are known HIV-positive individuals, results of previous HIV tests will be&#xD;
      obtained from the subjects' medical records. The sensitivity and specificity of Reveal G4&#xD;
      will be determined in fingerstick and venous whole blood relative to HIV-1 antibody status as&#xD;
      determined by an algorithm of FDA-approved assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will involve comparison of Reveal G4 results for anti-HIV-1 in each&#xD;
      sample matrix (fingerstick whole blood and venous whole blood) with the subject's HIV-1&#xD;
      antibody status as determined by FDA-approved assays. Based on the above, the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of Reveal G4 will be determined with corresponding two-sided 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals for both fingerstick and venous whole blood.&#xD;
