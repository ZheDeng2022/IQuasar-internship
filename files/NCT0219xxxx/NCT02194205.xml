&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients 40 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a smoking history of more than ten pack-years. A pack-year is&#xD;
             defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to perform technically satisfactory pulmonary function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to be trained in the proper use of a metered dose inhalator&#xD;
             (MDI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial&#xD;
             i.e. prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be on at least one regular aerosol bronchodilator for control of their&#xD;
             COPD symptoms and have symptoms of bronchospasm (wheeze or shortness of breath)&#xD;
             present OR Patients must be on at least two classes of prescribed bronchodilators on a&#xD;
             regular basis for control of their COPD symptoms for the three month period&#xD;
             immediately preceding the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant disease other than COPD will be excluded. A significant&#xD;
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either&#xD;

             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or&#xD;
             urinalysis. If the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion, the&#xD;
             patient is excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with a serum aspartate amino transferase (ASAT/SGOT) &gt; 80 IU/L, serum&#xD;
             alanine amino transferase (ALAT/SGPT) &gt; 80 IU/L, bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL or creatinine &gt;&#xD;
             2.0 mg/dL will be excluded regardless of the clinical condition. Repeat laboratory&#xD;
             evaluation will not be conducted in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a total bood eosinophil count &gt;= 600 mm**3. A repeat eosinophil&#xD;
             count will not be conducted in these patients&#xD;

             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients wth a&#xD;
             history of thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion&#xD;
             criterion No. 1&#xD;

             weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been treated with oral beta-adrenergics or long-acting&#xD;
             beta-adrenergics in the two weeks prior to the Screening Visit or during the baseline&#xD;
             period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had changes in their therapeutic plan within the last six weeks&#xD;
             prior to the Screening Visit or during the baseline period, excluding changes from&#xD;
             long acting or oral beta-adrenergics to short acting inhaled beta-adrenergics for&#xD;
             purposes of this trial&#xD;
