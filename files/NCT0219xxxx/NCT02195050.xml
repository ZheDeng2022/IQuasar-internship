      1. At target LDL-C levels, apoB100 concentrations will be higher than recommended levels in&#xD;
           the following populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Tertiary centre lipid clinic patients with raised TG treated with statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patients with type 2 diabetes treated with statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patients with Chronic Kidney disease (CKD) stages 4 and 5 treated with statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Despite achieving LDL-C and non-HDL-C targets, a significant number of statin-treated&#xD;
           patients have residual cardiovascular risk related to raised hsCRP. The relationship&#xD;
           between hsCRP and Lp-PLA2 (markers of inflammation) and LDL particle number measured by&#xD;
           apoB100 is stronger than that of measured and calculated LDL and non-HDL. In statin&#xD;
           treated patients there will be higher levels of hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 in patients achieving&#xD;
           LDL targets but not apo B targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. We hypothesise that non-diabetic patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia (fasting&#xD;
           serum triglyceride &gt;5.5 mmol/l) have evidence of greater nerve damage compared with&#xD;
           matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. LAL deficiency is underdiagnosed in patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia, low&#xD;
           HDL-C, hyperlipidaemias, non alcoholic fatty liver disease and idiopathic high liver&#xD;
           enzymes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fats are present in the body in the form of lipid particles containing cholesterol and&#xD;
      triglycerides. Lipid particles can deposit in blood vessels, forming atheromas, blocking&#xD;
      blood vessels and leading to heart attacks and strokes. These harmful particles are termed&#xD;
      'atherogenic' particles. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is the major atherogenic particle.&#xD;
      Each atherogenic particle has a protein associated with it called apolipoprotein B (apoB).&#xD;
      Cholesterol, triglycerides, and apoB levels can be measured in the laboratory. In this study&#xD;
      we focus on patients with raised levels of triglycerides (hypertriglyceridaemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit patients with hypertriglyceridaemia to look at (1) therapeutic targets, (2)&#xD;
      genetic causes, and (3) associated neuropathy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Therapeutic target arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
           LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) is the primary target for lipid-lowering drugs. A drug (commonly&#xD;
           a statin) is effective when it lowers LDL-C. Patients with diabetes, chronic kidney&#xD;
           disease and hypertriglyceridaemia on statins may have normal levels of LDL-C; but&#xD;
           because the size of LDL particles in these patients is smaller, they may in fact have&#xD;
           raised levels of apoB and therefore remain at cardiovascular risk. Thus, measurement of&#xD;
           apoB may be a better target for treatment because it measures 'atherogenic' particle&#xD;
           numbers. Since atheromatous disease is an inflammatory disease, we will also investigate&#xD;
           if residual risk may be correlated with inflammatory markers, such as hsCRP and Lp-PLA2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypertriglyceridaemia and nerve function arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
           We aim to demonstrate that severe hypertriglyceridaemia is associated with more&#xD;
           significant nerve damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Genetic screening arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several genetic mutations have been identified to cause hypertriglyceridaemia. Deficiency of&#xD;
      the enzyme lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) results in Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease (CESD)&#xD;
      and hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and abnormal lipid deposition in organs. We&#xD;
      wish to identify genetic mutations associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia and the&#xD;
      prevalence of LAL deficiency in patients attending our tertiary referral centre.&#xD;
