      Aim of this trial is to investigate feasibility of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI)&#xD;
      in patients with long term implanted coradial leads upgraded to an MRI conditional pacemaker&#xD;
      system, to assess MR-image quality and to prove the safety of MRI in this specific population&#xD;
      in the short term as well as during long term follow-up.&#xD;

      The trial is designed&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the cardiac MRI related adverse event-free rate in patients with long&#xD;
           term implanted coradial pacing leads (Fineline-II) after implantable pulse generator&#xD;
           (IPG) exchange to a MRI conditional system (short term and long term): Safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the technical performance of MRI conditional pacemaker systems with long term&#xD;
           implanted coradial pacing leads, for cardiac MRI (short term and long term):&#xD;
           Effectiveness pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the image quality (IQ) and the diagnostic value (DV) of the cardiac MRI scans&#xD;
           in patients with implanted MRI conditional systems: Effectiveness cardiac MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2) To evaluate the clinical incidence of MRI procedures in the population of long term&#xD;
           implanted pacemaker patients (long term-follow up)&#xD;
