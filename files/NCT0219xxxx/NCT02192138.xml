      Research project objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project includes eight research hypotheses and eight corresponding study objectives. The&#xD;
      most relevant objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of lung function and gas exchange parameters in relation to the removed pleural&#xD;
           fluid volume and intrapleural pressure changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of changes in lung and chest wall compliance and related changes in work of&#xD;
           breathing during therapeutic thoracentesis and pleural fluid withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of the relationship between intrapleural pressure changes and cardiac function&#xD;
           assessed by echocardiography and alterations in serum natriuretic peptide A and B&#xD;
           concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparative analysis of the reliability of the volume-pressure curve slope prediction&#xD;
           based on different variables measured before thoracentesis and real measurements of&#xD;
           ventilation and intrapleural pressure during thoracentesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. Research methodology The study will be performed in 60 patients with pleural effusion&#xD;
           planned for therapeutic thoracentesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies before thoracentesis: body plethysmography, spirometry, lung diffusion capacity&#xD;
      (DLCO), arterial blood gases, 6 minute walk test, echocardiography, serum natriuretic peptide&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation during thoracentesis: continuous measurement of tidal breathing and respiratory&#xD;
      rate, measurement of removed pleural fluid volume and intrapleural pressure, transcutaneous&#xD;
      measurement of PO2 and PCO2. Pleural catheter will be retained for the next 48hours to enable&#xD;
      fluid drainage and intrapleural pressure measurement after completion of thoracentesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring during 48-hrs after thoracentesis: pre-thoracentesis measurements will be repeated&#xD;
      in specific time points and compared in two subgroups (active physiotherapy to improve lung&#xD;
      re-expansion and passive lung re-expansion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrapleural pressure will be measured 24 and 48 hours after thoracentesis. Then, the&#xD;
      catheter will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis.Signal analysis and visual multidimensional analysis performed with the use of own&#xD;
      computer programs will be the first step of the analysis. The identified relationships&#xD;
      between the analyzed parameters should allow to form physiological, medical, and statistical&#xD;
      hypotheses, as well to verify the analysis of previously obtained data .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected impact of the research project The study results will allow to define lung function,&#xD;
      blood gases and cardiovascular function in relation to changes in intrapleural pressure. Some&#xD;
      of these correlations had not been previously investigated. Our results may influence&#xD;
      management standards in patients who require therapeutic thoracentesis.&#xD;
