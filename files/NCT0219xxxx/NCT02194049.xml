    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of PI3K inhibitor BKM120 when&#xD;
      given together with cisplatin and etoposide in treating patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      or small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and etoposide, work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing , or by stopping them from spreading. PI3K inhibitor BKM120 may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving PI3K&#xD;
      inhibitor BKM120 with cisplatin and etoposide may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of combining BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor BKM120) with&#xD;
      cisplatin and etoposide in advanced solid tumors, with emphasis on small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (SCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the MTD (maximally tolerated dose) of BKM120 in combination with&#xD;
      cisplatin/etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and toxicity profile associated with&#xD;
      BKM120 in combination with cisplatin/etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the preliminary efficacy of BKM120 in combination with cisplatin/etoposide&#xD;
      in an expanded cohort of patients with SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of BKM120 in this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To collect blood samples for future exploratory biomarker analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BKM120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive PI3K Inhibitor BKM120 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, cisplatin&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.&#xD;
