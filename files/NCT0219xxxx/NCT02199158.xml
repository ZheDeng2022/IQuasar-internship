      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate short-term angle opening after argon peripheral iridoplasty using AS-OCT and to&#xD;
      report its complications at 1-week and 1-month follow up in patients that did not achieve a&#xD;
      satisfactory clinical angle opening despite patent laser peripheral iridotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, Interventional case series&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with an occludable angle in more than two quadrants in dark room indentation&#xD;
      gonioscopy and patent iridotomies of at least 2 weeks, with assessment of persistent angle&#xD;
      closure aetiology by ultrabiomicroscopy and A-scan ultrasound are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo complete examination and AS-OCT before ALPI, one week and one month&#xD;
      after it. We analyzed the images in a masked manner and took the angle measurements (AOD500,&#xD;
      AOD 750, TISA500, TISA750, ARA500, ARA 750, Lens vault) at 0° and 180° as the main outcome&#xD;
      measure to determine effectiveness.&#xD;

      Background Argon laser peripheral iridoplasty (ALPI) (Figure 1) is an iris-remodeling&#xD;
      procedure that intends to widen the iridocorneal angle through redistribution of peripheral&#xD;
      iris tension forces close to the trabeculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALPI is effective in patients with plateau iris syndrome and acute angle closure glaucoma but&#xD;
      there is less published about its effectiveness in secondary angle closure. Therefore, we are&#xD;
      going to evaluate this procedure in those patients that did not achieve a satisfactory&#xD;
      clinical angle opening despite patent laser peripheral iridotomy, as long as there was no&#xD;
      contraindication for a new laser procedure and provided that cataract surgery is not viable,&#xD;
      as in clear lens or patients not willing to undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate its effectiveness, we will use a non-invasive non-contact method through anterior&#xD;
      segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), which transmits and receives light in an&#xD;
      ultrasound-like manner to obtain anterior segment imaging that helps to evaluate the angle&#xD;
      more objectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose To evaluate short-term angle opening after argon peripheral iridoplasty using AS-OCT&#xD;
      and to report its complications at 1-week and 1-month follow up in patients with persistent&#xD;
      angle closure despite patent iridotomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Prospective, interventional case series Patients with an occludable angle in&#xD;
      more than two quadrants in dark room dynamic gonioscopy and patent iridotomies of at least 2&#xD;
      weeks were included. A supplemental diagnosis regarding the etiology of persistent angle&#xD;
      closure by ultrabiomicroscopy and A-scan ultrasound will be obtained. Patients who presented&#xD;
      with these criteria to the angle closure clinic at the glaucoma service of our institute&#xD;
      (Instituto de Oftalmologia Fundacion Conde de Valenciana IAP, Mexico City) between July and&#xD;
      November 2012 were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with synechiae of more than one quadrant, advanced glaucomatous damage, prompt&#xD;
      cataract surgery plans and those who did not wish to participate were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, patients underwent biomicroscopy, gonioscopy, visual&#xD;
      acuity, intraocular pressure and AS-OCT before ALPI, one week and one month after it. The&#xD;
      AS-OCT Visante (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin) took an image of the vertical and horizontal&#xD;
      meridians at the same room illumination of 14 lux measured with a luxometer mobile&#xD;
      application (Apple Inc., Application Manufactory available at the AppStore by June 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images were analyzed in a masked manner marking scleral spurs and angle recess at 0° and 180°&#xD;
      of the horizontal image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALPI was applied with a VISULAS diode laser of 532 nm (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) by the&#xD;
      same ophthalmologist (JML). Twenty to 40 spots of 400 mW power with 500 microns of size and&#xD;
      duration of 500 ms were applied. Power was modified arbitrarily until an effective iris&#xD;
      contraction was obtained. It was considered an effective contraction as that which causes a&#xD;
      concentric movement around the laser spot, with minimal iris pigmentation and immediate angle&#xD;
      opening observed through the lens mirrors using a Goldmann lens. Power was lowered if there&#xD;
      was any bursting sound perceived, pigment dispersion, air bubbles or considerable pain.&#xD;
      Pilocarpine was not applied before the procedure in all cases because some eyes had angle&#xD;
      closure secondary to ciliary block and we considered it could worsen the closure in many&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical prednisolone acetate was applied every 4 hours for 1 week and brimonidine tartrate&#xD;
      every 12 hours for 1 week .&#xD;
