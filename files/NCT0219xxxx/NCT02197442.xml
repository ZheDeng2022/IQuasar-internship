    <textblock>
      The study was an open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, four-period, two sequence,&#xD;
      single oral dose, crossover, fully replicate bioequivalence study of two formulations of&#xD;
      Valsartan 320 mg under fasting conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tablet in healthy, adult human subjects under fasting condition, with a screening period of&#xD;
      28 days prior to dose administration in Period-I. In each study period, twenty-four (24)&#xD;
      blood samples, including two (02) predose blood samples, each of 02 mL were collected from&#xD;
      each subject except for the discontinued / withdrawn subjects to analyze the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile of the test as well as the reference product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the drug concentration vs. time profile&#xD;
      by non-compartmental model using WinNonlin Professional Software-Version 5.3 (Pharsight&#xD;
      Corporation, USA) for Valsartan. Statistical comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters of&#xD;
      the two formulations was carried out using PROC MIXED of SAS® Version 9.3 (SAS Institute&#xD;
      Inc., USA) to assess the bioequivalence of both the formulations.&#xD;
