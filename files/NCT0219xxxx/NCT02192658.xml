  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the recent World Report on Disability, around 15% of the world population lives&#xD;
      with a disability and 80% of people with disabilities (PWD) live in developing countries.&#xD;
      More and more evidence show that PWD are more likely to be poor, vulnerable to physical and&#xD;
      sexual violence, and to have less access to education. Therefore, PWD are likely to have an&#xD;
      increased risk for HIV infection, potentially being a key population in regard to this&#xD;
      epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vulnerability of PWD was recognized in 2007 by the United Nations Convention on the&#xD;
      Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However, data on the extent how PWD are affected by HIV&#xD;
      is still very limited. As a result, PWD are usually overlooked by National AIDS Control&#xD;
      Programmes and few projects specifically targeting them have been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognizing the need for appropriate and reliable data to help protect the rights of PWD and&#xD;
      achieve a better inclusion of disability in National AIDS Control Programmes, the Institute&#xD;
      of Research for Development (IRD), the Institut de Formation et Recherche Demographique&#xD;
      (IFORD) and Handicap International (HI) propose this study that aims to provide quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative data on the vulnerability of PWD to HIV infection in Cameroon and Burkina&#xD;
      Faso, in order to define if this vulnerable population is also a Key Population in relation&#xD;
      to the HIV epidemic. This study adopts a multidisciplinary approach (quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative methods). Quantitative data are collected only in Cameroon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the quantitative study is described here.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of this study is to provide information on the vulnerability of PWD to&#xD;
      HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the quantitative component of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of the HIV burden among PWD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the prevalence of HIV in PWD comprehensively and for each of the following&#xD;
           disabilities 1) hearing 2) visual 3) mobility 4) cognitive (intellectual)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the HIV prevalence between PWD and non-disabled matched controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the association between PWD's social network characteristics and the risk for&#xD;
           HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the knowledge, behaviour and practice toward HIV infection and sexual and&#xD;
      reproductive health (including contraception) overall and for each of the impairment groups&#xD;
      mentioned above:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe and analyze the knowledge, attitude and behaviours related to HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the knowledge, attitude and behaviours between PWD and non-disabled matched&#xD;
           controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe sexual and reproductive activities of PWD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe and analyze the access and actual use of family planning methods in PWD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to HIV prevention and health careglobally and for each of the impairment groups&#xD;
      mentioned above:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe and analyze the determinants of and barriers to access to prevention and&#xD;
           testing services&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe and analyze the determinants of and barriers to access to care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the access to services between PWD and non-disabled matched controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives related to disability:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the population of PWD in Yaoundé&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe and analyze the characteristics of the social networks of PWD&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross sectionnal study assessing HIV prevalence, HIV risk factors and sexual &amp;&#xD;
      reproductive health of PWD compared to a control group of Non-Disabled People. PWD are&#xD;
      sampled from the general population using a two-step sampling method. Eligible subjects are&#xD;
      proposed an HIV test and to respond to a questionnaire on their Knowledge, Attitudes and&#xD;
      Practices (KAP) in relation to HIV and SRH, on their social network and on their access to&#xD;
      prevention and care services. The life-grid interview method is used to collect data on&#xD;
      subject's history of social participation, employment, resources, sexual partnership and&#xD;
      reproductive life. Controls are selected from the PWD's neighborhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      850 disabled subjects and 850 non-disabled controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study location: Yaounde, Cameroon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated planning or Study timetable :&#xD;

      Study start date: April 2014 (exploratory work) Total trial/study duration: 24 months&#xD;
