  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies light sedation compared with intubated general&#xD;
      anesthesia (a loss of feeling and a complete loss of awareness that feels like a very deep&#xD;
      sleep) in reducing complications and length of hospital stay in patients with brain cancer&#xD;
      undergoing craniotomy. Craniotomy is an operation in which a piece of the skull is removed so&#xD;
      doctors can remove a brain tumor or abnormal brain tissue. Light sedation allows patients to&#xD;
      remain awake during their surgery, while intubated general anesthesia puts patients to sleep.&#xD;
      Surgery complication rates may be reduced if intubated general anesthesia is avoided.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients not receiving intubated general anesthesia tend to recover more&#xD;
      quickly after surgery. It is not yet known whether light sedation is better at reducing&#xD;
      complications and length of hospital stay compared to intubated general anesthesia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the overall hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients undergoing craniotomy&#xD;
      with light sedation vs. general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare resource utilization between the two groups. II. To assess the frequency of&#xD;
      post-operative delirium. III. To measure patient perceptions. IV. To track patient&#xD;
      complications during hospital stay - nausea/vomiting, pain, hematology/lab stability,&#xD;
      hemodynamic stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To track re-admission and extended hospital stay rates. VI. To compare cost of both&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive light sedation (awake) and undergo craniotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive intubated general anesthesia and undergo craniotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1month and 1 year.&#xD;

    <measure>Assess the frequency of post-operative delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Post-operative delirium will be assessed using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS); a tool developed to measure the severity of delirium and reflects the main diagnostic criteria and symptoms of delirium. The MDAS is structured as a ten-item, four-point clinician-rated scale (possible range, 0-30) designed to quantify the severity of delirium in medically ill patients. A score of 13 has been recommended by the original authors as a cutoff for establishing the diagnosis of delirium.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure patient perceptions</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured by asking patients about their overall positive experiences, if they understood rationale behind non-intubated craniotomy; necessary to improve outcomes and minimize complications; self-protection/preservation, if they appreciated receiving information before surgery to help them make informed decisions, and their trust in the surgeon via survey to be conducted at the conclusion of the inpatient stay, before hospital discharge</description>

    <description>If patients experience excessive preoperative anxiety they will receive light sedation of midazolam 1 mg IV.In our standard practice, it is very rare that patients receive anxiolytic premedication for craniotomies, so it is unlikely that many will require midazolam. Two IVs will be placed, one for infusion of meds and one for possible resuscitation.</description>
