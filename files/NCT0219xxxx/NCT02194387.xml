  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies different types of energy balance interventions to see how&#xD;
      well they work in increasing the physical activity levels of breast cancer gene-positive&#xD;
      patients, Lynch syndrome-positive patients, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) survivors or&#xD;
      family members of cancer survivors who are at high risk for cancer. Increasing exercise and&#xD;
      eating healthy foods may help reduce the risk of cancer. Studying how well different types of&#xD;
      interventions work in motivating cancer survivors or high-risk family members to increase&#xD;
      exercise and healthy food choices may help doctors plan the most effective motivational&#xD;
      program for cancer prevention.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the feasibility of using the multi-phase optimization strategy (MOST) approach&#xD;
      to optimize energy balance (EB) interventions in a sample of MD Anderson employees. (Pilot I)&#xD;
      II. To explore the feasibility of using the MOST approach to optimize energy balance&#xD;
      interventions in a sample of BRCA (BReast CAncer)-positive and Lynch syndrome positive&#xD;
      individuals and their family members. (Pilot II) III. To explore the feasibility of using the&#xD;
      MOST approach to optimize energy balance interventions in a sample of CLL (chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia) patients. (Pilot III)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To develop preliminary estimates of effect size and outcome variability for use in&#xD;
      planning future studies. (Pilot I) II. To develop preliminary estimates of effect size and&#xD;
      outcome variability for use in planning future studies. (Pilot II) III. To develop&#xD;
      preliminary estimates of effect size and outcome variability for use in planning future&#xD;
      studies. (Pilot III)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine relationship between individual-level (e.g., distress) and family-level (e.g.,&#xD;
      shared mutation status) variables that are specific to high-risk families and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of energy balance interventions. (Pilot II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 condition in each component for a total of 16 groups&#xD;
      using a randomized factorial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TELEPHONE COACHING VS EMAIL COACHING: Participants receive telephone coaching once per week&#xD;
      for 16 weeks or 1 email per week for 16 weeks (with follow-up responses if the participant&#xD;
      responds) from a coach trained in motivational interviewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEXT MESSAGES: Participants receive daily text messages promoting adherence to diet and&#xD;
      exercise recommendations daily 1-3 times per day or no text messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOCIAL NETWORKING: Participants are invited to an online forum for study participants&#xD;
      available for 16 weeks or do not receive an invitation for social networking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELF-MONITORING: Participants are asked to record their dietary intake 4-7 days per week or 1&#xD;
      day per week on a website or smartphone application (app).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4 months.&#xD;
