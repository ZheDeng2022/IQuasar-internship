    <textblock>
      A ten week, blinded trial of vitamin D vs. placebo in 80 patients with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder who have low blood levels of vitamin D and elevated blood levels of&#xD;
      the amino acid proline. The aims of the study are to evaluate an anticipated clinical&#xD;
      response to vitamin D supplementation including negative symptoms and cognitive deficits,&#xD;
      evaluate safety of vitamin D supplementation for schizophrenia patients and evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship of changes in plasma proline levels and efficacy outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (vitD) insufficiency is associated with cognitive decline and has&#xD;
      long-been considered important in schizophrenia susceptibility. VitD supplementation has been&#xD;
      suggested for those at-risk, and recent studies have demonstrated that vitD insufficiency&#xD;
      extends into both adolescent and adult schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism by which vitD deficits confers risk is unknown. However, vitD is a&#xD;
      transcriptional regulator, and the investigators recently found that vitD significantly&#xD;
      up-regulates PRODH gene expression. This is important because the highest known genetic risk&#xD;
      of schizophrenia is conferred by hemizygous microdeletion of chromosome 22q11, to which PRODH&#xD;
      maps. Furthermore, PRODH encodes proline oxidase, which catalyzes proline catabolism. Proline&#xD;
      is a neuromodulator at glutamatergic synapses, and peripheral hyperprolinemia has been&#xD;
      associated with learning and memory deficits and neurotransmitter dysregulation in animal&#xD;
      models, and in humans, with decreased intelligence quotient (IQ), cognitive impairment, and&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder. The investigators recently found that &gt;25% of schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients were hyperprolinemic and hypothesized a causal relationship between vitD, proline&#xD;
      elevation, and schizophrenia, such that vitD insufficiency causes decreased PRODH expression&#xD;
      and hyperprolinemia. Measuring fasting plasma 25hydroxyvitD and proline in 64 patients and 90&#xD;
      controls, the investigators found that vitD insufficiency (&lt;30ng/ml) was significantly&#xD;
      associated with schizophrenia (OR:2.1, p=0.044), vitD levels were negatively correlated with&#xD;
      proline (p=0.01), and vitD insufficient subjects had three times greater odds of&#xD;
      hyperprolinemia (p=0.046). Moreover, they demonstrated that hyperprolinemia explains &gt;37% of&#xD;
      the association between vitD insufficiency and schizophrenia, signifying that vitD&#xD;
      insufficiency increases schizophrenia risk, at least in part by elevating proline. These&#xD;
      findings advocate that targeting schizophrenia-associated hyperprolinemia by alleviating vitD&#xD;
      insufficiency, may improve symptoms including neurocognitive deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1) To Evaluate a clinical response to vitamin D3 (vitD3) treatment, targeting patients&#xD;
      with both vitD insufficiency and hyperprolinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2) To Evaluate the relationship between fasting plasma proline change, PRODH expression,&#xD;
      and symptoms, for development of an efficacy biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims will be accomplished via a ten week, double-blind, placebo controlled trial, in&#xD;
      which schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder subjects who are both vitD insufficient and&#xD;
      hyperprolinemic, will be randomized to vitD3 (4,000 international units (IU)/day n=40) or&#xD;
      placebo (n=40) as an adjunct to their antipsychotics.&#xD;
