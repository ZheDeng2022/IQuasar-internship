      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel PET tracer ([11C]AS2471907), and to use&#xD;
      [11C]AS2471907 to assess the level and time-course of enzyme occupancy in the human brain&#xD;
      prior to and following single oral dose administration of ASP3662.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study where Part 1 will assess the test/retest variability of the ligand&#xD;
      ([11C]AS2471907). Part 2 will assess the level and time-course of enzyme occupancy following&#xD;
      ASP3662 dosing. Subjects will be confined to the clinic for up to 2 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has an allergy to topical anesthetics, such as, lidocaine (if used for&#xD;
