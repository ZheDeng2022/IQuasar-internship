  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will assess the effects of bioactive peptide rich wheat products on blood&#xD;
      pressure and estimated cardiovascular disease risk. This will be a pilot, explorative,&#xD;
      cross-over, randomized double-blind 2 groups x 2-arms controlled, clinical trial. The&#xD;
      intervention will be based on commercially-packaged pasta, which will appear and taste the&#xD;
      same; (i) low dose bioactive peptides vs. (ii) high dose bioactive peptides. Inclusion&#xD;
      Criteria will be: Male and female non-diabetic adult volunteers at increased estimated CV&#xD;
      risk (ESC/EAS SCORE) with SBP 130-139 mmHg and/or DBP 85-90 mmHg); Age included between 40&#xD;
      and 70 years old; Primary prevention for CVD but otherwise in good general health and have&#xD;
      had no major illness in the previous 6-months; Volunteer providing their signed and dated&#xD;
      informed consent form. Exclusion Criteria will be: Severe medical illness/chronic&#xD;
      disease/gastrointestinal pathology (e.g. coeliac disease); Secondary prevention for CVD;&#xD;
      Treatment with drugs potentially affecting BP (including antihypertensive drugs) or other&#xD;
      related CV risk factors; Consumption of nutraceuticals, botanical extracts or other vitamin&#xD;
      supplements; Volunteer diagnosed as being hypertensive A total of 60 participants will be&#xD;
      recruited and following adherence to a standardized diet for a 4-week period, will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to complete one of 2 treatment sequences by consuming a prescribed quantity&#xD;
      of pasta products for a 4-week period followed by a 4-week washout before random assignment&#xD;
      to the 2nd treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Outcome will be the modification of office blood pressure (assessed by systolic&#xD;
      and diastolic BP, pulse and mean pressure (mean of 3 standing &amp; sitting measures) and 24-hour&#xD;
      blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional outcomes include: Anthropometric parameters (Weight, WC, HC, WC/HC, ICO, BMI),&#xD;
      Glucose and Lipid profile (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, non-HDL cholesterol, risk ratios), Estimated&#xD;
      CVD risk changes (EAS/ESC SCORE Charts), Measures of vascular health (FMD, PWA, PWV, Aix),&#xD;
      Liver and renal functionality biomarkers, 24-h urine collection at baseline of treatment&#xD;
      phase 1 and endpoint of the final phase will be analysed to account for potential confounding&#xD;
      of urinary sodium excretion (intake) As required by the GCPs and GLPs, all the SOPs have&#xD;
      already been established and all the personnel to be involved in the study is continuously&#xD;
      trained in trials with similar outcomes&#xD;

    <description>Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) will be performed using a non-invasive automatic monitor (Space Labs, model 90207). For ABPM, patients will be instructed to act and work as normal between 6:00 AM and 10:00 PM and rest or sleep between 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM. Readings were obtained automatically at 15-min intervals throughout a 24-h study period. Separate averages will be obtained for the 24-h, daytime (6:00 AM-10:00 PM) and night-time (10:00 PM-6:00 AM) values. The accuracy of the automatic blood pressure readings will be checked against manual readings taken using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer, twice for each ABPM. Blood pressure were was measured with the patient sitting, before the beginning of the ABPM, and after a 5-min rest period. The accuracy test will be repeated after the end of each 24-h ABPM.</description>
