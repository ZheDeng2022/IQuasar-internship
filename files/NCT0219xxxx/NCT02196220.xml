  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mucopolysaccharidosis are lysosomal storage disorders such as Hunter, Hurler, and Sanfilippo&#xD;
      syndromes. These patients have a genetic enzyme deficiency that results in the inability to&#xD;
      degrade glycosaminoglycans. The glycosaminoglycans accumulate in lysosomes causing cell&#xD;
      enlargement and subsequent dysfunction. The accumulation occurs in all tissues including&#xD;
      cartilage, joint capsule, and tendons and can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger digits,&#xD;
      and various other orthopaedic manifestations [Van Heest, White]. These children often suffer&#xD;
      from severe cognitive impairment and are often unable to communicate pain or numbness. Carpal&#xD;
      tunnel syndrome is almost always present, but may not become apparent until symptoms are&#xD;
      severe and loss of function has occurred. The current gold standard for diagnosis consists of&#xD;
      electromyographic (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies under sedation or general&#xD;
      anesthetic [Khanna].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The investigators plan to correlate EMG findings and median nerve&#xD;
      cross-sectional area in children with mucopolysaccharidosis. The investigators hypothesis is&#xD;
      that ultrasonography of the carpal tunnel in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis will prove&#xD;
      to be an effective, reliable, and safe method to evaluate the median nerve, thus avoiding the&#xD;
      need for EMG studies and anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: The investigators want to determine the cross-sectional area of the&#xD;
      median nerve using ultrasonography in a cohort of healthy children, ages 3-12. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to evaluate a cohort of healthy children to determine a normal&#xD;
      cross-sectional area of the median nerve.&#xD;
