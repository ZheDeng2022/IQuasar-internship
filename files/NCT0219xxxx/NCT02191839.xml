      3 Background The use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during cardiac surgery elicits&#xD;
      generalized non-specific systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and subsequent&#xD;
      activation of the cytokine, complement, and coagulation-fibrinolytic cascades (1). In&#xD;
      approximately 11% of the patients SIRS may deteriorate to severe multi-organ failure (MOF)&#xD;
      resulting in mortality rate of 40-98%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory modulation by intraoperative administration of anti-inflammatory substances has&#xD;
      been advocated to attenuate the effects of SIRS. Attempts have subsequently focused on&#xD;
      aprotinin which inhibits proteases that are key mediators in the complement, coagulation, and&#xD;
      fibrinolytic system. Related anti-inflammatory properties of aprotinin include the inhibition&#xD;
      of platelets, neutrophils and kallikrein activation. Reduction in blood loss and reduced need&#xD;
      for allogenic blood transfusions have been proposed as additional mechanisms by which&#xD;
      aprotinin limits the inflammatory response (2). The use of aprotinin during cardiac surgery,&#xD;
      however, was discontinued following alarming results in terms of higher rate of bypass graft&#xD;
      occlusion and overall inferior postoperative outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AAT-1 mechanism of action:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to aprotinin, α1-Antitrypsin (AAT) is a 52-kDa circulating serine protease inhibitor&#xD;
      classified as a SERPIN protein. Besides its ability to inhibit serine proteases, accumulating&#xD;
      data suggest that AAT-1 possesses independent anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective effects&#xD;
      (3). AAT-1 modifies dendritic cell maturation and promotes regulatory T-cell differentiation,&#xD;
      induces interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist and IL-10 release, protects various cell types&#xD;
      from cell death, inhibits caspases-1 and -3 activities and inhibits IL-1 production and&#xD;
      activity (4). Contradictory to classic immunosuppressants, AAT-1 allows undeterred isolated&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte responses (5).These effects have been repeatedly corroborated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike aprotinin, AAT-1 is produced from human plasma, and does not have strong pro coagulant&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AAT-1 in different clinical settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating AAT-1 levels increase by 4-fold during acute-phase response (3). Patients with&#xD;
      low circulating levels of AAT-1 are at increase risk for lung, liver and pancreatic&#xD;
      destructive diseases, particularly emphysema (3). Preclinical and clinical studies have shown&#xD;
      that AAT-1 therapy for non-deficient individuals is safe, and may modify disease progression&#xD;
      in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, transplant rejection, graft versus host disease&#xD;
      and multiple sclerosis (6-17, 32,33,37,38) . AAT-1 treatment has subsequently advanced from&#xD;
      replacement therapy to potential treatment for a broad spectrum of inflammatory and&#xD;
      immune-mediated diseases. AAT-1 also appears to be antibacterial and an inhibitor of viral&#xD;
      infections, such as influenza and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human pharmacokinetic data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with AAT-1 deficiency, intravenous administration of AAT-1 in a dose of 60 mg per&#xD;
      kg body weight maintain plasma levels resembling acute phase response immediately after&#xD;
      administration, and retain an appropriate level of serum AAT above the protective threshold&#xD;
      (50 mg/dl) a week afterwards (39).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational of AAT-1 dosage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies and clinical practice, the administration of multiple intravenous&#xD;
      dosage of 60 mg per kg body weight of AAT-1 is safe and is associated with low incidence of&#xD;
      benign side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Derived from pharmacokinetic studies (39), AAT-1 plasma levels immediately following the&#xD;
      administration of this external dosage resembles acute phase response. A 30% reduction in&#xD;
      AAT-1 plasma levels is anticipated with gradual return to preoperative levels after&#xD;
      termination of CPB (40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/ benefit of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of AAT-1 in mitigating inflammatory response has been established. CPB is a potent&#xD;
      stimulator of inflammatory cascades and associated with bleeding diatheses, coagulation&#xD;
      abnormalities, potentially leading to organ dysfunction. To date, the administration of AAT-1&#xD;
      in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB has not been explored. It may be postulated&#xD;
      that inherent AAT-1 effects may offset deleterious CPB effects. This may clinically result in&#xD;
      improved preservation of organ function, reduced postoperative bleeding and reduced hospital&#xD;
      stay. The benefits of other protease inhibitors in corresponding settings have been recently&#xD;
      demonstrated (41-43).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above, administration of AAT-1 in various clinical settings is considered safe&#xD;
      with low rate of side effects (see section 6.1 - potential risks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Methods 4.1 Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative AAT-1 administration in patients&#xD;
           undergoing CABG with CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperative blood loss and organ function will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no data exists with regard to AAT-1 effects in the settings of CPB. The primary&#xD;
      goals of this study are to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, organ function preservation&#xD;
      (1-2) and postoperative blood loss reduction following AAT-1 administration in patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;

      at any time during treatment without prejudice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If medically indicated, the principal investigator or the surgeon poses the right to&#xD;
      discontinue patient enrollment at any stage of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation (failure to complete the study) will be documented. The reason for&#xD;
      discontinuation will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential causes that may lead to discontinuation include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse event(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol violation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient withdrew consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administrative problems 4.3 Enrollment Prior to participation in this study, the&#xD;
           Investigator will obtain written appropriate approval for the protocol and the informed&#xD;
           consent form the Ethics Committee (EC) and other local regulatory organizations. The&#xD;
           approved consent form will clearly reflect the EC approval date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure to obtain a signed and hand dated informed consent prior to the procedure constitutes&#xD;
      a protocol violation, and subsequently reportable to the EC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Subject Screening Patients that have been already scheduled for isolated CABG operation&#xD;
      will be addressed by a member of the research team during the preoperative waiting period&#xD;
      (either in the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, the Department of Cardiology or the&#xD;
      Department of Internal Medicine). The goal of the study, procedure and incentive will be&#xD;
      explained by a research staff member to each potential participant. Consenting subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to provide written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.1 Randomization The study participants will be randomized to receive either single dose&#xD;
      AAT-1 60 mg per kg or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.2 Trial medication administration: Preparation and dosing of AAT-1 will be performed by&#xD;
      an unblinded pharmacist. The medication will be diluted just prior to administration. The&#xD;
      placebo solution will comprise human albumin that resembles the color and consistency of&#xD;
      AAT-1 solution. The medication will be given 3-5 hours prior to surgery (skin incision).&#xD;
      Administration rate of the drug will not exceed 0.04 ml per kg per minute (approximately&#xD;
      60-80 minutes). Vital signs including blood pressure, pulse rate and body temperature will be&#xD;
      correspondingly monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients, research staff, laboratory personnel and data analysts will remain blinded to&#xD;
      the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization and until database lock. Data&#xD;
      unblinding will commence in the case of patient's emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization list will be produced by the pharmacist, however, will be secured and&#xD;
      confidential until time of unblinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.3 Surgical technique Consistent with our routine policy, fentanyl citrate (20-50mcg/kg),&#xD;
      midazolam (2-3mg) and isoflurane (0.5-2%) will be used for induction and maintenance of&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard median sternotomy will be followed by procurement of the conduits. Heparin loading&#xD;
      dose will be administered to achieve a kaolin activated coagulation time (ACT). Ascending&#xD;
      aorta - right atrial cannulation will be performed to institute CPB and ACT will be monitored&#xD;
      at 480 seconds or more. Standard centrifugal pump and a membrane oxygenator will be used for&#xD;
      extracorporeal circulation (cardiopulmonary bypass). Compatible with the standard technique,&#xD;
      systemic active cooling will be avoided and patients core temperature will remain range&#xD;
      between 32 and 37˚C. Distal anastomoses will be performed during single aortic cross-clamp&#xD;
      and blood cardioplegic arrest. Proximal anastomoses will be performed during aortic&#xD;
      cross-clamp. Cold (10˚C) blood cardioplegic solution will be delivered in a 4:1 ratio.&#xD;
      Cardioplegia will be delivered antegrade via the aortic root with or without additional&#xD;
      retrograde administration via the coronary sinus. After cardioplegic induction (10 ml / Kg),&#xD;
      intermittent doses (300 - 500 ml) will be administered following completion of each distal&#xD;
      anastomosis. Heparin will be reversed using protamine sulphate in a ratio of 1:1 after&#xD;
      weaning from CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.4 Data collection Preoperative data: Demographic, morphological and clinical descriptors&#xD;
      including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA) co-morbidity, Euroscore&#xD;
      risk-stratification, medication, etc. will be recorded. Preoperative laboratory analysis will&#xD;
      include complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum creatinine levels and creatinine&#xD;
      clearance, liver function test and arterial blood gases test and serology for HIV,HCV,HBC.&#xD;
      Compatible with our routine policy, all patients will undergo preoperative echocardiography,&#xD;
      coronary angiography, chest x-ray, lung function tests (spirometry) and carotid artery duplex&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be assigned to undergo preoperative brain MRI; subjected to the&#xD;
      protocol described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative: The type of surgery will be classified. The following data will be recorded:&#xD;
      heparin dose given prior to bypass initiation; activated clotting time (ACT) counts during&#xD;
      the operation (prior, during and after CPB); operative time, cross-clamp time and CPB time;&#xD;
      number of trials to wean from CPB, type of inotropes and dosage used during weaning from CPB;&#xD;
      blood products utilization during surgery. Allergic reactions or adverse events observed by&#xD;
      the surgeon or anesthesiologist will be documented. The individual surgeon's impression&#xD;
      regarding bleeding tendency will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative organ function and blood loss evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence and magnitude of systemic inflammatory response and organ dysfunction will be&#xD;
      recorded and quantified by laboratory markers. Related laboratory markers will be monitored&#xD;
      on a daily basis during the recovery period (in the intensive care unit and at the ward). The&#xD;
      following organs and corresponding markers will be monitored:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function: Pulmonary function will be evaluated by measured overall mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation time, peak inspiratory pressures (PIP), plateau pressures, physiologic dead space&#xD;
      and static and dynamic lung compliance. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be performed 3&#xD;
      hours after operation (while the patient is anesthesized and intubated) and extracted fluid&#xD;
      will be analyzed for inflammatory markers. A-a DO2 calculation [AaDO2 = (713 x FiO2) - (pCO2&#xD;
      / 0.8) - (paO2)] will be measured daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete pulmonary function test will be performed before and 4 days after the operation.&#xD;
      Chest radiographs will be evaluated and quantified by an independent radiologist for the&#xD;
      occurrence of atelectasis, pulmonary edema, or pleural changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal function: Daily measurements of urine output, serum creatinine levels, creatinine&#xD;
      clearance and urinary albumin levels. Acute kidney injury (AKI) markers will be sampled in&#xD;
      the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain injury assessment: The degree of insult to the brain will be measured by plasma S-100&#xD;
      proteinlevels. Assessment of damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) will be performed by&#xD;
      magnetical resonance imaging (MRI) modality (see technique protocol below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic function: Daily measurements of serum hepatic enzymes levels. Cardiac function:&#xD;
      Monitoring of cardiac enzymes levels; need and magnitude of required inotrope treatment;&#xD;
      occurrence of low cardiac output syndrome (defined as systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or&#xD;
      less coupled with central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg or more) and incidence of cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmias. Transthoracic echocardiography examination will be performed on postoperative&#xD;
      day 5 and assessed by an independent cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood loss: Operative and postoperative blood loss will be monitored as well as daily&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels. Daily platelet counts and thromboelastograms will be performed. The&#xD;
      distribution of blood products and total administered will be recorded daily. Postoperative&#xD;
      CRP levels will be evaluated daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling and laboratory analysis methods for cytokine levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten mL whole blood venous EDTA samples will be collected from radial artery catheter at five&#xD;
      specified occasions: before induction of anaesthesia, 30 minutes after aortic cross-clamp&#xD;
      positioning and 3, 6, and 9 hours after aortic cross clamp positioning. The blood samples&#xD;
      will be subsequently centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min and the serum stored at -70 °C. Samples&#xD;
      will be analyzed for the following markers: Polimorphonuclear Neutrophil Elastase (PMNE),&#xD;
      Interleukin-1α (IL-1α), Interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), Interleukin-2 (IL-2), Interleukin-4 (IL-4),&#xD;
      Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Interferon-γ (IFN-γ),&#xD;
      Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Monocyte&#xD;
      Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), and Endothelial Growth Factor (EGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily blood samples will be collected postoperatively for platelet count, renal function,&#xD;
      liver function, CRP levels S-100 protein and troponin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early postoperative adverse events will be documented. These include 30-day mortality, new&#xD;
      neurological events, myocardial infarction, renal dysfunction, need for re-exploration for&#xD;
      bleeding and deep sternal wound infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) assessment by MRI The imaging modality used for BBB assessment will&#xD;
      be MRI scanner (Philips 3T or General Electric 1.5T). The examination format will include 24&#xD;
      cm FOV, 35 contiguous interleaved slices, 3.5-4 mm thick and co-localized across series.&#xD;
      Trace-weighted DWI images will be obtained at b=1000 from a 13-15 direction DTI sequence with&#xD;
      an in-plane resolution of 2.5×2.5mm and TR/TE=10s/58ms at 3T or TR/TE=10s/72ms at 1.5T.&#xD;
      T2-FLAIR images will be obtained with an in-plane resolution of 0.94×0.94 mm, TR/TE=9000/120&#xD;
      ms and TI=2600 ms at 3T or TR/TE=9000/140 ms and TI=2200 ms at 1.5T. (25)&#xD;
