      This research study is being done to help researchers develop new dietary options for&#xD;
      menopausal women to maintain a healthy weight by developing more nutritious snacks that have&#xD;
      health benefits. From this study, the researchers hope to gain understanding on how&#xD;
      menopausal women with metabolic syndrome digest and absorb foods with safflower oil on its&#xD;
      own and when combined with soy. The research team hypothesize that the two different types of&#xD;
      pretzels may be processed by your body differently and that components in the pretzel snacks&#xD;
      may be helpful for preventing diseases like obesity and cancer. Safflower oil and soybeans&#xD;
      contain many natural chemicals that may benefit human health. However, this relationship is&#xD;
      not well understood. This study will look at the impact of the pretzel snacks on your blood&#xD;
      fat and glucose levels as well as a group of chemicals found in soy called &quot;isoflavones&quot;.&#xD;
      Isoflavones are natural chemicals found commonly in soybeans or foods made from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened to determine if they qualify in meeting the study requirements.&#xD;
      Participants cannot have a known allergy to dairy, soy, safflower oil, or wheat protein.&#xD;
      Also, participants will be asked to stop eating legumes (beans, peas, soy protein, sprouts&#xD;
      and peanuts) and to document the oils they eat for the entire 14 weeks of this study. The&#xD;
      study will require five visits to the Ohio State University Clinical Research Center (CRC)&#xD;
      which part of the Ohio State University's Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences.&#xD;
      Once the investigators have determined that you qualify for this study and you decide to&#xD;
      participate, you will be consuming three different pretzels each for one month, starting with&#xD;
      a control pretzel. After the control pretzel treatment period, you will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      (like the &quot;flip of a coin&quot;) to start with one of the two pretzel groups (wheat or soy pretzel&#xD;
      with safflower oil) for your first treatment period and then switch to the other safflower&#xD;
      oil pretzel at your second treatment period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal is to develop new dietary strategies to help postmenopausal women&#xD;
      maintain a healthy weight by improving the availability of nutritious snacks that contain&#xD;
      added health benefits and will be used to assess the impact of a functional snack on snacking&#xD;
      behavior. The primary objective is to evaluate safflower oil delivered in a wheat pretzel&#xD;
      compared to a wheat pretzel enhanced with soy will have a greater affect on blood&#xD;
      triglyceride and glucose levels thereby affecting satiety and snacking behavior. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that a functional snack food such as a soft pretzel containing&#xD;
      safflower oil either with or without soy compared to the control pretzel (wheat pretzel with&#xD;
      no safflower oil) will reduce postprandial blood triglycerides and glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed multidisciplinary study is a randomized cross-over trial involving 20&#xD;
      overweight (BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2) postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome will participate in&#xD;
      a dietary intervention study for a total of 14 weeks (two weeks of washout and three 4 week&#xD;
      interventions). The study will require five visits to the Ohio State University Clinical&#xD;
      Research Center (CRC), part of the Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences, Figure 5.&#xD;
      Women will visit the CRC to be screened (Day-14) and their eligibility will be determined&#xD;
      using a health and lifestyle questionnaire and results from a 12 hour fasting lipid panel&#xD;
      (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides). Those meeting the National Cholesterol&#xD;
      Education Program criteria for metabolic syndrome and having no other excluding conditions&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Prior to their oral triglyceride tolerance tests (OTTT), women will be&#xD;
      instructed to abstain from a. alcohol consumption for 72 hour, b. consume ≥150g of&#xD;
      carbohydrates for 24 hours, c. abstain from vigorous exercise for 24 hours, d. collect urine&#xD;
      for 24 hours, e. fast for 12 hours prior to all their clinic visits. When women arrive at the&#xD;
      CRC for their clinic visits, weight and vital signs will be collected and a venous catheter&#xD;
      placed for timed blood collections. Blood will be collected for serum triglycerides and&#xD;
      glucose prior to (-5 minutes) and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes&#xD;
      after consumption of the test meal. At their run-in visit (Day 0), subjects will consume a&#xD;
      control pretzel with a flavored oil dip containing a standardized quantity of triglycerides&#xD;
      (50 g long chain fatty acids). At the first treatment period (Day 28) visit, women will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of the two intervention groups (wheat or soy pretzel with safflower oil)&#xD;
      and then crossover to the other safflower oil pretzel at their second treatment period visit&#xD;
      (Day 56). The two intervention pretzel meals will be accompanied with the same oil dip&#xD;
      provided before. At the end of each OTTT visit women will be instructed to continue eating&#xD;
      the test pretzels (12 pretzel bites/day) for the next 28 days as a snack. Subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to complete questions pertaining to their satiety during their 7 hour stay. Women&#xD;
      will return for their last visit on Day 84 to submit all completed study materials (survey,&#xD;
      dietary recall, and daily intake journal), completed 24 hour urine collection, and blood&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
