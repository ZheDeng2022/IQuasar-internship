      The study is designed to test the hypothesis that it is possible to recruit larger motor&#xD;
      responses to transcranial stimulation by increasing the number of stimulating pulses under&#xD;
      both baseline conditions and conditions of increased anesthetic suppression of the motor&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;

    <measure>Effect of Pulse Train Length on Transcranial Motor Evoked Potentials (TcMEP) Area Under Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) and TIVA Plus 3% Desflurane</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A series of 15 transcranial motor evoked potentials are recorded under a TIVA anesthetic and again after addition of 3% desflurane for 5 minutes at two different time points in a surgical procedure. The series consisted of 3 runs of 5,6, 7, 8, and 9 pulse trains, each train separated by 30 seconds. The 3 runs were averaged to give and average value of TcMEP amplitude and area for the 5,6,7,8 and 9 pulse trains. The data were used to compute regression coefficients for area vs pulse length for the TIVA case and TIVA plus desflurane for each participant who completed the study..The final measure is the number of participants who had a MEP area ratios significantly different from 1 at all times and conditions; that is for TIVA alone and TIVA plus desflurane, at both time points.</description>
