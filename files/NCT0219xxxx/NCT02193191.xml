  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and efficacy of a drug called&#xD;
      Plerixafor. Plerixafor is approved by the US FDA for use in increasing blood stem cell counts&#xD;
      before collection in cancer patients. It is not yet approved for patients with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease. The investigators want to find out if Plerixafor can be used to increase cell counts&#xD;
      in patients with sickle cell disease.&#xD;

    <description>Safety is assessed using a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) endpoint. Definition of a DLT is the occurrence of any of the below events that meets the following criteria: The occurrence of a vasoocclusive crisis requiring hospitalization, acute chest syndrome, CNS acute event, or any other disease related ischemic-based adverse event (AE) should be considered as a DLT, if occurring in the 48 hours DLT observation period.</description>

    <measure>efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>≥ 30/ul at either 6-12 hours or 24-48 hours post plerixafor.</time_frame>

    <description>Patients will receive a single dose of subcutaneous plerixafor with peripheral blood studies at approximately 0-2 hours before, approximately 6-12 hours after, and approximately 20-48 hours after plerixafor administration, with leukapheresis in the last 3 patients on the protocol. Collected HPCs will be transferred to the MSKCC CTCEF to determine if the HPCs are amenable to transduction with a lentiviral vector encoding the normal ß- globin gene.</description>
