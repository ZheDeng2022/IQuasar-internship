  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The hepatitis E virus causes an acute hepatitis that usually goes away by itself.&#xD;
      Researchers in France studied people who received a liver or kidney transplant. They found&#xD;
      that hepatitis E may not go away by itself in these people. It becomes chronic. This can&#xD;
      cause serious liver disease. More than half the people who had organ transplant who had&#xD;
      hepatitis E seemed to get a chronic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to find out if hepatitis E happens this often in patients who have liver,&#xD;
      kidney, or small bowel transplants in the United States. If it does, they want to know why.&#xD;
      They want to know if chronic hepatitis E will become an important medical problem. This&#xD;
      research might help improve care for people who have a transplant. It also might help&#xD;
      researchers prevent the spread of hepatitis E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see how many patients who have received or are waiting for certain transplants have&#xD;
      antibodies to hepatitis E virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults over age 18 who have had a liver, kidney, liver and kidney, or small bowel&#xD;
      transplant, or are on a waiting list for one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be enrolled from 3 transplant centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a questionnaire. They will be asked about possible risk&#xD;
           factors for hepatitis E exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a blood sample drawn through a needle placed in a vein.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis E virus infection commonly presents as an acute self-limiting hepatitis in the&#xD;
      developing world. However there have been reports that chronic hepatitis E may develop in&#xD;
      immunocompromised subjects such as renal and liver transplant recipients. Progression to&#xD;
      cirrhosis has also been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis E infection. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that immunosuppression post-organ transplantation predisposes individuals to&#xD;
      increased susceptibility to hepatitis E infection. Therefore, in this study, we wish to&#xD;
      determine the seroprevalence of antibody to hepatitis E IgG in organ transplant recipients&#xD;
      (an immunosuppressed population) and compare it to patients who are on organ transplant&#xD;
      waitlist (not immunosuppressed). We plan to study samples and date from 300 organ transplant&#xD;
      recipients and 300 patients on waitlist for liver, kidney or intestinal transplantation and&#xD;
      control for age, gender, organ and transplant center. Three transplant centers (2 in the&#xD;
      mid-Atlantic area and one in the Mid-West) will each enroll 100 cases and controls. A minimum&#xD;
      of 50 cases at each site will be liver transplant recipients. Cases will be stratified based&#xD;
      on number of years post transplant one, two or greater than or equal to three years.&#xD;
      Consecutive patients who are eligible and agree to participate in the study will be enrolled.&#xD;
      A brief questionnaire to assess risk factors for acquisition of hepatitis E will be&#xD;
      administered and 8mls of blood will be drawn in a serum separator tube for anti HEV IgG, anti&#xD;
      HEV IgM and HEV RNA testing analysis at the NIH. Subjects who are confirmed to have acute or&#xD;
      chronic HEV infection will be managed according to standard of care at each respective&#xD;
      transplant centers.&#xD;
