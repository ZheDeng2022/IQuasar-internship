        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             the Study of the Liver 2009): A diagnosis of PBC can be made with confidence in adult&#xD;
             patients with otherwise unexplained elevation of ALP and presence of&#xD;
             anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA≥1:40), and/or AMA type M2. A liver biopsy is not&#xD;
             essential for the diagnosis of PBC in these patients, but allows activity and stage of&#xD;
             the disease to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having a screening ALP serum level between 1.67 and 5x ULN inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be on a stable dose of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 12-20 mg/kg/day for at least 3&#xD;
             months prior to Screening or intolerant of UDCA in the opinion of the investigator (no&#xD;
             UDCA for at least 8 weeks prior to Screening).&#xD;
