  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REWINDER is a multinational, multicentre, non-interventional, retrospective study of patients&#xD;
      treated with an oral antiplatelet (ticagrelor, prasugrel or clopidogrel) while in hospital&#xD;
      after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event, to be conducted in Belgium and Luxembourg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to evaluate the actual treatment persistence with oral antiplatelets&#xD;
      (OAP) after an ACS in the clinical practice in Belgium and Luxembourg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main secondary objectives are to describe the most frequent reasons for OAP treatment&#xD;
      switch, discontinuation or reinitiation; to identify the decisionmakers in the OAP treatment&#xD;
      changes and to characterize the patient profile in terms of demographics, diagnosis,&#xD;
      management strategies, comorbidities and concomitant medications to identify any association&#xD;
      between patient profile and treatment duration.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with oral antiplatelets (OAPs) is recommended for&#xD;
      up to 12 months unless discontinuation is clinically indicated. Early discontinuation could&#xD;
      result in an increased risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction due to the&#xD;
      patient's underlying disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no robust data allowing to evaluate the treatment persistence with OAPs after ACS&#xD;
      in the current practice in Belgium and Luxembourg at this time. It is currently unclear as to&#xD;
      why patients discontinue, switch or reinitiate treatment and upon whose advice. A&#xD;
      non-interventional study is needed to obtain reliable data on treatment persistence and&#xD;
      reasons for discontinuation, switch or reinitiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REWINDER is a multinational, multicentre, non-interventional, retrospective study of patients&#xD;
      treated with an oral antiplatelet (ticagrelor, prasugrel or clopidogrel) while in hospital&#xD;
      after an ACS event, to be conducted in Belgium and Luxembourg. Primary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the actual treatment persistence with OAPs after an ACS in the clinical practice in&#xD;
      Belgium and Luxembourg. The main secondary objectives are to describe the most frequent&#xD;
      reasons for OAP treatment switch, discontinuation or reinitiation; to identify the&#xD;
      decisionmakers in the OAP treatment changes and to characterize the patient profile in terms&#xD;
      of demographics, diagnosis, management strategies, comorbidities and concomitant medications&#xD;
      to identify any association between patient profile and treatment duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target sample size of the study is 500 patients.&#xD;

    <description>Patients discharged after an ACS event and fulfilling the entry criteria will be included in each centre. The retrospective observation period will be 1 year, starting on the date of discharge to home. Data on OAD treatment situation during the observation period will be collected.
