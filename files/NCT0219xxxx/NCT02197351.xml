  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is thought that the development of cancer of the stomach follows a series of stages in&#xD;
      which the lining becomes increasingly abnormal. Early detection of precursors of gastric&#xD;
      cancer likely enable less invasive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of gastric mucosa using the endoscope is used to detect cancers and these&#xD;
      precursor lesions. Narrow band imaging uses filtered light already built into modern&#xD;
      endoscopoes to identify the early changes in the gastric lining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that narrow band imaging improves detection of precursor&#xD;
      lesions and is a method amenable to international standardization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a prospective trial in which standard random biopsy, white&#xD;
      light guided biopsy, and narrow band imaging guided biopsy will be performed for each&#xD;
      patient. The yield of the different methods for gastric cancer precursors will thus be&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;

      1 BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precursor Lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer and second leading cause of malignant death&#xD;
      in the world. It often presents only with vague symptoms of dyspepsia and consequently is&#xD;
      frequently diagnosed at advanced stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric cancer develop in a series of steps beginning with H. pylori infection. 2-4 It&#xD;
      induces an inflammatory reaction with the surrounding gut epithelium which is theorized to&#xD;
      drive a subsequent progression in some patients to mucosal atrophy, intestinal metaplasia,&#xD;
      dysplasia, and finally gastric adenonocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic biopsy protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the evaluation for precancerous gastric lesions and Helicobacter pylori, experts recommend&#xD;
      that biopsies be obtained from the antrum (3cm from pylorus), body (8cm from the pylorus),&#xD;
      and insisura/angle. Both the greater and lesser curvature should be sampled. Additionally,&#xD;
      recently developed staging systems including OLGIM (operative clinic on intestinal&#xD;
      metaplasia) scores require histologic assessment (via the updated Sydney score) from two&#xD;
      sites (antrum and corpus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Narrow Band Imaging in endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with H. pylori gastritis, gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia most commonly have&#xD;
      no visible lesions on white-light endoscopy, although endoscopic findings may include antral&#xD;
      nodularity, absent rugae, prominent gastric vessels white mucosal deposits. However, the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of these gross findings for underlying histological findings is&#xD;
      poor. Therefore a number of image-enhancement techniques including chromoendoscopy using&#xD;
      mucosal dyes or endoscopy-based virtual chromo-endoscopy (e.g., narrow band imaging) have&#xD;
      been proposed. Narrow band imaging is the most widely investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Narrow band imaging is an electronic, noninvasive technique in which the illuminating light&#xD;
      from the endoscope is filtered to enable passage primarily of two narrow bands of light,&#xD;
      415nm and 540nm. These wavelengths correspond to the hemoglobin absorption wavelength in the&#xD;
      capillaries and submucosal vessels respectively. This enhances evaluation of the mucosal&#xD;
      surface patterns and vascular irregularities. NBI has been shown to be useful in the&#xD;
      detection of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus and characterization of small colonic adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a simple NBI classification using high-definition white light endoscopy was&#xD;
      proposed for gastric mucosal examination.18 The NBI interpretation using this classification&#xD;
      was compared with histological examination of mucosal biopsies, with both NBI and histology&#xD;
      determined in blinded fashion. This classification which defines the mucosal pattern of the&#xD;
      stomach had an accuracy exceeding 80% and excellent interobserver agreement (kappa=0.75) for&#xD;
      normal mucosa, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia. However, the study was done at a&#xD;
      referral center where 34% of patients had dysplasia and NBI was not compared with a white&#xD;
      light assessment or standardized gastric biopsy protocol. Additionally, the results were not&#xD;
      provided on a per patient basis, which is the most relevant endpoint in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE Prompt detection of gastric cancer precursors enables early&#xD;
      detection and less invasive treatment options such as endoscopic resection. Narrow band&#xD;
      imaging is a completely noninvasive technique which uses filtered light to enhance assessment&#xD;
      of mucosa. Our aim is to gauge whether biopsies targeted by narrow band imaging improves the&#xD;
      detection of gastric intestinal metaplasia and gastric dysplasia relative to standard white&#xD;
      light techniques on a per patient basis. A secondary aim will be to assess whether the&#xD;
      technique is amenable to standardization so that it might be used more broadly to identify&#xD;
      patients with early gastric neoplasia. While NBI is built into the vast majority of&#xD;
      endoscopes in use few physicians are aware of its potential use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective tandem endoscopy trial. All EGDs will have already been&#xD;
      planned as part of standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High definition white light endoscopy will initially be performed. The specific location of&#xD;
      all mucosal findings in the stomach such as ulceration or nodularity which require biopsy&#xD;
      will be noted by the endoscopist and research coordinator but will not be biopsied until&#xD;
      after NBI. This is done so that blood will not distort or bias NBI assessment. Any abnormal&#xD;
      findings in other parts of the GI tract examined using the scope (esophagus and duodenum)&#xD;
      will be noted and biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the white light exam, while the scope is in the stomach, the white light&#xD;
      endoscopist will press a button on the scope which changes the view to the narrow band&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point the NBI endoscopist who is initially blinded to the white light findings will&#xD;
      enter the procedure room and examine the stomach using NBI. The type and location of NBI&#xD;
      abnormalities will be noted and biopsies obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the NBI exam the NBI endoscopist will switch the scope view back to white light&#xD;
      mode. The white light endoscopist will return to the room and biopsy any sites identified and&#xD;
      recorded during the initial white-light endoscopy. A research coordinator present for the&#xD;
      entire procedure will verify and record that all sites identified during the initial white&#xD;
      light exam are biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, random biopsies will be performed by taking 2 biopsies from the lesser&#xD;
      curvature (body and antrum), 2 biopsies from the greater curvature (body and antrum), and one&#xD;
      from the angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biopsies obtained by white light exam, narrow band imaging exam, and random sampling will&#xD;
      be separately coded and submitted to pathology. Histologic analysis will be performed by&#xD;
      expert GI pathologists blinded to the acquisition approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short 10 second video clips of each site targeted for biopsy by white light narrow band&#xD;
      imaging will be recorded. They will be matched with the final biopsy results and stored&#xD;
      WITHOUT personal health identifiers. These short videos may be used for training and shared&#xD;
      with collaborators to assess inter-observer variability and standardize the interpretation of&#xD;
      NBI of the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be yield of NBI, high definition white light endoscopy, and&#xD;
      random biopsy for the detection of atrophic gastritis, IM and dysplasia on a per patient&#xD;
      basis. A secondary endpoint will be the number of regions found by each method to exhibit&#xD;
      atrophic gastritis, IM, and dysplasia (per lesion (region) yield). The yields of H. Pylori by&#xD;
      method and the total number of biopsies guided per method will be additional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled at the Los Angeles County Hospital of the University of Southern&#xD;
      California as well as the Gastroenterology Unit at the University of Porto in Porto Portugal.&#xD;
      The protocol originates from and statistical analysis will be done at the University of&#xD;
      Southern California. No personal health identifiers will be exchanged at any point between&#xD;
      the two institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the formal initiation of the study there will be a lead in period of 10-20 patients&#xD;
      with gastric symptoms. The initial patients will be examined using the white light, NBI, and&#xD;
      gastric biopsy protocol. After this the images will be discussed by the investigators at the&#xD;
      two centers to make certain that NBI interpretation of gastric premalignant changes is&#xD;
      standardized. The LAC+USC investigators will also review the Portugese video training library&#xD;
      on gastric NBI. Any changes in performance of the lead in versus the study will be noted to&#xD;
      address the secondary aim of developing a standardized approach to NBI which may help this&#xD;
      technique be used widely to identify patients with early gastric neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fisher's exact chi squared test will be used for dichotomous outcomes such as the&#xD;
      accurate detection of the highest level histology and number of biopsies. Adverse reactions&#xD;
      will be reported in a descriptive manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous research which showed 74% correction detection of gastric cancer precursors&#xD;
      with white light endoscopy versus 89% with NBI and given our anticipated gastric cancer&#xD;
      prevalence of 20% we performed preliminary sample size estimates for a range of OR using&#xD;
      G*Power (alpha=0.05, beta =0.20). We anticipate an N of 200 will be sufficient to show a&#xD;
      significant difference between methods.&#xD;
