    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, open-label, sequential, three-period study in 15 healthy subjects to&#xD;
      assess the influence of P-glycoprotein inhibition and simultaneous CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein&#xD;
      induction on lenvantinib pharmacokinetics following single dose oral administration of 24 mg&#xD;
      lenvatinib to healthy volunteers. The study will consist of two phases: Pretreatment and&#xD;
      Treatment. The Pretreatment Phase will have two periods: Screening and Baseline 1. The&#xD;
      purpose of the Screening Period is to obtain informed consent and to establish protocol&#xD;
      eligibility. The purpose of the Baseline 1 is to confirm protocol eligibility. The Treatment&#xD;
      Phase will have three periods: Treatment Period 1, Treatment Period 2, and Treatment Period 3&#xD;
      with a Baseline 2 assessment prior to Treatment Period 2 and a Baseline 3 assessment prior to&#xD;
      Treatment Period 3. The purpose of Baselines 2 and 3 are to confirm continued protocol&#xD;
      eligibility. In the Treatment Phase, subjects will take a single oral dose of 24 mg&#xD;
      lenvatinib on three separate occasions (Period 1, Day 1; Period 2, Day 15; and Period 3, Day&#xD;
      43). In Period 2, Day 15, subjects will also take a single oral dose of 600 mg po rifampin.&#xD;
      In Period 3, subjects will receive 600 mg rifampin po daily for 21 days (Period 3, Days 29 to&#xD;
      49). On Day 43 of Period 3, subjects will take 24 mg lenvatinib in addition to the rifampin.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Non-smoking (i.e., no use of nicotine or nicotine containing products within the past&#xD;
             3 months), male or female subjects, age greater than or equal to 18 years and lesser&#xD;
             than or equal to 55 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 18 and lesser than or equal to 30 kg/m2&#xD;
             at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Females may not be lactating or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a&#xD;
             negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of&#xD;
             25 IU/L or equivalent units of B-hCG). A separate baseline assessment is required if a&#xD;
             negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first&#xD;
             dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are&#xD;
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age&#xD;
             group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically&#xD;
             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all&#xD;
             with surgery at least 1 month before dosing)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception (e.g., total abstinence, a nonhormonal-based intrauterine device, a&#xD;
             doublebarrier method [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], or have a&#xD;
             vasectomised partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout the entire study period&#xD;
             and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. Use of hormonal contraceptives&#xD;
             (e.g., oral contraceptive, contraceptive implant, hormone-releasing IUD) as the&#xD;
             primary method of contraception does not meet the definition of a highly effective&#xD;
             method of birth control for this study because Rifampin is known to cause failure of&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives. If currently abstinent, the subject must agree to use a&#xD;
             double-barrier method as described above if she becomes sexually active during the&#xD;
             study period or for 30 days after study drug discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and&#xD;
             their female partner must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing potential&#xD;
             or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and for 30&#xD;
             days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed through the study&#xD;
             period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Are willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who had a clinically significant illness that required medical treatment&#xD;
             within 8 weeks or a clinically significant infection within 4 weeks of dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with a disease that may influence the outcome of the study; such as&#xD;
             psychiatric disorders and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney,&#xD;
             respiratory system, endocrine system, hematological system, neurological system, or&#xD;
             cardiovascular system, or subjects who have a congenital abnormality in metabolism&#xD;
             within 4 weeks prior to dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with a history of gastrointestinal surgery (hepatectomy, nephrotomy,&#xD;
             digestive organ resection, etc.) that may affect pharmacokinetic profiles of&#xD;
             lenvatinib or rifampin&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with a known history of clinically significant drug or food allergies or&#xD;

             prior to dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with any clinically abnormal symptom or organ impairment found on medical&#xD;
             history, symptoms/signs, vital signs, ECG finding, or laboratory test results which&#xD;
             require medical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with a QTc interval greater than 450 ms at Screening or Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;

             or orange juice, vegetables from the mustard green family (e.g., kale, broccoli,&#xD;
             watercress, collard greens, kohlrabi, brussel sprouts, mustard), and charbroiled&#xD;
             meats] within 2 weeks prior to dosing&#xD;

             investigator, unsuitable for the study or who, in the opinion of the investigator, are&#xD;
             not likely to complete the study for any reason&#xD;
