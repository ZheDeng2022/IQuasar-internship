  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annually 12.000 people i Denmark suffer from a stroke. Treatment for ischemic stroke is&#xD;
      available, but only 12% of stroke patients receive it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is only available within a time frame of 4,5 hours from symptom onset, thus the&#xD;
      Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is essential to fast and effective stroke treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish the rate of recognition of stroke symptoms by healthcare personnel in the&#xD;
           EMD, ultimately aiming at optimizing performance, and identifying barriers for a fast&#xD;
           and correct EMS-response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess prehospital time consumption by ambulance personnel on the scene of a stroke,&#xD;
           create a baseline for future comparison and generate explorative hypotheses for&#xD;
           forthcoming interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is, to ensure the best possible prehospital care for all stroke&#xD;
      patients. The study will determine, if the EMD is at a high and international level in&#xD;
      regards to stroke recognition, and if there is a potential to decrease on-scene time. This&#xD;
      will serve as future comparison and have an effect on the structure and future education in&#xD;
      the prehospital services, and potentially improve the outcome after acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 12.000 strokes occur in Denmark annually. The only evidence based&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment of ischemic stroke is thrombolysis within a time-window of 4.5&#xD;
      hours from symptom onset(1). In 2012, 12% of patients with ischemic stroke in Denmark&#xD;
      received thrombolysis treatment. The probability of a favourable 3-month outcome after stroke&#xD;
      decreases with time from symptom onset to thrombolysis: the onset to needle time(2).&#xD;
      Therefore, it is of the highest importance to identify potential targets for prehospital time&#xD;
      reduction, and thereby reduce delay to definitive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prompt recognition of stroke symptoms by both the EMD and ambulance personnel is a crucial&#xD;
      step, as it provides access to fast track acute stroke services. In this context, the role of&#xD;
      the EMS is essential, as contact to the hospital through EMS opposed to private transport is&#xD;
      correlated to decreased onset-to-door time (3). EMS prenotification of the stroke centre is&#xD;
      correlated to shorter door-to-evaluation time, door-to-needle time and onset-to-needle&#xD;
      time(4). In Denmark EMS prenotification in acute stroke is well established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Danish guidelines for treatment of acute stroke and transient ischaemic attack&#xD;
      (TIA), prehospital diagnosis of stroke is improved by use of validated tests. No such is yet&#xD;
      implemented in the Capital Region of Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data shows that the mean time from the ambulance personnel arrives at the scene&#xD;
      to they start the transport to the hospital (&quot;on scene time&quot;) is 18 minutes in the Capital&#xD;
      Region of Denmark. American guidelines suggest that on-scene-time should be less than 15&#xD;
      minutes in all cases (unless extenuating circumstances or extrication difficulties are&#xD;
      present)(1), however the organisation of stroke care between Scandinavia and USA varies&#xD;
      largely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish the rate of recognition of stroke symptoms by healthcare personnel in the&#xD;
           EMD, ultimately aiming at optimizing performance, and identifying barriers for a fast&#xD;
           and correct EMS-response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess prehospital time consumption by ambulance personnel on the scene of a stroke,&#xD;
           create a baseline for future comparison and generate explorative hypotheses for&#xD;
           forthcoming interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 3 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An epidemiological analysis of prospectively collected data from a 2-year period, in&#xD;
           order to establish the rate of identification of stroke symptoms by healthcare personnel&#xD;
           in the EMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A quantification and statistical analysis of on-scene-time in stroke patients, based on&#xD;
           prospectively collected data from a registration form filled out by the ambulance&#xD;
           personnel after responding to a stroke. The focus of the form is on time spent on&#xD;
           predefined tasks aiming at assessing time consumption on the scene, and generating&#xD;
           explorative hypotheses for forthcoming interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Based on EMS data, the investigators will establish a baseline for on-scene-time and&#xD;
           transportation time in patients admitted by fast track stroke service during a 6 months&#xD;
           period, for future comparison and analyse data in conjunction with in-hospital delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method for each arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The epidemiological analysis is based on prospectively collected data from the Danish&#xD;
           Stroke Registry (DSR) and the National Patient Registry (NPR). In the DSR and NPR,&#xD;
           ICD-10-codes are linked to the Danish personal identification number, a unique number&#xD;
           for every Danish citizen. The investigators shall compare ICD-10 codes from DSR and NPR&#xD;
           with dispatch codes from the EMS database, to determine the amount of diagnosed stroke&#xD;
           patients recognized during the emergency call. The date of the incident report from the&#xD;
           EMS will be matched with the admission date correlated to the discharge ICD-10 code, in&#xD;
           case a patient has been admitted more than once.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To quantify and analyse prehospital time consumption, the investigators will develop a&#xD;
           registration form for the ambulance personnel to fill out after responding to a stroke&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This registration form will include registration of time intervals spent on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical tasks; including prior medical history, clinical examination and&#xD;
                measurement of vital parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Communication in relation to prenotification of the stroke centre&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mobilization of the patient and on-scene conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient preparation; including IV-accesses and 12-lead ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
           As well as information regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient preparation; including IV-accesses and 12-lead ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Language/communication barriers&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Specifications of the ambulance (operator, level of education)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient/relative related conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visitation to acute stroke fast track&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Poisson regression analyses will be made with over dispersion taken into account, in&#xD;
           order to identify specific time intervals and tasks correlated to extended or decreased&#xD;
           total on-scene-time. This model yields distributions similar to previously collected&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A power calculation has been made, based on this distribution and the assumption that a&#xD;
           clinically relevant difference, is defined as any time interval in cases considered as&#xD;
           having a high on-scene-time, (&gt;15 min.) being twice the amount than in cases considered&#xD;
           as having a low on-scene-time (â‰¤15 min.). This has shown an estimated demand of 500&#xD;
           registration forms in order to achieve a power of 0,8 with a 5% two-sided confidence&#xD;
           interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The establishment of on-scene-times and transportation-times will be made by extracting&#xD;
           specific time points (e.g. ambulance arrival at the scene, departure towards hospital&#xD;
           and arrival at hospital) from the EMS database during a 6 months period, and analysed in&#xD;
           conjunction with data on in-hospital delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stroke centres will provide Danish personal identification numbers for patients referred&#xD;
      to the stroke centres as well as door-to-needle times and treatment decisions in order to&#xD;
      determine if there is a correlation be-tween recognition and treatment decisions in stroke&#xD;
      fast track patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is no prior comparable registration of this, it is impossible to estimate a&#xD;
      clinically relevant difference in order to make a power calculation and determine the amount&#xD;
      of necessary registrations. Thus it has been decided that a 6-month registration will provide&#xD;
      a reliable baseline. To avoid bias, the registration of this variable, will start after the&#xD;
      end of the registration form period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is, to ensure the best possible prehospital care for all stroke&#xD;
      patients. The study will determine, if the EMD is at a high and international level in&#xD;
      regards to stroke recognition, and if there is a potential to decrease on-scene time. This&#xD;
      will serve as future comparison and have an effect on the structure and future education in&#xD;
      the prehospital services, and potentially improve the outcome after acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
