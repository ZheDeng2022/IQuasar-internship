  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a syndrome which includes elevated androgen levels,&#xD;
      irregular menstrual cycles and insulin resistance. Standard treatments, which include weight&#xD;
      loss and medications to improve insulin secretion are only partly successful, and may require&#xD;
      that young women take medications for decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators have been evaluating the effects of specific diets on insulin&#xD;
      resistance in healthy volunteers and subjects with type 2 diabetes, and have found that&#xD;
      subjects with insulin resistance seem to respond particularly well to these diet regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers with PCOS are being asked to participate to see if following these diets can help&#xD;
      regularize your menstrual cycles. The results of this study may help improve fertility&#xD;
      treatments for women with PCOS.&#xD;

      Experimental Design and Methods This is a prospective, open labeled, randomized diet&#xD;
      intervention study done on adult participants with PCOS. After signing informed consents,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to eat a recommended ADA diet for two weeks (run in period).&#xD;
      Participants will then have baseline testing, including: urine and blood tests to evaluate&#xD;
      insulin resistance (fasting glucose and insulin, 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test),&#xD;
      electrolytes to assess acid-base status, ovarian volume and testosterone levels measured to&#xD;
      assess severity of PCOS, and questionnaires about menstrual frequency, eating habits and&#xD;
      stress. Participants will then be randomized to either a high fruits and vegetable Paleo Diet&#xD;
      for 4-8 months or a standard ADA-recommended diet for the first 4 months followed by Paleo&#xD;
      Diet for 0-4 months.All participants will have the option of limiting their participation to&#xD;
      just 4 months or extending participation to the full 8 months depending on their ongoing&#xD;
      level of interest. All testing will be repeated at 4 months (crossover point) and at&#xD;
      completion of the diets at 8 months. The primary outcome variables are menstrual cycle&#xD;
      frequency and ovarian volume, and secondary outcomes include metabolic profiles and&#xD;
      eating/behavior questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diet: All participants will initially be given diet information on ADA diet for the &quot;Run&#xD;
           In&quot; period , including printed ADA diet instructions and advice on caloric intake. The&#xD;
           ADA diet includes foods that are excluded in the Paleo Diet, such as grains, legumes and&#xD;
           dairy products and will also contain less potassium. All participants will be instructed&#xD;
           not to add salt to their food when cooking or eating. At 2 weeks, participants will be&#xD;
           randomized to Paleo Diet arm or ADA diet arm. Participants on the Paleo Diet arm will&#xD;
           require a &quot;ramp-up&quot; phase for one week (start out with 1 Paleo meal per day, then two,&#xD;
           and then all meals will be on a Paleolithic-type menu, which contains approximately an&#xD;
           average of 142 grams of protein and 12,200 mg of potassium per 3000 kcal. Participants&#xD;
           on the ADA diet arm will continue on the run-in diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After 16 weeks, the participants in the ADA arm will be changed over to the Paleo arm if&#xD;
           they wish to continue participation. They will also require a &quot;ramp-up&quot; phase for 1&#xD;
           week. In our previous studies, we have seen a crossover effect at one month going from&#xD;
           the Paleo to the ADA diet, but not from the ADA to the Paleo arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will give all participants pertinent websites and written information about their&#xD;
           specific diet, as well as sample menus. We will give participants in the Paleo arm a&#xD;
           list of foods to avoid (e.g., dairy, grains, legumes, processed foods).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main obstacles to compliance with outpatient diets include the cost, the amount of&#xD;
           time needed, and ignorance about where to get specific kinds of foods. We will give them&#xD;
           lists of various supermarkets and farmers markets times and dates, we will advise&#xD;
           participants about making up batches of foods on the weekends and freezing them, and if&#xD;
           they have families or other support, we will try to get them involved in support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Monitoring dietary compliance: We will monitor compliance in a number of ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recruited four nutrition student volunteers from UC Berkeley, who will work closely&#xD;
      with the participants to help them adapt the study diets to their everyday living situations.&#xD;
      The nutrition students will help design the materials we will give the participants, as well&#xD;
      as give dietary advice. We are working on a number of electronic and social media methods for&#xD;
      keeping track of what our subjects are eating. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initially daily, or near daily contacts for the first week of each diet, then at least&#xD;
           weekly contacts, and then at least monthly contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  online data system that monitors food and activity (e.g., the USDA super tracker,&#xD;
           myfitnesspal, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tweets or texts that ask the subjects to go to an elink and answer a few questions,&#xD;
           e.g., did you eat grains today? The answers are downloaded to a database that can be&#xD;
           compiled to reflect dietary compliance for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also develop a secure website so that participants from each group can discuss with&#xD;
      others what problems and solutions they are using.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last, we will also assess 24 hour urines for creatinine, sodium, and potassium at 0, 16 and&#xD;
      32 weeks. Both of these diets will be higher in potassium and lower in sodium than typical&#xD;
      American diets. Although we expect our subjects will be motivated enough to follow these&#xD;
      diets, from our previous studies we have found that some subjects were not honest about what&#xD;
      they were eating, and this was reflected in the 24 hour urine excretion of potassium and&#xD;
      sodium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assays:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be drawn at time 0; week 8; week 16; week 24 and week 32. We will collect serum,&#xD;
      plasma and urine at all these timepoints for banking. The following tests will be performed&#xD;
      at time (table 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CBC, Chemical profile; blood lipids; cardiovascular risk factors and inflammatory&#xD;
           cytokines and adipokines (time 0, week 16, week 32): Electrolytes, liver function tests,&#xD;
           fasting glucose, lipid panel and insulin levels will be measured by Quest labs. PAI-1&#xD;
           will be measured by a colorimetric assay (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Homocysteine,&#xD;
           fibrinogen, hsCRP and ICAM-1 will be assayed by the UCSF clinical laboratory using&#xD;
           standard analytical methods. Commercial kits will be used to measure fasting serum&#xD;
           non-esterified fatty acids (Wako Diagnostics kit ;Richmond Virginia); serum TNF-α ,&#xD;
           IL-6, adiponectin and leptin (Quantikine HS high sensitivity ELISA ;R &amp; D Systems,&#xD;
           Minneapolis, MN&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Systemic oxidative stress (time 0, weeks 16, 32): we will measure 4 serum markers of&#xD;
           oxidative stress; protein carbonyls (a product of protein oxidation), TBARS (a&#xD;
           measurement of lipid peroxidation), TRAP (a measure of total antioxidant activity), and&#xD;
           isoprostanes (formed from the peroxidation of arachidonic acid in lipoproteins and&#xD;
           membranes). Blood samples will be drawn in the fasted state both at initial screening&#xD;
           and after ALA treatment. Protein carbonyls, TBARS, and TRAP will be performed at UC&#xD;
           Davis Clinical Laboratories employing standard techniques. Serum 8-isoprostane-F2α will&#xD;
           be measured by KRONOS Science laboratory, Phoenix Arizona. We will also measure urine&#xD;
           markers of oxidative stress before and after CRLA treatment. These will include&#xD;
           8-isoprostane-F2α, and 8-hydroxy guanosine (a marker of oxidized DNA). These urine&#xD;
           assays will be performed KRONOS Science laboratory, Phoenix Arizona and Dr Jack Roberts,&#xD;
           Vanderbilt University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Telomere assessment. The length of telomeres, the DNA caps at the ends of chromosomes,&#xD;
           is emerging as an indicator of stress-related biological aging: Data have implicated&#xD;
           accelerated telomere shortening in the context of increased psychological stress and&#xD;
           stress arousal [10, 11]Blood drawn by a licensed phlebotomist (4 mL for telomere&#xD;
           assessment) at baseline (0 weeks) and 16-weeks will be assayed for telomere length.&#xD;
           Samples will be frozen and transferred on dry ice to the Blackburn Laboratory at UCSF,&#xD;
           located at 600 16th Street, San Francisco, California, by a laboratory technician.&#xD;
           Assays will be completed according to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method..&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 24 hr urine collections . collections as per clinical protocol. We will measure volume,&#xD;
           Na, K, pH, creatinine and calcium&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reproductive testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will undergo assessment of 1)SHBG and androgen levels: total testosterone,&#xD;
           androstenedione and DHEAS; 2) clinical hyperandrogenism: hirsutism by modified&#xD;
           Ferriman-Gallwey and acne scores; 3) menstrual cyclicity (cycle interval and pattern);&#xD;
           and 4) ovarian morphology (follicle count and ovarian volume).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Androgen levels (times 0, weeks 16, 32): Two serum samples will be obtained 30 minutes&#xD;
           apart.. Serum will be isolated and aliquoted for future analysis of androstenedione (A),&#xD;
           testosterone (T), DHEAS, 17 hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and SHBG.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical hyperandrogenism: The presence and extent of hirsutism will be determined using&#xD;
           a modification of the Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) scoring method[12] while acne will be scored&#xD;
           according to the American Academy of Dermatology .Subjects will be requested to avoid&#xD;
           any mechanical treatment for hair removal for 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit and to&#xD;
           list all such treatments that are utilized during the study and their frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Menstrual cyclicity: Menstrual frequency will be assessed as a menstrual frequency ratio&#xD;
           as described by Elkind-Hirsch [13]so that menstrual events are normalized to the normal&#xD;
           interval of 12 menses per year (MFR=1.0) or, for instance, those with 6 cycles per year&#xD;
           would have an MFR of 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ovarian morphology: All subjects will undergo a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to obtain&#xD;
           an antral follicle count at baseline, 8 and 16 weeks. The study investigator will image&#xD;
           both the left and right adnexal areas in two planes, and make measurements of the&#xD;
           transverse, longitudinal, and anteroposterior diameters of each ovary using electronic&#xD;
           calipers on a Shimadzu SDU-450XL machine with a variable 4-8 mHz vaginal transducer. The&#xD;
           examination of each adnexa will ensure an adequate opportunity to locate the organs.&#xD;
           Inability to locate adnexa in this age group is less than 1% (internal data). All&#xD;
           echo-free structures in the ovaries will be regarded as follicles. Follicles with a mean&#xD;
           diameter (of two dimensions) between 2 and 10 mm will be counted. Calculation of all&#xD;
           follicles (2-10mm), as well as those 2- 5mm, will be possible as these numbers will be&#xD;
           recorded separately. The total between the two ovaries (2- 10mm) will be considered the&#xD;
           AFC. The volume of each ovary will be calculated by measuring the three perpendicular&#xD;
           diameters and applying the formula for an ellipsoid: (L x H x W x π/6). Data will be&#xD;
           entered directly onto scannable datasheets. Examination will also determine whether&#xD;
           cysts/other abnormalities exist and provide images to document number and type of&#xD;
           abnormalities. Clinical alerts will be generated for ovarian cysts of greater than 3cm&#xD;
           diameter or solid adnexal masses of any size. Dr. Huddleston will be responsible for&#xD;
           relaying information about clinical alerts to patients and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Body composition: Total body water (TBW) and extracellular water (ECW) volumes will be&#xD;
           determined by bioimpedance spectroscopy (Intermed Inc, Melbourne Australia) at baseline,&#xD;
           16 and 32 weeks. Subjects will also be weighed at each visit. We will also do waist and&#xD;
           hip measurements at baseline, 16 and 32 weeks .&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR): These will be measured at each visit in the&#xD;
           morning after 10 minutes of rest in the sitting position using an automated&#xD;
           oscillometric device (Dinamap, Critikon Inc) programmed to obtain 3 readings within 3&#xD;
           minutes, and then will calculate average daily pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      j. Questionnaires: Participants will complete the following questionnaires per the schedule&#xD;
      specified in Table 1. Questionnaires tap psychological experience, health and eating&#xD;
      behavior, and adherence.&#xD;
