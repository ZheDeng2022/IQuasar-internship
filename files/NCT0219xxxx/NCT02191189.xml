             for AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) or other sexually transmitted disease or&#xD;
             hepatitis. This will be achieved by the use of a card (similar to that used by the&#xD;
             National Blood Transfusion Service), which asks a potential subject if they have&#xD;
             reason to believe that they may fall into any category included on the card. If the&#xD;
             verbal answer is in the affirmative then they will be excluded from the study.&#xD;

          -  Positive hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HIV test results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving prohibited medication. Subjects must not stop taking a prescribed&#xD;

             any other reason&#xD;
&#xD;
        As a precaution, male subjects will be instructed to use appropriate barrier method&#xD;
        contraception (e.g. condoms and spermicide) during the time interval between taking the&#xD;
        first dose and three months following the last dose. Subjects will be advised to inform&#xD;
        Pharmaceutical Profiles if their partner becomes pregnant within three months of them&#xD;
        receiving the last dose of the study drug. Pharmaceutical Profiles will monitor the&#xD;
        pregnancy to conclusion.&#xD;
