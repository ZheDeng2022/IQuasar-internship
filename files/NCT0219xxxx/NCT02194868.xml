    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm that invariant NKT lymphocytes (iNKT) reconstitution&#xD;
      in recipient and in the graft content can predict the outcome of human allogeneic HSCT and to&#xD;
      set up an algorithm for clinical practice that would allow the prediction of acute GVHD risk&#xD;
      according to the quantity and functionality&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative treatment&#xD;
      in most haematological malignancies. However, its anti-tumor effect (GVT) is often associated&#xD;
      with the development of a graft versus host disease (GVHD) and impaired immune&#xD;
      anti-infectious responses. The predictive and protective features of iNKT cells on the&#xD;
      development of acute GVHD (aGVHD) are not or poorly known in humans and their mechanisms of&#xD;
      action, in particular their potential interactions with the other regulatory effectors and&#xD;
      immune actors of the allogeneic response, remain to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project aims, first, to show that the post-transplant reconstitution and/or the content&#xD;
      of the graft in some immunoregulatory T lymphocytes can early predict the post-transplant&#xD;
      clinical outcome and, second, to explore the underlying immunological mechanisms. For that,&#xD;
      we propose to analyse, in homogeneous cohorts of allografted patients and their donors, the&#xD;
      levels of iNKT cells and other cell populations implicated in the allogeneic immune response&#xD;
      (Tregs, mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, delta gammaT and anti-viral specific T&#xD;
      cells) and correlate the results to the post-transplant outcome (GVHD, infections, relapse,&#xD;
      survival). This study will be performed in a cohort of 80 adult allografted patients in four&#xD;
      transplant departments in Paris (hospitals of Necker, Saint Antoine, Saint Louis and La Pitié&#xD;
      Salpétrière) and in a cohort of 60 allografted paediatric patients (Robert Debré hospital in&#xD;
      Paris). Sequential blood samples of patients will be drawn to monitor the immune&#xD;
      reconstitution of the different lymphocyte populations of interest by flow cytometry and&#xD;
      perform functional studies on iNKT (ex vivo expansion capacities and cytokine production).&#xD;
      These analyses will be also performed in the corresponding donors from blood samples&#xD;
      collected before the collection process and from the grafts (obtained by the cell therapy&#xD;
      departments of Necker, La Pitié Salpétrière and Saint Louis hospitals). In addition, we plan&#xD;
      to analyse the effect of, and the mechanisms by which, human cluster of differentiation 4&#xD;
      (CD4) CD4- and CD4+ iNKT cells might control the allogeneic response in vitro, particularly&#xD;
      via their potential interactions with dendritic cells and Tregs. According to the results of&#xD;
      the mechanistic studies, we will test the effect of human subtypes of iNKT cells on the&#xD;
      GVH/GVL affects in a preclinical humanized mouse model of allogeneic HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical and biological data will be anonymously entered in the electronic case report by&#xD;
      the investigators up to 3 years post transplant.&#xD;
