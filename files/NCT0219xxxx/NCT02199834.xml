      In this project, the investigators hypothesize that in an integrated, multifaceted,&#xD;
      team-based program incorporating comprehensive assessment with risk stratification, diabetic&#xD;
      patients with high risk of negative emotions and hospitalization will benefit from additional&#xD;
      peer support which will improve their psychological health, cardio-metabolic control,&#xD;
      self-management, quality of life and reduce hospitalization. The investigators further&#xD;
      hypothesize that peer support will interact with regular personalized feedback reporting to&#xD;
      improve clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes self-management is often emotionally and physically taxing, demanding lifelong&#xD;
      commitment to medication adherence and lifestyle modification. People with diabetes have to&#xD;
      be well-educated and supported to make clinical decisions in their daily living. However,&#xD;
      most diabetes self-management education (DSME) interventions are short-term and have little&#xD;
      external support. In order to empower patients to self-manage over a lifetime after the&#xD;
      initial DSME, ongoing multidisciplinary programs which coordinates individual components of&#xD;
      care into a structured system and further supported by reinforcement through multiple&#xD;
      contacts are necessary to provide practical tips as well as social and psychological support&#xD;
      to diabetic patients, so as to sustain behavioral changes and improve metabolic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these principles, the Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Program was developed in&#xD;
      2007 as a quality improvement initiative to deliver technologically integrated and&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team-based care. It is enabled by a web-based portal containing templates&#xD;
      which guide care providers in providing standardized comprehensive assessments, the results&#xD;
      of which are then used for personalized risk stratification and feedback reports. The&#xD;
      personalized feedback report contains the patient's risk category according to the JADE&#xD;
      definition, with visual displays of important trends including those of glycated haemoglobin&#xD;
      (HbA1c), blood pressure (BP), low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), and practical suggestions to help the individual to reach multiple treatment&#xD;
      targets based on the latest values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, according to a recent WHO consultation report, peer support intervention&#xD;
      is considered to have enormous potential to improve self-management in patients with chronic&#xD;
      disease. Programs using peer supporters to teach and support their peers with diabetes have&#xD;
      shown significant reductions in HbA1c, enhanced self-efficacy, improved health status and&#xD;
      better self-management behaviors. In our previous study, we found that a combined program&#xD;
      which integrates structured care, peer support and clinical decision support by regular&#xD;
      follow up report significantly improved psychological health and medication adherence of&#xD;
      diabetic patients, and reduced hospitalization of patients with negative emotions like&#xD;
      depression, distress, and anxiety, who were most likely to suffer from chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      or poor glycemic control. In this program, we hypothesize that using a multifaceted program&#xD;
      which incorporates structured care, personalized feedback reporting, and peer support to&#xD;
      influence and motivate diabetic patients with high risk of hospitalization and negative&#xD;
      emotions on diabetes self-management, will further improve their self-management,&#xD;
      psychological health and metabolic control, and reduce hospitalization. We further&#xD;
      hypothesize that receiving personalized feedback report with decision support will improve&#xD;
      glycemic control and reduce hospitalization in patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 286 patients with high risk of negative emotion and hospitalization will be invited to&#xD;
      join the peer support program. We anticipate that half of the patients will agree (n=143) and&#xD;
      be assigned 24 peer supporters on a 5~6:1 ratio. Peer supporters are patients who have good&#xD;
      glycemic control and self-care and trained to provide both informational and emotional&#xD;
      support to the peer group. For patients who decline to participate, they will be identified&#xD;
      as refused peer group and their reasons for declining will be documented. Half of the&#xD;
      patients in each group will be randomized to receive 2 personalized feedback reports through&#xD;
      the mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1200 adult patients consecutively enrolled in JADE program will be recruited and half of them&#xD;
      (n=600) will be randomized to receive a personalized feedback report twice a year. All&#xD;
      patients will be followed up at their usual clinics and will be observed for at least 1 year&#xD;
      when we shall evaluate the effects of providing regular personalized report on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes including metabolic control and hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the independent effects of peer support , we further used a case-control design&#xD;
      to. Within the 1200 patients who were not offered peer support, a group of patients who met&#xD;
      the criteria of &quot;high risk&quot; were matched to those agreed to receive peer support on a 3:1&#xD;
      basis by age, gender, diabetes duration, and baseline HbA1c as a control group. Data of&#xD;
      metabolic control and hospitalization of the control group were retrieved from the CMS and&#xD;
      compared to that of the peer group after 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the effect of regular personalized feedback reports to patients with diabetes&#xD;
           managed within an integrated care program on hospitalization and metabolic control,&#xD;
           irrespective of their risk levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the feasibility of using trained diabetes patients (peer supporters) to assist&#xD;
           diabetes educators in diabetes management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the acceptability of peer support in a real life setting and the effects of&#xD;
           non-participation in peer support program on clinical outcomes including hospitalization&#xD;
           and glycemic control in high risk patients for negative emotions and multiple risk&#xD;
           factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study the independent and interactive effects of peer support and regular&#xD;
           personalized feedback report on cardio-metabolic risk factor control, psychological&#xD;
           health, self-efficacy, self-management, quality of life and hospitalization rates in&#xD;
           patients with diabetes at high risk for negative emotions and multiple risk factors.&#xD;
