  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, single-dose, sequential-cohort trial in&#xD;
      subjects with renal impairment and healthy subjects. The study consists of two phases: A&#xD;
      Pretreatment Phase and a Treatment Phase. The two periods in the Pretreatment Phase are: (1)&#xD;
      the Screening Period (lasting up to 29 days), and (2) the Baseline Period (one day). The&#xD;
      Treatment Period of the Treatment Phase lasts 8 days. The study will enroll a sufficient&#xD;
      number of subjects so that 24 to 26 subjects complete the study. This will include six&#xD;
      subjects with mild renal impairment (Group 1), six subjects with moderate renal impairment&#xD;
      (Group 2), four to six subjects with severe renal impairment (Group 3) and eight subjects&#xD;
      with normal renal function (Group 4). Subjects determined to be eligible for the protocol&#xD;
      will receive a single 24-mg oral dose of E7080 on Day 1. Subjects will be discharged from&#xD;
      clinical site on Day 8.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects should meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subjects, ages 18 to 79, inclusive, at the time of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. BMI, 18 to 40 kg/m2, inclusive, at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Nonsmokers and smokers who smoke no more than 10 cigarettes per day&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All females must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25&#xD;
             IU/L or equivalent units of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG] at the Screening&#xD;
             Visit or within 72 hours before the first dose of study drug). Females of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential, if not practicing total abstinence or having a vasectomised&#xD;
             partner with confirmed azoospermia, must agree to use two highly effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception: e.g., 1) an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); 2)&#xD;
             a barrier method such as a condom or occlusive cup (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps)&#xD;
             plus spermicide (foam, gel, cream, etc.); 3) oral, injected, or implanted hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug&#xD;
             discontinuation. Use of a double-barrier method (i.e., use at the same time of a&#xD;
             condom plus occlusive cup [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] plus spermicide [foam,&#xD;
             gel, cream, etc.]) is accepted as two highly effective methods of contraception. The&#xD;
             only subjects who will be exempt from this requirement are postmenopausal women&#xD;
             (defined as women who have been amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the&#xD;
             appropriate age group, without other known or suspected primary cause) or subjects who&#xD;
             have been sterilized surgically or who are otherwise proven sterile (i.e., bilateral&#xD;
             tubal ligation with surgery at least 1 month prior to dosing, total hysterectomy, or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy with surgery at least 1 month prior to dosing). All women who&#xD;
             are of reproductive potential and who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been&#xD;
             on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30&#xD;
             days after study drug discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Male subjects who are partners of women of childbearing potential must use a condom&#xD;
             plus spermicide and their female partners if of childbearing potential must use a&#xD;
             highly effective method of contraception (see methods described in Inclusion Criterion&#xD;
             No. 4) beginning at least one menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug, throughout&#xD;
             the entire study period, and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug, unless the&#xD;
             male subjects are totally sexually abstinent or have undergone a successful vasectomy&#xD;
             with confirmed azoospermia or unless the female partners have been sterilized&#xD;
             surgically or are otherwise proven sterile (see Inclusion Criterion No.4).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Voluntary agreement to provide written informed consent and the willingness and&#xD;
             ability to comply with all aspects of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For healthy subjects with normal renal function the following key inclusion criterion will&#xD;
        also apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 90 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For subjects with renal impairment, the following key inclusion criteria will also apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have a diagnosis of renal impairment that has been stable, without any&#xD;
             change in disease status, for 60 days prior to study screening, as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Mild (creatinine clearance, 60-89 mL/min), moderate (creatinine clearance, 30-59&#xD;
             mL/min), or severe (creatinine clearance, 15-29 mL/min) renal impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Other than renal impairment, subjects must have no history of clinically relevant&#xD;
             disease or condition (e.g., significant cardiac or hepatic dysfunction, diseases of&#xD;
             the gastrointestinal tract or conditions which may impact drug absorption), as&#xD;
             determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with a history of Type I or Type II diabetes are permissible, providing that,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, they have stable disease. Subjects receiving&#xD;
             insulin therapy are permissible provided that they have been on a stable treatment for&#xD;
             at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment and continuing through the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) calculated by Fridericia's formula (QTcF)&#xD;
             interval lesser than or equal to 500 msec at Screening and Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects may be enrolled with joint approval of the principal investigator (PI) and&#xD;
             medical monitor based on subject history and stability of the renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             paracetamol or ibuprofen within 14 days and any local anesthetic within 3 days before&#xD;
             study drug administration. Current over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and prescription&#xD;
             medication use is permitted, but must be stable and consistent for at least 14 days&#xD;
             prior to Screening and throughout the study treatment period.&#xD;
