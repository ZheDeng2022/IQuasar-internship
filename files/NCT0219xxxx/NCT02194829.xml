      This partially randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of WEE1&#xD;
      inhibitor MK-1775 when given together with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle&#xD;
      formulation and gemcitabine hydrochloride and how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated pancreatic cancer that has spread to another place in the body or cannot&#xD;
      be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized&#xD;
      nanoparticle formulation and gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel&#xD;
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and gemcitabine hydrochloride are more effective&#xD;
      with or without WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 in treating patients with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicity of combination therapy with nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel&#xD;
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation), gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and&#xD;
      AZD1775 (WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775) in patients with treatment-naive metastatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      of the pancreas or locally-advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas which is not surgically&#xD;
      resectable. (Phase I) II. To determine the dose of AZD1775 to be used in combination with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine chemotherapy in the phase II portion of the trial. (Phase I)&#xD;
      III. To determine the pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and&#xD;
      gemcitabine. (Phase I) IV. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) associated with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/placebo or nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/AZD1775 in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate overall survival (OS) associated with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/placebo or&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/AZD1775 in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      pancreas. (Phase II) II. To evaluate response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response&#xD;
      [PR]) associated with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/placebo or&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/AZD1775 in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      pancreas. (Phase II) III. To evaluate disease control rate (CR + PR + stable disease [SD])&#xD;
      associated with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/placebo or nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/AZD1775 in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the ability of AZD1775 to inhibit Wee1 and increase deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (DNA) damage and tumor cell death when combined with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine compared to&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/placebo. (Phase II) II. To evaluate if biomarker changes in tumor&#xD;
      tissue associated with Wee1 inhibition may also be present in hair follicles. (Phase II) III.&#xD;
      To evaluate the change in tumor fludeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake (maximum standardized uptake&#xD;
      value [SUVmax]) between baseline FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) and week 4 FDG-PET as&#xD;
      a predictor of response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) as the&#xD;
      reference standard for response. (Phase II) IV. To evaluate the change in tumor FDG uptake&#xD;
      (SUVmax) between baseline FDG-PET and week 4 FDG-PET as a predictor of progression-free&#xD;
      survival. (Phase II) V. To compare the change in tumor FDG uptake (SUVmax) between baseline&#xD;
      FDG-PET and week 4 FDG-PET between the patients from treatment arms C and D. (Phase II) VI.&#xD;
      To evaluate if an early increase in tumor fluorothymidine (FLT) uptake (FLT-flare) is&#xD;
      observed within 24 hours after initiation of treatment with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/placebo. (Phase II) VII. To evaluate if an early (within 24 hours&#xD;
      [h]) increase in tumor FLT uptake (FLT-flare) is abrogated after initiation of treatment with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/AZD1775. (Phase II) VIII. To compare the change in tumor FLT&#xD;
      uptake (SUVmax) from baseline to 24 hours after initiation of treatment between the patients&#xD;
      from treatment arms C and D. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 followed by a&#xD;
      randomized phase II study. Patients in phase I are assigned to arm A or B and patients in&#xD;
      phase II are randomized to arm C or D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A (PHASE I, DOSE LEVEL 1): Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle&#xD;
      formulation intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 orally (PO) daily&#xD;
      on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B (PHASE I, DOSE LEVEL 2): Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle&#xD;
      formulation, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 as in Arm A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C (PHASE II, PLACEBO): Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle&#xD;
      formulation and gemcitabine hydrochloride as in Arm A. Patients also receive placebo PO daily&#xD;
      on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM D (PHASE II, WEE1 INHIBITOR MK-1775): Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized&#xD;
      nanoparticle formulation, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 as in Arm A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
