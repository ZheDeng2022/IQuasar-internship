    <measure>Part A and B: Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent AEs (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, Severe TEAEs, Drug-Related TEAEs, and TEAEs Leading to Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to the end of follow-up (4 weeks after the last dose of study drug; up to approximately 1371 days)</time_frame>
    <description>AEs were analyzed as one group combined for parts A and B per planned analysis. An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Severe AE=prevents normal daily activities. Drug-related TEAEs: TEAEs with possible, probable, or definite relationship to study drug. Serious AEs: death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. A treatment-emergent AE was defined as an AE that began after the first administration of study medication or existing AEs that worsened after the first dose of study medication. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

    <measure>Part A: Percentage of Participants Who Were a Treatment Success, Based on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 145</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment success was defined as much or very much improved on the CGIC from baseline of this study. The CGIC is a single-item questionnaire that asks the investigator to assess a participant's TD symptoms at specific visits/weeks after initiating therapy. The CGIC uses a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from -3 to +3 (-3 = very much worse, -2 = much worse, -1 = minimally worse, 0 = not changed, 1 = minimally improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = very much improved), to assess overall response to therapy.</description>

    <description>The CDQ-24 is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire developed for use in participants with craniocervical dystonia, including both cervical dystonia (CD) and blepharospasm (BPS). The CDQ-24 was modified such that the questions focus more directly on the impact of TD (as opposed to CD/BPS) on quality of life. The following domains were evaluated in the mCDQ-24: stigma, emotional well-being, pain, activities of daily living, and social/family life. Each of the 24 questions were rated by participants on a scale of 0 = never or no impairment to 4 = always or very severe impairment. Total score ranged from 0 - 96, with higher score indicative of severe impairment.</description>

          <description>CDQ-24 is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire developed for use in participants with craniocervical dystonia. CDQ-24 was modified such that the questions focus more directly on the impact of TD on quality of life. The following domains were evaluated in mCDQ-24: stigma, emotional well-being, pain, activities of daily living, and social/family life. Each of the 24 questions were rated by participants on a scale of 0 = never or no impairment to 4 = always or very severe impairment. Total score ranged from 0 - 96, with higher score indicative of severe impairment.</description>

        <title>Part A: Change From Baseline in Total Motor AIMS Score at Week 145, as Assessed by the Site Rating</title>
        <description>The AIMS is an assessment tool used to detect and follow the severity of tardive dyskinesia (TD) over time. The AIMS is composed of 12 clinician-administered and -scored items. A total motor score from Items 1 to 7 (orofacial, extremity, and truncal movements) was calculated. Items 1 through 7 included facial and oral movements (Items 1-4), extremity movements (Items 5-6), and trunk movements (Item 7). Each item was rated on a 5-point anchored scale ranging from 0 (no dyskinesia) to 4 (severe dyskinesia). Total motor AIMS score for Items 1-7 ranged from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicative of more severe dyskinesia.</description>

        <title>Part A: Change From Baseline in AIMS Items 8, 9, and 10 Score at Week 145, as Assessed by the Site Rating</title>
        <description>The AIMS is an assessment tool used to detect and follow the severity of TD over time. The AIMS is composed of 12 clinician-administered and -scored items. Items 8 to 10 deal with global severity as judged by the examiner, and the participant's awareness of the movements and the distress associated with them. Item 8 (used as an overall severity index indicating severity of abnormal movements) was rated on a 5-point anchored scale ranging from 0 (no dyskinetic movements) to 4 (severe dyskinetic movements). Items 9 and 10 (provide additional information with regard to participant's incapacitation due to abnormal movements and participant's awareness of abnormal movements) were rated on a 5-point anchored scale ranging from 0 (none or no awareness) to 4 (severe or aware, severe distress). Higher scores indicated more severe disease.</description>

        <description>The CDQ-24 is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire developed for use in participants with craniocervical dystonia, including both cervical dystonia (CD) and blepharospasm (BPS). The CDQ-24 was modified such that the questions focus more directly on the impact of TD (as opposed to CD/BPS) on quality of life. The following domains were evaluated in the mCDQ-24: stigma, emotional well-being, pain, activities of daily living, and social/family life. Each of the 24 questions were rated by participants on a scale of 0 = never or no impairment to 4 = always or very severe impairment. Total score ranged from 0 - 96, with higher score indicative of severe impairment.</description>
