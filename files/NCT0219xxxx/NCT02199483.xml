      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Many people can lose weight by changing their diet or exercise. However, most people&#xD;
      eventually regain the weight over time. This weight regain may be related to changes in&#xD;
      metabolism as well as changes in the brain caused by weight loss. Researchers want to learn&#xD;
      more about these changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see how weight loss and regain affects the body s metabolism and the brain of obese but&#xD;
      healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Obese but healthy adults age 18-55 who plan to participate in a weight loss program at one&#xD;
      of several participating clinics or resorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will first be screened at home through questionnaires and telephone&#xD;
           interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then be screened at the NIH with blood tests, medical history,&#xD;
           physical exam, electrocardiograms, and questionnaires. They will have a mock magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging (MRI) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visit 1, participants will stay at the NIH and will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have MRI and PET brain scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have body composition scans and measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  give blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  eat a special diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  wear a physical activity monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  provide a urine sample and body weight daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  drink a special type of water to measure calorie burn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  wear a clear plastic hood over their head while lying down, to collect exhaled air.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  spend 24 hours in a room that measures oxygen and carbon dioxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete questionnaires and computer tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After visit 1, participants will give daily urine samples and weight and physical&#xD;
           activity measurements from home. Then they will follow a lifestyle intervention for&#xD;
           weight loss and give daily weight and activity measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits 2, 3, and 4 occur 1-26 months after the start of the weight loss program.&#xD;
           Participants will repeat procedures from visit 1. Visits 1-4 last 4 days each.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will track participants weight and physical activity for up to 26 months&#xD;
           after visit 2.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lifestyle interventions can result in weight loss, but most people experience a plateau after&#xD;
      6-10 months when weight stabilizes and many subsequently regain weight over the subsequent&#xD;
      months. This pattern of weight plateau and regain is typical and appears to be independent of&#xD;
      the lifestyle intervention used. The apparent resistance to further weight loss in not well&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently demonstrated that participants engaged in an intensive intervention employing&#xD;
      caloric restriction and vigorous exercise had a profound slowing of metabolism that was&#xD;
      significantly greater than expected due to weight loss alone. This phenomenon is called&#xD;
      metabolic adaptation and has also been observed following weight loss through caloric&#xD;
      restriction without exercise and may persist long after weight loss has ceased. Metabolic&#xD;
      adaptation has been hypothesized to limit weight loss and predispose individuals to weight&#xD;
      regain, but this has yet to be demonstrated and the concept is controversial. In addition to&#xD;
      the metabolic adaptations to weight loss, the brain also adapts in ways that enhance the&#xD;
      activation of reward regions in response to palatable food cues and their receipt. In&#xD;
      particular, the brain s dopamine circuitry is believed to be altered in obesity and it is&#xD;
      presently unclear how this pathway responds to a weight loss intervention in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of this study are to investigate the metabolic and neural adaptations in 60&#xD;
      obese adult volunteers participating in lifestyle interventions resulting in weight loss&#xD;
      through a structured meal replacement program or caloric restriction plus vigorous exercise.&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to determine whether the magnitude of metabolic adaptation or the&#xD;
      changes in the brain s reward circuitry or responsiveness to food cues are related to the&#xD;
      ubiquitous weight loss plateau after 6-10 months or the rate of weight regain in the&#xD;
      subsequent months.&#xD;
