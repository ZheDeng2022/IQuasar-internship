    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effect of an anthocyanin-rich blood orange juice with a&#xD;
      standard (no anthocyanin) blonde orange juice on markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants aged between 25 and 84 years of age will be recruited into a single arm, two way&#xD;
      cross-over study based on their waist measurement, with 42 individuals required to complete&#xD;
      the study. Participants will each receive two interventions in a randomised order: 500mL&#xD;
      blood orange juice daily for 28 days, and 500ml standard (blonde) orange juice daily for 28&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to each intervention there will be a 2 week &quot;run in period&quot; where participants will be&#xD;
      asked to avoid consuming foods rich in anthocyanins. After the first 28 day intervention&#xD;
      period, there will be a 3 week wash out period after which the participants will be asked to&#xD;
      then drink the other juice for 28 days. The 500 mL of blood orange juice contains&#xD;
      approximately 50mg of anthocyanins, whereas the standard juice contains none.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected for the preparation of plasma and peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for the analysis of anthocyanin metabolite concentrations,&#xD;
      transcriptomics and CVD risk markers. Urine samples will be collected and urinary excretion&#xD;
      of anthocyanin metabolites will be quantified. Other measurements will include pulse wave&#xD;
      analysis, pulse wave velocity, central blood pressure, waist and hip circumference, blood&#xD;
      glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) and insulin concentrations, and various measurements&#xD;
      using the TANITA machine which include weight, fat mass, muscle mass, fat percentage,&#xD;
      fat-free mass, total body water, bone mass, metabolic age, basal metabolic rate, visceral fat&#xD;
      rating, and degree of obesity. All measurements and samples will be taken at baseline and&#xD;
      post intervention for each phase of the study.&#xD;
