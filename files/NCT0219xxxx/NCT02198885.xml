  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NanoMaxx Ultrasound System (SonoSite) in connection with the RP-Xpress (InTouch&#xD;
      Technologies) provides a means of transmitting ultrasound images, video, and audio to a&#xD;
      remote location in real-time. It has been envisioned that this system be used to diagnose&#xD;
      trauma patients with suspected pleural effusion, hemothorax, pneumothorax, or abdominal&#xD;
      blockage during prehospital care; under the guidance of in-hospital physicians, paramedics&#xD;
      would perform an Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) examination while&#xD;
      trauma patients are transported to hospital via ambulance. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      in-hospital physicians interpreting ultrasound images obtained by paramedics during trauma&#xD;
      patients' transportation to hospital will reduce time to diagnosis; thus, preparations by&#xD;
      emergency physicians, surgeons, and operating room teams to receive critically injured&#xD;
      patients may begin earlier, reducing time to intervention during a critical period in patient&#xD;
      care. Data will also be collected regarding quality of images obtained in-ambulance and the&#xD;
      interaction between paramedics and physicians using the remote-presence system.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient being transported by a paramedic who has received training in the above&#xD;
             ultrasound system and who has with them a NanoMaxx Ultrasound System (SonoSite) to be&#xD;

             paramedic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's care will not be compromised in completing a FAST exam - opinion of ER&#xD;
             physician&#xD;
