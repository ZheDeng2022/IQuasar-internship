  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the pathophysiological process of coronary artery disease (CAD), are present, autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction and reduced functional capacity. Studies showed that physical training (PT) is&#xD;
      critical in the treatment of CAD by promoting beneficial effects. Although water based&#xD;
      exercises program have been documented in patients with various cardiovascular diseases, the&#xD;
      most of studies among patients with CAD used land based exercises programs. OBJECTIVE: To&#xD;
      evaluate and compare the effects of aerobic water (WPT) and land (LPT) based PT on autonomic&#xD;
      modulation of heart rate (HR), body composition and cardiorespiratory and metabolic variables&#xD;
      in patients with CAD. METHODS : 40 men between 50 and 70 years old with CAD diagnosed by&#xD;
      coronary angiography showing obstruction greater than 50% and underwent angioplasty will be&#xD;
      evaluated in 4 stages; 1) immediately after angioplasty, clinical assessment, body&#xD;
      composition analysis and recording of HR and NN intervals during rest. 2) The components of&#xD;
      step 1) will be repeated after three month, adding the record of HR and NN before, during and&#xD;
      after the Valsalva maneuver, spirometry and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. 3) Volunteers&#xD;
      will be randomly divided into two groups, WPT and LPT for 48 sessions. 4) The components of&#xD;
      step 2) are repeated after each period of 12 sessions. Thus, it is expected that WPT promote&#xD;
      beneficial physiological adaptations in CAD patients with obstruction greater than 50%.&#xD;

      1. Immediately after angioplasty, the volunteers will be subject to an assessment&#xD;
           (Assessment 0), which will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History: personal data, lifestyle and food, family history, current and previous&#xD;
                history of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical examination: cardiac and lung auscultation,measurement of heart rate (HR),&#xD;
                blood pressure (BP), body weight and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Analysis of body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Registration of HR and NN intervals (NN) during rest, in the supine and sitting&#xD;
                positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  biochemical blood tests: complete blood count, blood glucose, total cholesterol,&#xD;
                LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein ultrasensitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recording of HR and NN during rest in the supine position, sitting, standing and&#xD;
                during respiratory sinus arrhythmia maneuver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Three months after the &quot;Assessment 0&quot;, the volunteers will be subject to an assessment&#xD;
           (initial Assessment) prior to physical training program. Will be repeated all&#xD;
           assessments performed in the &quot;Assessment 0&quot; plus the record of HR and R-Ri before,&#xD;
           during and after the Valsalva maneuver, spirometry and cardiopulmonary exercise test&#xD;
           (CPET). This is a submaximal CPET performed on a treadmill, in order to verify and&#xD;
           identify possible changes in hemodynamic, electrocardiographic induced to physical&#xD;
           exertion, their aerobic functional capacity as well as to prescribe physical training&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After this assessment, the volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of two groups,&#xD;
           aerobic water (WPT) or land (LPT) based physical training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Components of &quot;Initial Assessment&quot; will be repeated at the end of each month of physical&#xD;
           training (Revaluation 1, 2 and 3) and the end (Final Assessment).&#xD;
