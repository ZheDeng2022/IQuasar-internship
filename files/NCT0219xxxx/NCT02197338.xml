      1. Cannulation of (placement of a small catheter into) the bile duct is critical to remove&#xD;
           bile duct stones, divert bile leaks, and decompress biliary obstruction due to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Given the small size of the bile duct orifice and its close proximity to the pancreatic&#xD;
           duct, selective biliary cannulation is the most difficult part of the endoscopic&#xD;
           retrograde cholangiography (ERCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. New small diameter sphincteromes and &quot;short wire&quot; systems (which allow physicians to&#xD;

      1.0 BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bile duct access is the most difficult part of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP)&#xD;
      performed for the biliary indications of bile duct stones, leak, and stricture. In the past&#xD;
      decade there has been an evolution in the technology and approach used to achieve selective&#xD;
      biliary cannulation, In the classic approach a standard cannula is placed into the biliary&#xD;
      orifice and contrast injected to confirm placement. Subsequently, a long wire is passed by&#xD;
      the assistant deeply into the duct and the cannulatome exchange for a sphincterotome which is&#xD;
      used to perform papillotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first major change in cannulation approach has been the widespread use of the&#xD;
      sphincterotome to obtain initial biliary access in lieu of the cannulatome. This is in part&#xD;
      driven by economics. With the advent of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) almost all ERCP is therapeutic and sphincterotomy is&#xD;
      typically part of this approach.1 Thus it is sensible to forgo the step of using the&#xD;
      cannulatome which enables only diagnostic ERCP. In addition to cutting, the wire on the&#xD;
      distal tip of the sphincterotome enables variable flexion in the direction of the bile duct,&#xD;
      a feature lacking for the cannulatome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, high quality comparison trials suggest that the sphincterotome is superior to&#xD;
      the cannulatome for initial access. Schwacha et al prospectively randomized patients to bile&#xD;
      duct cannulation with the standard cannulatome versus the sphincterotome.2 After five&#xD;
      attempts bile duct access was achieved in 62% of those in the standard catheter group&#xD;
      compared to 84% in the sphincterotome group. Cortus et al randomized patients to &lt;15 attempts&#xD;
      to access with bile duct with the cannulatome versus the sphincterotome and found that&#xD;
      initial biliary access was obtained in 67% in the former versus 97% in the latter groups.3 In&#xD;
      addition the mean number of cannulation attempts and time to achieve selective biliary&#xD;
      cannulation was also less in the sphincterotome group. Given these considerations most&#xD;
      American endoscopists use sphincterotomes for initial biliary cannulation.4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most modern sphincterotomes have two to three lumens to enable simulatenous passage of&#xD;
      contrast and wire into the bile duct. Traditionally, contrast was first injected to confirm&#xD;
      that the bile duct as opposed to the pancreatic duct had been accessed. In 2004 Lella&#xD;
      randomized 400 patients to the standard approach of contrast injection versus the passage of&#xD;
      the guidewire to confirm bile duct cannulation.5 In the contrast group 4% of patients&#xD;
      developed pancreatitis compared to none in the wire guided group and high pancreatic enzyme&#xD;
      levels (5 times the upper limit of normal) developed in 20% of contrast guided versus 5% of&#xD;
      wire guided cases. Subsequent large randomized trials have consistently demonstrated post&#xD;
      ERCP pancreatitis rates of 2-9% in wire guided versus 10-17% in contrast guided ERCP.6-7 Wire&#xD;
      guided cannulation has also been shown to shorten cannulation and fluoroscopy times.8&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Additionally, several new technologies have been introduced with potential but unproven&#xD;
      advantages. Traditionally the ERCP wires have been as long as the combination of the scope&#xD;
      channel and accessory length such that an assistant could control placement during the&#xD;
      procedure. Recently, short wire system have been developed in which wires may be stripped out&#xD;
      of catheters with tear away lumens down to the distal most aspect (5-50cm) depending on the&#xD;
      accessory.9 A stripped down sphincterotome accomodates a short wire which can be completely&#xD;
      controlled by the endoscopist enabling physician controlled wire passage. A locking device on&#xD;
      the scope allows the short wire to be fixed reliably during therapeutic maneuvers. The&#xD;
      advantage of the short wire system is that it decreases reliance on an assistant. The&#xD;
      disadvantage is that is may decrease the backpressure on the sphincterotome which may be&#xD;
      achieved based on Newton's third law (pulling the wire back helps advance the tome forward).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been little published work comparing short wire to traditional long wire systems.&#xD;
      Available data suggests trends toward shorter fluoroscopy and procedure times.10&#xD;
      Additionally, the short wire system appears to enable shorter time to bile duct system&#xD;
      placement compared to the long wire system. A recent national survey revealed that 43% of&#xD;
      endoscopists favored the short wire system compared to 33% the long wire system.4&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 An additional technology frequently used to facilitate cannulation are smaller sized&#xD;
      sphincterotomes. Theoretically, these small diameter tomes may enable access into bile duct&#xD;
      with more diminutive orifices. One small randomized trial compared standard 5Fr tomes to 4Fr&#xD;
      tomes. Cannulation in both groups was 84% though the study was prematurely terminated.11&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients in whom biliary access is still not achieved often another type of sphincterotome&#xD;
      or cannulatome will be used. If this does not work a wire or pancreatic stent will often be&#xD;
      placed in the pancreatic duct ideally to change the orientation of the papilla in a favorable&#xD;
      way.12 The latter strategy will also decrease the risk of post ERCP pancreatitis in difficult&#xD;
      cases including those who have undergone multiple cannulation attempts.13 If these approaches&#xD;
      fail an access or precut papillotomy may be performed using a needle knife. Precut&#xD;
      sphincterotomy in the direction of the bile duct can either be performed from the orifice&#xD;
      (gough) or above the orifice (fistulotomy).12, 14&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently both the small and standard tomes are routinely used at LAC. The Rx System can be&#xD;
      converted from long to short wire method using the same device. Both long and short wire&#xD;
      approaches are routinely performed at LAC. There is no standardized approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether initial bile duct cannulation with a 39Fr versus 44Fr sphincterotomes and&#xD;
      the long verus short wire systems favors successful bile duct cannulation and minimizes&#xD;
      complications. This will help to developed an evidence based approach to initial bile duct&#xD;
      access during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 STUDY DESIGN: The study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial. All patients&#xD;
      undergoing ERCP for standard indication including stones, leaks or jaundice will be eligible.&#xD;
      Those who have undergone prior sphincterotomy, which ensures biliary access will be excluded.&#xD;
      Additionally those with prior ERCP and failed bile duct cannulation will be excluded.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients who require ERCP only for pancreatic indications such as pancreatic&#xD;
      duct leak will be exlcluded as bile duct cannulation is not required for clinical&#xD;
      indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized using a 2 x 2 factorial design to initial cannulation attempt&#xD;
      with a small versus standard sphincterotome (1:1) and short versus long wire system (1:1).&#xD;
      The Rx Biliary System (Boston Scientific; Natick, MA) will be used. In those randomized to&#xD;
      the short wire approach, the wire will be stripped from the tear away lumen to convert from a&#xD;
      long to short wire system. The wire will be controlled by the endoscopist &quot;physician&#xD;
      controlled.&quot; In those randomized to the long wire approach the long wire will be left in the&#xD;
      lumen which will not be stripped down. The wire will be controlled by the assistant. Those&#xD;
      randomized to the small sized tome will initially use the 39Fr tome and those randomized to&#xD;
      the standard tome will use the 44Fr tome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all 4 groups initial successful cannulation will be defined as the acquisition of deep&#xD;
      bile duct access within the first 8 attempts. An attempt is defined as the placement of the&#xD;
      cannula into the biliary orifice followed by advancement of the wire or contrast injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At LAC+USC procedures are performed by 2-3 third year fellows who are recognized as&#xD;
      clinically and technically excellent. Fellows at other levels; first year and second year&#xD;
      fellows are not allowed to perform ERCP. All procedures are directly supervised by a faculty&#xD;
      physician who takes over cannulation if the fellow is not successfully after 3-5 attempts.&#xD;
      Faculty physicans perform the procedures alone only under rare circumstances. However, to&#xD;
      account for this possibility randomization will be stratified by 3rd fellow+faculty and&#xD;
      faculty alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To account for variability of assistants we will make certain that the policy that nursing&#xD;
      assistants rotate on monthly basis is enforced which will ensure an even distribution of&#xD;
      technical assistance which reflects the real word scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If biliary cannulation is not achieved after 8 attempts any wire system or sphincterotome&#xD;
      size may be used at the discretion of the attending endoscopist. Thus the assigned tome and&#xD;
      wire approach may be abandoned or continued at the discretion of the faculty member&#xD;
      performing the case. Additionally, pancreatic wire or stent placement or precut&#xD;
      sphincterotomy will be performed at the discretion of the attending endoscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be successful initial bile duct cannulation as defined by&#xD;
      cannulation with the assigned technology within the first 8 attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will include total cannulation and fluoroscopy times, inadvertent,&#xD;
      pancreatic duct access, and ERCP complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who are inpatient will be seen in follow-up on the second procedure day and data&#xD;
      to assess for outcomes will be collected by the study team. They will be called 7 days after&#xD;
      the procedure. Those who are discharged on the day of the procedure will be called 1 day&#xD;
      after the procedure and 7 days after the procedure to assess for these outcomes. Thus all&#xD;
      patients will be assessed either with a follow up visist or phone call at 1 and 7 days post&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2 x 2 factorial design will be used with a 1:1 randomization to 44Fr versus 39Fr tome and&#xD;
      1:1 randomization to long or short wire system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our a priori hypothesis is that there will be a 10% difference in successful initial&#xD;
      cannulation (85% to 95%). At an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.10 a sample size of 498 will be&#xD;
      needed to demonstrate a difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned interim analysis will be performed after 200 patients have been enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rule for stopping are as follows;&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) If significant difference in the primary outcome (cannulation within 8 attempts) is&#xD;
      reached in one arm (wire length or cannulatome size) that arm will be stopped. An interim&#xD;
      test of the effect of administration will be computed to determine the sample size for the&#xD;
      remaining arm with a 2 group design moving forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) If both a superior wire length and cannulatome size strategy (both arms) are demonstrated&#xD;
      after 200 cases the trial will be stopped and reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) If significance is reached in neither arm at 200 cases, then the 4 groups will continue&#xD;
      until the sample size of 500 is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) If significantly more complications including pancreatitis, perforation, bleeding,&#xD;
      cholangitis are seen in one arm (wire length or cannulatome size) that arm will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dichotomous outcomes will be compared using a Fischer's exact or chi squared test and&#xD;
      continuous outcomes will be compared using a Wilcoxan rank sum test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed by biostatisticians at the Biostatistical and&#xD;
      Bioinformatics Resource Group within the SC CTSI.&#xD;
