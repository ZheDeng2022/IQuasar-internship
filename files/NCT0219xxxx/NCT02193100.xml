        Inclusion Criteria for Leukemia Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each of the criteria in the following section must be met in order for a patient to be&#xD;
             eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only patients with clinically diagnosed or histologically diagnosed leukemia will be&#xD;
             eligible to participate in this non-therapeutic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have measurable quantities of leukemic blasts on peripheral blood&#xD;
             detected with a CBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of diabetes for the experimental group or the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hepatitis C or HIV (AIDS) are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and sign and&#xD;
             give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria forHealthy Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have no known prior history of cancer or malignant blood disorders.&#xD;
             -Where possible, follow up will be carried out to verify that no cancer has developed&#xD;
             since the blood collection. This will be done by a phone call performed one month from&#xD;
             sample to ask if new medical conditions have arisen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have WBC, RBC, and platelet counts within normal range on CBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known hepatitis C or HIV (AIDS) are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of Diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 30 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preferably be fasting for 12 hours (minimum 8 hours) prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and sign and&#xD;
             give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
