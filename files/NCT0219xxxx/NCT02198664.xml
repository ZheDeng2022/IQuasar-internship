    <textblock>
      This phase 2, open-label, follow-on, multicenter study was designed to gather additional&#xD;
      information on the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of oral desensitization with AR101 in&#xD;
      subjects who participated in study ARC001 (NCT01987817) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (ARC001 placebo): Subjects who received placebo in study ARC001&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (ARC001 AR101): Subjects who received AR101 and tolerated up to 300 mg peanut&#xD;
           protein (443 mg cumulative) in the DBPCFC at the end of study ARC001&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive daily oral dosing of peanut OIT (oral immunotherapy) in the form of&#xD;
      Characterized Peanut Allergen (CPNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration - 12-90 weeks before reaching the Extended Maintenance Phase. All Subjects may&#xD;
      continue Extended Maintenance Phase until CPNA becomes commercially available or the study is&#xD;
      terminated.&#xD;

        <description>A 100-mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used by the investigators for the Physician Global Assessment of disease activity as a marker for safety. The investigator was to assign a single integrated overall disease activity score ranging from 0 to 100 mm. Zero indicated no disease activity and 100 indicated very severe disease activity.</description>

          <title>Change in Physician Global Assessment, Disease Activity as Measured on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) From Baseline and Up-dosing to Extended Maintenance.</title>
          <description>A 100-mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used by the investigators for the Physician Global Assessment of disease activity as a marker for safety. The investigator was to assign a single integrated overall disease activity score ranging from 0 to 100 mm. Zero indicated no disease activity and 100 indicated very severe disease activity.</description>

      <desc>A multi-page adverse event form was used allowing all adverse events to be submitted through a single reporting mechanism. Study investigators will provide the Coordinating Center with data of all SAEs as defined per the protocol on an ongoing basis, within 24 h of site awareness of the event. The sponsor's Medical Monitor will review each SAE report and will determine whether the SAE must be reported to FDA on an expedited basis.</desc>
