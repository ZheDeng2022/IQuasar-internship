      To investigate the effects of cortisol on alcohol craving and stress reactivity in alcohol&#xD;
      addicted subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, single administration of study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;

      Study hypothesis: Cortisol has an inhibiting effect on alcohol craving and stress reactivity&#xD;
      in alcohol dependent subjects.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol dependence is a chronically and relapsing disorder with major impact on the persons&#xD;
      psychological, physiological and social functioning. There is extensive evidence from animal&#xD;
      and human studies pointing out the important role of addiction memory in the development and&#xD;
      maintenance of the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has proven its high effectiveness in the treatment for&#xD;
      addictive disorders. A core element of CBT are exposure techniques that are comparable to&#xD;
      extinction and habituation learning. The repeated exposure to alcohol related cues in the&#xD;
      absence of alcohol ingestion will lead to extinction of conditioned responses, thus reducing&#xD;
      the probability of relapse to alcohol taking behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that glucocorticoids impair memory retrieval in healthy subjects. In fact,&#xD;
      the investigators could show that cortisol has a fear reducing effect in patients with&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder and in phobic patients, resulting particularly in reduced&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety and in reduced stress reactivity. Interestingly enough, pharmacologically&#xD;
      induced high levels of glucocorticoids lowered the subjective feeling of anxiety and stress&#xD;
      in situations activating per se the HPA-axis. Further it has been shown that the combined&#xD;
      therapy of glucocorticoid administration and exposition based psychotherapy leads to better&#xD;
      therapy outcome in patients with specific phobias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to examine the acute effects of glucocorticoids administration on&#xD;
      alcohol craving and stress reactivity of abstinent alcohol dependent patients. On the basis&#xD;
      of clinical research in anxiety disorders, the investigators expect that a pharmacologically&#xD;
      increased cortisol level may impair the retrieval of addiction memory, which is indicated by&#xD;
      less craving during the alcohol exposition, while exposition therapy enhances consolidation&#xD;
      of corrective experiences. Similar to the research in anxiety patients, the investigators aim&#xD;
      to examine whether cortisol administration could help improve the effects of exposition&#xD;
      therapy in patients with alcohol dependence. The purpose is to decrease therapy duration&#xD;
      through cortisol administration in addition to already well proven therapies and make the&#xD;
      therapy more efficient as well as a factor in reducing healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo two identical experimental sessions between the 6th and 8th week (one week&#xD;
      in between) of their 12-week inpatient treatment program for alcohol dependence. The&#xD;
      experiment takes place in the experimental rooms of the clinic Südhang between 1 and 6 pm.&#xD;
      One hour before the confrontation with alcohol associated stimuli patients receive either&#xD;
      20mg of hydrocortisone or placebo (oral administration). The experiment consists of a&#xD;
      computer based picture task (alcoholic and neutral pictures) and an in-vivo exposure task.&#xD;
      Psychological (craving, stress, arousal) and physiological (heart rate, saliva cortisol)&#xD;
      parameters are repeatedly measured over the course of the experiment.&#xD;
