      Title Staged Bilateral Carpal Tunnel Release: Which Side Hurts More? Primary null hypothesis&#xD;
      Patients undergoing staged bilateral open Carpal Tunnel Release (CTR) have no difference in&#xD;
      overall pain intensity of pain between sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary null hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no correlation in overall pain intensity after open CTR surgery and distal&#xD;
           sensory latency, distal motor latency, electromyography (EMG), demographics, occupation,&#xD;
           avocation, relevant comorbidities, dominance, left vs. right, Pain Self-Efficacy,&#xD;
           Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity or&#xD;
           PROMIS depression when both surgeries are performed within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no difference in satisfaction with treatment at the time of suture removal&#xD;
           after the first and second open CTR surgery when both are performed within 6 months..&#xD;

      Drijkoningen, Braun, Ring Journal: To be discussed Design: Prospective cohort study&#xD;
      Background Many hand surgeons note that patients undergoing staged bilateral open carpal&#xD;
      tunnel release often experience more pain with the second side. The investigator felt this&#xD;
      was an easily testable hypothesis worthy of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 18 or older&#xD;

      Exclude:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant women&#xD;

&#xD;
      Response Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  11-point ordinal measure of overall pain intensity during and after surgery measured at&#xD;
           the time of suture removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  11-point ordinal measure of satisfaction with treatment&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Explanatory Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distal Sensory Latency (DSL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distal Motor Latency (DML)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EMG changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics: age, sex, race, occupation, avocation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time limit between two surgeries &lt; 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relevant comorbidities: Trapeziometacarpal (TMC) arthrosis, ulnar neuropathy, trigger&#xD;
           finger&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Involved hand (Dominance, Side)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First side vs. second side surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROMIS Pain Interference Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain Self Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ-2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROMIS Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The investigator and study staff will invite all adult patients (age 18 and older)&#xD;
      presenting to the Orthopaedic Hand and Upper Extremity Service Department at Massachusetts&#xD;
      General Hospital (MGH) with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome planning staged bilateral carpal&#xD;
      tunnel release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Power analysis An a priori power analysis for matched pairs was performed. To detect&#xD;
      the difference between two dependent means an effect size of 0.5 at alpha of 0.05 and 80%&#xD;
      power, a total sample size of 34 patients is needed.As the investigator expects to have&#xD;
      patients who will be lost to follow-up the investigators will count 10% extra, a total of 38&#xD;
      patients will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate analysis: Variables will be presented with frequencies and percentages for&#xD;
      categorical variables and as mean with standard deviation or median with interquartile range&#xD;
      for respectively normal or non-normal distributed continuous variables. Normality of&#xD;
      continuous distributed variables will be tested a paired T-Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bivariate and multivariable analysis will be performed and subsequently all variables with a&#xD;
      probability &lt; 0.10 in bivariate analysis will be inserted in a backward, stepwise,&#xD;
      multivariable linear regression analysis to assess their ability to explain variation in&#xD;
      outcome. The 11 point Likert Pain scale score is considered significant when there is a&#xD;
      difference of more than 1.4 points (2.8 SD*0.5 effect size)on a scale from 1-10.[9]&#xD;
