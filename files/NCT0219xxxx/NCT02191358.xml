      This multicenter observational study aims to investigate the benefits of providing&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic testing with the YouScript Personalized Prescribing System which includes a&#xD;
      clinical decision support tool and individualized pharmacist recommendations to elderly&#xD;
      polypharmacy patients who are most at risk of adverse drug events. The YouScript system is&#xD;
      unique in identifying drug-gene, and drug-drug-gene interactions that are missed by existing&#xD;
      systems, and represent over 35% of significant interaction warnings. Data analysis will&#xD;
      assess the impact of recommendations for medication changes on clinical decision making,&#xD;
      patient outcomes, and healthcare resource utilization to determine which medications,&#xD;
      specialties, or patient segments derive the greatest benefit from this intervention. Data&#xD;
      gathered from patients enrolled in this study will be compared to patients matched on key&#xD;
      characteristics from Inovalon's MORE2 healthcare database.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genelex Corporation is a leader in comprehensive medication management based on the YouScript&#xD;
      clinical decision support tool and DNA drug sensitivity testing. Controlling prescription&#xD;
      drug adverse event risk is complex because more than 85% of patients have significant DNA&#xD;
      based variation in activity of the cytochrome p450 (CYP) enzymes that metabolize the majority&#xD;
      of the most commonly prescribed medicines. Polypharmacy, common in the elderly and&#xD;
      chronically ill further increases the risk of an adverse drug event (ADE). The public&#xD;
      healthcare problem resulting from these factors costs an estimated $289 billion per year in&#xD;
      excess health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the YouScript personalized prescribing system is to improve patient outcomes by&#xD;
      preventing ADEs caused by drug-drug, drug-gene and drug-drug-gene interactions. ADEs are&#xD;
      defined to include prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drug overdose toxicity, adverse&#xD;
      drug reactions (ADRs), and treatment failures generally caused by properly prescribed&#xD;
      medications. The YouScript system prevents ADEs by the combined analysis of patient drug&#xD;
      regimens and individual genetics. YouScript DNA drug sensitivity testing includes five&#xD;
      enzymes in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) group (CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5).&#xD;
      YouScript synthesizes decades of publicly funded basic and clinical research to provide&#xD;
      actionable information to physicians treating patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly patients are at greater risk of an ADE. Two-thirds of adults age 65 or older take one&#xD;
      or more prescription drugs daily. Patients age 60 years and older account for 10-17% of&#xD;
      hospitalizations and 51% of the deaths from ADEs, although this age group represents just 17%&#xD;
      of the U.S. population. Following discharge, 50% of patients with ADRs declined in one or&#xD;
      more activities of daily living, compared to 24% of patients without ADRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the value of pharmacogenetic testing and comprehensive gene-based medication&#xD;
      management is being recognized by clinicians, it is still not endorsed by many expert&#xD;
      committees and third party payers for most prescription drugs. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to meet the need for evidence that better demonstrates the impact of such comprehensive&#xD;
      gene-based medication management on healthcare resource utilization (HRU), clinical&#xD;
      decision-making, and patient outcomes. Therefore, the proposed study aims to assess the&#xD;
      impact of the YouScript Personal Prescribing System on HRU, clinical decision-making, and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the impact of the YouScript Personalized Prescribing System on HRU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the impact of the YouScript Personalized Prescribing System on clinical&#xD;
      decision-making, including risk modification through dosage adjustment and medication change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the impact of the YouScript Personalized Prescribing System on the number of ADEs&#xD;
      experienced by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a prospective, non-interventional, observational study to assess the&#xD;
      real-world impact of the YouScript Personalized Prescribing System on HRU, provider clinical&#xD;
      decision-making, and ADEs. The decision to utilize the YouScript Personalized Prescribing&#xD;
      System and all treatment decisions will be made in accordance with usual care practice, and&#xD;
      will be made prior to the decision to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be compared between a group of prospectively enrolled patients undergoing&#xD;
      CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, VKORC1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 testing with the YouScript Personalized&#xD;
      Prescribing System at the discretion of their provider (i.e. &quot;tested&quot; patients) and data from&#xD;
      a group of similar patients included in Inovalon's MORE2 healthcare database meeting the same&#xD;
      enrollment criteria (excluding the YouScript testing) and matched on key characteristics to&#xD;
      the tested patients using propensity score matching. Sites will be queried regarding use of&#xD;
      other drug-drug interaction (DDI) systems to better distinguish the impact of YouScript vs.&#xD;
      other systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to initially enroll 1500 patients from 3-15 sites in the United States,&#xD;
      identified by Genelex. The study may be expanded up to 10,000 patients at additional sites in&#xD;
      the United States. The study duration is estimated to be at least 15 months, including 3&#xD;
      months for study set-up, 6 months or longer for patient enrollment depending on the rate of&#xD;
      accrual at each site, 4 months of per-patient follow-up and 2 months for study closeout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study consisting of the first 150 patients enrolled will be conducted prior to&#xD;
      continuing enrollment in order to assist with planning the larger-scale study, such as&#xD;
      confirming appropriate length of follow-up necessary to observe patient outcomes, comparison&#xD;
      of patient baseline characteristics, identifying potential variables for propensity score&#xD;
      matching, sample size calculation, and necessary changes to case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a discussion about the study with study staff and providing informed consent, baseline&#xD;
      data will be collected (described in more detail below), including a buccal swab or blood&#xD;
      sample, from patients undergoing YouScript testing. Follow-up data will be collected 120 days&#xD;
      after enrollment on all patients. Patients will be seen in the clinic or phoned (if a visit&#xD;
      is not scheduled in 120 days Â± 14 days from baseline) and queried regarding HRU (including&#xD;
      number of hospitalizations, ER visits, provider office visits, and procedures), changes in&#xD;
      medications, reason for changes, and adverse drug events. This data will also be abstracted&#xD;
      from the medical record for completeness. In addition, providers utilizing YouScript will&#xD;
      also be surveyed regarding the usefulness of YouScript in their clinical decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar available data will be abstracted for a sample of presumably untested patients&#xD;
      included in the MORE2 registry database who meet eligibility criteria and are matched to&#xD;
      prospectively enrolled patients on key characteristics using propensity score matching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is an observational study, there are no mandatory visits. While the timing of actual&#xD;
      patient visits will occur at the discretion of the treating provider, it will be requested&#xD;
      that data be entered at baseline and again 120 days after enrollment regardless of the number&#xD;
      of times that a patient had been seen during that interval. All data will be collected and&#xD;
      entered by the sites directly into a web-based electronic data capture (EDC) system via&#xD;
      electronic case report forms (eCRFs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients are screened and consented, the following variables will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline, with some being collected as part of the standard YouScript requisition form:&#xD;
      demographics, current smoking status, active medical conditions, liver or kidney dysfunction,&#xD;
      drugs of interest and other concomitant medications (including date of initiation of therapy,&#xD;
      dose, frequency, and indication, respectively), previous ADEs to any drug of interest, and&#xD;
      buccal swab/blood sample for YouScript testing. The site will not be required to enter data&#xD;
      collected on the YouScript requisition form into the eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following follow-up data will be collected during a routinely scheduled visit, or by&#xD;
      phone if a visit is not scheduled, approximately 120 days after enrollment: number of&#xD;
      hospitalizations; ER visits, diagnostic or surgical procedures, and office visits since&#xD;
      baseline; Change/consider/monitor recommendations for drug regimen change(s) by the pharmacy&#xD;
      team; changes in drug regimen/dose for drugs of interest and concomitant medications since&#xD;
      baseline; reason for changing or not changing drug regimen/dose; ADEs since baseline; and&#xD;
      healthcare provider survey/questions regarding role and usefulness of YouScript in clinical&#xD;
      decision making. If a visit is not scheduled at 120 days Â±14 days, the study staff will&#xD;
      contact patients by telephone and data will be collected. If patients choose to terminate&#xD;
      participation before completion of the 120-day follow---up, all follow-up data will be&#xD;
      collected, as well as the reason for discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete analytical specifications, including tables and listings, will be fully detailed in&#xD;
      the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Descriptive analyses will be performed to gain an&#xD;
      understanding of the qualitative and quantitative nature of the data collected and the&#xD;
      characteristics of the sample studied. Summary statistics will be calculated and presented&#xD;
      for baseline characteristics and outcomes for tested and control groups separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative analyses will be conducted to determine whether there are statistically&#xD;
      significant differences in specific quantitative outcomes between tested and control groups.&#xD;
      Because of propensity score matching between tested and control patients, unadjusted&#xD;
      comparative analysis will be performed and reported as the primary results. Adjusted analysis&#xD;
      using multiple regression models will be used to examine potential confounding effects that&#xD;
      cannot be addressed by the matching process. Exploratory analyses will be conducted to&#xD;
      explore the impact of YouScript in various subgroups and to identify potential subgroups&#xD;
      which will be most likely to benefit from YouScript, as deemed appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first interim analysis will be conducted after data collection is complete for&#xD;
      approximately the first 150 prospectively enrolled patients (i.e. the pilot study) to&#xD;
      determine if any changes are necessary in the methods of the larger scale study. The second&#xD;
      interim analysis will be completed after data collection is complete for approximately 750&#xD;
      prospectively enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the main analyses, differences in HRU at the 120-day follow-up will be determined by&#xD;
      comparing the mean number of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, diagnostic procedures,&#xD;
      surgical procedures, and clinic visits between the tested and untested groups. The impact of&#xD;
      YouScript on clinical decision making will be determined by comparing the mean number of&#xD;
      changes in drug regimen or dose between those who underwent YouScript testing and those that&#xD;
      did not. In addition, the number of ADEs experienced by patients during the 120-day study&#xD;
      will be compared between the tested and untested groups. Comparisons will be made with the&#xD;
      t-test (if the data are normally distributed), the Wilcoxon-Rank-Sum test (if the data are&#xD;
      continuous and not normally distributed), or the chi-squared (or Fisher exact) test if the&#xD;
      data are considered categorical. Multivariable linear regression models will be used to&#xD;
      examine the association of the YouScript Personalized Prescribing System with HRU, clinical&#xD;
      decision making, and ADEs, respectively, while controlling for potential confounding effects&#xD;
      from baseline characteristics not included in the propensity score matching process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In tested patients only, HRU, number of ADEs, and number of changes in drug regimen/dose will&#xD;
      be examined in relationship to genotype, sample size permitting. Reasons for not changing&#xD;
      drug regimen or dose when a recommendation was made will be summarized qualitatively or be&#xD;
      analyzed quantitatively if possible. In addition, calculation of the drug-gene,&#xD;
      drug-drug-gene and drug-drug interaction recommendation acceptance rate (as defined by&#xD;
      whether a drug or dose was changed after a recommendation was made) will be calculated.&#xD;
      Provider feedback regarding whether the YouScript Personalized Prescribing System impacted&#xD;
      their clinical decisions will be summarized quantitatively and qualitatively.&#xD;
