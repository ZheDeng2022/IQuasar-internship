  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently become proficient in a new, and we believe more effective&#xD;
      technique for polyp removal. Known as Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD). ESD involves&#xD;
      removing the polyp in one piece. It is preferable to remove the polyp in one piece as it&#xD;
      minimises the chance of leaving residual polyp tissue behind. There have also been recent&#xD;
      studies overseas that have shown this new technique to be quite effective. In this study,&#xD;
      half of the patients will receive the newly developed technique of polyp removal (ESD), while&#xD;
      the other half will receive conventional Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) treatment. This&#xD;
      study will allow us to show which technique results in lower recurrence rates and is more&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EMR is a very effective procedure for lesions smaller than 20 mm. With this size the polyp&#xD;
      can be removed en bloc. En bloc resection is preferred as it minimises the likelihood of&#xD;
      residual adenoma and enhances histological assessment. It is also curative in superficially&#xD;
      invasive submucosal disease. It eliminates the need for surgery in these patients. With&#xD;
      lesions larger than 20 mm, the lesion is removed piece meal, often in more than 5 pieces.&#xD;
      Care is taken to ensure that no adenoma is left behind at the point of overlap between snare&#xD;
      resections. However, for every additional snare resection, there is the possibility that a&#xD;
      small amount of adenoma will be left behind at this overlap point. Overall, the literature&#xD;
      suggests that there is approximately a 15% residual adenoma rate at repeat colonoscopy in 3&#xD;
      months, which requires further treatment. With en bloc resection residual adenoma rate at&#xD;
      repeat colonoscopy in is close to 0%. This has to be balanced against the relative&#xD;
      inexperience with performing ESD, longer procedure time and higher complication rates. A&#xD;
      randomized trial near completion is comparing endoscopic snare resection with transanal&#xD;
      surgical resection for rectal polyps (24). Should this trial show that en bloc resection is&#xD;
      superior in achieving complete resection without recurrence at similar complication rates,&#xD;
      the endoscopic treatment strategy of large colorectal adenomas should be reconsidered. Since&#xD;
      en bloc resection is technically more challenging, this should have consequences for&#xD;
      credentialing, referral patterns and performance of removal of large colorectal polyps in&#xD;
      reference centers only. Thus, before en bloc resection is promoted as superior, and training&#xD;
      has to be intensified to comply with standards of safe oncologic resection of these lesions,&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety have to be proven in a comparative randomized trial.&#xD;
