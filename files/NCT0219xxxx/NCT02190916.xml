    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about how patients with vasculitis think about their&#xD;
      illness and to assess to what extent patient perceptions of illness are associated with&#xD;
      physical, mental, and social functioning&#xD;
    </textblock>

      All patients enrolled in the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium's Contact Registry were&#xD;
      invited via email to participate in this study. The Contract Registry includes people who&#xD;
      self-identify as having one of the following types of vasculitis: granulomatosis with&#xD;
      polyangiitis (Wegener's), microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, polyarteritis&#xD;
      nodosa, Takayasu's arteritis, giant cell arteritis, Behcet's disease, Henoch-Schöenlein&#xD;
      purpura, or CNS vasculitis. People voluntarily enroll in this Registry with the understanding&#xD;
      that they will receive information about clinical studies for which they might be eligible.&#xD;
      The introductory email included basic information about the study and all of the required&#xD;
      elements for informed consent in a brief format. Once participants agreed to participate in&#xD;
      the study, then they were directed to the online questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When completing the questionnaire, patients were asked a series of questions. Some of the&#xD;
      follow-up questions depended on initial answers. The questionnaire content was included as an&#xD;
      appendix. The online questionnaire version was thoroughly tested for usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was expected that most participants would require approximately 20-30 minutes to complete&#xD;
      the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey data is stored by the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network Data Management and&#xD;
      Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South Florida. The data is de-identified.&#xD;
      Names or other personal health information are not be collected.&#xD;

        Patients will be recruited from within the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC)&#xD;
        Patient Contact Registry to participate in an online questionnaire. More than 2000&#xD;
        patients, representing all the different types of idiopathic vasculitis, are currently&#xD;
        enrolled into the on-line registry. The different types of vasculitis available for study&#xD;
        include: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic&#xD;
        polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss Syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, giant cell arteritis,&#xD;
        Takayasu's arteritis, Henoch-Schöenlein purpura, Behçets disease, and CNS vasculitis.&#xD;
