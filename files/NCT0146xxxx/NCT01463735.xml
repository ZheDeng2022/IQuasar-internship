      Acanthocytes, also termed spur cell, are large erythrocytes covered with spike-like&#xD;
      projections which are associated with severe hemolytic anemia. In advanced cirrhosis,&#xD;
      acanthocytes may account for 20 to 30% of red blood cells. Up to 70% of cirrhotic patients&#xD;
      display anemia and hemoglobin level may fall to below 5 gr/L in spur cell anemia. The true&#xD;
      incidence of spur cells in cirrhosis is not known precisely but may avoisinate 45%, typically&#xD;
      in patients with advanced cirrhosis.The presence of spur cells usually predicts lower&#xD;
      survival rates. Vitamin E is an antioxidant compound that is a component of biological&#xD;
      membrane that helps to maintain integrity of lipid bilayers. Vitamin E deficiency leads to&#xD;
      erythrocyte hemolysis, which is improved by supplemental vitamin E. This study is an open&#xD;
      label single arm phase II study in cirrhotic patients treated for 4 weeks with Tocofersolan&#xD;
      (Vedrop), a water-soluble derivative of alpha-tocopherol, and thus an orally bio-available&#xD;
      source of vitamin E. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of tocofersolan on red&#xD;
      blood cell membranes lipid composition in adult patients with cirrhosis and vitamin E&#xD;
      deficiency. Secondary endpoints are the effects of tocofersolan on anemia, hemolysis and&#xD;
      acanthocytosis; on lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress; the safety of a 4 week treatment&#xD;
      of 700 mg/day.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cirrhosis may be complicated by the presence of ascites, portosystemic collaterals that may&#xD;
      eventually bleed or give rise to hepatic encephalopathy. Laboratory findings in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis includes alterations in synthetic function as well as an increase in serum&#xD;
      bilirubin. Liver diseases are also associated with hematologic complications and altered red&#xD;
      blood cells morphology. Up to 70% of cirrhotic patients display anemia and hemoglobin level&#xD;
      may fall to below 5 gr/L in spur cell anemia. Thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and neutropenia&#xD;
      are also common. In patients with cirrhosis, acanthocytes and echinocytes are reported.&#xD;
      Acanthocytes, also termed spur cell, are large erythrocytes covered with spike-like&#xD;
      projections which are associated with severe hemolytic anemia. In advanced cirrhosis,&#xD;
      acanthocytes may account for 20 to 30% of red blood cells. The spiky morphology of&#xD;
      acanthocytes results from an abnormal surface area to volume ratio and an altered membrane&#xD;
      lipids composition. These changes in red blood cell membranes render the cell more prone to&#xD;
      destruction and hemolysis. The true incidence of spur cells in cirrhosis is not known&#xD;
      precisely but may avoisinate 45%, typically in patients with advanced cirrhosis.The presence&#xD;
      of spur cells usually predicts lower survival rates. The liver is a very susceptible organ to&#xD;
      oxidative-related cellular damage, and low antioxidants, such as vitamin E, in cirrhosis&#xD;
      participate in cellular membrane alterations. Vitamin E is an antioxidant compound that is a&#xD;
      component of biological membrane that helps to maintain integrity of lipid bilayers. Vitamin&#xD;
      E deficiency leads to erythrocyte hemolysis, which is improved by supplemental vitamin E.&#xD;
      Tocofersolan (Vedrop) is a water-soluble derivative of alpha-tocopherol, and thus an orally&#xD;
      bio-available source of vitamin E. Vitamin E supplementation appears safe in liver diseases&#xD;
      and provides histological benefit in NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and endpoints I. To determine the effect of tocofersolan on red blood cell membranes&#xD;
      lipid composition in adult patients with cirrhosis and vitamine E deficiency II. To determine&#xD;
      the effect of vit E on anemia, hemolysis and acanthocytosis; on lipid peroxidation and&#xD;
      oxidative stress; the safety of a 4 week treatment of 700 mg/day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: selection period: 1 week; active treatment: 4 weeks; follow-up period. 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Evaluation time-points: baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment Methodology/Design: phase II&#xD;
      pilot trial on 27 patients, single arm study&#xD;
