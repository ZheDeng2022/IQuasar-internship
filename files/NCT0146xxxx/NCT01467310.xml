    <textblock>
      Research into treatments for breast cancer relies more and more on an understanding of how&#xD;
      the cells of tumor tissue act when they are exposed to a new or different drug. To find these&#xD;
      new or different drugs to treat cancer, researchers are looking at proteins that help cancer&#xD;
      cells grow, such as a group of proteins called Kinases. In this study the investigators want&#xD;
      to look at the activity of kinases when a particular experimental drug called GSK1120212 is&#xD;
      administered. GSK1120212 blocks a kinase called MEK. GSK1120212 is not yet approved by the&#xD;
      FDA for use in breast cancer patients. The investigators want to give subjects GSK1120212 for&#xD;
      a short period of time (one week) to see how MEK and the other kinases function in cancer&#xD;
      cells both before and after the study drug is given. This study is not intended to treat&#xD;
      cancer, it is looking at ways that the investigators may treat cancer in the future.&#xD;

      In this study the investigators want to look at the activity of kinases when a particular&#xD;
      experimental drug called GSK1120212 is administered. GSK1120212 blocks a kinase called MEK.&#xD;
      GSK1120212 is not yet approved by the FDA for use in breast cancer patients. The&#xD;
      investigators want to give subjects GSK1120212 for a short period of time (one week) to see&#xD;
      how MEK and the other kinases function in cancer cells both before and after the study drug&#xD;
      is given. The investigators are giving this drug for research purposes only. The length of&#xD;
      time it is being given is not intended to treat cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research into treatments for breast cancer relies more and more on an understanding of how&#xD;
      the cells of tumor tissue act when they are exposed to a new or different drug. To find these&#xD;
      new or different drugs to treat cancer, researchers are looking at proteins that help cancer&#xD;
      cells grow, such as a group of proteins called Kinases. This is important because many of the&#xD;
      newest cancer drugs are designed to block kinases causing the cancer cells to die and the&#xD;
      tumors to shrink. However, blocking only one of the kinases at a time is often less effective&#xD;
      than the investigators expected because when you block one kinase another can take its place.&#xD;
      For this reason, the investigators may need to treat breast cancer with more than one&#xD;
      kinase-blocking drug at a time. However, the investigators don't yet know what the best&#xD;
      combination of drugs should be, because it is hard to measure all the possible kinases.&#xD;
      Previous studies have only been able to identify less than 10% of the hundreds of kinases in&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently researchers here at UNC have developed a process that can identify may (more than&#xD;
      half) of these kinases. This can tell us which kinases need to be blocked at the same time to&#xD;
      make tumors shrink so that the investigators can design the best combinations of kinase&#xD;
      blocking drugs for triple negative breast cancer. This is especially important for&#xD;
      individuals with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) because there are fewer drugs available&#xD;
      that can block molecules that affect tumor growth. The investigators believe that&#xD;
      kinase-blocking drugs have the potential to be a more effective treatment for people with&#xD;
      TNBC.&#xD;
