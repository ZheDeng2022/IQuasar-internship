      Background: Collagen IV-related nephropathies can lead to End Stage Renal Disease.&#xD;
      Experimental studies have shown renin angiotensin aldosterone system blockade can reduce&#xD;
      proteinuria and preserve renal function. In humans there is no proven treatment. Methods:&#xD;
      This is a retrospective study of patients with Collagen IV-related nephropathies and&#xD;
      proteinuria treated with enalapril analyzing the evolution of proteinuria and renal function,&#xD;
      as well as predictive variables of progression to end stage renal disease. Outcome was&#xD;
      creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2.&#xD;

      Introduction Collagen IV-related nephropathies, caused by mutations in the three genes&#xD;
      encoding collagen type IV of the basal membrane, represent a spectrum of phenotypes from&#xD;
      Alport syndrome (AS) to thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) (1). Subtypes are X-linked&#xD;
      AS (XLAS) which corresponds approximately 80% of AS, autosomal recessive AS (ARAS), counting&#xD;
      for 15% of AS, and the autosomal dominant forms, represented by autosomal dominant AS (ADAS,&#xD;
      5% of AS) and TBMN, which is believed to be present in 1% of the population (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides renal manifestations, these diseases can present cochlear and ocular abnormalities&#xD;
      (2). However, the hallmark of Collagen IV-related nephropathies is hematuria. Proteinuria is&#xD;
      detected during life, being a marker of disease progression. All males with XLAS develop&#xD;
      proteinuria and, eventually, progressive renal insufficiency, which leads to end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease (ESRD). Overall, an estimated 60% reach ESRD by age 30 years, and 90% by age 40 years&#xD;
      (2). Approximately 12% of females with XLAS develop ESRD before age 40 years, increasing to&#xD;
      30% by age 60 years (3). Most individuals with ARAS develop significant proteinuria in late&#xD;
      childhood or adolescence and ESRD before age 30 years. Progression to ESRD is slower in&#xD;
      individuals with ADAS. Similarly, TBMN is characterized clinically by persistent&#xD;
      microhematuria often observed in childhood. TBMN is rarely associated with extrarenal&#xD;
      abnormalities and proteinuria. Hypertension and progression to ESRD are unusual (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the severity of disease, the high rate of ESRD, and the increasing knowledge about&#xD;
      genetics and diagnosis, there is currently no proven treatment to AS. So far, the therapeutic&#xD;
      approach is limited to angiotensin-II (AII) blockade, blood pressure control and diet&#xD;
      counseling. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers&#xD;
      (ARB) are usually started once proteinuria appears but there is no clear evidence that such&#xD;
      treatment alters the natural history of the disease in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal was to describe the evolution of a series of cases with Collagen IV-related&#xD;
      nephropathies and proteinuria treated with enalapril, as well as predictive variables of&#xD;
      progression to ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods This is a retrospective study of collagen IV-related nephropathies&#xD;
      patients followed at Instituto da Criança - HCFMUSP from 1999 to 2010. All patients presented&#xD;
      glomerular hematuria (erythrocyte dysmorphism and/or red blood cell cast in the urinary&#xD;
      sediment) and proteinuria. In 16 of 19 cases the diagnosis was based on familial history and&#xD;
      renal histology findings which showed negative immunofluorescence and the ultrastructural&#xD;
      abnormalities of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) showing TBMN (uniform or diffuse&#xD;
      attenuation of the GBM without the typical lamellation and thickening that is seen in AS) or&#xD;
      AS (defects in terms of alternating attenuation, splitting, lamellation, and thickening along&#xD;
      the GBM). However, it is very difficult to discriminate between the initial stage of AS and&#xD;
      TBMN. Three patients were not submitted to renal biopsy since the familial history and the&#xD;
      renal histology of relatives were characteristics of the disease. Only adherent patients were&#xD;
      included, which was based on presence in attendance and exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients visited the outpatient clinic at least once every 3 months and had at least 2&#xD;
      years of follow up. The following parameters were evaluated at baseline: age, renal function&#xD;
      (serum creatinine, urea, and creatinine clearance according to Schwartz Formula) (5), 24 hour&#xD;
      proteinuria, blood pressure and light and electron microscopy of the renal fragment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, enalapril was employed as a RAAS blocker, observing benefits and side&#xD;
      effects as hypotension symptoms and/or signs. Our protocol intends to reach a dose of 0.3&#xD;
      mg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters were also collected during follow up: serum creatinine and urea, 24&#xD;
      hour proteinuria and creatinine clearance estimated by stature (Schwartz Formula).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study hyperfiltration is defined as ≥ 145 ml/minute/1.73m2BS, based on Piepsz et al&#xD;
      and Prestidge et al data (6,7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Mann-Whitney and chi-square (or Fisher) tests were used in the&#xD;
      univariate analysis. For the analysis of the effect of enalapril on proteinuria during the&#xD;
      first 2 years of treatment we have used a non-parametric repeated measures analysis&#xD;
      (Friedmann´s test). We have analyzed the main predictive variables of CKD progression, by&#xD;
      considering a creatinine clearance below 60 ml/min/1.73m2 as an outcome.&#xD;
