  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) colorectal cancer will be vaccinated&#xD;
      with three so called frame shift peptides (FSPs), AIM2(-1), HT001(-1) and TAF1B(-1) combined&#xD;
      with Montanide® ISA-51 VG. By this, an immune response directed against MSI-induced FSPs that&#xD;
      are shared by the majority of MSI-H colorectal cancers can be induced. The aim is to show&#xD;
      that vaccination against MSI-induced FSPs is safe and can induce or enhance immune responses&#xD;
      against MSI-H colorectal cancer-associated antigens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is initiated to evaluate vaccination with MSI-specific FSPs in patients&#xD;
      with MSI-H colorectal cancer. Specifically, the present study aims at the following&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of potential toxicity of the FSP AIM2(-1), HT001(-1), TAF1B(-1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the immune response in patients with advanced MSI-H colorectal cancer&#xD;
           before vaccination and after vaccination with the FSP AIM2(-1), HT001(-1), TAF1B(-1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the present study shall demonstrate whether application of FSP in a&#xD;
      vaccination approach is associated with the induction of peptide-related toxicity. Hence, the&#xD;
      study marks the first step towards the application of FSP in humans, as it provides&#xD;
      information on the safety of FSP as vaccination agents for the first time. Moreover, the&#xD;
      study shall provide initial information, whether vaccination with FSP can induce FSP-specific&#xD;
      immune responses in patients with MSI-H colorectal cancer. Thus, it shall provide&#xD;
      information, whether FSPs AIM2(-1), HT001(-1), and TAF1B(-1) have the potential to elicit&#xD;
      peptide-specific immune responses and therefore represent suitable targets for the induction&#xD;
      of tumor antigen-specific immune responses in patients with MSI-H tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study marks an important milestone towards a potential application of&#xD;
      MSI-specific FSP as therapeutic agents in the management of patients with MSI-H tumors,&#xD;
      particularly patients with MSI-H colorectal cancer. Long-term goal of this approach is to&#xD;
      develop novel tools for (1) the palliative and/or adjuvant therapy of patients with advanced&#xD;
      MSI-H colorectal cancer and (2) the preventive application of FSPs in mutation carriers of&#xD;
      the HNPCC/Lynch syndrome.&#xD;
