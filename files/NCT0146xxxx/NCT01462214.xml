  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present phase 1-2 study the investigators aim to determine whether depletion of Tregs&#xD;
      using metronomic cyclophosphamide can enhance the antitumor efficacy of everolimus in&#xD;
      patients with mRCC not amenable to or progressive after a VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor containing treatment regimen. In the phase 1 part of the study the investigators&#xD;
      will determine the optimal CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell-depleting dose and schedule of&#xD;
      metronomic oral cyclophosphamide when given in combination with a fixed dose (10 mg daily) of&#xD;
      everolimus. In the phase 2 part of the study the investigators will subsequently evaluate&#xD;
      whether the number of patients who are cancer progression free at 4 months can be increased&#xD;
      from 50% to 70% by adding metronomic cyclophosphamide (in the dose and schedule determined in&#xD;
      the phase 1 part) to everolimus. In addition to efficacy, the investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      treatment toxicity to determine whether this combination strategy is feasible and safe.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, national multi-center study of different doses and schedules of&#xD;
      low-dose oral cyclophosphamide in combination with fixed dose everolimus in patients with&#xD;
      mRCC not amenable to or progressive after a VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      containing treatment regimen. Phase I part: Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 5 per&#xD;
      dose level. The first 5 patients enrolled will be assigned to dose level 0 in order to assess&#xD;
      immune and angiogenic effects caused by everolimus monotherapy. The second 5 patients&#xD;
      enrolled will be assigned to dose level 1. If there are ≤1 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)&#xD;
      experienced by the first 5 patients in a cohort during the first 28 days after the first&#xD;
      study treatment, further patients will be entered in the next dose level. Entry of patients&#xD;
      into the expansion cohort will not occur until at least 28 days after the last patient in the&#xD;
      escalation phase received his/her first study treatment. At the final dose level recommended&#xD;
      for the phase II study a minimum of 10 patients will be treated. Phase II part: In the phase&#xD;
      2 part of the study up to 56 patients will be treated at the dose level that has been&#xD;
      selected based on its capacity to most selectively deplete circulating Treg levels in the&#xD;
      phase 1 part of the study. Based on data of patients with mRCC treated with everolimus&#xD;
      monotherapy after previous treatment with sunitinib ± sorafenib, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      increase the number of patients who are alive and cancer progression free at 4 months from&#xD;
      50% to 70% by adding metronomic cyclophosphamide. In addition, the investigators consider&#xD;
      this increase meaningful as long as the combination treatment does not cause combination&#xD;
      treatment related toxicity ≥ grade 3 in ≥ 30% of patients.&#xD;
