  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open label, dose-escalating study will evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of RO5503781, administered once daily (QD)&#xD;
      or once weekly (QW) in participants with advanced malignancies except leukemia. Participants&#xD;
      will receive multiple escalating oral doses in two different dosing schedules (Sch) until&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.&#xD;
