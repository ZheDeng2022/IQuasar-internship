  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a fit-for-purpose biochemical verification tool that&#xD;
      can be used to detect concomitant use of a few (less than 5) conventional cigarettes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be performed in two parts. The first part, Part A, is a dose titration study&#xD;
      in healthy smokers with incremental cigarette consumption performed in confinement. The&#xD;
      second part, Part B, is an observational study on healthy non-smokers in an ambulatory&#xD;
      setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART A (smokers only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A screening visit will be conducted within 4 weeks prior to admission to the investigational&#xD;
      site. The 8-day confinement period consists of the admission day (Day1), 1 day ad-libitum&#xD;
      smoking (Day0), 3 days of smoking abstinence (Day1-3), 2-day exposure period smoking 2 and 4&#xD;
      cigarettes (Day4-5), and the day of discharge (Day6) followed by a 7-day safety follow-up&#xD;
      period. Urine collection will be performed for each subject from Day0 to Day5 in 4 intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART B (non-smokers)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit will be conducted within 4 weeks prior to the ambulatory Visit 1 (collection&#xD;
      of 24-hour urine and spot urine) to the investigational site. The minimum interval between&#xD;
      the screening and Visit 1 is of 7 days.&#xD;

             visit based on clinical laboratory parameters (clinical biochemistry, urine analysis&#xD;
             and standard haematology), spirometry, serology, urine drug screen, vital signs,&#xD;
