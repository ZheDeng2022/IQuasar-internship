    <textblock>
      Patients with schizophrenia display cognitive impairments, such as reduced attention and&#xD;
      problems with memory. Available medications for schizophrenia poorly alleviate memory&#xD;
      problems however, research indicates that nicotine improves memory. In order for there to be&#xD;
      memories formed, there has to be changes (neuroplasticity changes) in how the brain cells&#xD;
      communicate. One way to induce such changes is by using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) combined with peripheral nerve stimulation in a Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS)&#xD;
      paradigm. The investigators laboratory has developed a novel method that measures memory-like&#xD;
      brain changes using electroencephalography (EEG), TMS and PAS. The present study will use&#xD;
      this novel method to evaluate the effects of acute nicotine gum (4mg) and placebo (regular)&#xD;
      gum on memory and memory-like brain changes in schizophrenia and healthy controls. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that nicotine will improve memory and facilitate neuroplasticity changes in the&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia to a larger extent than in healthy controls.&#xD;

      Background: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is frequently associated with marked working memory (WM)&#xD;
      deficits whose pathophysiology is closely related to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (DLPFC)-dependent dysfunction[1]. These deficits predict disease outcome and poor response to&#xD;
      antipsychotic treatment[2]. Consequently, elucidating the physiology of DLPFC-dependent WM&#xD;
      deficits in SCZ is key in better understanding this illness and its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with SCZ display an unusually high prevalence of smoking and high rates of smoking&#xD;
      cessation failures are commonly associated with WM deficits[3]. The central nicotinic&#xD;
      acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the main target for nicotine. Several lines of evidence&#xD;
      strongly suggest that the nAChR system is a promising target for treating cognitive deficits&#xD;
      in SCZ. These include the following observations: (1) expression of nAChRs receptors is&#xD;
      abnormal in several brain regions, including the PFC, in post mortem brains of patients with&#xD;
      SCZ, (2) genes coding for nAChR subunits are candidate risk genes for SCZ and nicotine&#xD;
      addiction, and (3) smoking abstinence produce deficits of WM, which correlate with blood&#xD;
      levels of nicotine, are alleviated by smoking re-instatement and are blocked by nAChR&#xD;
      antagonists in patients with SCZ, but not in healthy control smokers (e.g.,[4]). However, the&#xD;
      underlying mechanism through which nicotine and nAChRs affect DLPFC-dependent memory in SCZ&#xD;
      are still unknown. Nicotine-induced increases in neural plasticity may represent one such&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroplasticity, which includes long-term potentiation (LTP), is a proposed physiological&#xD;
      mechanism for memory formation. LTP is dependent on an optimal interaction between the&#xD;
      glutamate (GLU), dopamine (DA) and γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems and perturbations in&#xD;
      these systems likely explain why patients with SCZ demonstrate deficits in WM and&#xD;
      neuroplasticity[5,6]. nAChR are present on GABA, GLU and DA neurons and nicotine could&#xD;
      potentially improve cognition by modulating these systems. Studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      acute nicotine administration potentiates neural plasticity in the motor cortex of healthy&#xD;
      human subjects. One of these studies used Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS), a powerful&#xD;
      paradigm to index LTP in the motor cortex, to assess the effects of nicotine on LTP in&#xD;
      non-smokers[7]. The results demonstrate that nicotine enhanced LTP-like mechanisms induced by&#xD;
      PAS in the motor cortex[7]. To date, however, there has been no direct measure of LTP-like&#xD;
      plasticity from the DLPFC in humans. To overcome this challenge, the investigators group has&#xD;
      developed a novel PAS technique of combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG)[8] to directly index LTP from the DLPFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional methods of applying PAS involves the repetitive delivery of two paired&#xD;
      stimulations: the first being an electrical peripheral nerve stimulation of the right median&#xD;
      nerve of the hand and 25 ms later a second TMS pulse delivered to the contralateral motor&#xD;
      cortex (hence PAS-25). Through repetitive pairing of these two stimulations, PAS-25 results&#xD;
      in increased activation of output neurons that represents a direct measure LTP in humans[9].&#xD;
      The investigators lab has recently recorded PAS-LTP in the DLFPC using a novel technique of&#xD;
      TMS-EEG[8]. Here, PAS is applied to the DLPFC by repetitive delivery of: (1) a peripheral&#xD;
      nerve stimulation to the right side, followed 25 ms later by; (2) a TMS pulse delivered to&#xD;
      the left DLPFC. PAS-induced potentiation of cortical evoked activity is then measured&#xD;
      directly from the DLPFC and represents LTP in this region as interneurons activated from&#xD;
      cortical stimulation and peripheral stimulation, in turn, activate DLPFC output neurons&#xD;
      contemporaneously and increase their activity when repeated over 30 min. Thus, the activation&#xD;
      of the somatosensory cortex by peripheral nerve stimulation will propagate to the DLPFC and&#xD;
      arrive there simultaneously with the TMS pulse resulting in LTP. The validity of this&#xD;
      technique relies on the observation that there are strong correlations between TMS induced&#xD;
      evoked potentials in the motor and DLPFC (r=0.8-0.85, p&lt;0.001)[8]. LTP is quantified as&#xD;
      change in DLPFC cortical evoked activity from baseline (pre-PAS) to different time points&#xD;
      following PAS-25 (post-PAS). Preliminary data from the investigators ongoing study using&#xD;
      these novel methods, demonstrate that PAS-25 induces significant LTP in the DLPFC. For&#xD;
      example, in healthy controls cortical evoked activity in the DLPFC was facilitated by 56%&#xD;
      post-PAS (maximal point of facilitation) while in patients with SCZ the cortical evoked&#xD;
      activity post-PAS was only increased by 16% (Cohen's d=0.80). This is to the investigators&#xD;
      knowledge the first time LTP has ever been demonstrated in-vivo in the DLPFC of humans and&#xD;
      the first time that LTP deficits in the DLPFC have been reported in patients with SCZ. The&#xD;
      aim of this proposal is now to assess whether enhanced WM by nicotine is mediated by&#xD;
      potentiation of LTP in the DLPFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with SCZ will have reduced DLPFC LTP and impaired WM compared to healthy&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acute nicotine gum challenge will attenuate the DLPFC LTP and WM deficit in patients&#xD;
           with SCZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Plasma nicotine levels will correlate with improvement in DLPFC LTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reversal of the DLPFC LTP deficit in patients with SCZ will be associated with&#xD;
           improvement in WM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Fourteen healthy non-smokers and 14 non-smokers with SCZ will complete this&#xD;
      exploratory study. This sample size is based on a previous study that used the TMS-EEG method&#xD;
      and demonstrated a significant difference in cortical inhibition between healthy controls and&#xD;
      SCZ patients[10], and will be sufficient to detect a medium effect size (Cohen´s d=0.72;&#xD;
      α=0.05, 1-β=0.80) of nicotine treatment. Only patients that are treated with a stable dose of&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication (≥1 month) will be enrolled in this study. This could potentially&#xD;
      confound the results as the investigators are using healthy non-medicated controls for&#xD;
      comparison. However, the within- subjects design is an effort to control for such effects.&#xD;
      Study design: The study will be a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study&#xD;
      consisting of two PAS-25 testing sessions one month apart, followed by a 7 day post-PAS&#xD;
      follow-up test session each. Pharmacological treatment: Nicotine (4 mg) or matching placebo&#xD;
      gum will be administered on each of the two test days before baseline TMS-EEG recording.&#xD;
      Maximum nicotine blood concentration is reached after 30 min, at which point blood samples&#xD;
      will be drawn to assess nicotine levels. WM assessment: The N-back task measures the ability&#xD;
      to maintain active information online (i.e. WM) and is dependent on DLPFC functioning.&#xD;
      Letters are presented in a continuous sequence and the subject is asked to respond if they&#xD;
      recognize the present letter as the same letter appears that appeared as the N (0, 1, 2 or 3)&#xD;
      letters back, i.e. &quot;N-back&quot;. The N-back will be administered at the pre-test training session&#xD;
      (to control for training effects), baseline, 120 minutes and 1 week post PAS. Paired&#xD;
      Associative Stimulation (PAS): The pairings will occur over a 30 min period and the&#xD;
      peripheral nerve stimulation and TMS to the DLPFC will be delivered at 0.1 Hz. To assure the&#xD;
      DLPFC localization, neuronavigational techniques using the MRIcro/reg software and a&#xD;
      T1-weight MRI scan will be used. Quantifying LTP: To assess DLPFC LTP, change in cortical&#xD;
      evoked activity will be measured using pre- and post-PAS TMS-EEG recordings. TMS pulses will&#xD;
      be generated using two Magstim 200 stimulators (Magstim Company Ltd., UK) connected to and a&#xD;
      7 cm figure-of-eight coil via a Bistim module. A train of 100 pulses (0.1 Hz) will be&#xD;
      administered together with EEG recordings; (1) before PAS in order to assess baseline&#xD;
      cortical evoked activity and (2) at different time points (0, 15, 30, 60,120 min and 7 days)&#xD;
      following PAS-25. EEG will be recorded using the DLPFC-corresponding electrodes of a&#xD;
      64-channel Synamps 2 EEG system. Cortical evoked activity will be defined as the area under&#xD;
      the rectified curve for the averaged EEG recordings (50-275 ms post-stimulus) and LTP will be&#xD;
      quantified as the change in cortical evoked activity from baseline. Statistics: Within and&#xD;
      between subjects comparisons will be carried out using repeated measures, mixed-factorial,&#xD;
      ANOVAs when appropriate. Relationship between LTP and nicotine levels will be assessed using&#xD;
      Pearson correlations. P-values will be set to 0.05 and multiple comparisons will be&#xD;
      Bonferroni corrected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The results of this study will provide important new knowledge about mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying cognitive enhancement strategies in SCZ. That is, the investigators intend to&#xD;
      decipher the complex pharmacological mechanisms that underlie nicotinic cholinergic&#xD;
      enhancement of plasticity in the DLPFC. Such findings will also help to generate important&#xD;
      biomarkers through which cognitive enhancing strategies may be measured biologically that can&#xD;
      potentially lead to the development of more personalized treatments of cognitive deficits in&#xD;
      this debilitating disorder.&#xD;
