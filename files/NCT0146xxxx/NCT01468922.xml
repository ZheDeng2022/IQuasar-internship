  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pazopanib is an anticancer drug that blocks the growth of new blood vessels in tumors. It&#xD;
      has been approved to treat renal cell cancer. ARQ 197 is an experimental drug that blocks a&#xD;
      protein called c-MET, which cancer cells need to grow. Studies suggest that some drugs that&#xD;
      block blood vessel growth can increase the production of c-MET in tumors, which helps cancer&#xD;
      cells keep growing. Blocking both blood vessel growth and c-MET with pazopanib and ARQ 197&#xD;
      may help kill cancer cells faster. This study will use these drugs to treat solid tumors that&#xD;
      have not responded to earlier treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of pazopanib and ARQ 197 for advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded&#xD;
      to earlier treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have blood and urine tests, and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study drugs will be given in 4-week cycles of treatment. Participants will take&#xD;
           pazopanib once a day and ARQ 197 twice a day by mouth. Some participants will start with&#xD;
           pazopanib or ARQ 197 alone for the first week. Then they will take both drugs together&#xD;
           for the rest of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. Optional&#xD;
           tumor samples may be collected during different treatment cycles.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signal&#xD;
           transduction pathways have synergistic effects on promoting angiogenesis and growth&#xD;
           factor expression. Hypoxia caused by treatment with VEGF inhibitors results in the&#xD;
           upregulation of c-MET, the receptor for HGF. In a mouse model, combined blockade of&#xD;
           VEGFR and c-Met significantly prolonged survival compared with inhibition of either&#xD;
           target alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that co-administration of the MET inhibitor ARQ 197 will prevent the&#xD;
           adaptive response to hypoxia resulting from treatment with the VEGFR inhibitor&#xD;
           pazopanib, and conversely, that co-administration of pazopanib will prevent the effect&#xD;
           of increased VEGF and reduced thrombospondin 1 in tumors after treatment with ARQ 197.&#xD;
           Therefore, the combination of these agents may result in improved antitumor effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the safety and tolerability of the combination of pazopanib with ARQ 197 in&#xD;
           patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of pazopanib with ARQ 197&#xD;
           in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate changes in MET and phospho-MET following treatment with pazopanib and ARQ 197&#xD;
           in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pazopanib and ARQ 197.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine and compare levels of total MET, phospho MET, HIF-1 , and&#xD;
           epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers (e-cadherin, beta catenin) in tumor biopsy&#xD;
           samples prior to and following administration of the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine and compare levels of circulating levels of HGF, soluble MET (sMET), VEGF-A,&#xD;
           and soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2) prior to and following administration of the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 and correlate these with the observed toxicities,&#xD;
           and the PK of ARQ 197.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate antitumor activity of the combination of pazopanib and ARQ 197 in patients with&#xD;
           refractory advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Adults with advanced, refractory solid tumors. Patients enrolling in the expansion cohorts&#xD;
      must have advanced sarcoma, gastric cancer, and MET-expressing malignancies, have disease&#xD;
      amenable to biopsy, and be willing to undergo pre-and post-treatment biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ARQ 197 will be administered orally twice daily and pazopanib orally once daily, in&#xD;
           28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose escalation will proceed using the traditional 3+3 design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the MTD is established, an additional cohort will be accrued for pharmacodynamic&#xD;
           (PD) studies in tumor biopsies (required in the expansion phase). For the first week,&#xD;
           patients will receive pazopanib alone to compare PK and PD results; combination therapy&#xD;
           will be given from week 2 onwards.&#xD;

             medication that may cause QTc interval prolongation cannot be discontinued may be&#xD;
             eligible at the discretion of the study PI. A comprehensive list of agents with the&#xD;
             potential to cause QTc prolongation can be found at&#xD;
             http://www.azcert.org/medical-pros/drug-lists/bycategory.cfm. (Note: If subjects must&#xD;
             take medications with a risk or possible risk of Torsades de Pointes, they should be&#xD;
             watched carefully for symptoms of Torsades de Pointes, such as syncope. Performing&#xD;
             additional EKGs on subjects who must take one or more of these medications is not&#xD;
