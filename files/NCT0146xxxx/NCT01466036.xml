  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cabozantinib works by blocking the growth of new blood vessels that feed a tumor. In addition&#xD;
      to blocking the formation of new blood cells in tumors, cabozantinib also blocks pathways&#xD;
      that may be responsible for allowing cancers cells to become resistant to other&#xD;
      &quot;anti-angiogenic&quot; drugs. Cabozantinib has been studied or is being study in research studies&#xD;
      as a possible treatment for various types of cancer, including prostate cancer, brain cancer,&#xD;
      thyroid cancer, lung cancer, and kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators wish to learn if cabozantinib is effective in&#xD;
      treating patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine and carcinoid tumors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects will take cabozantinib orally, once per day, in cycles of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each cycle subjects will have the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, including measurement of weight and vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions regarding any side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample (about 1 tablespoon) for routine laboratory tests of blood cell counts,&#xD;
           blood chemistries, organ function and blood clotting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample (about 4 tablespoons) for research test to measure biomarkers to assess the&#xD;
           response to study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample for routine urine tests to monitor health&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 (beginning of week 3) during the first 3 cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, including measurement of weight and vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions regarding any side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample (about 1 tablespoon) for routine laboratory tests of blood cell counts,&#xD;
           blood chemistries, organ function and blood clotting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample (about 4 tablespoons) for research test to measure biomarkers to assess the&#xD;
           response to study drug Subjects will receive a CT scan or MRI every two cycles (every&#xD;
           two months) to evaluate disease.&#xD;

             3 years or any currently active malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
