  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is approximately 3.5&#xD;
      cases per 100,000 persons per year. Approximately 13,000 people were diagnosed with AML in&#xD;
      2009 and 9,000 died of the disease, making AML the 6th leading cause of cancer death. Over&#xD;
      the past three decades, AML survival has improved for younger patients with 5-year survival&#xD;
      rates of greater than 60% for adults under the age of 45 years likely owing to improvements&#xD;
      in induction and consolidation chemotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant&#xD;
      (HSCT) and supportive care. Post-remission therapy with high-dose cytarabine-based regimens&#xD;
      after cytarabine and anthracycline based induction has improved disease free and overall&#xD;
      survival at the expense of increased treatment related mortality limiting its use in many&#xD;
      older patients and those with significant comorbidities. Although allogeneic HSCT remains the&#xD;
      standard of care for patients with poor risk AML or relapsed disease, advanced age,&#xD;
      comorbidities and donor availability preclude this option for a large number of patients&#xD;
      making improvement in the tolerability and efficacy of induction therapy an important goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over half of newly diagnosed AML patients are over 65 years of age with a third over the age&#xD;
      of 75 years. Unlike younger patients, the prognosis of elderly patients with AML is still&#xD;
      dismal with five-year survival rates of less than 10% for patients over the age of 65 years.&#xD;
      For the last thirty years, induction therapy with standard dose cytarabine with an&#xD;
      anthracycline has remained the standard of care for elderly patients with AML. In the&#xD;
      elderly, complete response rates to induction chemotherapy are lower than younger patients at&#xD;
      40 to 60% with median survival approaching 12 months. New strategies using novel agents to&#xD;
      increase the sensitivity of malignant myeloid precursors to standard induction chemotherapy&#xD;
      may improve complete response and relapse rates without increasing treatment related&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The myelodysplastic syndromes are neoplasms of hematopoietic progenitor cells characterized&#xD;
      by ineffective hematopoiesis and increased risk of transformation to AML. Clinically,&#xD;
      patients develop symptoms related to with cytopenias, typically progressive anemia with or&#xD;
      without thrombocytopenia or neutropenia that is unrelated to a defined reversible cause such&#xD;
      as nutritional deficiency. Histologically, MDS is suggested by the presence of dysplasia in&#xD;
      &gt;10% of cells in one or more myeloid lineage on bone marrow evaluation. Characteristic&#xD;
      cytogenetic abnormalities also aid in making the diagnosis of MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of MDS in the U.S. has been estimated at 3.4 cases per 100,000 people per year&#xD;
      with the incidence increasing 10 fold in people over the age of 70. Risk factors for the&#xD;
      development of MDS include advanced age, male sex, and prior exposure to DNA-damaging&#xD;
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy, typically for treatment of other malignancies. As a group,&#xD;
      patients with advanced MDS and those with MDS progressing to AML have treatment resistant&#xD;
      disease with low response rates and short durations of response after induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for primary MDS assigns four MDS risk&#xD;
      categories (Low, INT-1, INT-2, High) based on bone marrow myeloblast percentage, specific&#xD;
      cytogenetic abnormalities, and number of cytopenias to estimate survival and risk of&#xD;
      transformation to AML. Low and INT-1 risk MDS patients have a median survival of 5.7 and 3.3&#xD;
      years, respectively, in the absence of therapy. Advanced MDS patients in IPSS risk groups&#xD;
      INT-2 and High fare much less well with median survival of 1.1 and 0.4 years, respectively.&#xD;
      INT-2 and High-risk MDS is also associated with a higher risk of transformation to AML. In&#xD;
      addition, hematopoietic precursors from patients with advanced MDS more frequently express&#xD;
      the multi-drug resistance (MDR1) gene product P-glycoprotein, possibly explaining the low&#xD;
      response rates and short duration of responses in this group after conventional induction&#xD;
      therapies. A Phase III trial of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor valspodar in combination with&#xD;
      mitoxantrone, etoposide and cytarabine in relapsed or refractory AML and high-risk MDS failed&#xD;
      to show improved outcomes with P-glycoprotein inhibition. As such, novel therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies to overcome the intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy seen in advanced MDS are&#xD;
      needed to improve induction chemotherapy as primary therapy and as a bridge to allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the relatively long survival and low rate of progression to AML seen in patients with&#xD;
      IPSS Low and INT-1 risk disease, allogeneic transplant is typically reserved for those who&#xD;
      fail conservative management with erythropoiesis stimulating agents, G-CSF, hypomethylating&#xD;
      agents such as azacitidine or decitabine, lenalidomide, or immune suppression therapy. For&#xD;
      patients 60 years of age and younger with advanced MDS (INT-2, High), allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplant is the most appropriate therapy as it prolongs life expectancy.&#xD;
      Due to advanced age and significant co-morbidities, allogeneic hematopoietic transplant is&#xD;
      not an appropriate treatment modality for a large number of patients with advanced MDS. In&#xD;
      addition, stem cell donors are not available for all patients. For patients with advanced&#xD;
      MDS, hypomethylating agents or enrollment on clinical trials are both appropriate treatment&#xD;
      options given the poor outcomes in this patient population. A phase III open-label,&#xD;
      randomized trial of azacitidine versus conventional care regimens in advanced MDS showed&#xD;
      superior overall survival for patients treated with azacitidine (24.5 versus 15.0 months, HR&#xD;
      0.58; 95% CI 0.43-0.77). Although decitabine has activity in MDS, it has not been shown to&#xD;
      prolong survival in advanced MDS to date. In a phase III study comparing decitabine to&#xD;
      supportive care, decitabine showed a superior response rate and delayed the time to the&#xD;
      development of AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthracyclines in AML therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthracycline chemotherapy agents (daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone) are highly active&#xD;
      in AML and are an essential part initial induction therapy in those fit for intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The optimal dose of anthracycline to maximize response and survival while&#xD;
      preserving safety is still being determined. For daunorubicin, a Phase III randomized study&#xD;
      of younger patients ages 17 to 60 years with AML demonstrated that standard dose cytarabine&#xD;
      100 mg/m2 daily for 7 days in combination with daunorubicin 90 mg/m2 daily for 3 days was&#xD;
      superior to daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 daily for 3 days with improved complete remission rates&#xD;
      (70.6% vs. 57.3%, p&lt;0.001) and median overall survival (23.7 vs. 15.7 months, p=0.003).&#xD;
      Toxicity was not significantly different between the two groups. A similar Phase III study in&#xD;
      AML patients 60 years of age or older compared daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 to 90 mg/m2 for 3 days&#xD;
      in combination with cytarabine 200 mg/m2 daily for 7 days. Although the complete remission&#xD;
      rate was higher in patients receiving the 90 mg/m2 daunorubicin dose (64% vs 54%, p=0.002),&#xD;
      no difference was seen in survival. Notably, patients aged 60-65 years receiving higher&#xD;
      daunorubicin dose had superior complete remission rates, event-free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival. To date, no head-to-head comparisons of daunorubicin at 60 mg/m2 versus 90 mg/m2&#xD;
      have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histone deacetylases and their inhibitors in AML and MDS&#xD;
&#xD;
      HDAC inhibitors have shown activity in Phase I monotherapy trials for AML and advanced MDS. A&#xD;
      Phase I trial of panobinostat as monotherapy in primarily AML yielded transient hematologic&#xD;
      responses with reduction in peripheral blood blast counts in 8 of 11 patients consistent with&#xD;
      the documented in vitro activity of the drug. Major toxicities included nausea, diarrhea,&#xD;
      hypokalemia, anorexia, thrombocytopenia and reversible QTcF prolongation. Similar responses&#xD;
      with rare complete responses have also been seen with the HDAC inhibitors romidepsin and&#xD;
      MGCD0103 in AML and MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synergy between HDAC inhibitors and anthracyclines&#xD;
&#xD;
      As monotherapy, HDAC inhibitors are unlikely to impact the treatment of AML and advanced MDS&#xD;
      although there is a strong biologic rationale for use of these agents in combination&#xD;
      therapies. By inhibiting deacetylation of histones, HDAC inhibitors generate a more open&#xD;
      chromatin structure more susceptible to the DNA damaging effects of anthracycline&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents, in some instances when administered 48 hours after the HDAC&#xD;
      inhibitor. In vitro, HDAC inhibitors potentiate the cytotoxic effects of anthracyclines in&#xD;
      leukemia cell lines. Panobinostat, specifically, acts synergistically with the anthracycline&#xD;
      doxorubicin to induce DNA damage, increase histone acetylation and activate programmed cell&#xD;
      death in AML cell lines and primary AML cells. The administration of the anthracycline&#xD;
      daunorubicin with panobinostat is predicted to be synergistic in vivo and may improve&#xD;
      complete response and relapse rates for AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper sequencing of HDAC inhibitors with anthracyclines will likely be important to the&#xD;
      success of these combinations. Pretreatment with HDAC inhibitors prior to anthracycline&#xD;
      exposure may provide synergistic effects as well by increasing nuclear DNA exposure to&#xD;
      anthracycline. In cultured MCF-7 breast cancer cells, treatment with the HDAC inhibitor&#xD;
      vorinostat leads to chromatin decondensation which is maximal after 48 hours of HDAC&#xD;
      inhibitor treatment. In this system, co-administration of vorinostat and epirubicin did not&#xD;
      lead to increased apoptosis whereas 48 hour pre-incubation with vorinostat led to synergistic&#xD;
      increases in apoptosis associated with increased nuclear accumulation of epirubicin and&#xD;
      increased DNA damage. In AML, maximal epigenetic effects appear to occur at about 48 hours&#xD;
      after HDAC inhibitor exposure as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticancer activity of DAC inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alterations in chromosome structure play critical roles in the control of gene transcription.&#xD;
      These epigenetic alterations include modification of histones and others proteins by&#xD;
      acetylation and/or phosphorylation. Normally, these modifications are balanced finely and are&#xD;
      highly reversible in normal tissues, but they may be imbalanced and heritable in tumor cells.&#xD;
      DAC inhibitors increase histone acetylation, thereby modulating the expression of a subset of&#xD;
      genes in a coordinated fashion. Several tumors suppressor genes associated with the malignant&#xD;
      phenotype are repressed by epigenetic mechanisms in sporadic cancers. Thus therapy with DAC&#xD;
      inhibitors may alter tumor phenotype and inhibit growth in such tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple hallmarks of cancer are regulated by acetylation/deacetylation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DAC inhibition targets both histone and nonhistone proteins. Targeting the acetylation&#xD;
           status of nonhistone, tumor-associated proteins that mediate proliferation may be the&#xD;
           underlying antitumor mechanism of DAC inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nonhistone proteins regulated by acetylation include α-tubulin, p53, HIF-1α, and HSP90.&#xD;
           These proteins are substrates of DACs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ability of a single agent to target multiple molecular features of tumor cells may&#xD;
           result in good efficacy against a range of different tumor types.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HSP90 is involved in protein stability and degradation; the inhibition of HSP90 affects&#xD;
           protein turnover in diseases such as multiple myeloma and B-cell malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acetylated HIF-1α is degraded and can no longer act as a tumor growth factor. Class II&#xD;
           DAC inhibitors target histone deacetylase (HDAC or DAC) 6, resulting in increased&#xD;
           acetylation of HIF-1α and decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thereby&#xD;
           inhibiting angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both acetylation and ubiquitylation often occur on the same lysine residue, but these&#xD;
           processes cannot occur simultaneously. Acetylation allows for increased stability, and&#xD;
           ubiquitylation leads to protein degradation. Therefore, DACs decrease the half-life of a&#xD;
           protein by exposing the lysine residue for ubiquitylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panobinostat (LBH589)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panobinostat (LBH589) is a deacetylase inhibitor (DACi) belonging to a structurally novel&#xD;
      cinnamic hydroxamic acid class of compounds. It is a potent class I/II pan-DAC inhibitor&#xD;
      (pan-DACi) that has shown anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical models and cancer patients.&#xD;
      Deacetylases (DAC) target lysine groups on chromatin and transcription factors and various&#xD;
      non-histone proteins such as p53, tubulin, HSP90 and Rb. Panobinostat is formulated as an&#xD;
      oral capsule and a solution for intravenous (i.v.) injection. Both the oral and i.v.&#xD;
      formulations are currently being investigated in ongoing Phase I and Phase II studies in&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibition of DAC provides a novel approach for cancer treatment. Histones are part of the&#xD;
      core proteins of nucleosomes, and acetylation and deacetylation of these proteins play a role&#xD;
      in the regulation of gene expression. Highly charged deacetylated histones bind tightly to&#xD;
      the phosphate backbone of DNA, inhibiting transcription, presumably, by limiting access of&#xD;
      transcription factors and RNA polymerases to DNA. Acetylation neutralizes the charge of&#xD;
      histones and generates a more open DNA conformation. This conformation allows transcription&#xD;
      factors and associated transcription apparatus access to the DNA, promoting expression of the&#xD;
      corresponding genes. The opposing activities of two groups of enzymes, histone&#xD;
      acetyltransferase (HAT) and DAC control the amount of acetylation. In normal cells a balance&#xD;
      exists between HAT and DAC activity that leads to cell specific patterns of gene expression.&#xD;
      Perturbation of the balance produces changes in gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several lines of evidence suggest that aberrant recruitment of DAC and the resulting&#xD;
      modification of chromatin structure may play a role in changing the gene expression seen in&#xD;
      transformed cells. For example, silencing of tumor suppressor genes at the level of chromatin&#xD;
      is common in human tumors and DAC complexes have been shown to be crucial to the activity of&#xD;
      the AML-specific fusion proteins PLZF-RAR-α, PML-RAR-α, and AML1/ETO. DAC inhibitors (DACi)&#xD;
      have been shown to induce differentiation, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in cultured tumor&#xD;
      cells, and to inhibit the growth of tumors in animal models. In addition, DACi have been&#xD;
      shown to induce expression of p21, a key mediator of cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and&#xD;
      cellular differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor growth inhibition and apoptosis in response to DACi treatment may also be mediated&#xD;
      through changes in acetylation of non-histone proteins (e.g., HSP90, p53, HIF-1α, α-tubulin).&#xD;
      For example, the chaperone protein HSP90 has been shown to be acetylated in cells treated&#xD;
      with DACi. Acetylation of HSP90 inhibits its ability to bind newly synthesized client&#xD;
      proteins, thus preventing proper client protein folding and function. In the absence of HSP90&#xD;
      function, misfolded proteins are targeted for degradation in the proteasome. Many proteins&#xD;
      that require HSP90 association are critical to cancer cell growth, including ErbB1, ErbB2,&#xD;
      AKT, Raf, KDR, and BCR-ABL. Acetylation of HSP90 in cells treated with DACi inhibits the&#xD;
      chaperone function of HSP90, leading to degradation of the client proteins and eventual cell&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential clinical utility of the use of DACi in cancer therapy was first suggested by&#xD;
      the activity of the DACi, sodium phenylbutyrate, against acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).&#xD;
      An adolescent female patient with relapsed APL, who no longer responded to all trans-retinoic&#xD;
      acid (ATRA) alone, achieved a complete clinical remission after treatment with a combination&#xD;
      of ATRA and the DACi sodium phenylbutyrate.&#xD;
