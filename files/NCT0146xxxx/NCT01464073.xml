      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 3 of physical exercise training&#xD;
      programs, with a supplementation in fruits and vegetables, on body composition. 126 women&#xD;
      will be randomized into 3 groups (42 subjects per group). The first program will be conducted&#xD;
      at a relatively low intensity of effort, corresponding to the maximum rate of lipid oxidation&#xD;
      (LIPOXmax)measured by indirect calorimetry. The second program will be at 60% of VO2peak and&#xD;
      the third program will be prescribed according to the Good Practices physical Guidelines (30&#xD;
      minutes per day at a moderate intensity). All subjects will receive a free supplement of 5&#xD;
      fruits and vegetables per day during all the intervention. The intervention will last 5&#xD;
      months in total.&#xD;

      Background: in Reunion Island, in 2000 the REDIA study showed a prevalence of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      among 30-69 years old people above 17%, a prevalence of obesity among women of 20% and 10%&#xD;
      for men. According to the literature upon preventive strategies and/or treatment of metabolic&#xD;
      diseases, regular physical activity associated with a balanced diet and an intake of fruits&#xD;
      and vegetables, can reduce body fat mass and prevent the complications related to obesity.&#xD;
      These complications are partly related to the inflammatory and oxidative stress that&#xD;
      accompanies obesity. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables, may improve the inflammatory and&#xD;
      oxidative status. However there is no consensus on the intensity of regular physical activity&#xD;
      in the practices of prevention and care. These parameters are generally not individualized.&#xD;
      International recommendations cover a wide range of exercise intensity (between 40% and 60%&#xD;
      of maximal oxygen uptake). The research group of Jacques Mercier (CERAMM Lapeyronie-CHU&#xD;
      Montpellier) showed the benefit of the training conducted at a relatively low intensity of&#xD;
      effort, corresponding to the maximum rate of lipid oxidation (LIPOXmax), and its effects on&#xD;
      the fat mass, the insulin sensitivity and the muscle metabolism, in overweight or obese&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: to study the effects of three programs of rehabilitation training associated&#xD;
      with a diet supplemented with fruits and vegetables, on reducing body fat in overweight or&#xD;
      obese people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: to study the effects on the oxidative stress and the inflammatory&#xD;
      status, compare the efficacy of these 3 programs of physical training on body composition&#xD;
      modifications, insulin sensitivity, lipid utilization during exercise and quality of life,&#xD;
      describe feasibility in population (compliance, motivation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract: according to data from the literature, a balanced diet combined with moderate&#xD;
      exercise helps to fight against biological complications related to obesity and to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of type 2 diabetes by promoting fat loss. But there is no consensus on the&#xD;
      intensity of physical activity prescribed. Have been shown the benefits of training performed&#xD;
      at an individualized intensity of effort, relatively low, corresponding to the maximum rate&#xD;
      of lipid oxidation measured by indirect calorimeter (LIPOXmax) on fat loss, sensitivity to&#xD;
      insulin and muscle metabolism in obese or diabetic patients. However, an individualized&#xD;
      LIPOXmax exercise training has not yet been compared to a standardized training&#xD;
      conventionally used in the treatment of obese subjects. Furthermore, no study has yet&#xD;
      evaluated the impact of LIPOXmax training on inflammatory and antioxidant status among&#xD;
      overweight and obese patients. We propose to compare among overweight or obese patients, the&#xD;
      effects of an individualized training at an intensity corresponding to LIPOXmax, the effects&#xD;
      of a standardized training to 60% of VO2max, and the effects of a moderate and regular&#xD;
      physical activity prescribed according to guidelines of Good Medical Practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At M0 participants will have anthropometric and functional examinations and laboratory tests,&#xD;
      and will follow nutritional education sessions. They will be then randomized into 3 arms: arm&#xD;
      1 LIPOXmax physical activity, arm 2 60% VO2max physical activity, arm 3 physical activity&#xD;
      according to guidelines of Good Medical Practices. Participants of the arms 1 and 2 will&#xD;
      practice under the control of a sports instructor; participants of the arm 3 will be&#xD;
      regularly monitored by telephone. The procedure will last 5 months. At M3 and M5&#xD;
      anthropometric and biological examinations will be replicated and participants will answer to&#xD;
      questionnaires on quality of life and experience of physical activity during and after the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: body fat mass reduction, in kilograms and in % of total weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: improvement of biological parameters (markers of inflammation and&#xD;
      antioxidant status, blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin, cholesterol, HDL / LDL, triglycerides);&#xD;
      improvement in body composition (weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, muscle&#xD;
      mass), and in lipid utilization during exercise; improvement of the quality of life;&#xD;
      demonstration of the feasibility in population (adherence, compliance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: controlled, randomized, of superiority, not blind trial in 126 people divided&#xD;
      into three arms of 42 people per arm: arm 1 LIPOXmax intensity of effort, arm 2 60% of VO2max&#xD;
      intensity of effort, arm 3 intensity of effort according to the Guidelines of Good Medical&#xD;
      Practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: the 126 subjects will undergo the following exams: weight, height, waist and&#xD;
      hip circumference, blood pressure, body fat measurement by impedancemetry and biphotonic&#xD;
      absorptiometry, maximal cardiopulmonary exercise and effort metabolic test (by indirect&#xD;
      calorimeter to determine the LIPOXmax and the crossing points of the substrates), laboratory&#xD;
      tests (blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin, cholesterol total, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, CRP,&#xD;
      albumin, creatinine, urinary parameters, antioxidant status, inflammatory markers);&#xD;
      questionnaires about medical history and sociodemographic data; food survey (frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire, quantization by photos), questionnaires on physical activity (Baecke amended),&#xD;
      quality of life (SF-36), experience of physical activity. All the participants will have an&#xD;
      initial nutritional education session and will receive a free supplement of 5 fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables per day during all the intervention, and random urine assays will be performed to&#xD;
      monitor the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Participants will be randomized into three&#xD;
      arms. Arm 1: LIPOXmax arm. Subjects will perform a physical activity 4x1 hour per week at the&#xD;
      optimal intensity for fat oxidation (LIPOXmax) measured by indirect calorimeter. Arm 2:&#xD;
      physical activity standard arm (60% of VO2max measured by cardio respiratory exercise test).&#xD;
      Subjects will realize 4 sessions per week and duration of sessions will be adjusted so that&#xD;
      arms 1 and 2 have the same total energy expenditure by session. Arm 3: control arm. The&#xD;
      subjects initially receive the recommendations of good medical practice for physical activity&#xD;
      (achieving at least 3h30min per week of &quot;moderate&quot; exercise). The intervention will last 5&#xD;
      months in total. For arms 1 and 2: physical activity on ergo meter bicycle controlled by a&#xD;
      sports trainer, with the goal of gradual empowerment. For arm 3: self-directed activities&#xD;
      with regular telephone follow-up, holding of a book on physical activities and use of a&#xD;
      pedometer during walking sessions. Indemnization: all the participants will receive a monthly&#xD;
      allowance for the constraints due to their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects: to highlight a difference in average change of 1.5 kg fat mass, with a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 2.0 kg, a first species risk of 1.67% (5% / 3), a power of 80%, it is&#xD;
      necessary to include 38 subjects. In such circumstances it will be possible to demonstrate a&#xD;
      theoretical minimum significant difference between arms of: - 2.3% on changes at 5 month of&#xD;
      average percentage of body fat (SD = 3%) and - 3.8 kg on changes at 5 months of average&#xD;
      weight (SD = 5 kg). Due to missing data (dropouts, lost) rate estimated at 10%, it is planned&#xD;
      to include 42 subjects per arm, or 126 in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: single analysis in intention to treat (arms assigned by the&#xD;
      randomization). Overall first species risk = 5%. Bilateral formulation of statistical tests.&#xD;
      Statistical methods used: bivariate analysis (one factor ANOVA, Pearson Chi2 test or Fisher&#xD;
      test), multivariate analysis (ANCOVA, logistic regression). Taking into account the&#xD;
      longitudinal data (M0-M3-M5) with generalized estimating equations (GEE). Graphic&#xD;
