      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometriosis is a relatively common chronic gynecological condition that affects&#xD;
      approximately 10% of all women of reproductive age. It is a pelvic inflammatory disease that&#xD;
      is characterized by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside of the uterine&#xD;
      cavity. Typical symptoms of endometriosis include dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and infertility;&#xD;
      the severity of pain associated with this disease often leads to a considerable decrease in&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment for severe pelvic pain and infertility is to surgically remove&#xD;
      endometriotic areas. Identifying all endometriotic lesions is paramount to &quot;optimal&#xD;
      endometriosis debulking.&quot; The inability to see all endometriosis lesions has been thought to&#xD;
      be a factor for patients with little or no relief following surgery. Using the Narrow Band&#xD;
      Imaging (NBI) method has the potential to improve visualization of endometriosis lesions,&#xD;
      assist in debulking and thus, result in improved clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NBI is a technique that uses a specific narrow wavelength of light to change the normal color&#xD;
      contrasts of the endoscopic image and improve detection of neovascularization, which is the&#xD;
      pathological feature of endometriosis for both superficial and deeper vascularization. This&#xD;
      type of imaging has the potential to offer improved discrimination of lesions, increasing&#xD;
      diagnostic yield as well as resulting in more complete debulking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of a pilot study of 21 patients conducted at Mercy Medical Center demonstrated&#xD;
      that use of NBI resulted in the diagnosis of pathologically-proven endometriosis among 4&#xD;
      patients whose lesions were missed with visible white light only examination. In addition,&#xD;
      the number of confirmed endometriosis lesions increased with the use of NBI in addition to&#xD;
      white light. The study also suggested that NBI may assist in discriminating endometriosis&#xD;
      from other lesions, thus reducing false positives: one patient had no lesions detected with&#xD;
      NBI and the lesions biopsied based on visible white light examination were not endometriosis&#xD;
      at pathologic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesion discrimination under white light examination based on lesion color has been previously&#xD;
      described in the literature. Red (also known as clear and/or pink) lesions are considered to&#xD;
      be active and early lesions on endometriosis. White lesions may indicate areas of fibrosis&#xD;
      and may be latent or dormant lesion of endometriosis. The red and white lesions are also&#xD;
      known as the &quot;subtle&quot; lesions of endometriosis. Black (also known as brown, chocolate green,&#xD;
      purple or blue) represent a more severe stage of the disease. Black lesions are also known as&#xD;
      &quot;gunshot&quot; or &quot;powder-burn&quot; lesions and are considered the &quot;typical&quot; lesions of endometriosis.&#xD;
      Mixed color lesions can include a mixture of any color. It has been speculated that the&#xD;
      subtle lesions of endometriosis are more likely to be positive lesions and to be missed under&#xD;
      white light examination. The red lesions are also considered to have more vessels of smaller&#xD;
      diameter and may also include peritoneal microlesions and therefore may be more easily&#xD;
      detected under NBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a multi-center study with the following primary aims to&#xD;
      determine the degree to which NBI improves the detection and diagnosis of endometriosis&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the degree to which NBI improves the diagnosis of endometriosis (diagnostic&#xD;
           yield) of laparoscopic examinations compared to use of visible white light-only&#xD;
           laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if NBI improves sensitivity in the detection of potential endometriosis&#xD;
           lesions and reduces false positives compared to visible white light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the impact of the use of NBI, and presumed more complete removal of endometriotic&#xD;
      lesions, compared to use of white light examination on reported severity of pain at 6-weeks,&#xD;
      3-months, and 6 months following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study would significantly advance the state of art for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of endometriosis. Improved detection and treatment of endometrial lesions should&#xD;
      translate to a significant health benefit to women suffering from endometriosis. Potential&#xD;
      health benefits include improved diagnosis of the etiology of pelvic pain, therefore guiding&#xD;
      appropriate treatment management for women with pelvic pain due to endometriosis and improved&#xD;
      debulking of lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study design is a multisite randomized controlled device trial conducted in two&#xD;
      clinical centers. Women will be randomized to have laparoscopic examination with white light&#xD;
      followed by NBI (white light/NBI) examination or white light followed by repeat white light&#xD;
      examination (white light/white light). Women of reproductive age (&lt;50 years of age)&#xD;
      undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy for pelvic pain, suspected endometriosis, or infertility&#xD;
      will be eligible. A systematic examination covering the four quadrants of the pelvis will be&#xD;
      conducted using white light followed by either NBI or white light to identify and document&#xD;
      endometriotic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of NBI in addition to white light examination will improve the diagnostic yield of&#xD;
      endometriotic lesions at the time of laparoscopy compared to only using white light&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of NBI in addition to white light examination will improve the sensitivity of&#xD;
      detecting endometriotic lesions and reduce false positives at laparoscopy compared to only&#xD;
      using white light examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondarily, the use of NBI will be associated with a greater reduction in pain at the&#xD;
      6-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up compared to the use of white light examination alone&#xD;
      because of improved lesion identification and debulking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pass/Fail Criteria for Primary Aims. In this randomized clinical trial, failure is defined as&#xD;
      no statistically significant difference in the primary outcomes of diagnostic yield or&#xD;
      sensitivity between the white only examination arm and the white light followed by NBI&#xD;
      examination arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methods The investigators will test the hypotheses by conducting a&#xD;
      multicenter device trial. Participants will be randomized to either white light/NBI or white&#xD;
      light/white light at a 3:1 ratio. In both study groups, each of the quadrants of the pelvis&#xD;
      will first be examined by white light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a full exam is performed using the white light with lesion location documented with&#xD;
      photographs, a randomization envelope will be opened to reveal the patient's second modality&#xD;
      (NBI or white light). Each area will then be inspected by this second modality with&#xD;
      photographs taken for each quadrant, documenting lesion location. All identified lesions in&#xD;
      areas amenable to resection will then be resected, labeled by method of detection, and sent&#xD;
      for pathologic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are the comparison of the diagnostic yield, sensitivity, and false&#xD;
      positive rate of visible white light (white light/white light) versus NBI (white light/NBI)&#xD;
      based on pathology gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator Training:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be trained on the visualization of endometriosis under NBI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Viewing WL and NBI images of potential endometrial lesions of various types&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The procedural use of NBI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of study forms to ensure data integrity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating surgeons and assistants from each site will be trained on the procedural&#xD;
      use of NBI by Olympus and the coordinating center. A minimum of three cases of patients&#xD;
      suspected to be positive for endometriosis will be watched by surgeons and coordinators from&#xD;
      remaining sites. The training surgeon will perform the sweep through the quadrants of the&#xD;
      pelvis. Each area will be viewed under white light. The training surgeon will ask the&#xD;
      surgeons to identify suspicious areas that they would biopsy. Then the training surgeon will&#xD;
      switch to NBI and once again ask the training surgeons to identify suspicious areas that they&#xD;
      would biopsy. This will be done to ensure that all participating surgeons are able to&#xD;
      identify suspicious areas under both imaging modalities to learn what potential endometrial&#xD;
      lesions look like under NBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olympus will visit each site prior to the first procedure and train the assistant(s) on the&#xD;
      completion of the study case report forms. Olympus will also monitor adherence to the&#xD;
      protocol and the completion of the first study case report forms during the time of study&#xD;
      start (first patient enrollment) to ensure the surgeon is performing the procedure according&#xD;
      to the protocol and that the assistant is accurately capturing all of the required&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population will include women of reproductive age undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy for&#xD;
      suspected endometriosis. The study population may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergoing initial diagnostic laparoscopy for pelvic pain, suspected&#xD;
           endometriosis or infertility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients previously evaluated with laparoscopy undergoing repeat laparoscopy for&#xD;
           suspected recurrence or onset of endometriosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be recruited through the gynecologic practices of the participating physicians. At&#xD;
      the pre-surgery visit, patients will be informed of the purpose of the study as well as the&#xD;
      risks and benefits of the procedure and will be asked to sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent, women will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire&#xD;
      to obtain information on demographic characteristics, medication history, and symptoms. A&#xD;
      10-centimeter (cm) visual analog scale and a validated endometriosis symptom questionnaire&#xD;
      [the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30)] will also be administered to assess pain. The&#xD;
      EHP-30 is an instrument specifically designed to measure pain and quality of life among women&#xD;
      diagnosed with endometriosis. The EHP-30 consists of a core questionnaire with 30 items and&#xD;
      five scales and six modular parts consisting of 23 questions. The EHP-30 has demonstrated&#xD;
      both high reliability and validity.&#xD;
&#xD;

        -  OLYMPUS HD EndoEYE Video Telescope (Models WA50011A, WA50013A, WA50013L, WA50013T,&#xD;
           WA50015L) or OLYMPUS HD EndoEYE Laparo-Thoraco Videoscope LTF-VHOLYMPUS CLV-180 EVIS&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  SONY HD recorder PDW-70MD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Printers OEP-4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laparoscopic examination will be conducted in a standardized fashion with visible white&#xD;
      light (standard), followed by an additional sweep with either white light (control) or NBI.&#xD;
      The second look examination will be determined by random assignment after completion of the&#xD;
      first examination with white light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination will include visualizing each quadrant of the pelvis (Right Anterior, Right&#xD;
      Posterior, Left Posterior, Left Anterior).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each area will first be viewed and photographed under white light. The absence or presence of&#xD;
      suspected endometrial lesions will be noted. If suspected lesions are seen, the number of&#xD;
      lesions, the extent of the lesions and the surgeon's confidence in the lesion being&#xD;
      endometriosis will be recorded. Photographs will be labeled by quadrant and all lesions will&#xD;
      be circled and numbered. Clinicians will record their degree of confidence on a 5 point&#xD;
      likert scale that the lesion to be excised is a lesion of endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following visualization, photographic identification and documentation of the quadrants under&#xD;
      white light has been completed, the study coordinator will open the randomization envelope&#xD;
      and reveal the second modality to be used. The physician will then repeat the exam and&#xD;
      photographs with either white light (control) or under NBI (switching on NBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Again, under the second modality, the absence or presence of suspected endometrial lesions&#xD;
      will be noted. If suspected lesions are seen, the number of lesions, the extent of the&#xD;
      lesions, the lesion color and the surgeon's confidence in the lesion being endometriosis will&#xD;
      be recorded. A photograph will be taken, labeled and all lesions will be circled and&#xD;
      numbered. Clinicians will record their degree of confidence on a 5 point likert scale that&#xD;
      the lesion to be excised is a lesion of endometriosis. The surgeon will record if the lesion&#xD;
      was also visualized under the 1st imaging modality or under only one of the modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order at which the areas are examined through the sweep will be at the surgeon's&#xD;
      discretion. Examination by both sweeps will be photographed. Photos of all areas and detected&#xD;
      lesions will be printed, labeled and lesions will be circled and numbered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All suspected endometrial lesions will be included in the analysis, even lesions that may be&#xD;
      latent or healed (otherwise known as white lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once both exams are complete, additional areas of the abdomen can be evaluated at the&#xD;
      surgeon's discretion; those randomized to white light only will continue with only white&#xD;
      light examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All lesions detected by either method that are amenable to resection will be numbered and&#xD;
      biopsied. Data collected will include location, method of detection and clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      confidence score. Pathologists will be masked to method of detection (NBI versus white&#xD;
      light).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesions will be recorded according as falling within three categories: visible white&#xD;
      light-detected only; NBI-detected only; or both NBI- and visible white light-detected.&#xD;
      Pathology will be performed at each center following a standardized protocol for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of endometriosis. Pathologists at each institution will be masked to the method of&#xD;
      examination used to identify the specimen. All discordant lesions (visualized under only one&#xD;
      imaging modality), a random 10% sample of specimens and a random 10% of images from each&#xD;
      center will be re-reviewed by a central independent reviewer at the coordinating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesions that are not amendable to resection will be photographed only and will not be&#xD;
      included in the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient baseline questionnaire: symptoms, medication history, demographic information,&#xD;
           pain measurement (including 10-cm visual analog scale and EHP-30)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Photo documentation of each light examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Case report forms:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recording of location of lesion by method of examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Notation of lesion color&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical impression of detected lesions - degree of confidence on a scale of 1 to 5&#xD;
                that the lesions observed are endometriosis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Notation of lesions excised&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Photographic documentation of lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in surgical treatment (larger excision/smaller excision/organ removal) based&#xD;
                on results of visualization under the different imaging modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pathology reports&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Medical record review&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Provider questionnaire: planned follow-up treatment after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Follow-up questionnaires for pain at 6-weeks, 3-months and 6-months; follow-up surveys&#xD;
           will include both the 10-cm visual analog scale and the EHP-30&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Control:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control will be maintained by standardizing the protocols across the centers. As&#xD;
      stated above, in each patient, the locations of all lesions suspected to be endometriosis&#xD;
      detected with each modality will be documented with photographs. All discordant lesions (seen&#xD;
      under only one imaging modality) and a random 10% sample of the images and specimen samples&#xD;
      from each center will be re-reviewed by a central independent reviewer at the coordinating&#xD;
      center. The results between the site physician and the central reviewer will be compared. If&#xD;
      the site and central reviewer have disagreement on the photographed lesion or pathology,&#xD;
      adjudication will be performed between the site and the central reviewer. If a consensus&#xD;
      still cannot be reached, a third party (surgeon and/or pathologist (from the remaining site)&#xD;
      will be used as the tie breaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Procedure Subjects will be assigned to one of two groups in a stratified&#xD;
      randomized design. All subjects will undergo a white light examination followed by either a&#xD;
      second examination with white light or an examination using NBI. Investigators will be&#xD;
      blinded to second look imaging method until after the initial white light examination is&#xD;
      complete. Randomization to either white light/NBI or white light/white light will occur at a&#xD;
      3:1 ratio. Each site is treated as independent and subjects will be combined across sites for&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization table will be generated using Microsoft Excel at the beginning of study&#xD;
      recruitment. The randomization number will be a three digit number and will form the last 3&#xD;
      digits of the study ID. Sealed envelopes will be provided to each site by the coordinating&#xD;
      center to be opened after the initial white light examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size in the original protocol for this study was calculated as described in section&#xD;
      12.1 below. Because data from a third site of this multicenter trial (Atlanta Northside) will&#xD;
      not be used, the total sample size goal (N = 170) in the original protocol will not be&#xD;
      reached. Mercy was approved by the IRB in September 2012 to enroll 100 patients total; the&#xD;
      Chicago site is approved to enroll 57 patients. Thus, the total sample size goal has been&#xD;
      revised to 157; minimal detectable differences under the conditions of 90% power are&#xD;
      described in section 12.2 below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations from original protocol, dated 5/14/2010&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations were based on the primary outcomes of diagnostic yield and&#xD;
      sensitivity as well as the secondary outcome of impact on pain symptoms. The sample size is&#xD;
      largely driven by the primary outcome of diagnostic yield. A sample size of 170 will provide&#xD;
      90% power to detect an improvement in diagnostic yield of 20% (95% CIs 72%-85% white light&#xD;
      and 95%-100% NBI), based on a randomization scheme of 3:1 for white light/NBI versus white&#xD;
      light/white light examination. This sample size takes into consideration a 25% drop out/not&#xD;
      evaluable rate for the following reasons: incomplete visualization of the pelvis, loss to&#xD;
      follow-up for pain assessment or patients not evaluable for pain assessment (a subset of&#xD;
      infertility patient who may not have pain as a presenting symptom).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sample size provides 90% power to detect an average increase of one additional&#xD;
      endometriosis lesion with the NBI examination (white light/NBI group) compared to white light&#xD;
      only examination (white light/white light group). To note, this power calculation was based&#xD;
      on data from the pilot study that showed an average of 2 lesions (per patient) found using&#xD;
      white light and 3 lesions (per patient) detected using NBI; the calculation assumes a common&#xD;
      standard deviation of 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data used for sample size calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic yield: The calculations for sample size were based on information obtained from a&#xD;
      pilot study that examined patients using white light followed by NBI during diagnostic&#xD;
      laparoscopy. In that study, 4 additional patients were diagnosed with endometriosis with the&#xD;
      addition of NBI to white light examination for an absolute improvement of 27% (4/15 patients&#xD;
      with endometriosis were found with NBI examination only) (Barrueto and Audlin, 2008). Using&#xD;
      these data, sample size calculations were conducted using nQuery 6.01 (Elashoff, 2005) for a&#xD;
      two group chi-square test with unequal Ns (3:1 ratio). A two group chi-square test with a&#xD;
      0.05 two-sided significance level will have 90% power to detect the difference between a&#xD;
      Group 1 (white light/white light) diagnostic yield of 0.79 and a Group 2 (white light/NBI)&#xD;
      diagnostic yield of 0.99 when the sample sizes in each group are 34 and 101, respectively (a&#xD;
      total sample size of 135).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity and false positive rate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pilot study, 15 of 20 patients examined were diagnosed with endometriosis on&#xD;
      histology. All 15 patients were detected with NBI and white light. Four patients were&#xD;
      diagnosed by lesions that were detected only with NBI. Based on these data, the estimated&#xD;
      sensitivities of white light and NBI are 73% and 100% respectively. Given these sensitivities&#xD;
      and the small total sample size, 95% confidence intervals are wide (48%-90% white light and&#xD;
      80%-100% NBI). At the lesion level, pilot data have shown an average of 2 lesions seen under&#xD;
      white light compared to an average of 3 lesions using NBI. Using a common standard deviation&#xD;
      of 1, the current sample size has at least 90% power to detect an average difference of at&#xD;
      least one additional lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain difference:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also consider pain reduction as a clinically relevant outcome. A recently&#xD;
      published study by Abbott et al (2003) reported that participants undergoing laparoscopy for&#xD;
      potential endometriosis on average rated non-menstrual pelvic pain prior to surgery as 6 on a&#xD;
      10-point visual analogue scale, with 10 being the worst pain. In the Abbott et al (2003) and&#xD;
      other similar studies, laparoscopic surgery using white light was shown to be associated with&#xD;
      a 30% reduction in pain at 6 month follow up and 50%-75% at 12 month follow up with&#xD;
      increasing variance (Abbott et al., 2004, Jarrell et al., 2005). An RCT from Jarrell et al.&#xD;
      (2005) showed a reduction in pain score of 1.9 (SD 0.5) at 6 month follow up and 2.6 (SD 0.5)&#xD;
      at 12 month follow up, although the sample size of this study was small (N=16 overall, N=7&#xD;
      for laparoscopy arm). This study will test the hypothesis that NBI will result in an&#xD;
      additional 20% decrease in pain compared to what has been observed in these previously&#xD;
      published studies examining the reduction in pain using white light laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the unbalanced randomization design with 1 patient randomized to white light/white&#xD;
      light for every 3 patients randomized to white light/NBI , a two group t-test with a 0.050&#xD;
      two-sided significance level will have 90% power to detect the difference in pain change with&#xD;
      a Group 1 (white light/white light) mean change of 1.9 and a Group 2 (white light/NBI) mean&#xD;
      of 2.28, a difference in means of 0.38 with a common SD of 0.5, when the sample sizes in the&#xD;
      two groups are 25 and 75, respectively (a total sample size of 100). We project that the&#xD;
      majority of patients enrolled (over 70%) will be symptomatic with pelvic pain despite the&#xD;
      indication for surgery (i.e. pelvic pain or infertility). Only 1 of the 2 study center sites&#xD;
      has a significant population of women undergoing laparoscopy for evaluation and treatment of&#xD;
      infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amended sample size The sample size of the study has been adjusted downward to 157 due to the&#xD;
      loss of one of the study centers for accrual. The revised sample size considers the outcomes&#xD;
      of diagnostic yield and sensitivity of clinical determination of identified lesions at the&#xD;
      time of surgery, by modality. A review of the first 69 patients enrolled and assigned to the&#xD;
      combined white light/NBI arm shows an average detection rate for any lesion to be 4.2 per&#xD;
      patient using NBI versus 2.9 per patient with white light. The minimal detectable difference&#xD;
      in diagnostic yield and sensitivity was determined using nQuery 6.01 (Elashoff, 2005). With&#xD;
      the current projected sample size of 157 patients, the minimal detectable difference between&#xD;
      the two modalities, with 90% power, in diagnostic yield proportions and sensitivity estimates&#xD;
      is 12.2%. Thus, the power of the study remains sufficient to detect a clinically meaningful&#xD;
      difference in detection of endometriosis by white light and NBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis The investigators hypothesize that NBI will improve detection of endometriosis&#xD;
      lesions thus improving the diagnosis of endometriosis. For the primary outcome of diagnostic&#xD;
      yield, the reference standard will be the pathologic confirmation of excised lesions where&#xD;
      any one lesion within an individual detected by either method will confirm the diagnosis of&#xD;
      endometriosis. The investigators will address the detection of endometriosis by comparing the&#xD;
      diagnostic yield of the white light/white light group versus the white light/NBI group. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a McNemar's test for the proportion comparison, which accounts for the&#xD;
      pairing of assessment within a participant and makes no assumptions about the distribution of&#xD;
      samples. At the lesion level, the investigators will assess the average change in the number&#xD;
      of lesions detected between the white light/white light group to the white light/NBI group&#xD;
      using independent samples t-test. The investigators will also calculate and compare the&#xD;
      sensitivities and false positive rates for the white light/white light group and the white&#xD;
      light/NBI group. Pain across the study period will be assessed by comparing average change in&#xD;
      pain score (using both the VAS and the EHP-30 scores) between the two groups. The difference&#xD;
      in average pain change scores will be assessed using an independent samples t-test.&#xD;
      Differences in average pain between baseline and follow-up will be assessed using paired&#xD;
      t-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management A copy of the consent form will be sent to the Data Coordinating Center&#xD;
      (DCC). Report forms will be sent by fax or electronically (secured/encrypted) to the DCC data&#xD;
      entry. The data will be checked for consistency by using selected double entry where 1/10th&#xD;
      of the entered data will be re-entered and checked for errors. Data cleaning procedures will&#xD;
      be done using SAS with extensive program files to ensure the correctness of skip patterns and&#xD;
      responses. After baseline information is collected and entered, an analysis will be done to&#xD;
      confirm comparable baseline characteristics across the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hard copies of questionnaires and interview records will be locked in file cabinet with&#xD;
      limited keyed access to research personnel. Computer data files are also kept on the Mercy&#xD;
      Medical Center Intranet in a password protected file that is accessible only by research&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any results from this study will be published using data from the group as a whole. No&#xD;
      individual will be identified in any reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks/Benefits Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks/Discomforts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      White light examination is the current standard of care. NBI itself does not incur any&#xD;
      additional risk. However, the use of NBI may result in the identification of additional&#xD;
      lesions and thus incur the risk of additional resection at the time of laparoscopy.&#xD;
      Additional sites identified for biopsy using NBI have no additional risks for removal as&#xD;
      compared to white light. Lesions identified which are associated with higher risk structures&#xD;
      such as the bowel and the diaphragm will not be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is uncertain to what extent participants may benefit clinically and this will be clearly&#xD;
      stated in the consent form. If diagnosis of endometriosis is improved, then patients may&#xD;
      benefit from improved medical management. If additional lesions are identified and resected,&#xD;
      patients may benefit from an improved clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal from protocol All participants are informed that taking part in this study is&#xD;
      completely voluntary and they have the right to not participate. If they do not want to join&#xD;
      the study, or if they wish to withdraw from the study, they will still receive the same&#xD;
      quality of medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modifications to the Protocol Any modifications to the protocol will be sent to the IRB for&#xD;
      approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Deviations The IRB (and other review boards as required for this study) will be&#xD;
      notified of any protocol deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems The protocol has minimal&#xD;
      additional risks beyond the usual risks associated with diagnostic laparoscopy. Should any&#xD;
      unanticipated problems develop, the investigators will attend to/address the problem and&#xD;
      notify institutional IRBs and the sponsor.&#xD;
