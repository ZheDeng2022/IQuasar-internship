      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a blockage of the main vein that carries blood&#xD;
      away from the retina in the back of the eye. It can lead to macular edema, a swelling of the&#xD;
      retina that is a common source of vision loss. Studies suggest that inflammation might be a&#xD;
      cause. Minocycline is a drug that might help prevent cells involved in inflammation from&#xD;
      becoming activated. It is approved for use as an antibiotic, but it has not yet been tested&#xD;
      to see if it can treat CRVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of minocycline as a treatment for central retinal vein&#xD;
      occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have central retinal vein occlusion in at least&#xD;
      one eye, with vision between 20/32 and 20/200.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study lasts 2 years, with at least 25 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have blood tests and an eye exam. One eye will be selected as the study eye to receive&#xD;
           the medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take minocycline or a placebo pill twice a day, about 12 hours apart,&#xD;
           for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have monthly visits for blood tests and full eye exams to study the&#xD;
           effect of the treatment. Other exams may include thyroid tests and eye imaging studies.&#xD;
           Those in the study may also receive injections of a drug to prevent the growth of new&#xD;
           blood vessels in the eye.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinal vein occlusions (RVOs) are significant sources of vision loss, affecting mostly&#xD;
      healthy people over 55 years of age. The common source of vision loss is the macular edema&#xD;
      accompanying the retinal injury. Very recently, studies employing monthly anti-vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments have demonstrated a benefit to this line of&#xD;
      treatment; however, the duration of effectiveness appears to be short lived and the length of&#xD;
      time needed for these monthly injections remains unknown. A histologic study of human retinas&#xD;
      with retinal vein occlusions found the presence of activated microglia. Microglia are capable&#xD;
      of migrating through the retina to sites of inflammation to associate closely with neurons&#xD;
      and the vasculature, and are key cellular players in the mediation of processes of chronic&#xD;
      inflammation. For these reasons, microglia represent a promising cellular target for forms of&#xD;
      therapy that limit the deleterious inflammatory changes found in vein occlusions.&#xD;
      Minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline, has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties, including microglial inhibition. The objective of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      the safety and potential efficacy of minocycline as a microglia inhibitor in participants&#xD;
      with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 10 and a maximum of 20 participants who meet the eligibility criteria may be&#xD;
      enrolled. Eligibility criteria include: foveal center-involved macular edema secondary to a&#xD;
      CRVO, retinal thickness in the central subfield &gt;350 microns as measured by optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT); and visual acuity (VA) between 20/32 and 20/200 in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot, double-masked, randomized multi-center study, participants will receive&#xD;
      monthly bevacizumab injections for the first three months, followed by PRN dosing. In&#xD;
      addition, participants will take an oral dose of 100 mg of minocycline or placebo twice daily&#xD;
      for 24 months. During each monthly visit, participants will have their visual acuity measured&#xD;
      and will undergo OCT testing to measure retinal thickness. At the Month 3 visit and&#xD;
      thereafter, participants will be evaluated for improvement and worsening and will be eligible&#xD;
      for additional bevacizumab treatment and/or investigational product (IP) depending on which&#xD;
      criteria they fulfill. Additionally, at Month 12, participants will also be evaluated for no&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the difference in mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA),&#xD;
      as measured in ETDRS letters, between the minocycline and placebo groups in the study eye at&#xD;
      12 months compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes include the difference between the&#xD;
      minocycline and placebo groups in the number of intravitreal bevacizumab injections between&#xD;
      12 and 24 months and baseline, changes in mean macular sensitivity as measured by&#xD;
      microperimetry at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline, the mean change in BCVA at&#xD;
      24 months compared to baseline, changes in retinal thickness as measured by OCT at 6, 12, 18&#xD;
      and 24 months compared to baseline, number of participants improving greater than or equal to&#xD;
      1 logOCT scale step at 12 and 24 months compared to baseline, as well as and changes in fluid&#xD;
      leakage in the macula as demonstrated by fluorescein angiography at 12 and 24 months compared&#xD;
      to baseline. Safety outcomes include the number of participant withdrawals, number and&#xD;
      severity of systemic and ocular toxicities and the number of adverse events (AEs).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible, the following participant-level inclusion criteria must be met, where&#xD;
        applicable:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must understand and sign the protocol s informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding&#xD;
             and must be willing to undergo serum (BRC sites only) and urine pregnancy tests&#xD;
             throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the NEI Site: Female participants of childbearing potential and male participants&#xD;
             able to father children must have (or have a partner who has) had a hysterectomy or&#xD;
             vasectomy, be completely abstinent from intercourse or must agree to practice two&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception throughout the course of the study and for one&#xD;
             week after study medication discontinuation (based on the half life of minocycline&#xD;
             which is 11-22 hours). Acceptable methods of contraception include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills*, injected hormones, dermal&#xD;
                  patch or vaginal ring),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  intrauterine device,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  barrier methods (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or tubal ligation).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Oral birth control pills must be used with caution as minocycline decreases&#xD;
                       the effectiveness of some oral contraceptives. Participants already taking&#xD;
                       oral contraceptives may continue to use them, but must agree to use at least&#xD;
                       one other method of birth control while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the BRC Sites: Female participants of childbearing potential and male participants&#xD;
             able to father children must have (or have a partner who has) had a hysterectomy or&#xD;
             vasectomy, or be completely abstinent from intercourse. Male participants or male&#xD;
             partners (of female participants) who have not had a vasectomy or are not abstinent&#xD;
             are required to use a condom with spermicide throughout the course of the study and&#xD;
             for one week after study medication discontinuation (based on the half life of&#xD;
             minocycline which is 11-22 hours). Female participants of childbearing potential or&#xD;
             female partners (of male participants) of childbearing potential must practice one of&#xD;
             the below acceptable methods of contraception throughout the course of the study and&#xD;
             for one week after study medication discontinuation:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills*, injected hormones, dermal&#xD;
                  patch or vaginal ring),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  intrauterine device,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  barrier methods (e.g., diaphragm) with spermicide, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or tubal ligation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Abstinence is only acceptable when it is the participant s preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
        choice. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation&#xD;
        methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        *Oral birth control pills must be used with caution as minocycline decreases the&#xD;
        effectiveness of some oral contraceptives. Participants already taking oral contraceptives&#xD;
        may continue to use them, but must agree to use at least one other method of birth control&#xD;
        while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        It should be noted that two forms of contraception (as specified above) will be used by&#xD;
        sexually active participants for the duration of the study and for one week after study&#xD;
        medication discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must agree to notify the study investigator or coordinator if any of&#xD;
             their doctors initiate a new medication during the course of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have normal renal function and liver function, or have mild&#xD;
             abnormalities not above grade 1 as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs&#xD;
             v4.0 (CTCAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must agree to minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays and to&#xD;
             wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and sunscreen (minimum SPF 15) if s/he must be&#xD;
             out in the sun.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has at least one eye that meets the study eye criteria listed in the Study&#xD;

             that had retinal hemorrhage or other biomicroscopic evidence of RVO (e.g.,&#xD;
             telangiectatic capillary bed) and a dilated (or previously dilated) venous system in&#xD;
             at least three quadrants of the retina drained by the affected vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye has retinal thickness in the central subfield on baseline OCT&#xD;
             measurement &gt; 350 microns, as measured by Zeiss Cirrus spectral domain OCT, or an&#xD;
             equivalent retinal thickness on a similar OCT machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye has media clarity and pupillary dilation sufficient for adequate fundus&#xD;
             photographs. Furthermore, the participant must be able to cooperate during the&#xD;
             procedure for accurate fundus photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        STUDY EYE EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than CRVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
             --An eye should not be considered eligible if:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The macular edema is considered to be related to cataract extraction or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinical examination and/or OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface disease&#xD;
                  (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) is the primary cause of&#xD;
                  the macular edema or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinical examination, medical history and/or fluorescein angiography suggest that&#xD;
                  diabetic retinopathy is the primary cause of the edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye has a history of a recurrent RVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye has a history of RVO present for &gt;18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A brisk afferent pupillary defect (APD) is present in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An ocular condition (other than RVO) is present such that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, visual acuity would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g.,&#xD;
             foveal atrophy, pigmentary changes, dense subfoveal hard exudates, laser scar at&#xD;
             fovea, non-retinal condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An ocular condition (other than RVO) is present that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of&#xD;
             the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,&#xD;
             neovascular glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be&#xD;
             decreasing visual acuity by three lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing&#xD;
             acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal) is present in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye has had panretinal or sectoral scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within&#xD;
             four months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye has had pars plana vitrectomy within six months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye has undergone major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction,&#xD;
             scleral buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within three months prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) capsulotomy has been performed on the study eye within&#xD;
             two months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye has had treatment &lt;3 months prior to study entry of intravitreal or&#xD;
             periocular steroid injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye has had treatment &lt; 28 days prior to study entry of intravitreal&#xD;
             anti-VEGF agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        STUDY EYE SELECTION CRITERIA IN CASES OF BILATERAL DISEASE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        If both eyes of a participant meet the criteria described above, the study eye will be&#xD;
        determined at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
