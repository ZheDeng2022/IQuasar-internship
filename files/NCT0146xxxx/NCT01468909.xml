  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel when given together with or&#xD;
      without pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating patients with ovarian epithelial, fallopian&#xD;
      tube, or peritoneal cavity cancer that is persistent or has come back. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow&#xD;
      to the tumor or by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known&#xD;
      whether paclitaxel is more effective when given with or without pazopanib hydrochloride in&#xD;
      treating ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cavity cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the progression-free survival hazard ratio of the combination of weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel and pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) compared to weekly paclitaxel and placebo&#xD;
      in patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate and compare the proportion of patients responding to therapy by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), cancer antigen 125 (CA125) response, the&#xD;
      overall survival (OS), and the duration of response in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the association between plasma cytokines and angiogenic markers and&#xD;
      progression-free and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and&#xD;
      progression-free and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and&#xD;
      placebo orally (PO) daily on days 1-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel as in Arm I and pazopanib hydrochloride PO daily on days&#xD;
      1-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
