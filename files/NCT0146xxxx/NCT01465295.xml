      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study a new method of treatment for patients who are&#xD;
      diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis and have abnormal and increasing curvature of the spine.&#xD;
      The treatment consists of the surgical implantation of a new medical device called the&#xD;
      &quot;HemiBridge™ Clip&quot;. This medical implant device has never been used in humans. SpineForm,&#xD;
      LLC, the developer of the HemiBridgeTM System has designed this scientific clinical trial, to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of the use of this device in humans. Information collected from patients&#xD;
      treated with this new device shall be used to determine the initial safety of the new device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved the use of the HemibridgeTM System for this research study in 6 (six)&#xD;
      pediatric patients who have idiopathic scoliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure is intended to stop additional curvature of the spine by redirecting growth of&#xD;
      the bones of the spine (vertebrae). To accomplish this, the patient undergoes a surgical&#xD;
      procedure to securely attach small metal clips (HemiBridge™ Clips) to the outer side of each&#xD;
      vertebra involved in the curvature. The HemiBridge™ Clip forms a &quot;bridge&quot; between each&#xD;
      vertebra and is intended to hold the vertebrae in place to prevent the spine from curving any&#xD;
      further.&#xD;

      Significance Spinal deformity fusion treatment involves some of the most costly and invasive&#xD;
      procedures in orthopaedics. The development of an effective treatment method to avoid fusion&#xD;
      is needed. Many pediatric spine specialists concur that growth modulation displays compelling&#xD;
      pre-clinical and clinical data that must be studied further. While bracing is the only&#xD;
      non-operative modality with any evidence of effectiveness for idiopathic scoliosis, its level&#xD;
      of effectiveness compared to observation or natural history remains inconclusive. Research&#xD;
      has been published for over 50 years, yet conflicting literature reports both successes and&#xD;
      failures. Most literature consists of retrospective reports of bracing experience, with&#xD;
      little commonality relative to existing conditions at the time bracing is initiated,&#xD;
      documentation of compliance and basis for judging success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent panel of private-sector&#xD;
      experts in primary care and prevention. The Task Force was convened by the U.S. Public Health&#xD;
      Service to systematically review the evidence of effectiveness of clinical preventive&#xD;
      services. One of their charges was to evaluate the evidence supporting the practice of school&#xD;
      screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. After systematically reviewing the literature&#xD;
      to date, their policy statement issues in 1992, and updated in 1996 states &quot;…There is&#xD;
      inadequate evidence to determine whether brace therapy limits the natural progression of the&#xD;
      disease in a significant proportion of cases, as most studies suffer from selection bias,&#xD;
      lack of internal control groups, inadequate follow-up, small sample sizes, and lack of health&#xD;
      outcome measures.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no Level One evidence to support the practice of bracing, and clinicians are left&#xD;
      with conflicting and questionable inferences regarding bracing effectiveness. Some clinicians&#xD;
      believe the evidence favors a decrease in the rate of curve progression, and based on this&#xD;
      assumption, over half the states in the U.S. have mandated school screening programs for the&#xD;
      detection and early treatment of scoliosis. On the other hand, groups such as the USPSTF, its&#xD;
      British and Canadian counterparts and many individual practitioners worldwide feel the&#xD;
      evidence is inconclusive and are therefore ambivalent about brace treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the variability in published results on brace effectiveness, researchers in the United&#xD;
      States and Canada have commenced a randomized multi-center trial of bracing versus no bracing&#xD;
      to determine the effectiveness of brace wear in the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis (BRAIST&#xD;
      Study). This study, which was initiated in 2007 in the United States, is being performed&#xD;
      under the auspices of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Canadian Institute of&#xD;
      Health. In the Netherlands, a randomized multi-center study comparing bracing to observation&#xD;
      is also underway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While bracing treatment is non-invasive and preserves growth, motion and function of the&#xD;
      spine, it does not correct the deformity. In addition, the brace pressure on the rib cage and&#xD;
      the influence on the chest wall in a growing child create concerns. Some scoliosis patients&#xD;
      wear a brace for as long as five years only to learn that brace treatment failed and then&#xD;
      recommended to endure major fusion surgery and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When surgery (fusion and instrumentation) is required for scoliosis, internal fixation of the&#xD;
      spine to achieve correction and bony fusion is performed. Surgical correction via posterior&#xD;
      fusion is typically performed for curves greater than 40 - 50°, often with accompanying&#xD;
      discectomy and release of the anterior longitudinal ligaments for curves greater than 75°.&#xD;
      Smaller incisions or use of portals for anterior surgery became available in the early 1990's&#xD;
      with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Potential advantages include less muscular&#xD;
      and chest wall disruption, less impact on pulmonary function, quicker recovery time and&#xD;
      smaller scars. Arlet (2000) completed a meta-analysis of 10 articles with a total of 151&#xD;
      patients, where VATS was utilized in scoliosis surgery. Of the 151 patients, 18% (27&#xD;
      complications) experienced major and minor complications, including major bleeding (3),&#xD;
      prolonged ventilation (10), pulmonary complications (6), intercostal neuralgia (number not&#xD;
      specified), aborted procedure (3), and one each chylothorax, infection, and tachycardia. A&#xD;
      conclusion could not be drawn as to whether the complication rate is increased or decreased&#xD;
      with VATS. The correction rate was similar to open thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoliosis fusion surgery involves extensive posterior and/or anterior spine exposure with&#xD;
      associated risks, frequent blood transfusions (2 to 4 units), high postoperative pain, loss&#xD;
      of motion of the treated segment, and slow rehabilitation. The child also has potential&#xD;
      life-long complications that do not present for several years after surgery, including&#xD;
      adjacent segment disease or degeneration that in many cases requires additional surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Andersen conducted a study of 100 braced and 115 surgical patients with idiopathic scoliosis&#xD;
      10 years after the treatment was completed. The SF-36 scores (patient physical and mental&#xD;
      health assessment) did not differ between the two groups; however, both group's scores were&#xD;
      lower than age-matched normal controls. Results for the braced patients indicated that 17%&#xD;
      felt that the brace was so unpleasant that they would rather take the chance of curve&#xD;
      progression than wear a brace. Of the braced patients, 71% indicated that they would have&#xD;
      preferred an operation (fusion) to a brace. More than two of three patients didn't wear the&#xD;
      brace as prescribed due to skin irritation. Other investigators have refuted the impact of&#xD;
      bracing on the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, neither bracing nor surgical fusion treatments represent an ideal treatment of&#xD;
      idiopathic scoliosis. As such, there is a need for idiopathic scoliosis treatments that&#xD;
      address the population of patients whose curvature is unlikely to be corrected via bracing&#xD;
      but for whom the risks of less invasive non-fusion surgical treatment may be exceeded by the&#xD;
      potential benefit in avoiding lifelong progression or an extensive fusion surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HemiBridge™ System is indicated for progressive idiopathic scoliosis (Lenke Type 1A or&#xD;
      1B) in skeletally immature (Risser Grade 0 and triradiate cartilage open) patients by&#xD;
      mechanically modulating spinal growth (hemiepiphysiodesis) and arresting spinal deformity&#xD;
      progression without the need for spinal fusion. The HemiBridge™ System is intended to be&#xD;
      placed at contiguous levels through an anterior thoracoscopic procedure on the convex side of&#xD;
      a main thoracic curve that measures 25° to 40°, where the end of the vertebrae of the curve&#xD;
      spans levels inclusive of or between T3 and L1. The HemiBridge™ System is intended for males&#xD;
      and females with a chronologic age of 10 years and older. Females with an Atlas Matching bone&#xD;
      age ≥ 8 years and 10 months not to exceed 13 years (or pre-menarche) and males with an Atlas&#xD;
      Matching bone age ≥ 10 years not to exceed 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation The study device, named the HemiBridgeTM System, is the result of extensive&#xD;
      pre-clinical research and development initiated by Donita Bylski-Austrow, PhD and Eric Wall,&#xD;
      MD both of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati.&#xD;
      Research and development of the study device to date has used an interdisciplinary team,&#xD;
      including pediatric spine surgeons, engineers, scientists and regulatory experts. This team&#xD;
      has helped define the compressive loading required to alter growth, tested prototype devices&#xD;
      in preclinical models, improved the test articles for clinical use, and confirmed repeatable&#xD;
      in-vivo results in compliance with FDA Good Laboratory Practices. This process has led to the&#xD;
      approval of a study device that has achieved FDA and IRB approvals to begin clinical phase&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HemiBridge System's innovation is in its ability to apply mechanical hemiepiphysiodesis&#xD;
      to redirect spine growth and developed to accommodate adolescent physiologic loading while&#xD;
      remaining securely fastened to the spinal motion segment. Additionally, the System includes&#xD;
      innovative patient safety and surgeon interface features. The surgical technique and&#xD;
      instrumentation were co-developed by SpineForm LLC and the Orthopaedics Department at&#xD;
      Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of mechanical hemiepiphysiodesis to treat progressive scoliosis challenges&#xD;
      the use of external bracing and/or observation (watchful waiting). Comparing the pooled rates&#xD;
      for these two non-operative interventions shows no clear advantage of either approach;&#xD;
      therefore, one cannot recommend one non-operative approach over the other to prevent the need&#xD;
      for surgery in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Arresting curve progression with the&#xD;
      HemiBridge System and avoiding fusion may significantly impact quality of life while reducing&#xD;
      total lifetime patient care cost. Providing patients with a surgical alternative that is&#xD;
      superior to the current non-operative standard of care is a paradigm shift that must be&#xD;
      studied further to determine its safety and indications for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study protocol design is limited to patients at the highest risk of progressing&#xD;
      to needing multi-level fusion surgery. There are no medical devices cleared by the FDA to&#xD;
      treat late juvenile or early adolescent onset of idiopathic scoliosis. The HemiBridge System&#xD;
      is the first mechanical compression device FDA approved for pediatric investigational use.&#xD;
      The proposed study is the first use in humans of the HemiBridge System. The clinical trials&#xD;
      will enable the study sponsor to gather prospective information to continuously improve the&#xD;
      product, its indications, the next study phase clinical protocol design and recommended&#xD;
      surgical technique.&#xD;
