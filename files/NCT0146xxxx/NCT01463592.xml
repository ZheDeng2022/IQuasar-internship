  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic HCV infection is one of the common causes of the chronic liver disease. Approximately&#xD;
      6-10% of the general public is expected to be suffering from this infection. In case that&#xD;
      these patients are not treated at an appropriate time, these patients develop the sequelae of&#xD;
      the chronic liver disease e.g. cirrhosis of liver, Ascites, and Hepatocellular carinoma.&#xD;
      Interferon alpha 2 a or alpha 2b injections and Ribavirin combination is the treatment of&#xD;
      choice for people suffering from Chronic HCV infection and this combination need to be&#xD;
      administered for 6-12 months. Interferons are biological agents and are to be administered&#xD;
      parenterally. Interferons are expensive and are associated with number of minor and major&#xD;
      adverse effects. Ribavirin is also associated with significant adverse effects. These&#xD;
      compounds cannot be considered as one of the ideal forms of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, quite a few natural products have been tested to assess their hepatoprotective&#xD;
      activity and possibly anti viral activity as well. These include Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid),&#xD;
      Vitamin E, Zinc, Silymarin, Red beet roots, crushed licorice and etc. etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Iodine , Potassium iodide and Ascorbic acid are natural products used in the&#xD;
      management of Thyroiditis and chronic cutaneous fungal infections. This combination of iodine&#xD;
      compounds along with ascorbic acid is being used for the management of chronic hepatitis B &amp;&#xD;
      C in the central Asian states e.g. Kazakhstan etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have conducted a feasibility study in which oral Iodine Compound&#xD;
      {RENESSANS} was given to patients suffering HCV related Chronic Active Hepatitis and&#xD;
      anti-viral activity and safety has been analyzed. In this study, RENESSANS containing regimen&#xD;
      has been well tolerated by all the patients and has shown some antiviral activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will assess whether the administration of RENESSANS {oral }&#xD;
      improves the antiviral activity in patients receiving standard interferon therapy.&#xD;

      1. Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of combination therapy&#xD;
           comprising of RENESSANS, INTERFERONS and RIBAVIRIN in the management of treatment na√Øve&#xD;
           HCV related Chronic Active Hepatitis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Determine the biochemical or virological improvement in patients suffering from HCV&#xD;
                related Chronic Active Hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Determine the safety and tolerability of Renessans {oral} when administered as a&#xD;
                part of antiviral activity outlined in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary endpoint will be the number of subjects achieving&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Virological response as evident by Rapid Viral Response(RVR), Early Viral&#xD;
                Response(EVR) and Sustained Viral Response(SVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Biochemical response as evident by normalization of ALT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary endpoint will be&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Assessment of the safety and tolerability of RENESSANS through: routine physical&#xD;
           examination, routine clinical laboratory tests, clinical monitoring and adverse events&#xD;
           reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
