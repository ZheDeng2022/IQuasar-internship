      Establish normative data of ElMindA's Brain Network Activation (BNA) using evoked response in&#xD;
      two age groups: adolescents and young adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no reliable, practical, and non-invasive method for assessing changes in&#xD;
      electrophysiological activity of the brain associated with brain-related pathologies, e.g.,&#xD;
      concussion, ADHD, autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), etc. Event Related Potentials (ERPs),&#xD;
      which are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of cells in specific&#xD;
      regions of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a method, as they&#xD;
      provide both a noninvasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs provide excellent&#xD;
      temporal information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally been limited.&#xD;
      However, by using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial resolution for&#xD;
      ERPs is improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will combine&#xD;
      neurophysiological knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern recognition&#xD;
      methods (BNA) to temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and&#xD;
      synchronization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need of objective measures that will help the clinician in its decision making in&#xD;
      brain-related pathologies is recognized. BNA is a new imaging modality that has been&#xD;
      developed to fill this gap.&#xD;
