  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients who are unable to receive surgery or having local advanced esophageal cancer&#xD;
      stages, concurrent chemoradiotherapy is recommended. But radiotherapy is the main strategy&#xD;
      for older patients because of their chemoradiotherapy intolerance. The whole world focused on&#xD;
      targeted therapy which has strong specialties and mild toxicities. So combined targeted&#xD;
      therapy and radiotherapy may be a novel strategy for older patients with esophageal cancer.&#xD;
      Nimotuzumab is a EGFR monoclonal antibody. This clinical trial is to study the effect and&#xD;
      safety of Nimotuzumab in combined with radiotherapy for older patients with esophageal&#xD;
      cancer. All patients receive intensity modulated radiotherapy with conventional fraction.&#xD;
      Nimotuzumab with 200mg is given weekly for all patients during radiotherapy.&#xD;
