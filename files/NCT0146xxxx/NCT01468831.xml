      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is a blockage of the small veins that carry blood away&#xD;
      from the retina in the back of the eye. It often leads to macular edema, a swelling of the&#xD;
      retina that is a common source of vision loss. Studies suggest that inflammation might be a&#xD;
      cause. Minocycline is a drug that might help prevent cells involved in inflammation from&#xD;
      becoming activated. It is approved for use as an antibiotic, but it has not yet been tested&#xD;
      to see if it can treat BRVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of minocycline as a treatment for branch retinal vein&#xD;
      occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have branch retinal vein occlusion in at least one&#xD;
      eye, with vision between 20/32 and 20/200.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study lasts 2 years, with at least 25 visits. Participants must agree to protect&#xD;
           themselves from sunlight or artificial ultraviolet rays while in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have blood tests and an eye exam. One eye will be selected as the study eye to receive&#xD;
           the medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those in the study will take minocycline or a placebo pill twice a day, about 12 hours&#xD;
           apart, for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have monthly visits for blood tests and full eye exams to study the&#xD;
           effect of the treatment. Other exams may include thyroid tests and eye imaging studies.&#xD;
           Those in the study may also receive injections of a drug to prevent the growth of new&#xD;
           blood vessels in the eye.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinal vein occlusions (RVO) are significant sources of vision loss, affecting mostly&#xD;
      healthy people over 55 years of age. The common source of vision loss is the macular edema&#xD;
      accompanying the retinal injury. Very recently, studies employing monthly anti-vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments have demonstrated a benefit to this line of&#xD;
      treatment; however, the duration of effectiveness appears to be short lived and the length of&#xD;
      time needed for these monthly injections remains unknown. A histologic study of human retinas&#xD;
      with RVOs found the presence of activated microglia. Microglia are capable of migrating&#xD;
      through the retina to sites of inflammation to associate closely with neurons and the&#xD;
      vasculature, and are key cellular players in the mediation of processes of chronic&#xD;
      inflammation. For these reasons, microglia represent a promising cellular target for forms of&#xD;
      therapy that limit the deleterious inflammatory changes found in vein occlusions.&#xD;
      Minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline, has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties, including microglia inhibition. The objective of this study is to investigate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of minocycline as a microglia inhibitor in participants with branch&#xD;
      retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of ten and a maximum of 20 participants who meet the eligibility criteria may be&#xD;
      enrolled. Eligibility criteria include: foveal center-involved macular edema secondary to a&#xD;
      BRVO, retinal thickness in the central subfield greater than 350 microns as measured by&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual acuity (VA) between 20/32 and 20/200 in the&#xD;
      study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot, double-masked, randomized, multi- center study, participants will receive&#xD;
      monthly bevacizumab injections for the first three months, followed by PRN dosing. In&#xD;
      addition, participants will take an oral dose of 100 mg of minocycline or placebo twice daily&#xD;
      for 24 months. During each monthly visit, participants will have their visual acuity measured&#xD;
      and will undergo OCT testing to measure retinal thickness. At the Month 3 visit and&#xD;
      thereafter, participants will be evaluated for &quot;improvement&quot; and &quot;worsening&quot; and will be&#xD;
      eligible for additional bevacizumab treatment and/or investigational product (IP) depending&#xD;
      on which criteria they fulfill. Additionally, at Month 12, participants will also be&#xD;
      evaluated for no improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the difference in mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA),&#xD;
      as measured in ETDRS letters, between the minocycline and placebo groups in the study eye at&#xD;
      12 months compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes include the difference between the&#xD;
      minocycline and placebo groups in the number of intravitreal bevacizumab injections between&#xD;
      12 and 24 months and baseline, changes in mean macular sensitivity as measured by&#xD;
      microperimetry at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline,&#xD;
&#xD;
      the mean change in BCVA at 24 months compared to baseline, the changes in retinal thickness&#xD;
      as measured by OCT at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline, number of participants&#xD;
      improving greater than or equal to 1 logOCT scale step at 12 and 24 months compared to&#xD;
      baseline, as well as changes in fluid leakage in the macula as demonstrated by fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography at 12 and 24 months compared to baseline. Safety outcomes include the number of&#xD;
      participant withdrawals, the number and severity of systemic and ocular toxicities and the&#xD;
      number of adverse events.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible, the following inclusion criteria must be met, where applicable:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must understand and sign the protocol s informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding&#xD;
             and must be willing to undergo serum (BRC sites only) and urine pregnancy tests&#xD;
             throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the NEI Site: Female participants of childbearing potential and male participants&#xD;
             able to father children must have (or have a partner who has) had a hysterectomy or&#xD;
             vasectomy, be completely abstinent from intercourse or must agree to practice two&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception throughout the course of the study and for one&#xD;
             week after study medication discontinuation (based on the half life of minocycline&#xD;
             which is 11-22 hours). Acceptable methods of contraception include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injected hormones, dermal&#xD;
                  patch or vaginal ring),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  intrauterine device,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  barrier methods (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or tubal ligation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Oral birth control pills must be used with caution as minocycline decreases the&#xD;
        effectiveness of some oral contraceptives. Participants already taking oral contraceptives&#xD;
        may continue to use them, but must agree to use at least one other method of birth control&#xD;
        while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the BRC Sites: Female participants of childbearing potential and male participants able&#xD;
        to father children must have (or have a partner who has) had a hysterectomy or vasectomy,&#xD;
        or be completely abstinent from intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male participants or male partners (of female participants) who have not had a vasectomy or&#xD;
        are not abstinent are required to use a condom with spermicide throughout the course of the&#xD;
        study and for one week after study medication discontinuation (based on the half life of&#xD;
        minocycline which is 11-22 hours). Female participants of childbearing potential or female&#xD;
        partners (of male participants) of childbearing potential must practice one of the below&#xD;
        acceptable methods of contraception throughout the course of the study and for one week&#xD;
        after study medication discontinuation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills*, injected hormones, dermal patch or&#xD;
             vaginal ring),&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. intrauterine device,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. barrier methods (e.g., diaphragm) with spermicide, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or tubal ligation).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Abstinence is only acceptable when it is the participant s preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle choice. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Oral birth control pills must be used with caution as minocycline decreases the&#xD;
             effectiveness of some oral contraceptives. Participants already taking oral&#xD;
             contraceptives may continue to use them, but must agree to use at least one other&#xD;
             method of birth control while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             It should be noted that two forms of contraception (as specified above) will be used&#xD;
             by sexually active participants for the duration of the study and for one week after&#xD;
             study medication discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must agree to notify the study investigator or coordinator if any of&#xD;
                  their doctors initiate a new medication during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participant must have normal renal function and liver function or have mild&#xD;
                  abnormalities not above grade 1 as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
                  Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participant must agree to minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays and&#xD;
                  to wear protective clothing, sunglasses and sunscreen (minimum SPF 15) if s/he&#xD;
                  must be out in the sun.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participant has at least one eye that meets the study eye criteria listed in&#xD;
                  Section 3.2.&#xD;

             participant can become eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participant is currently being treated with systemic anti-VEGF agents or systemic&#xD;
                  steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participant had a cerebral vascular event (CVA) or myocardial infarction (MI)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Participant has a history of thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Study Eye Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -The participant must have at least one eye meeting all inclusion criteria and none of&#xD;
             the exclusion criteria listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Study Eye Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The study eye has a best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score between 78 and&#xD;
                       34 letters (i.e., between 20/32 and 20/200).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The study eye shows evidence of definite retinal thickening due to a BRVO&#xD;
                       based on clinical examination involving the center of the macula that is not&#xD;
                       refractory to further therapy as based on the investigator s clinical&#xD;
                       judgment. BRVO is defined as an eye that had retinal hemorrhage or other&#xD;
                       biomicroscopic evidence of RVO (e.g., telangiectatic capillary bed) and a&#xD;
                       dilated (or previously dilated) venous system in one or two quadrants or&#xD;
                       less of the retina drained by the affected vein. Hemiretinal vein occlusion&#xD;
                       (HRVO) is an RVO that involves two altitudinal quadrants. In this study,&#xD;
                       eyes with a HRVO will be considered a BRVO and are given the same treatment&#xD;
                       as BRVO eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The study eye has retinal thickness in the central subfield on baseline OCT&#xD;
                       measurement &gt;350 microns, as measured by Zeiss Cirrus spectral domain OCT,&#xD;
                       or an equivalent retinal thickness on a similar OCT machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The study eye has media clarity and pupillary dilation sufficient for&#xD;
                       adequate fundus photographs. Furthermore, the participant must be able to&#xD;
                       cooperate during the procedure for accurate fundus photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Study Eye Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The study eye has macular edema considered to be due to a cause other than&#xD;
                       BRVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  An eye should not be considered eligible if:&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  The macular edema is considered to be related to cataract extraction,&#xD;
                            or&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Clinical examination and/or OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface&#xD;
                            disease (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) is the&#xD;
                            primary cause of the macular edema, or&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Clinical examination, medical history and/or fluorescein angiography&#xD;
                            suggest that diabetic retinopathy is the primary cause of the edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  The study eye has a history of a recurrent RVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  The study eye has a history of RVO present for &gt; 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  A brisk afferent pupillary defect (APD) is present in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  An ocular condition is present in the study eye such that, in the&#xD;
                            opinion of the investigator, visual acuity would not improve from&#xD;
                            resolution of macular edema&#xD;
&#xD;
                            (e.g., foveal atrophy, pigmentary changes, dense subfoveal hard&#xD;
                            exudates, laser scar at fovea, non-retinal condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  An ocular condition (other than RVO) is present that, in the opinion of&#xD;
                            the investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity&#xD;
                            during the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
                            (e.g., uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular&#xD;
                            glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).&#xD;
