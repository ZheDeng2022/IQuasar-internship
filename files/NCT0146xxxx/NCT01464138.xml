      This is an open label uncontrolled study to determine the efficacy of fosmidomycin and&#xD;
      clindamycin when co-administered orally over three days in the treatment of acute&#xD;
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoints will be the cure rate on Day 28 (PCR corrected). The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be the cure rate on Day 7 and the parasite and fever clearance times.&#xD;

      An open label uncontrolled study to determine the efficacy of fosmidomycin and clindamycin&#xD;
      when co-administered orally over three days in the treatment of acute uncomplicated&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoints will be the cure rate on Day 28 (PCR corrected). The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be the cure rate on Day 7 and the parasite and fever clearance times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population A total of 40 children will be recruited into the study. Sample size&#xD;
      calculations have been made on the basis that this trial aims at substantiating the efficacy&#xD;
      results obtained in children in Gabon. In the largest trial of this drug combination done in&#xD;
      Gabon, 51 children were recruited, and the per-protocol, PCR-adjusted day 28 cure rate was&#xD;
      89% (42/47; 95% CI, 77 to 96%). Based on this expected 90% efficacy estimate, a sample size&#xD;
      of 35 children produces a two-sided 95% confidence interval with a an estimated precision of&#xD;
      20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allowing for an attrition rate of 10% for non-evaluable subjects, a sample size of 40&#xD;
      subjects will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints Primary The primary endpoint will be the cure rate on Day 28 (PCR corrected).&#xD;
      Secondary The secondary endpoints will be the cure rate on Day 7 and the parasite and fever&#xD;
      clearance times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria during treatment (classified as therapeutic failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe deterioration in clinical condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signs of severe malaria, according to WHO criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onset of drug related serious adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeated vomiting within one hour of re-dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation criteria after completion of treatment (classified as therapeutic failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistent parasitaemia at 96 hours after initiation of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parasitaemia during follow-up period after initial clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No reduction of parasitaemia within 48 hours after initiation of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onset of drug related serious adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation criteria after completion of treatment (not classified as therapeutic&#xD;
      failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal of guardian consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss to follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol violation Procedure for treatment The study drugs will be administered under&#xD;
           direct supervision by a study clinician or nurse in doses of fosmidomycin 30mg/kg/dose +&#xD;
           clindamycin 10mg/kg/dose twice daily for three days (total daily dose fosmidomycin&#xD;
           60mg/kg, clindamycin 20mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of vomiting within one hour of dosing, the same dose of each drug will be&#xD;
      re-administered from a supplemental drug supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-dosing will be done only once for each drug administration and only twice for the whole of&#xD;
      the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant treatment Subjects will be treated for symptoms and adverse events during the&#xD;
      study period by standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs with antimalarial activity or likely to have an effect on parasitaemia will not be&#xD;
      permitted during the study. This will include artemether-lumefantrine combination,&#xD;
      artesunate, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine combination, chloroquine, amodiaquine and&#xD;
      co-trimoxazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial procedures and duration of the study A general physical examination will be performed&#xD;
      on admission to the study. All subjects will be hospitalised for a minimum of three days&#xD;
      until they are asymptomatic and aparasitaemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief examinations will be conducted daily during this period and once weekly thereafter to&#xD;
      assess general physical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter subjects will return for out-patient follow-up on days 7 ± 1 day, 14 ± 2 days, 21&#xD;
      ± 2 days and 28 ± 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects are expected to participate in the trial for the total duration of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those subjects not attending for follow-up will be located by a member of the study staff who&#xD;
      will provide transportation to the hospital for the scheduled examinations or ascertain the&#xD;
      reason for failing to attend.&#xD;
