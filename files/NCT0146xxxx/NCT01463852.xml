  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proof-of-principle study, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), who are&#xD;
      scheduled to initiate treatment per the recommendations of their primary oncologist, will&#xD;
      receive a single dose of vincristine 2 milligrams (mg). The objective is to determine if this&#xD;
      single dose will induce rapid cell death in isolated CLL cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vincristine 2 mg will be administered to the participants intravenously over 5 minutes. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected from an intravenous line inserted into the contralateral limb to&#xD;
      that where the vincristine was given, at time zero (pre-vincristine treatment), immediately&#xD;
      after vincristine administration (within 2-10 minutes upon completion of administration) and&#xD;
      at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours post-vincristine treatment. Patients will then at a later date receive&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment as prescribed by their primary oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days of vincristine administration, participants will receive a phone call from the&#xD;
      research nurse to discuss potential toxicities. At the time of the initiation of standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment, the Principal Investigator will also meet with the participant to&#xD;
      collect information regarding adverse events.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, 18 years old or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia(CLL) which is CD5/CD19/CD23 positive,&#xD;
             confirmed by peripheral blood immunophenotyping and/or lymph node biopsy and&#xD;
             immunophenotyping and/or bone marrow biopsy and immunophenotyping. CD23-negative CLL&#xD;
             cases are eligible, however additional diagnostic confirmation should include absence&#xD;
             of Cyclin D1 rearrangement [t(11;14)] as determined by standard laboratory methods&#xD;
             (such as fluorescent in situ hybridization).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients are planning to start chemotherapy for CLL recommended and prescribed by&#xD;
             their primary oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Peripheral blood lymphocyte count above 20,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be able to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to vincristine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Liver function test abnormalities of ≥ grade 3 (total bilirubin &gt;3 ULN (upper limit of&#xD;
             normal), AST&gt; 5 ULN, ALT&gt; 5 ULN) as per CTCAE 4.0 criteria, or direct bilirubin ≥ 3.0&#xD;
             mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pre-existing neuropathy grade 2 or greater as per CTCAE 4.0 criteria (moderate&#xD;
             symptoms limiting instrumental activities of daily living - ADLs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant during their participation in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
