      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the inherent difficulty of detecting significant improvements in cognitive performance&#xD;
      in normal healthy subjects, it is presently incredibly hard to predict and select efficacious&#xD;
      agents early in the drug development process. As such the potential success of novel&#xD;
      therapeutic agents for the symptomatic relief of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is largely unknown&#xD;
      until the drugs enter relatively large studies, assessing clinical outcome over at least a&#xD;
      six month period. To try to overcome this issue, clinical scientists have focused their&#xD;
      attention to the development of cognitive endpoints/biomarkers that can be detected in a&#xD;
      number of experimental paradigms where cognitive impairments akin to those observed in AD,&#xD;
      have been artificially induced.Based on the scientific literature, the use of total Sleep&#xD;
      Deprivation in healthy volunteers seems to be a good paradigm to assess potential anti-AD&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the first multicenter study that combines 3 complementary approaches via a&#xD;
      standardization of the sleep deprivation model: cognitive evaluations, imaging and&#xD;
      neurophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVE(S)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aim is to assess the utility of sleep deprivation as a potential model for&#xD;
      prediction of clinical efficacy using a combination of cognitive physiological endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goals are to test the effects of donepezil and memantine treatment on cognitive&#xD;
      functions in young healthy deprived subjects and to assess the potential restoring effect of&#xD;
      the two drugs on cognitive functions induce by sleep deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess that Sleep Deprivation model results in cognitive impairments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the sensitivity of the model by testing the restoring effects of one single&#xD;
           dose of modafinil&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the reversal effect of modafinil on EEG under sleep deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the reversal effect of modafinil on fMRI acquisitions under sleep&#xD;
           deprivation (subjects that will be included in Toulouse will not have fMRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the influence of donepezil and memantine on EEG under sleep deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the influence of donepezil and memantine on fMRI acquisitions under sleep&#xD;
           deprivation (subjects that will be included in Toulouse will not have fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The study is a phase I, multicentric (Lille, Marseille, Toulouse), randomised,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, cross-over design.&#xD;
