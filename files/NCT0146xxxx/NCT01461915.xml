  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether ODSH (2-0,3-0 desulfated heparin), a low&#xD;
      anticoagulant heparin derivate with preserved anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic&#xD;
      characteristics is efficacious in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with gemcitabine&#xD;
      and nab-paclitaxel ( Abraxane) as first line therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ODSH has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activity on mechanisms that are&#xD;
      believed to play important roles in pancreatic cancer invasion, metastasis, and resistance to&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation. Pancreatic cancer appears to have a dependence on autophagy, a&#xD;
      regulated catabolic pathway to degrade and recycle cellular organelles and macromolecules.&#xD;
      Autophagy appears to be largely driven by the binding of high mobility group box-1 protein&#xD;
      (HMGB1) to the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), which is strongly&#xD;
      inhibited by ODSH. Autophagy appears to not only assist pancreatic cancer cells to survive in&#xD;
      a hypoxic, relatively avascular environment, but also appears to play an important role in&#xD;
      chemotherapy resistance. Other important biological activities promoting pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      invasion and metastasis affected by ODSH include the inhibition of heparanase and the binding&#xD;
      of tumor cells to endothelium and platelets mediated by the selectins. It is believed that&#xD;
      these biological activities such as the inhibition of RAGE, heparanase, and selectin-mediated&#xD;
      metastasis, can be inhibited by ODSH at dose levels that can safely be administered without&#xD;
      clinically significant anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care of pancreatic cancer is evolving. It appears that two combination&#xD;
      regimens, the &quot;FOLFIRINOX&quot; regimen (a combination of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan&#xD;
      and oxaliplatin) and the combination of gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel, could have more&#xD;
      activity than the previous standard treatment of gemcitabine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer that have not received chemotherapy,&#xD;
      surgical or radiation treatments and have a good performance status will be eligible to&#xD;
      participate in this study. 10 patients will be enrolled in a Run-in Period to receive&#xD;
      gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel +ODSH. PK sampling and safety assessments will be conducted to&#xD;
      decide on the continuation to the Controlled Period of the study where 50 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized at a 1:1 ratio to either of the two study arms: Arm A will receive gemcitabine +&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel + ODSH and Arm B will receive gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is mean progression free survival. The secondary endpoints&#xD;
      consist of tumor response by RECIST criteria, overall survival at the end of the study and&#xD;
      changes from baseline for CA19-9 marker, weight and plasma albumin.&#xD;

             medications and substances are not allowed during the study: ritonavir, saquinavir,&#xD;
             indinavir, nelfinavir, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz, or nevirapine,&#xD;
