  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to elucidate the value of PET/CT applied early in the work-up of patients with&#xD;
      a metastasising cancer of an unknown primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of patients with metastasising cancer of unknown primary often includes&#xD;
      various and a large number of radiographic studies and invasive procedures, but the occult&#xD;
      primary tumor is detected in less than 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early PET/CT may be useful in Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP) before expensive and invasive&#xD;
      diagnostic procedures are carried out. The outcome may be higher tumor detection rate and&#xD;
      quicker diagnosis, avoiding unnecessary, extensive procedures. Furthermore, a large number of&#xD;
      the patients will receive treatment aimed at the correct diagnosis. Therefore, a prospective&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis is warranted.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every year, 800-1000 patients in Denmark are classified with a diagnosis of metastasising&#xD;
      cancer of unknown primary (CUP). This corresponds to approximately 3 % percent of all new&#xD;
      cancer cases on a national scale. The number is probably higher, since this is a&#xD;
      heterogeneous group of patients that is not registered consistently. The prognosis is poor;&#xD;
      the average survival is only approximately one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CUP is characterized by the finding of a metastasis the starting point of which (the primary&#xD;
      tumour) is unknown. Typically, one finds an enlarged lymph node in the neck, a swelling in&#xD;
      the throat or in the stomach, a filling in the skin or a tumour detected somewhere in the&#xD;
      body during an X-Ray examination, an endoscopy or the like. In spite of a search applying&#xD;
      multiple techniques, the primary tumour remains unknown in 70-80% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A great number of patients experience a long and discontinuous examination sequence marked by&#xD;
      various contacts with doctors, many examinations dispersed over many days and locations, as&#xD;
      well as a lot of time wasted, because there exists no single option or institution that takes&#xD;
      care of the patient and handles diagnostic procedures and treatment efficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is often initiated too late, typically as a combination of several&#xD;
      chemotherapeutics in order to cover different types of cancer simultaneously, but modern&#xD;
      chemotherapeutical regimes have not increased the survival rate. The bad prognosis is&#xD;
      undoubtedly due to the fact that the patients are diagnosed in an advanced phase.&#xD;
      Alternatively, the primary tumour is not detected at all. This, in part, is due to the&#xD;
      absence of any single agency in possession of the competence and responsibility to implement&#xD;
      the work-up without delay, and maybe because one does not offer examination by the modality&#xD;
      (PET/CT) which is most likely to detect the presence of cancer, its starting point and&#xD;
      dispersion in an early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to the diagnostic arms 'conventional diagnostics incl. CT' or&#xD;
      'early PET/CT' at study entry. Before study start, a randomization list will be prepared&#xD;
      according to which the assignment of patients to the treatment arms will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The early PET/CT examination will be performed at the Department of Nuclear Medicine at&#xD;
      Odense University Hospital (OUH) using the tracer [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Patients&#xD;
      will be requested to appear in fasting state (minimum 6 hours) and will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously FDG which is a radioactively labeled glucose-analog which enters cells by known&#xD;
      glucose transport systems. The usage of FDG as cancer tracer is based on the increased&#xD;
      metabolism and glucose demand of rapidly growing and proliferating cells. FDG remains within&#xD;
      cells since it does not metabolize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be scanned from the base of the scull to mid thigh by an integrated PET/CT&#xD;
      scanner (GE Healthcare DiscoveryTM STE). A standardized CT protocol is used (Smart mA 30-400&#xD;
      mA with a noise index of 18.0 and rotation time of 0.8 s., kV 120, reconstruction thickness&#xD;
      of 3.75 mm), followed by a PET examination (recording time is 2.5 min pr. field of view). CT&#xD;
      scanning will be done with intravenous contrast medium (Ultravist 370 mg I/ml). The effective&#xD;
      dose will be 18-20 mSv from CT and 5-6 mSv from FDG PET. Every patient at the Department of&#xD;
      Nuclear Medicine has their height and weight measured before PET/CT and the PET/CT&#xD;
      examination must be started in the interval 60 Â± 5 min. after injection of FDG. Serum glucose&#xD;
      concentration is measured before injection of FDG and must not exceed 8 mmol/L (150 mg/dL)&#xD;
      The first 40 patients with a negative FDG-PET/CT will have an extra, late scan (without new&#xD;
      contrast and with the same FDG-injection). One half (20 patients) will be scanned after 3&#xD;
      hours and the second half (20 patients) will be scanned 4 hours after the injection of FDG.&#xD;
      This is to examine whether there is late focal uptake in some patients due to slow and only&#xD;
      slightly increased glucose uptake. If so, the standard time point of scanning will in the&#xD;
      remaining patients be at 3 or 4 hours after the injection of FDG in order to optimize the&#xD;
      chance of detecting also slow growing tumours and metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of the primary tumor:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary tumor will be confirmed by histopathological examination of relevant biopsy&#xD;
      specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the hypotheses, the following data will be collected for all patients&#xD;
      retrospectively from the local patient report filing system FPAS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Detection of primary tumor possible: yes/no (primary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time frame from inclusion into the study to detection of primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Time frame from inclusion into the study to referral to palliative or curative&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Time frame from inclusion into the study to end of follow-up or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Total score of Quality of Life instrument &quot;SF-36&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are recruited from the Emergency Department based on subjective selection at the&#xD;
      discretion of a trained internal medicine specialist (KKP). The expected number of patients&#xD;
      will be 220.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of PET/CT consists in the extra radiation dose (5-6mSv, p 4), which the&#xD;
      PET-examination adds to the patient beyond the dose from CT (18-20mSv). The dose of radiation&#xD;
      from PET is insignificant (a total estimated risk: 1/10.000), while the estimated risk from&#xD;
      the radiation dose of CT is 1/1000. The lifetime risk of developing cancer is 25%. Performing&#xD;
      the PET/CT scan increases the lifetime risk from 25% to 25,1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiation dose which is used has never been proven to cause adverse effects. The increase&#xD;
      in lifetime effect is considered acceptable when compared to the improvement in diagnostic&#xD;
      yield, patient course and targeted treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information describing the study and providing sufficient information for patients to&#xD;
      make an informed decision about their participation will be handed out to patients in written&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will have 24 hours to think it over before making the final decision whether or&#xD;
      not to participate. Participation is voluntary and consent can at anytime be withdrawn&#xD;
      without any consequences for the patient's future treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Informed Consent form will be signed by all participating patients and stored at the&#xD;
      Department of Nuclear Medicine&#xD;
