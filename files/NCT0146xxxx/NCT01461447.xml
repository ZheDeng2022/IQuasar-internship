  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and immunogenecity of a third MVA in the&#xD;
      HIVIS 03 volunteers who have received 3 HIVIS DNA vaccines followed by boosting with 2 MVA&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators postulate that the Immune responses that were observed in the HIVIS 03&#xD;
      trial are likely to wane over time. To date it is unknown how these responses should best be&#xD;
      maintained. In this study the investigators seek to boost immune responses, especially the&#xD;
      antibody responses induced by the second MVA boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the HIV specific antibodies were induced only after the second MVA injection, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that a 3rd MVA will give rise to even higher and sustained antibody titers.&#xD;
