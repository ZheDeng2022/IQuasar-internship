  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uncontrolled high blood pressure (HBP) is a major public health concern and leading cause of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease worldwide. The HBP crisis is particularly onerous to African Americans&#xD;
      as they are disproportionately more susceptible to HBP than non-Hispanic White Americans.&#xD;
      Poor adherence to prescribed medication regimens is a major problem, as only about half of&#xD;
      patients who have been diagnosed with hypertension adhere to prescribed medications. Mobile&#xD;
      phones and text messages are becoming widely integrated into routine daily life and may offer&#xD;
      a simple and non-labor intensive strategy for improving the quality of medication management&#xD;
      through enhancing medication adherence. This proposed research will be conducted in two&#xD;
      distinct phases addressing three specific aims. For Specific Aim 1 (Phase I), the&#xD;
      investigators propose to conduct focus groups with participants from the investigators target&#xD;
      population in order to obtain feedback to guide the development of a mobile phone text&#xD;
      message system that seeks to improve adherence to antihypertensive medications. For Specific&#xD;
      Aim 2 (Phase II), the investigators propose to pilot test the newly developed text message&#xD;
      intervention with a randomized controlled trial. For Specific Aim 3 (Phase II), the&#xD;
      investigators propose to ascertain participant perceptions of intervention effectiveness and&#xD;
      satisfaction in order to guide further system refinement. In Phase I, African Americans with&#xD;
      uncontrolled hypertension (n=24-32) will be recruited to take part in one of four focus&#xD;
      groups that will help guide the development of the text message intervention. In Phase II,&#xD;
      African Americans with uncontrolled hypertension will be randomized to receive usual care&#xD;
      (n=30) vs. the text message intervention (n=30). The primary outcome in this pilot will be&#xD;
      change in medication adherence at one month follow-up; secondary outcomes include change in&#xD;
      medication self-efficacy and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at one month follow-up, as&#xD;
      well as participant satisfaction with the text message intervention. The proposed research&#xD;
      will utilize the Wayne State University (WSU) Center for Urban Studies to conduct high&#xD;
      quality and professionally run focus groups, the WSU Division of Computing and Information&#xD;
      Technology's Broadcast Message Service infrastructure for the delivery of text messages, the&#xD;
      WSU Center for Health Research for statistical analysis and grant management assistance, and&#xD;
      a diverse study team from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds at WSU. As a result, the&#xD;
      proposed research leverages the considerable local resources to investigate an innovative and&#xD;
      much needed intervention for this high-risk population.&#xD;
