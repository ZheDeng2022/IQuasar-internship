  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to examine the safety of two different hemoglobin (Hgb)-based&#xD;
      transfusion triggers in patients post cardiac surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 20% of blood transfusions in the United States are given to in patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. Despite the many blood conservation techniques that are available, safe, and&#xD;
      efficacious for patients, many of these operations continue to be associated with significant&#xD;
      amounts of blood usage. We believe that transfusion protocols which employ specific&#xD;
      guidelines for transfusion can decrease blood product usage and improve outcomes for patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery. Our goal is to demonstrate that a carefully chosen trigger can&#xD;
      achieve better outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that a transfusion trigger of Hgb 7.5 g/dl will lead to decreased&#xD;
      utilization of blood transfusions and will have many positive effects on the patients post&#xD;
      cardiac surgery in addition to substantial cost savings. We will use an evidence based&#xD;
      approach to observe the relative safety of a conservative transfusion trigger (7.5 g/dl) as&#xD;
      compared to a more liberal trigger (9.0 g/dl). We will also study the effect of blood&#xD;
      conservation on the incidence of transfusion-related complications such as transfusion&#xD;
      related lung injury (TRALI) and infectious complications as well as length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      cost and ventilator time.&#xD;
