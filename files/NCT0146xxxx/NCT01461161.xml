&#xD;
          2. Any condition possibly affecting absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of&#xD;

             the investigator could potentially either pose a health risk to the subject during the&#xD;
             study or influence the study outcome;&#xD;
&#xD;

          6. Positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 antibody, hepatitis&#xD;
             B surface antigen, or hepatitis C virus antibody at screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any medical or dental procedure, no matter how minor, that is planned or anticipated&#xD;
             to occur during the conduct of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence within the last year;&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Use of aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, or acetaminophen within 5 days&#xD;
             prior to the ingestion of the study drug; use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti&#xD;
             inflammatory agents (but not acetaminophen) will be allowed for isolated episodes of&#xD;
             pain at the discretion of the investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Donation or receipt of blood or blood components within the 4 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             study. The investigator should instruct subjects who participate in this study not to&#xD;

             amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids or&#xD;
             cotinine (indicating active current smoking) at the screening or Day -1 of Period 1&#xD;
             visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Female subjects who are planning a pregnancy or are pregnant or lactating;&#xD;
&#xD;
