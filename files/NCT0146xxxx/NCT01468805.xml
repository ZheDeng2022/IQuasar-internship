      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cockroach allergies are an important risk factor for asthma in inner-city households,&#xD;
      especially in children. A new method for killing cockroaches may help children who live in&#xD;
      households that have high numbers of cockroaches. Because most public health treatments&#xD;
      target more than just cockroaches, this method could lower the costs of treating childhood&#xD;
      allergies and asthma by focusing on the most likely source of the allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test a new cockroach-killing method designed to reduce asthma in children exposed to&#xD;
      cockroaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children 5 to 14 years of age who have moderate to severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children must live in a household that has a high number of cockroaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a phone call and an initial home visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study doctors will place cockroach traps, and return after 3 days to check the number of&#xD;
           roaches caught and killed. Dust samples will be collected from the house.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have blood and lung function tests, and will be tested for allergies&#xD;
           (including cockroach allergies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some households will be treated for cockroaches at regular intervals, or more frequently&#xD;
           if required by the study doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular checkup visits in their homes at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and&#xD;
           12 and short phone call interviews at months 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 to study their asthma&#xD;
           symptoms. The home visits will also check the cockroach levels in the house.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most prevalent chronic childhood condition and is the most frequent cause of&#xD;
      hospitalization among children. There are about 6.7 million children in the U.S. who&#xD;
      currently have asthma, and nearly two of every three of these children had at least one&#xD;
      attack in the past 12 months. Evidence suggests that exposure to cockroach allergen might be&#xD;
      the most important risk factor for asthma in inner-city households. An environmental&#xD;
      intervention targeting only cockroach allergen could potentially provide cost savings in a&#xD;
      public health program over high cost multi-component interventions, if it could be shown to&#xD;
      reduce asthma morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the Childhood Asthma REduction Study (CARES) is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a novel cockroach eradication method, shown in prior studies to drastically&#xD;
      decrease cockroach allergen levels, in reducing asthma morbidity in children with moderate to&#xD;
      severe asthma who are both allergic and exposed to cockroach allergen. Additionally, the&#xD;
      study will characterize relationships between cockroach infestation and other environmental&#xD;
      allergen exposures, and asthma morbidity, as well as consider dynamic relationships between&#xD;
      cockroach counts and observed allergen reductions over time; and use study data to identify&#xD;
      mechanisms such as cleaning behaviors that may influence those relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These objectives will be addressed through a prospective, randomized controlled, multi-site&#xD;
      intervention trial in which 414 eligible children age 5 to 14 years who live in households&#xD;
      with a confirmed trap count of 30 or more cockroaches over a 3-day period, are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two treatment groups. Treatment will be implemented at multiple intervals&#xD;
      in the homes of children assigned to the intervention group. Children in both the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups will receive clinical evaluations for asthma, home&#xD;
      assessments of allergen exposures, educational materials on allergen exposures and asthma,&#xD;
      and information on study results. Following 12-months of active data collection, the&#xD;
      extermination treatment will be made available to the homes of children in the control group.&#xD;
      The target sample size is 372 participants completing the study, equally divided into the two&#xD;
      arms. Home environmental assessments following the enrollment visit will take place at&#xD;
      enrollment, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Clinical assessments will also be conducted in the&#xD;
      home at enrollment and the 12-month visit. Primary outcome data will be collected during&#xD;
      scheduled follow up phone calls every two months.&#xD;
