      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Evaluate incidence of cardiac complications in Phase I patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To identify variables (i.e. number of electrocardiograms (EKG) performed) that lead to the&#xD;
      detection of cardiac events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research plan includes a retrospective review of the chart of past UT MD Anderson Cancer&#xD;
      Center (MDACC) patients and the experience in treating them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All studies analyzed will be Phase I clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis is designed to collect information on the number of and timeframe within which ECGs&#xD;
      are performed on these trials. Data on adverse events and serious adverse events, dose&#xD;
      modifications based on ECG changes, attribution to drug, incidence and types of ECG changes&#xD;
      specifically QTC prolongation as well as their influence on study procedures like dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities (DLTs) in dose escalation phase of the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study conducted using clinical records of patients treated on Phase I protocols in the MDACC&#xD;
      Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics. The demographic data to be collected from&#xD;
      patients whose charts will be analyzed will include variables such as age, gender, primary&#xD;
      cancer, stage of the disease, performance status, treatment characteristics (i.e., number and&#xD;
      type of prior therapies), disease status, adverse events, laboratory data (i.e., complete&#xD;
      blood count/differential/platelets, tumor markers), and treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will allow identification and descriptive analysis of the occurrence of cardiac&#xD;
      events in the phase I population and will help define the role of protocol required EKGs in&#xD;
      their detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIPAA privacy and confidentiality guidelines will be followed. The database will be secured&#xD;
      in the Department server. A Data coordinator has been recruited to undertake this project.&#xD;
      The information derived from these observations will help the investigators formulate&#xD;
      research questions and projects to develop future prospective studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be performed in a descriptive fashion with paired and&#xD;
      multivariable analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will be reported using summary tables, figures, and data listings. Continuous&#xD;
      variables will be summarized using the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and&#xD;
      maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.&#xD;
