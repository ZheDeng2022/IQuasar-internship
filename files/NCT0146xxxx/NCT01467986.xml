  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children, adolescents and young adults with high risk relapsed or treatment refractory&#xD;
      neuroblastoma (rNB) represent a group of patients with dismal prognosis for whom a&#xD;
      recommended standard salvage therapy is currently not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multimodal metronomic approach combining molecular targeted drugs (rapamycin and&#xD;
      dasatinib) with conventional chemotherapy (irinotecan and temozolomide) will be investigated&#xD;
      in a randomized fashion as new treatment strategy for patients with rNB. The intention is to&#xD;
      assess the therapeutic benefit of molecular targeted drugs for the treatment of rNB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of irinotecan and temozolomide showed activity in the treatment of several&#xD;
      solid organ tumors, brain tumors and neuroblastoma. In one study rNB patients received a&#xD;
      median of 5 courses of 5 days irinotecan and temozolomide every 3 to 4 weeks with a&#xD;
      cumulative dose of 35% lower than in the RIST design. 33% had disease regression with 8% CR&#xD;
      or PR. A phase II study in rNB also using irinotecan and temozolomide with a substantially&#xD;
      lower intensity showed a response rate of 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of a mTOR inhibitor with a multi-kinase inhibitor demonstrated in preclinical&#xD;
      studies a synergistic effect on cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and sensitization for radio- and&#xD;
      chemotherapy. It is assumed that this combination of molecular targeted drugs with a&#xD;
      tolerable conventional chemotherapy consisting of irinotecan and temozolomide can&#xD;
      substantially improve the outcome of this patient population. A group of 20 rNB patients&#xD;
      treated with the RIST therapy approach in a compassionate use setting showed an overall&#xD;
      survival of 55% at a median of 80 weeks with a tolerable adverse event profile.&#xD;
