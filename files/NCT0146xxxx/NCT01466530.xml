    <textblock>
      Misoprostol would reduce the uterine bleeding after caesarean delivery, without harmful&#xD;
      effects on either mother or baby. The investigators postulated that the use of sublingual&#xD;
      misoprostol during isoflurane anaesthesia for uncomplicated caesarean delivery would reduce&#xD;
      maternal haemorrhage, uterine atonic effects, and the need for additional uterotonic agents,&#xD;
      without harmful effects on either mother or baby. Therefore, the present study was designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the effects of preoperative sublingual misoprostol on maternal blood loss,&#xD;
      uterine tone, the need for additional oxytocin and neonatal outcome after elective caesarean&#xD;
      delivery under isoflurane anaesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Volatile anaesthetics including sevoflurane, desflurane, and isoflurane are often used during&#xD;
      general anaesthesia for caesarean delivery. The cost effectiveness of isoflurane anaesthesia1&#xD;
      for caesarean delivery is widely used at many centres including the authors' centre, where&#xD;
      general anaesthesia is commonly used for caesarean deliveries than did regional anaesthesia&#xD;
      because of the refusal of many ladies for the later, especially in the light of&#xD;
      evidence-based equivocal maternal or neonatal outcomes of both techniques. 2 However,&#xD;
      isoflurane in similar to other inhalational anaesthetics have been shown a dose-dependent&#xD;
      (from 0.5 to 2.35 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)) induced myometrial relaxation in 25%&#xD;
      of parturients with added risks of postpartum haemorrhage, 3-5 which may be mediated through&#xD;
      the inhibition of the oxytocin-induced contraction,6 decrease in intracellular concentration&#xD;
      of free calcium,7 inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels activity,8 and activation&#xD;
      of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels (K (ATP))9 of pregnant uterine smooth&#xD;
      muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several uterotonics such as oxytocin reduce postpartum haemorrhage by inducing uterine&#xD;
      contraction, but with added risks of haemodynamic adverse effects. 10 Sublingual or rectal&#xD;
      misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, in doses of 100 to 800 µg is safe and as effective&#xD;
      as intravenous infusion of oxytocin in reducing blood loss and the need for additional&#xD;
      oxytocin after caesarean delivery under either spinal or general anaesthesia, with occurrence&#xD;
      of transient side effects such as nausea, shivering and pyrexia. 11-17 Misoprostol possess&#xD;
      several advantages over oxytocin, including long shelf life, stability at room temperature,&#xD;
      and possible buccal, rectal and sublingual administration. 11, 16The later has many&#xD;
      advantages such as rapid uptake, long-lasting duration of effect, and greatest&#xD;
      bioavailability, compared with other routes of misoprostol administration. 18 Up to our best&#xD;
      knowledge, this trial was the first one studied the inhibitory effects of misoprostol on the&#xD;
      uterine atonic effects of inhalational anaesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon previous published data, 19 blood loss after caesarean delivery was normally&#xD;
      distributed with standard deviation 560 ml. A priori power analysis indicated that 174&#xD;
      patients in each group would be sufficient to detect a 20% reduction in blood loss after&#xD;
      caesarean delivery, with a type-I error of 0.05 and a power of 90%. The investigators added&#xD;
      10% more patients to account for patients dropping out during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly allocated to receive sublingual 400 µg of misoprostol or identical&#xD;
      placebo two tablets after tracheal intubation before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthetic management was standardized in all studied patients. Oral ranitidine 150 mg was&#xD;
      given the night before and on the morning of surgery, with 0.3 mol/L sodium citrate (30 mL)&#xD;
      given 15 min before induction. In the operating theatre women were positioned supine on the&#xD;
      operating table with 15° firm rubber wedge under the right hip to effect left uterine&#xD;
      displacement. A slow 500-mL i.v. infusion of lactated Ringer's solution was given to all&#xD;
      subjects over 20 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were monitored with electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry&#xD;
      (SpO2), and end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (EtCO2). After pre-oxygenation for 5 min,&#xD;
      rapid-sequence induction was performed with propofol 1.5-2 mg/kg followed by suxamethonium&#xD;
      1.5 mg/kg after loss of verbal response. Cricoid pressure was applied after loss of&#xD;
      consciousness and was released after correct placement of the tracheal tube had been&#xD;
      confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After tracheal intubation, subjects were allocated randomly to two groups by drawing&#xD;
      sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes containing a software-generated randomisation&#xD;
      code (Random Allocation Software, version 1.0.0, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences,&#xD;
      Isfahan, Iran). The parturients in the placebo group (n = 183) received sublingual two&#xD;
      moistened white coated placebo tablets which looked identical in size, colour, and packing to&#xD;
      misoprostol tablet. In the misoprostol group (n = 183), sublingual misoprostol was given by&#xD;
      putting two moistened tablets of misoprostol (400 µg) under the tongue and allowing them to&#xD;
      dissolve (Misotac®, Sigma Pharmaceutical Industries, Egypt) (200 µg/tablet). The&#xD;
      anaesthesiologists who gave the anaesthetics and study tablets were blinded to the study&#xD;
      randomization and were not involved in collecting of the patients' data. All staff in the&#xD;
      operating room were unaware of the randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia was maintained with 0.5-1 MAC of isoflurane with nitrous oxide 50% in oxygen to&#xD;
      maintain the heart rate and blood pressure within 20% of baseline values. Neuromuscular block&#xD;
      was maintained with vecuronium 0.06 mg/kg. The lungs were ventilated using a tidal volume of&#xD;
      8 mL/kg, an inspiration-expiration ratio of 1: 2, and at a respiratory rate necessary to&#xD;
      maintain an EtCO2 of 30-35 mm Hg. An infusion of lactated Ringer's solution 800 mL was given&#xD;
      to all subjects during the procedure. Induction to delivery (I-D) times was recorded using a&#xD;
      stopwatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the umbilical cord was clamped, a 10-unit infusion of oxytocin in 500 mL of 5% glucose&#xD;
      was started. Intravenous midazolam 0.05 mg/kg and fentanyl 2.0 µg/kg were given and end-tidal&#xD;
      concentration of the nitrous oxide was increased to 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obstetrician who was blinded to the study group, assessed the uterine tone by palpation&#xD;
      every three minutes after delivery of the placenta and rated the degree of uterine&#xD;
      contraction on a 10-cm VAS (0: well contracted; 10: completely relaxed). If uterine tone&#xD;
      remained unsatisfactory after 3 min, an additional 5-unit bolus of oxytocin was administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All neonates were assessed by a paediatrician unaware of the randomisation code as regarding&#xD;
      their Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min, arterial blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and&#xD;
      arterial oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, isoflurane and nitrous oxide were discontinued, residual neuromuscular&#xD;
      block was antagonised and the patients were extubated. Postoperative analgesia was achieved&#xD;
      with morphine, tramadol and paracetamol.&#xD;
