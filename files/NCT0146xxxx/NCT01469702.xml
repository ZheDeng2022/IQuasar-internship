  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bartonella henselae is the etiologic agent of cat scratch disease (CSD). 90% of patients&#xD;
      present with regional lymphadenitis (typical CSD) while 10% will have disease involving other&#xD;
      organs, such as neuroretinitis, arthropathy, erythema nodosum, and encephalitis (atypical&#xD;
      CSD). In most CSD cases resolution occurs in 2 to 3 months although a prolonged course often&#xD;
      occurs. Data on the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in CSD is limited. Azithromycin has been&#xD;
      shown to have a small favorable effect in a small comparative study and is commonly&#xD;
      prescribed for CSD, however its overall effect is not satisfactory. Corticosteroids may be&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of CSD for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Many experts believe that host response is involved in the pathogenesis of CSD and is&#xD;
           responsible for the clinical manifestations rather than the direct effect of B.&#xD;
           henselae. The absence of viable organisms in affected lymph nodes (in the presence of&#xD;
           positive PCR for B. henselae DNA), and the fact that arthritis, arthralgia and erythema&#xD;
           nodosum (that are often associated with autoimmune diseases) have been described in CSD,&#xD;
           support this concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Corticosteroids have been anecdotally reported to have been administered to patients&#xD;
           with CSD, apparently with some success. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
           efficacy of corticosteroids in addition to azithromycin in CSD. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
           that corticosteroids will improve out come. Ten patients with typical CSD will be&#xD;
           treated with a 5-day oral course of prednisone (1 mg/kg up to 60 mg/day) and&#xD;
           azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg on days 2-5). Patients will be under followed&#xD;
           up for 3 months. Major outcome measures will include duration of symptoms and signs,&#xD;
           with particular emphasis on affected lymph node size and duration using a specific&#xD;
           scoring system (lymphadenitis score, LS). LS will be used to evaluate lymphadenitis at&#xD;
           each follow-up visit. The time period from baseline LS until 75% and 90% reduction in LS&#xD;
           in the treatment group will be compared with historical controls. The historical control&#xD;
           group will be consisted of age, sex, and clinical manifestations-matched CSD patients&#xD;
           who were treated with azithromycin without corticosteroids.&#xD;

    <description>LS will evaluate the severity of lymphadenitis, using the following clinical parameters: size of lymph node in cm; pain estimated by the patient, using a 0-5 scale (0 equals no pain, 5 the most severe pain); tenderness estimated by the physician, (0 equals no tenderness, 5 the most severe tenderness); erythema of the skin overlying the affected lymph-node (0 no erythema, 1 mild erythema, 2 moderate erythema and 3 severe erythema); suppuration of a lymph node will score 5 points, no suppuration will score 0. The total score will consist of the arithmetical summation of the 5 parameters.</description>
