  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to re-confirm the already established health effects and dose&#xD;
      tolerance of Isomalto-oligosaccharide or IMO, which is a general health/functional food&#xD;
      ingredient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMO) is a mixture of natural resistant carbohydrates consisting of&#xD;
      short-chains of glucose molecules. IMO is made by enzymatic conversion of starch and uses as&#xD;
      a health food ingredient with health benefits of a low calorie sweetener, prebiotic and&#xD;
      dietary fiber. IMO have been ingested by humans for last many centuries as it is naturally&#xD;
      found in rice miso, sake and soy sauce. IMO already got approval from FDA (GRAS) and from&#xD;
      Health Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are number of published studies (in humans and animals) regarding the health benefits&#xD;
      of IMO as an effective prebiotic, and its role in improving overall human gastric health.&#xD;
      Studies also showed that IMO have found to be most tolerable with least adverse effects&#xD;
      compared to other short-chain resistant oligosaccharides. Current clinical studies are&#xD;
      conducted to verify the above given health benefits in BioNeutra's manufactured&#xD;
      VitaSugar/VitaFiber-IMO products which including quantitative analysis of Bifidobacteria&#xD;
      spp., Lactic acid bacteria group and clostridium spp. The production of short-chain&#xD;
      fatty-acids (SCFA) and effect on blood glucose level are also analyzed in addition to the&#xD;
      dose tolerance in term of lower and upper permissible dosage with resultant adverse effects&#xD;
      if any are also observed.&#xD;
