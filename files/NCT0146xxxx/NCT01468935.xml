      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some transplant recipients have been found to have cells in their uterus that come from the&#xD;
      donor. Researchers want to study uterine tissue from three different groups of women: (1)&#xD;
      healthy volunteers, (2) people who have had a stem cell transplant, and (3) people with rare&#xD;
      diseases or conditions that affect reproduction. These samples will help researchers learn&#xD;
      more about the way stem cells work in the reproductive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect cells from the uterus to study how stem cells work in the reproductive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an endometrial biopsy to collect cells for study. The biopsy&#xD;
           visit will take 1 to 2 hours.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Transplantation with hematopoietic cells has been used for a wide variety of blood disorders,&#xD;
      but also for diseases like solid organ cancers. Interestingly, women who have had bone marrow&#xD;
      transplants have been found to have donor tissue in their endometrium, which raises the&#xD;
      possibility of cellular therapies using bone marrow derived cells for gynecologic&#xD;
      indications. Donor engraftment does not appear to occur when transplantations were performed&#xD;
      with stem cells collected from peripheral blood of the donor. Therefore, the subtype of cells&#xD;
      from the bone marrow responsible for engraftment is not yet known, nor is the ideal&#xD;
      transplantation regimen known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate aim of this tissue procurement protocol is to obtain endometrial (uterine) stem&#xD;
      cells from many human volunteers in order to examine the biological properties of those&#xD;
      cells. We will collect tissue from 3 primary groups of patients: normal controls, patients&#xD;
      with rare diseases or reproductive disorders, and patients who have undergone hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplant. Each volunteer will undergo an endometrial biopsy during an office&#xD;
      visit. The endometrial tissue will then be studied for a better understanding of their&#xD;
      biological properties, growth and differentiation. One specific area of interest is to study&#xD;
      how hematopoietic transplantation impacts endometrial cell function. These endometrial cells&#xD;
      will be analyzed in-depth in the laboratory to determine if they came from the donor or&#xD;
      recipient, and if so, which specific populations of cells. Hematologic pre-transplant&#xD;
      conditioning information will be correlated with these research studies to identify factors&#xD;
      that may assist with the understanding of adult endometrial stem cell biology.&#xD;
