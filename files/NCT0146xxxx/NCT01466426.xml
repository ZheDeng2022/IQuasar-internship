  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims at validating 18F-flourodeoxyglucose positron emission&#xD;
      tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in the detection and characterization of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism (VTE) in the entire human body, especially deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism (PE). On completion of this study the investigators will hopefully be able&#xD;
      to demonstrate the importance of functional/molecular imaging technique in managing patients&#xD;
      with this common and potentially fatal disorder.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute DVT and PE are common and serious conditions. Highly effective treatment (most often&#xD;
      anticoagulant agents) is available for acute VTE, but it is associated with potentially&#xD;
      dangerous side effects. In addition, DVT and PE are just two manifestations of VTE, which can&#xD;
      occur everywhere in the human organism. An underlying disease (i.e. cancer) is often a key&#xD;
      factor in developing VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly used diagnostic imaging techniques in DVT and PE have a fair diagnostic accuracy,&#xD;
      but do not address other important aspects of the disease. In contrast to this, FDG-PET/CT&#xD;
      has the potential to contribute in VTE diagnosis by&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differentiate between acute and chronic VTE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening of the entire body for VTE (e.g. the pelvis where normal imaging techniques&#xD;
           fail)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early diagnosis of underlying disease (e.g. cancer, with the possibility of early&#xD;
           treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study with the above mentioned objectives, and is part of a larger study&#xD;
      addressing other aspects of FDG-PET/CT in VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that their hypothesis that FDG-PET/CT imaging may introduce a new&#xD;
      approach for detecting thrombi anywhere in the body, particularly in the venous system&#xD;
      including the pelvis and the calves, will add a new dimension in treating patients with&#xD;
      suspected PE. This technology will only detect acute thrombi and not chronic thrombi that no&#xD;
      longer have activity, which will obviate unnecessary treatment in this population.&#xD;

        The study population comprises the following patient groups: 10 patients with a positive&#xD;
        diagnosis of DVT, 10 patients where clinically suspected DVT was ruled out, 10 patients&#xD;
        with a positive diagnosis of PE, and 10 patients where clinically suspected PE was ruled&#xD;
