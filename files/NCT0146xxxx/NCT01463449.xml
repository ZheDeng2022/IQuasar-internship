    <textblock>
      CD163 is a membrane bound receptor primary expressed in monocytes and macrophages. A soluble&#xD;
      variant of CD163 (sCD163) is present in plasma and is elevated in pathological condition&#xD;
      activating the monocyte-macrophage system. Recently sCD163 is associated with various&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions, ex. adipose tissue inflammation and very recently to be a rather&#xD;
      strong predictor of the development of type 2-diabetes. Only a subset of obese individuals&#xD;
      develops insulin resistance, type 2-diabetes and related diseases. These healthy obese&#xD;
      subjects are characterized of less adipose tissue inflammation and less insulin resistance as&#xD;
      compared to unhealthy obese individuals. Consequently it would be of great importance to&#xD;
      develop markers that could discriminate between healthy and unhealthy obese subjects. Aim: To&#xD;
      investigate whether macrophage CD163 is involved in adipose tissue inflammation in obesity&#xD;
      and thereby to the metabolic complications of metabolic syndrome. To investigate how sCD163&#xD;
      is regulated by metabolic factors such as obesity, fat distribution, weight loss and diet.&#xD;
      Methods: Intervention study. 45 morbidly obese subject approved to gastric by-pass. Blood&#xD;
      samples, MR-spectroscopy, DXA, weight control and fat biopsy are taken before and 12 month&#xD;
      after surgery. Correlations studies: to investigate the influence of diet and weight loss on&#xD;
      CD163 and sCD163. Perspective: To study the role of macrophages infiltration and activation&#xD;
      for adipose tissue inflammation and to determine whether the macrophage marker, s-CD163,&#xD;
      together with other markers will be able better to identify obese individuals who are at&#xD;
      increased risk for developing complications such as diabetes&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is recognized that low grade inflammation is a key player in the development of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and insulin resistance (Haslam, James 2005). Circulating levels of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers such as high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin (IL)-6&#xD;
      are found to be increased in subjects with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2-diabetes&#xD;
      (Dandona, Aljada &amp; Bandyopadhyay 2004). We and others have shown that obesity, and in&#xD;
      particular abdominal obesity, is associated with persistent increased level of inflammatory&#xD;
      markers (Bruun et al. 2007, Christiansen et al. 2010a) . Thus this low grade of inflammation&#xD;
      may represent &quot;the common soil&quot; for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and insulin&#xD;
      resistance and represent the link between these metabolic disturbances and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides its function as a storage organ, the adipose tissue (AT) exerts a complex role in the&#xD;
      organism. In obesity the adipose tissue is infiltrated by an increased amount of macrophages,&#xD;
      and particular these macrophages express and release a wide range of hormones and cytokines,&#xD;
      collectively called adipokines, which biological functions are shown to include involvement&#xD;
      in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, adipocyte differentiation, immunity, vasculature and&#xD;
      neuron development and eating behavior (Trayhurn, Wood 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the adipokines expressed in the AT are pro-inflammatory cytokines as TNFα, IL-6,&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory chemokines as IL-8, MCP-1, MIP1α, thrombotic factors as plasminogen&#xD;
      inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and AT specific proteins as adiponectin and leptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertrophied adipocytes, as seen in obese subjects and associated with insulin resistance&#xD;
      are shown to display a distinct gene expression of inflammatory markers compared to small&#xD;
      human adipocytes and it is shown that adipocyte size is an important determinant of adipokine&#xD;
      secretion. Moreover an positive association between the grade of obesity and the expression&#xD;
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines as TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, has been found whereas and an inverse&#xD;
      association between adiponectin and obesity has been reported (Kern et al. 2003, Bruun et al.&#xD;
      2003).In accordance with these observations, we have found the AT expression of MCP-1 was&#xD;
      up-regulated in obese subjects (Christiansen, Richelsen &amp; Bruun 2005) whereas the AT&#xD;
      expression of adiponectin in obese subjects (mean BMI 40 kg/m2 ) was found down-regulated&#xD;
      with 50% as compared to lean subjects (mean BMI 22 kg/m2) (Christiansen et al. 2010b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, adipose tissue inflammation resulting in dysfunction of the adipose tissue may be the&#xD;
      important factor relating obesity to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD163:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD-163 is a membrane bound receptor primary expressed in monocytes and macrophages. CD163 was&#xD;
      originally described as a hemoglobin scavenger receptor since it is involved in removing&#xD;
      hemoglobin released from ruptured red blood cells (Moestrup, Moller 2004). A soluble variant&#xD;
      of CD-163 (s-CD-163) is present in plasma and is elevated in pathological condition&#xD;
      activating the monocyte-macrophage system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently s-CD-163 is associated with various inflammatory conditions (Moestrup, Moller 2004),&#xD;
      and very recently to be a rather strong predictor of the development of type 2 diabetes in a&#xD;
      large Danish cohort (Moller et al. 2011). Thus, s-CD-163 may be a marker both related to&#xD;
      inflammation as well as to metabolic conditions maybe linking low grade inflammation and&#xD;
      metabolic abnormalities, and furthermore, may be a marker of the obese state with&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a subset of overweight and obese individuals develops insulin resistance, type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and related diseases (Stefan et al. 2008, Bluher 2010). These &quot;healthy&quot; obese&#xD;
      subjects are characterized of less adipose tissue inflammation and less insulin resistance as&#xD;
      compared to unhealthy obese individuals. Consequently it would be of great importance to&#xD;
      develop markers or predictors that could discriminate between &quot;healthy&quot; and unhealthy obese&#xD;
      subjects in order to made a better selection for more invasive treatment such as e.g.&#xD;
      surgery, pharmacotherapy etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is CD163 pathophysiologically involved in adipose tissue inflammation in obesity?&#xD;
           Adipose tissue (AT) is taken from various regions in lean to very obese subjects - from&#xD;
           either subcutaneous fat biopsies (lean subjects), surgery (obese subjects - BMI&gt; 30),&#xD;
           and from bariatric surgery (gastric bypass) in the very obese subjects (BMI &gt; 40) - both&#xD;
           subcutaneous and visceral AT are investigated in parallel in the very obese individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the adipose tissue the amount of macrophages will be determined by both biochemical&#xD;
           (e.g. CD68) and microscopically methods (immunohistochemistry). Moreover, the gene&#xD;
           expression (PCR) and protein (Western blot) of CD163 will be detected in AT and related&#xD;
           to the expression and protein of a number of other proinflammatory adipokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is s-CD163 a marker of adipose tissue inflammation and metabolic disturbances? Blood&#xD;
           samples from the individuals in project 1 will also be obtained and s-CD163 measured (in&#xD;
           house sandwich ELISA kit (Moller, Hald &amp; Moestrup 2002)). These values will be related&#xD;
           to the amount of macrophages in AT and the expression of CD136 in AT. Moreover, the&#xD;
           insulin sensitivity determined by the HOMA model will be performed, and s-CD163 related&#xD;
           to the HOMA score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is s-CD163 affected by weight loss, and dietary changes ( e.g. the effect of fructose&#xD;
           (proinflammatory) and the effect of resveratrol (antiinflammatory)?&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Weight loss will be induced by bariatric surgery (bypass) in very obese subjects&#xD;
                (BMI &gt; 40). S-CD163 and changes in insulin sensitivity (HOMA) and other&#xD;
                inflammatory markers (e.g. hsCRP, IL-6, TNF, MCP-1, adiponectin etc.) will be&#xD;
                measured before and after 6 and 12 months after surgery. From power calculations it&#xD;
                is planned to include 45 very obese subjects in this study - half of them with type&#xD;
                2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. We have performed dietary investigations with fructose (soft drinks taken for 6&#xD;
                months in 50 overweight and obese subjects) which induces ectopic fat accumulation&#xD;
                in the liver determined by MR-spectroscopy and insulin resistance, and dietary&#xD;
                intervention with resveratrol which reduces liver fat and has antiinflammatory&#xD;
                effects. In frozen plasma samples from these studies s-CD163 will be measured in&#xD;
                order to get insight in the dietary effect of fructose and resveratrol on this and&#xD;
                related markers.&#xD;
