      The purpose of the study is to compare the 3 ointment formulations containing LEO 29102 plus&#xD;
      calcipotriol and Daivonex® ointment and Diprosone® ointment and to compare LEO 29102 plus&#xD;
      calcipotriol to LEO 29102 alone and to calcipotriol alone in the same ointment vehicle, using&#xD;
      the psoriasis plaque test modified from the method developed by KJ Dumas and JR Scholtz.&#xD;
