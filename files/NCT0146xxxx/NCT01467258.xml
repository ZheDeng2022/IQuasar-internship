    <textblock>
      Amantadine appears to be a specific substrate for acetylation by spermidine/spermine&#xD;
      N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT). SSAT activity in cancer cells is higher by several-fold compared&#xD;
      to normal cells. Amantadine can be used to determine SSAT cellular activity, and may indicate&#xD;
      the presence of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide additional information in conjunction with data from a previous study&#xD;
      which include cancer patients and normal health age matched controls to determine whether&#xD;
      urinary excretion of acetylamantadine is predictive for the presence of cancer, and if so&#xD;
      whether excretion of this metabolite is associated with any particular site of the tumor.&#xD;
      Based on the results of the first study additional data in normal healthy volunteers is&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from both studies will be analyzed to account for subject gender, stage of disease&#xD;
      at time of testing, concurrent diseases, alcohol and tobacco use and occupational&#xD;
      characteristics. This is an important first step in validating a cancer detection method that&#xD;
      can be implemented economically for screening of large numbers of people at sites remote from&#xD;
      limited and expensive diagnostic instrumentation. Thus there is a possibility that this&#xD;
      design can be prognosis biomarker as well as a positive/negative indicator.&#xD;

      A group of 20 female and 20 male normal healthy volunteers ages 18 to 69 will be recruited&#xD;
      from the community by use of a general advertisement placed initially as posters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will tell the volunteers that we are conducting this study in healthy volunteers to&#xD;
      determine how amantadine is eliminated from the body. We will explain the pharmacology of&#xD;
      amantadine and the potential side effects of a single dose before we obtain consent.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be told of the potential for concurrent alcohol ingestion to result in the&#xD;
      presence of acetylamantadine in urine. Volunteers will be required to abstain from alcohol&#xD;
      consumption for at least one day prior to and including the time involved in the amantadine&#xD;
      ingestion and urine collection. Any previous adverse reaction to amantadine will exclude a&#xD;
      person from volunteering from this study. Subjects will be informed that side effects from&#xD;
      this drug ingestion are highly unlikely because only a single dose will be administered. Any&#xD;
      side effects if they occur will be related to the effect of amantadine on the brain. These&#xD;
      effects may include insomnia, jitteriness, difficulty in concentrating and mental depression.&#xD;
      However, these are the side effects associated with chronic ingestion of amantadine and are&#xD;
      highly unlikely to occur with ingestion of a single dose. Once consent is obtained, the&#xD;
      volunteers will ingest a therapeutic dose of amantadine (200 mg) in the morning, at least 2&#xD;
      hours before breakfast, and their complete urine will be collected over a period of 12 hours&#xD;
      post dose. A previous clinical study in our laboratory with collections of urine for a total&#xD;
      of 8 hours demonstrated that this collection time was sufficient to collect all metabolically&#xD;
      produced acetylamantadine in the urine. The urine samples will also be analyzed for their&#xD;
      content of creatinine as an indication of the completeness of the urine collection. The&#xD;
      urines will then be labeled with a code and frozen at -20Â°C until analyzed. The urine will be&#xD;
      analyzed for acetylamantidine by our established gas chromatography method. The technician&#xD;
      analyzing the samples will not have access to any participant information other then the code&#xD;
      on the label. Saliva specimens will also be collected at 2 hour intervals after amantadine&#xD;
      ingestion. It should be noted that with the morning dose of amantadine collection of multiple&#xD;
      saliva samples will be simplified and allow for the determination of the optimal time after&#xD;
      dose for the urine analysis. Furthermore, this design will identify the window of opportunity&#xD;
      to give the best signal to noise ratio for acetylamantidine production. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected 1 hour prior to dosing and 2 hours post dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also collect the following data from each volunteer: their name, age, sex, body&#xD;
      weight, height, any concurrent medication use, and a recent history of alcohol ingestion.&#xD;
      These data will be used for correlation analyses to determine any relationship of urinary&#xD;
      acetylamantidine to the particular cancer diagnosis, sex, and/or the history of alcohol&#xD;
      consumption. All of these data will be coded by the principal investigator, and individually&#xD;
      identifying information locked in a secure cabinet. Access to the data by other than the&#xD;
      principal investigator and/or their attending physician will not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are anyone with a history of previous adverse reaction to amantadine as&#xD;
      well as pregnant or lactating females will be excluded from volunteering for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross validation of the finding will occur by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)&#xD;
      of these urine samples for the presence of polyamines and metabolites, including&#xD;
      N1-acetylspermidine.&#xD;
