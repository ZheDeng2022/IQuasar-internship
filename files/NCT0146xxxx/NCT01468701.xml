  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this part of the Registry Program patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) at&#xD;
      risk for stroke are enrolled to characterize the target population and to collect real world&#xD;
      data on important outcome events. For administrative purposes the study is divided into two&#xD;
      protocol numbers: 1160.129 for all non-EU (European Union) and non-EEA (European Economic&#xD;
      Area) countries, and 1160.136 for EU and EEA countries. The total number of patients enrolled&#xD;
      in both protocols is estimated to be 48,000 patients, and all these patients will be included&#xD;
      in the data analysis for study 1160.129.&#xD;

    <description>Incidence rate of composite outcome which includes events of Stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, life-threatening bleeding events and vascular death on restricted set that included Dabigatran etexilate (DE) of phase III and Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA) of phase III only. In case of multiple events for a patient, the first event was considered. Unknown cause of death was imputed by multiple imputation. Counts were based on the average of the 20 restricted data sets. The average of the 20 incidence rates from the 20 imputed datasets were used to obtain the point estimate of the incidence rate that is reported here. The bootstrapping approach was used to obtain the 95% confidence interval of the incidence rate.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>GLORIA-AF was an international, multicentre, non-interventional study based on prospectively collected data for patients (pts) with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). In Ph II, pts baseline characteristics (BC), their antithrombotic treatment patterns and outcomes with 2 years of follow-up for dabigatran alone were collected prospectively. Ph III collected prospective data on pts BC, their treatments and outcomes with 3 years of follow-up for all pts in real-world setting.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the study. Patients attended a participating site which ensured that they (the patients) strictly met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Incidence rate of composite outcome which includes events of Stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, life-threatening bleeding events and vascular death on restricted set that included Dabigatran etexilate (DE) of phase III and Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA) of phase III only. In case of multiple events for a patient, the first event was considered. Unknown cause of death was imputed by multiple imputation. Counts were based on the average of the 20 restricted data sets. The average of the 20 incidence rates from the 20 imputed datasets were used to obtain the point estimate of the incidence rate that is reported here. The bootstrapping approach was used to obtain the 95% confidence interval of the incidence rate.</description>
        <time_frame>From baseline visit of phase III until end of initial treatment regimen episode (minimum date of permanent stop of DE + 3 days/ VKA+ 6 days, start date of other treatments - 1 day, and date of study completion/discontinuation), up to 3 years.</time_frame>
        <population>Restricted patient set: was defined only for eligible dabigatran and vitamin K antagonist patients (pts) of phase III who were within region of propensity score (PS) overlap excluding pts in non-overlapping tails of PS distribution, using cut-offs at 1.5th percentile of the PS distribution for dab-exposed group, and 98.5th percentile of distribution for VKA-exposed group. Excluding these pts from the tails of PS distribution reduces channeling bias and improves the validity of comparisons.</population>

          <description>Incidence rate of vascular composite outcome including events of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction and vascular death on restricted set that included Dabigatran etexilate (DE) of phase III and Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA) of phase III only. In case of multiple events for a patient, the first event was considered. Unknown death was imputed by multiple imputation. Counts were based on the average of the 20 restricted data sets. The average of the 20 incidence rates from the 20 imputed datasets were used to obtain the point estimate of the incidence rate that is reported here. The bootstrapping approach was used to obtain the 95% confidence interval of the incidence rate.</description>
          <population>Restricted patient set: was defined only for eligible dabigatran and vitamin K antagonist patients (pts) of phase III who were within region of propensity score (PS) overlap excluding pts in non-overlapping tails of PS distribution, using cut-offs at 1.5th percentile of the PS distribution for dab-exposed group, and 98.5th percentile of distribution for VKA-exposed group. Excluding these pts from the tails of PS distribution reduces channeling bias and improves the validity of comparisons.</population>

        <time_frame>From baseline visit of phase III until end of initial treatment regimen episode (minimum date of permanent stop of DE + 3 days/ VKA+ 6 days, start date of other treatments - 1 day, and date of study completion/discontinuation), up to 3 years.</time_frame>
        <population>Restricted patient set: was defined only for eligible dabigatran and vitamin K antagonist patients (pts) of phase III who were within region of propensity score (PS) overlap excluding pts in non-overlapping tails of PS distribution, using cut-offs at 1.5th percentile of the PS distribution for dab-exposed group, and 98.5th percentile of distribution for VKA-exposed group. Excluding these pts from the tails of PS distribution reduces channeling bias and improves the validity of comparisons.</population>

          <population>Restricted patient set: was defined only for eligible dabigatran and vitamin K antagonist patients (pts) of phase III who were within region of propensity score (PS) overlap excluding pts in non-overlapping tails of PS distribution, using cut-offs at 1.5th percentile of the PS distribution for dab-exposed group, and 98.5th percentile of distribution for VKA-exposed group. Excluding these pts from the tails of PS distribution reduces channeling bias and improves the validity of comparisons.</population>
