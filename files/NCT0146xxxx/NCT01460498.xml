    <textblock>
      This is a 2 part study. The goal of the first part of this clinical research study is to find&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose of azacitidine that can be given with a TKI that you are already&#xD;
      taking (such as Gleevec, Sprycel, or Tasigna). The safety of this drug will also be studied.&#xD;
      The goal of the second part is to see if this combination may improve your response to the&#xD;
      TKI you are already taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azacitidine is designed to change genes that are thought to cause leukemia. By changing these&#xD;
      genes, the drug may help to stop them from causing the disease to grow.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will continue receiving the&#xD;
      same TKI at the dose you had been receiving for the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive azacitidine either as an injection under your skin or through a vein every&#xD;
      day for 3 to 7 days of each 28-day cycle. The dose and how often you take the drug will&#xD;
      depend on when you enter the study. The study staff will tell you how often you will receive&#xD;
      the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of the study, you will be assigned to a dose level of azacitidine based on&#xD;
      when you join this study. Up to 2 dose levels of azacitidine will be tested. At least 3&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will&#xD;
      receive the lowest dose level. The next group will receive a higher dose than the group&#xD;
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest&#xD;
      tolerable dose of azacitidine is found. This is called the Dose Escalation Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerated dose has been found, an extra 36 participants will receive&#xD;
      azacitidine at this dose level. This is called the Expansion Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have severe side effects from the study drug, the study doctor may decide to reduce&#xD;
      and/or stop drug dosing until your side effects improve. If the doctor thinks it is in you&#xD;
      best interest, your dose may be increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every visit, you will be asked about any side effects you have had and to list any drugs&#xD;
      you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 1-2 weeks for 8 weeks, then at the start of every cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon)&#xD;
           will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 2-4 weeks for 8 weeks, then before each cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will also&#xD;
           be drawn to test your kidney and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before each cycle for 3 cycles, then every 3-6 cycles until 1 year, then every 6-12&#xD;
           cycles, blood (about 1 tablespoon) drawn for molecular testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 3-6 months in Year 1, then as often the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have&#xD;
           a bone marrow aspirate to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in the Expansion Group, every 3 months (+/- 1 month) for the first 6 months,&#xD;
           then every 6-12 months, you will have a complete physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in the Dose Escalation Group, every 2 weeks for the first month, Months 1, 2,&#xD;
           3, and 6 (+/- 1 month), and then every 6-12 months, you will have a complete physical&#xD;
           exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. TKIs are approved for the treatment of CML. Azacitidine is&#xD;
      FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of patients with MDS. The&#xD;
      combination of these drugs to treat CML is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 48 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
