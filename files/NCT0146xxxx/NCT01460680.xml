      Polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids (ω3 PUFAs) are essential nutrients. Studies indicate that&#xD;
      the incidence of Major Depression (MD) is inversely related to the consumption of fish (which&#xD;
      are rich in ω3-PUFAs) and to the concentration of ω3 PUFAs in the plasma or Red Blood Cell&#xD;
      (RBC) membranes. In several studies, the ω6 to ω3 ratio was elevated (ω6 PUFAs are&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory, compared to ω3). ω3 PUFAs are also inversely associated with anxiety and&#xD;
      neuroticism but apparently not with somatization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation of fish oil alleviates joint pain in patients with auto-immune disease.&#xD;
      Inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (which induce both pain and depression-like&#xD;
      symptoms) by ω3 PUFAs may underlie the benefit conferred by fish oil consumption . RBC ω3&#xD;
      PUFA content is lower in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and chronic fatigue&#xD;
      syndrome, compared to healthy controls. The ω3 PUFA status of fibromyalgia patients has not&#xD;
      been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium is an essential nutrient and plays a regulatory role in neural transmission. It is&#xD;
      not known whether magnesium concentration is associated with pain in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the current study are to 1) compare the mean RBC omega-3 content in female&#xD;
      fibromyalgia patients compared to that of healthy controls and female SLE patients, and to 2)&#xD;
      assess the correlation between RBC omega-3 content and between the severity of physical (e.g.&#xD;
      pain) and mental (e.g. depression) in fibromyalgia and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia is a common, chronic pai n disorder that is recognized by the American College&#xD;
      of Rheumatology as a distinct clinical entity (1). In addition to the core feature of&#xD;
      long-term, body-wide &quot;soft tissue&quot; pain, patients often report co-morbid mental and physical&#xD;
      symptoms, including exercise intolerance, un-refreshing sleep, depressed mood and anxiety&#xD;
      (2). Much remains to be learned from the disorder's pathophysiology, but evidence exists of&#xD;
      inter-related perturbations involving the nervous, endocrine and immune systems (2,3). For&#xD;
      instance, depressive and anxiety symptoms are common and frequently severe, even in community&#xD;
      studies of FM (4). Fibromyalgia patients exhibit an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      which may contribute to pain and emotional distress (5,6). Although nutrients such as&#xD;
      polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids and magnesium attenuate hypersensitivity to pain, little&#xD;
      is known about the impact of nutrition on the development and persistence of fibromyalgia&#xD;
      (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids (ω3 PUFAs) are essential nutrients that are not&#xD;
      sufficiently consumed by many individuals. The brain accrues long-chain ω3 PUFAs&#xD;
      -particularly DHA- and a sufficient supply of ω3 PUFAs is necessary for CNS development and&#xD;
      function (8). The accessibility of circulating PUFAs renders them suitable for assessment of&#xD;
      PUFA status in epidemiologic studies. Indeed, studies indicate that the incidence of Major&#xD;
      Depression (MD) is inversely related to the consumption of fish (which are rich in ω3-PUFAs)&#xD;
      and to the concentration of ω3 PUFAs in the plasma or Red Blood Cell (RBC) membranes. RBC ω3&#xD;
      PUFA content is negatively correlated to the degree of depression in different settings. In&#xD;
      several studies, the ω6 to ω3 ratio was elevated (ω6 PUFAs are pro-inflammatory, compared to&#xD;
      ω3) (9-14). ω3 PUFAs are also inversely associated with anxiety and neuroticism (15,16) but&#xD;
      apparently not with somatization (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation of fish oil alleviates joint pain in patients with auto-immune disease (17).&#xD;
      Inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (which induce both pain and depression-like&#xD;
      symptoms) by ω3 PUFAs may underlie the benefit conferred by fish oil consumption (18).&#xD;
      Interestingly, RBC ω3 PUFA content is lower in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus&#xD;
      (SLE, refs 19,20) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS, ref 21), compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
      SLE and CFS are considered to be auto-immune and functional disorders, respectively, but both&#xD;
      share characteristics of fibromyalgia: a higher incidence in women, increased depressive&#xD;
      co-morbidity and the frequent presence of fibromyalgia-like symptoms (22,23). However, the ω3&#xD;
      PUFA status of fibromyalgia patients has not been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium is an essential nutrient and plays a regulatory role in neural transmission. It&#xD;
      appears to counter the development of hyperalgesia by inhibition of the NMDA-receptor&#xD;
      (24,25). Intracellular magnesium concentration reflects magnesium intake, distribution and&#xD;
      secretion, and varies widely between individuals. It is not known whether magnesium&#xD;
      concentration is associated with pain in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the current study are to 1) compare the mean RBC omega-3 content in female&#xD;
      fibromyalgia patients compared to that of healthy controls and female SLE patients, and to 2)&#xD;
      assess the correlation between RBC omega-3 content and between the severity of physical (e.g.&#xD;
      pain) and mental (e.g. depression) in fibromyalgia and SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: observational, case-control study Study Population: 100 female patients with&#xD;
      diagnosed fibromyalgia Control population(s): 100 female SLE patients, 100 healthy adult&#xD;
      females&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: (detailed below in Procedure section):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographics and medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Body mass index&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mean RBC omega-3 content&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intracellular magnesium concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Fibromyalgia Impact Score (FIQ, bennet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Modified ACR 2010 fibromyalgia scale (23)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Beck Depression Score&#xD;

&#xD;
        9. SLEDAI scale (SLE patients, ref 26)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Fibromyalgia Clinic (Rheumatology Unit, Sourasky Medical&#xD;
      Center). For each patient/volunteer, all assessments (BMI, questionnaires, blood test) will&#xD;
      be performed at a single visit. The principal investigator (K.A.) will enroll eligible and&#xD;
      willing participants from among the female patients treated at the clinic. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will receive a description of what is entailed in participating in the study. Suitable and&#xD;
      willing patients will sign the informed consent form and then 1) undergo venopuncture [10 ml&#xD;
      venous blood] and 2) complete questionnaires, with the guidance of an investigator. Data and&#xD;
      blood samples obtained from patients will be de-identified (recoded) and stored in Clinical&#xD;
      Research Forms (CRFs) and in test-tubes at -70oC, respectively. Blood samples will undergo&#xD;
      fatty acid analysis (see laboratory methods) and magnesium concentration. Serum will be&#xD;
      stored and kept for potential future analysis (e.g. for pro-inflammatory cytokines), but will&#xD;
      not be subjected to genetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred female SLE patients treated at the Rheumatology clinic will also be enrolled.&#xD;
      Following their signing of the informed consent form, patients will be assessed for&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, medical history, BMI, all questionnaires, and blood analysis for&#xD;
      RBC PUFA content and magnesium concentration. Disease activity will be documented by filling&#xD;
      out the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy female volunteers (without painful or inflammatory conditions) will be enrolled&#xD;
      through written invitation posted on allocated locations around the hospital. Following their&#xD;
      signing of the informed consent form, volunteers will be assessed for demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, medical history, BMI, BDI and blood analysis for RBC PUFA content and&#xD;
      magnesium concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatty acid composition of RBC membrane (thin liquid chromatography) 5 mls of blood will be&#xD;
      centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 5 o C, removal of plasma and buffy coat; addition of 5&#xD;
      ml cold saline + EDTA (NaCl 0.9% containing 1 mM EDTA) and mix; centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10&#xD;
      min at 5oC; repeat; flushing of erythrocytes with N2; storage at -70o C (Revco). Lipid&#xD;
      extraction will be performed by homogenization of the cells in hexane/ isopropanol (3 :2&#xD;
      vol./vol.) containing 5 mg/100 ml butylated hydroxytoluene as an antioxidant and 5 mg/100 ml&#xD;
      heneicosanoic acid (21 :0) as an internal standard. Fatty acid analysis: fatty acids will be&#xD;
      converted to methyl esters by heating with BF3 in methanol, and the methyl esters separated&#xD;
      on a HP 5890 Series II Gas Chromatograph containing a flame ionization detector. Peak areas&#xD;
      will be integrated and plotted with the aid of the Varian Star Integrator computer package&#xD;
      (Varian Star Workstation, 1990, Varian Associates, Inc.). Individual fatty acid methyl esters&#xD;
      will be identified by comparing retention times with authentic standards. Values will be&#xD;
      expressed as wt.% of total identified fatty acids (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANOVA and Chi Square tests will be used to determine differences between the groups in&#xD;
      possible covariates. One-way ANCOVA will be used to compare PUFA status between groups,&#xD;
      controlling for potential covariates. Pearson correlations will be conducted (assuming a&#xD;
      Normal distribution) to determine significant associations between symptom scores and between&#xD;
      levels of EPA, DHA, total n-3 PUFA, AA and total n-6 PUFA (expressed in all cases as&#xD;
      percentage of total fatty acids in erythrocytes). Significant correlations and covariates&#xD;
      will then be entered into multiple linear regressions to investigate whether PUFA levels are&#xD;
      associated with symptom scores. The significance level will be set at p&lt;.05 with correction&#xD;
      for multiple comparisons.&#xD;
