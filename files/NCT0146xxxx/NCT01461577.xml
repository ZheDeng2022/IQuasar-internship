      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of insulin glargine as measured by changes of HbA1c levels from&#xD;
           baseline in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients following GLP-1 failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the change in glycemic control, safety, and treatment satisfaction in&#xD;
           insulin glargine use in patients following GLP-1 failure.&#xD;
