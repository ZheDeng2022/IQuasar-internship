  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2018682 is a potent and selective agonist for the sphingosine-1- phosphate receptor&#xD;
      subtype 1 (S1P1) with the potential to be an effective treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
      The immunomodulatory properties of GSK2018682 are related to functional antagonism of S1P1 on&#xD;
      lymphocytes, resulting in sequestration of lymphocytes within the lymphoid organs, rendering&#xD;
      them incapable of migrating to sites of inflammation and leading to lymphopenia. Orally&#xD;
      administered GSK2018682 is very effective in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis&#xD;
      (EAE), an animal model of human MS. This study will assess the relative bioavailability of&#xD;
      different oral formulations of GSK2018682 in healthy volunteers. A tablet formulation is&#xD;
      desired for progression into future clinical safety and efficacy studies as the current&#xD;
      capsule formulation is not suited to large scale manufacture. The information obtained in&#xD;
      this study will help to establish the optimal dosing form for future studies, and also&#xD;
      determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of GSK2018682.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating, progressive neurological disease characterized by&#xD;
      inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in demyelination and axonal&#xD;
      damage (for review see [Compston, 2008]). The clinical course for ~85% of MS patients at&#xD;
      diagnosis is a relapsing remitting (RRMS) form, characterized by recurrent episodes of&#xD;
      neurological dysfunction (relapses) interspersed with longer periods of gradual improvement&#xD;
      (remissions). Typical symptoms during RRMS include limb weakness, sensory disturbance and&#xD;
      visual impairment. Over time, disability accumulates such that after 10 years approximately&#xD;
      half of RRMS patients do not suffer further relapses but show gradual progression of&#xD;
      disability, termed secondary progressive (SP) MS [Confavreuax, 2000]. Excess mortality due to&#xD;
      MS and quality of life is improving through more rapid and accurate diagnosis combined with&#xD;
      better complication management and administration of disease modifying therapies [Bronnum,&#xD;
      2006]. However, more efficacious and better tolerated medicines are needed to relieve the&#xD;
      considerable social and economic burden associated with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) is an endogenous ligand to a conserved family of five G-protein&#xD;
      coupled receptors(S1P receptor subtype 1 -5), with effective concentrations (EC50) ranging&#xD;
      from submicromolar to nanomolar levels [Chun, 2002]. Validation for a therapeutic approach&#xD;
      targeting S1P receptors in autoimmune disease has been provided by the clinical development&#xD;
      of FTY720 in MS (fingolimod; Novartis). GSK2018682 is an agonist at recombinant human S1P1&#xD;
      with some activity at S1P5 receptors but displays no agonist activity towards human S1P2,&#xD;
      S1P3 or S1P4 up to a concentration of 10 µM. This selectivity is anticipated to minimise&#xD;
      known cardiovascular effects mediated by S1P2/3 subtypes. Orally administered GSK2018682 is&#xD;
      very effective in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of&#xD;
      human MS. GSK2018682 has been reasonably tolerated following single oral doses of 0.6mg to&#xD;
      24mg in an ongoing study (P1A114070) in healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two Phase I studies (P1A114070 &amp; P1A114347) have been conducted in healthy volunteers using&#xD;
      GSK2018682 in capsule formulation. These capsules were produced from a single batch of&#xD;
      compound (second drug substance campaign, termed CD2) with a particle size of 15 µm (D90). In&#xD;
      order to support further clinical development of GSK2018682, a new batch (CD3) of compound&#xD;
      has been synthesized that has a slightly larger particle size (29 µm, D90). In addition, it&#xD;
      is intended that longer term studies (Proof of Concept and beyond) will be conducted with a&#xD;
      tablet form of the drug. There is also a possibility that obtaining a smaller particle size&#xD;
      through micronisation of the CD3 batch (to produce particles with diameters of approximately&#xD;
      3.8 µm, D90) may improve bioavailability; so a tablet made from micronized CD3 GSK2018682 is&#xD;
      also being developed. In order to ensure appropriate dose selection for future studies, there&#xD;
      is a need to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of both new tablet forms of GSK2018682&#xD;
      (manufactured from CD3 campaign) and compare these to the original (CD2) capsule formulation.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will evaluate the relative bioavailability of single doses of each of&#xD;
      the 3 different formulations (CD2 capsule, CD3 tablet and CD3 micronized tablet) of&#xD;
      GSK2018682 in a cross over, randomized, 4 period, open label design. The fourth treatment arm&#xD;
      will be added to examine the effect of food on relative bioavailability of the CD3 tablet&#xD;
      formulation. The study will also measure the effects of each dose form of GSK2018682 on total&#xD;
      lymphocyte counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2 mg dose will be used in the study as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK can be well quantified at this dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant (in excess of 100%) changes in PK parameters will be detectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK will be below level of quantification by 7 days after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  S1P1-mediated PD effects on lymphocytes and heart rate have not been detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is at least a 2 fold cover to exposures that do have PD effects on lymphocytes and&#xD;
           heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is very likely to be a dose used in a future Phase II study (given the predicted&#xD;
           accumulation ratio and exposure at steady state).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate single doses of GSK2018682 in a cohort of 16 healthy male and&#xD;
      female (of non-childbearing potential) subjects according to a randomized, open-label, 4 way&#xD;
      crossover design. The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the CD3 tablet formulation&#xD;
      will be explored as it is the most likely to be used in a future Phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimens will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD2 Capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD3 non-micronised Tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD3 micronised Tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD3 non-micronised Tablet under fed conditions&#xD;

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated&#xD;
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin&#xD;
             &lt;35%).&#xD;

             significantly outside the reference range for the population being studied may be&#xD;
             included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding&#xD;
             is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study&#xD;
             procedures. Subjects with lymphocyte counts outside the normal range should always be&#xD;
             excluded from enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;

             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on&#xD;
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,&#xD;
