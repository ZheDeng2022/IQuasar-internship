      This randomized clinical trial evaluates the clinical performance of a new two-component&#xD;
      self-etch universal adhesive, OptiBond XTR, when applied in non-carious Class V cervical&#xD;
      lesions without macromechanical retention (retentive grooves or bevels). The control material&#xD;
      is OptiBond FL, a &quot;traditional&quot; etch/prime/bond adhesive with documented clinical&#xD;
      performance. Eighty non-carious Class V cervical lesions are divided into two groups to be&#xD;
      treated with either OptiBond XTR or OptiBond FL. Both adhesives are applied strictly&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer's directions. Herculite Ultra, a nano-hybrid resin-based&#xD;
      composite, is used as the restorative material with both adhesives. The restorations will be&#xD;
      evaluated at insertion (baseline), 6 months, and 18 months. An optional three-year recall&#xD;
      evaluation is also proposed. The investigators hypothesize that both adhesives will have&#xD;
      comparable performance.&#xD;

      CLINICAL RESEARCH PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized clinical trial involved the restoration and evaluation of 83 (target&#xD;
      enrollment was 80) non-carious cervical lesions (NCCLs) using either the new two-component&#xD;
      self-etch universal adhesive OptiBond XTR or a control dental adhesive, OptiBond FL, and a&#xD;
      nano-hybrid composite restorative material, Herculite Ultra. OptiBond XTR is a two-component&#xD;
      self-etch, filled, fluoride releasing, light-cured bonding agent designed for the universal&#xD;
      bonding of direct and indirect restorations. The study design was based on the American&#xD;
      Dental Association Acceptance Program Guidelines for Dentin and Enamel Adhesive Materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Selection Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were selected on the basis of requiring restorations of non-carious cervical&#xD;
      lesions. Participants with fewer than 20 teeth were not considered. The participant pool was&#xD;
      randomized as much as possible to exclude bias due to age (18 to 80 years old), sex, race,&#xD;
      national origin, or other factors such as unusual dietary, habitual, or oral hygiene factors&#xD;
      which might affect the results. If the participant pool included these effects, they will be&#xD;
      acknowledged in all project reports. Despite our efforts to have close to equal numbers of&#xD;
      men and women in the study (ADA Guidelines, 2001), as noted in this report our pool was&#xD;
      imbalanced towards women (we enrolled 20 females and 4 males). However, we do not believe&#xD;
      this gender imbalance will affect or bias the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment in the study, participants signed a consent form. Both the consent form&#xD;
      and this research protocol were reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB)&#xD;
      at the University of North Carolina. IRB approval was secured throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tooth Selection Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any tooth included in the study contacted the opposing tooth in a normal occlusal&#xD;
      relationship and had normal periodontal health. The dental health status of the participant&#xD;
      was considered normal in all respects except for ongoing restorative procedures in unrelated&#xD;
      and unopposed quadrants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teeth restored had non-carious cervical lesions (NCCLs, abrasion/erosion/abfraction) with no&#xD;
      undercuts. Class V carious lesions were excluded. Normally, no more than 50% of the&#xD;
      cavosurface margin involved enamel and more than 75% of the surface area of the defect&#xD;
      involved dentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All NCCLs were characterized preoperatively relative to height of the lesion, width, depth,&#xD;
      percent of margin in enamel, internal angle of the lesion, and degree of sclerosis as&#xD;
      measured by the UNC Sclerosis Scale (Appendix 1). The shape of the lesions was documented as&#xD;
      &quot;saucer-shaped&quot; or &quot;notch-shaped.&quot; Evidence of stressful occlusion (wear facets, fremitus)&#xD;
      also was noted. These clinical co-variables can retrospectively be analyzed if any retention&#xD;
      failures occur to assess potential cause and effect relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distribution of Restorations (Per Participant)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize the chance that strong participant-related effects could distort the outcome of&#xD;
      the study, no more than two restorations of each type of material (four total restorations)&#xD;
      per participant were allowed. Our initial target was for the distribution of restorations to&#xD;
      include approximately one-half anterior teeth and one-half posterior teeth. A minimum of 25&#xD;
      participants at baseline, 20 participants at 6 months, and 15 participants at 18 months is&#xD;
      required for evaluation (ADA Guidelines, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized schedule was prepared to minimize the effects of operator, participant, and&#xD;
      material on the results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were scheduled as they were accepted in the study, and operators were scheduled&#xD;
      to place the restorations according to the Department of Operative Dentistry master schedule.&#xD;
      For each participant, the adhesive used (OptiBond XTR or OptiBond FL) in the first&#xD;
      restoration placed was chosen on the flip of a coin, and the subsequent restorations (if more&#xD;
      than one tooth was to be restored on that participant) were done using the other adhesive and&#xD;
      so on. Consequently, if the participant had two or more lesions to be restored, he/she&#xD;
      received both adhesives. Every effort was made to distribute the restorations evenly in the&#xD;
      mouth, i.e., restorations placed with both adhesives were equally distributed in&#xD;
      anterior/posterior teeth, and in maxillary/mandibular teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tooth Preparation Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tooth preparations were of a modified design (as described in Sturdevant's Art and&#xD;
      Science of Operative Dentistry, 6th edition, 2012). The preparations did not include&#xD;
      retentive grooves or bevels. The dentin and enamel walls of the preparation were lightly&#xD;
      roughened with a coarse diamond stone. Tooth preparation were limited to roughening the&#xD;
      involved surfaces and producing a definite finish line, where indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative procedures were performed using local anesthesia as needed. The operating sites&#xD;
      were isolated with cotton rolls and retraction cord, or rubber dam, depending on access and&#xD;
      location of the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tooth Restoration Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      OptiBond XTR and OptiBond FL were applied according to the specific directions supplied by&#xD;
      the manufacturer. The preparations were restored with a light-cured nanoparticle resin-based&#xD;
      composite material (Herculite Ultra). The composite was inserted in increments of 2 mm or&#xD;
      less. Each increment was fully polymerized according to composite shade for no less than 20&#xD;
      seconds using a Demi Plus LED light-curing unit as determined and provided by the&#xD;
      manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After polymerization, finishing was accomplished with 12-fluted tapered and/or flame-shaped&#xD;
      carbide finishing burs using light intermittent pressure to avoid damaging the margins.&#xD;
      Polishing was accomplished with slow speed polishing brushes (Occlubrush, Axis Dental) and&#xD;
      aluminum-oxide polishing discs (OptiDisc, Axis Dental) where accessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many factors that might contribute to retention and/or microleakage failures. For&#xD;
      that reason, the following items were recorded on the project data forms (see Appendix 3 for&#xD;
      example of data form) for each restoration placed during the course of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification # of the operator&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tooth # for each restoration&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participant's age and gender for each restoration&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Isolation method (e.g., cotton roll, retraction cord, rubber dam)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Number of increments of restorative composite&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Shade of composite&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Total polymerization time for adhesive and composite&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Finishing technique and instruments used&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Any unusual step and/or event (e.g., contamination requiring additional etching and/or&#xD;
           application of adhesive)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardization of Clinicians (Operators)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted with four operators experienced in this trial design. For the&#xD;
      purpose of initial standardization, all project personnel met to review the procedures in&#xD;
      detail, comparing their individual assessments of the procedures. They discussed difficulties&#xD;
      and potential problems and finalized the details of all clinical procedures. All involved&#xD;
      operators are full-time faculty of the Department of Operative Dentistry with years of&#xD;
      experience in clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the insertions, the patient coordinator had primary responsibility for&#xD;
      continual assessment of standardization. Any procedural step that was out of the ordinary was&#xD;
      recorded on the project data forms (comments section) and signed. In addition, the principal&#xD;
      investigators reviewed those points at the periodic meetings of the project personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL EVALUATION PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Evaluation Times&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restorations were evaluated at insertion (baseline) and 6 months, and will be evaluated&#xD;
      at 18 months, with an optional three-year evaluation. This document reports on data collected&#xD;
      at the 6 month evaluation visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct Evaluation Criteria and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each restoration will be evaluated for the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Retention&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Color match&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cavosurface margin discoloration&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Secondary caries&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Anatomic form&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Marginal adaptation and/or integrity&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Post operative sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
      United States Public Health Service (USPHS) direct evaluation procedures will be conducted&#xD;
      using the methods reported by Ryge in 1973. See Appendix 2 for a complete description of the&#xD;
      Direct Evaluation Criteria. Retention will be recorded as completely retained (alfa) or&#xD;
      partially or completely lost (charlie).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All restorations will be evaluated independently by two operators. Consensus will be&#xD;
      determined by consultation and re evaluation. The individual and consensus values will be&#xD;
      recorded on data sheets. The consensus values for each participant at baseline and each&#xD;
      recall period will be recorded on a participant case card. The case card data will be&#xD;
      transferred directly to a summary sheet containing data for all participants treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect Evaluation Criteria and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoral photographs are the best method to document color matching, interfacial staining,&#xD;
      and occlusal patterns. Intraoral color photographs were taken at baseline (before and after&#xD;
      restoration placement) and will be taken at each evaluation appointment as a permanent record&#xD;
      for subsequent indirect evaluation and later reference. Pre-operative photographs consist of&#xD;
      one image of the defect to be restored. Clinical photographs will be high-quality digital&#xD;
      images made at an original magnification of 1.5x and will be used principally for reference&#xD;
      to document the direct evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the retention and other aspects of a new two-component self-etch&#xD;
      adhesive system in non-retentive cervical defects when compared to a resin adhesive system&#xD;
      with documented performance. The study is designed so that its results can be compared with&#xD;
      the results of previous clinical trials and with ADA guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized clinical trial is designed as an equivalence trial, i.e., the overall&#xD;
      hypothesis tested is that the clinical performance of OptiBond XRT, as measured by the USPHS&#xD;
      criteria described, will be equivalent to that of OptiBond FL, which has excellent documented&#xD;
      clinical performance. In order to minimize possible participant and operator effects on the&#xD;
      results of the study, the assignment of participants to operators and materials to teeth was&#xD;
      randomized (see section Distribution of Restorations per Participant above). Participants&#xD;
      were assigned to operators in order of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual clinical evaluations and consensus values shall be recorded at each recall visit&#xD;
      and signed by each evaluator. Categorical (USPHS) values will be tabulated and incidence&#xD;
      values will be reported for comparison to the specification limits. Any failures during the&#xD;
      clinical study will be counted as failures in all subsequent recalls. The restorations'&#xD;
      failure rates will be calculated using the following equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure Percentage = [(PF+NF)/(PF+RR)] x 100%&#xD;
&#xD;
      PF = Number of previous failures before the current recall NF = Number of new failures during&#xD;
      the current recall RR = Number of restorations recalled for the current recall&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the study is designed as an equivalence trial, the power calculation is based not on&#xD;
      expected differences between adhesive systems, but rather on differences in performance of&#xD;
      the systems across time (baseline versus evaluation times). For an estimated 30 percent&#xD;
      difference in clinically unacceptable scores between baseline and 3 years, the sample size&#xD;
      used will adequately power the study at 85 percent. At baseline, data on subjects' age, sex&#xD;
      and occlusion, lesion characteristics and operator may be compared between the two&#xD;
      restorative systems using two-sample t tests (continuous variables) and χ2 (categorical&#xD;
      variables), to determine if the two groups are equivalent. The lesion characteristics to be&#xD;
      evaluated are internal angle, percentage of enamel margin, sclerosis scale value, and lesion&#xD;
      size (height, width and depth) and volume. Modified USPHS direct evaluation criteria scores&#xD;
      of restorations placed with OptiBond XTR or OptiBond FL will be compared at each evaluation&#xD;
      time for statistically significant differences using the Fisher exact test (P = 0.05).&#xD;
      Lesions/restorations will be used as the unit of analysis (cases). Although restorations&#xD;
      placed in the same participant are not totally independent cases, the assignment of&#xD;
      restorations to participants was randomized. Therefore, subject and lesion characteristics&#xD;
      are not expected to affect outcomes. However, to test for the influence of such&#xD;
      characteristics on the performance of the restorative systems, logistic regression can be&#xD;
      used to control for factors such as operator; subject's age, sex and occlusion; and lesion's&#xD;
      location, size and score on the sclerosis scale. Finally, we will run a survival analysis and&#xD;
      derive a Kaplan-Meier survival estimate curve on the clinically unacceptable (Charlie) scores&#xD;
      for any of the USPHS criteria at the different follow-up times. A log rank test for equality&#xD;
      of survivor function will be used to compare the survival estimates of the two restorative&#xD;
      systems. We will use Stata 10 data analysis and statistical software (StataCorp, College&#xD;
      Station, Texas) for all statistical analyses.&#xD;
