      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - AZD7451 is a drug that may help interfere with brain tumor cell growth. It can prevent&#xD;
      glioma cells from entering into normal brain tissue, and slow or stop the growth of&#xD;
      additional tumors. Researchers want to see if AZD7451 is effective against gliomas that have&#xD;
      not responded to surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if AZD7451 is a safe and effective treatment for gliomas that have not responded to&#xD;
      standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have gliomas that have not responded to standard&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, blood and urine&#xD;
           tests, heart function tests, an eye exam, and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take AZD7451 daily by mouth for 28-day cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will keep a medication diary and record any side effects. Treatment will be&#xD;
           monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will continue as long as there are no serious side effects and the tumor does&#xD;
           not start growing again....&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent glioma patients have very limited treatment options. A major cause of gliomarelated&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality is the extensive infiltrative and invasive nature of glioma cells.&#xD;
      Thus, inhibition of glioma invasion is a potentially promising strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work in the Neuro-Oncology Branch laboratory of Dr. Howard Fine has identified TrkA as an&#xD;
      important signaling receptor for mediating glioma cell invasion. Both genetic and&#xD;
      pharmacological inhibition of Trk potently inhibits glioma invasion and tumor progression in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo. AZD7451 is a first in-class inhibitor of Trk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous twice a day AZD7451 dosing in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To generate pharmacokinetic data on continuous twice a day AZD7451 dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma are eligible for this study. Patients should&#xD;
      have failed prior standard treatment with radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will accrue up to 60 evaluable patients. Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will receive&#xD;
      continuous AZD7451 twice a day orally for 28 days. The MTD will be based on the tolerability&#xD;
      observed during the first 4 weeks of treatment only. Up to three patients may be enrolled&#xD;
      simultaneously at each dose level. The dose of AZD7451 can be progressively escalated if only&#xD;
      0/3 or 1/6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity at the prior dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Cycle 1, patients may choose to continue to receive AZD7451 until disease&#xD;
      progression or until they experience unmanageable drug related toxicity, as long as they are&#xD;
      continuing to derive clinical benefit and do not fulfill any of the criteria for removal from&#xD;
      protocol therapy. Each cycle during this extension period will last 28 days.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically proven malignant primary gliomas who have progressive&#xD;
             disease after radiotherapy will be eligible for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an MRI scan performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a&#xD;
             fixed dose of steroids for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between&#xD;
             the date of imaging and registration a new baseline MRI is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be&#xD;
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients will be eligible four weeks after surgery if they have recovered from&#xD;
                  the effects of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for&#xD;
                  eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease&#xD;
                  postoperatively, an MRI should be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  at least 4 weeks post-operatively, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  within 14 days of registration, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If the 96 hour scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be&#xD;
        repeated. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration, a&#xD;
        new baseline MRI is required on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) (if the patient is&#xD;
             deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably impaired&#xD;
             in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is&#xD;
             questionable) to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be greater than or equal to18 years old, and must have a life expectancy&#xD;
             &gt; 8 weeks. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use&#xD;
             of AZD7451 in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but&#xD;
             may be eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks from radiation therapy. Additionally, patients must&#xD;
             be at least 6 weeks from nitrosoureas, 4 weeks from temozolomide, 3 weeks from&#xD;
             procarbazine, 2 weeks from vincristine and 2 weeks from last bevacizumab&#xD;
             administration. Patients must be at least 4 weeks from other cytotoxic therapies not&#xD;
             listed above and 2 weeks for non-cytotoxic agents (e.g., interferon, tamoxifen)&#xD;
             including investigative agents. With the exception of alopecia, all toxicities from&#xD;
             prior therapies should be resolved to CTCAE less than or equal to grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (WBC greater than or equal to&#xD;
             3,000/microl, ANC greater than or equal to 1,500/mm(3), platelet count of greater than&#xD;
             or equal to 100,000/mm(3), and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 gm/dl), adequate&#xD;
             liver function (AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 times ULN&#xD;
             and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN), and adequate renal function&#xD;
             (creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN and/or creatinine clearance greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 50 cc/min calculated by Cockcroft-Gault) before starting therapy.&#xD;
             Patients must also have serum potassium greater than or equal to 3.5 mmol/L,&#xD;
             magnesium, phosphate and calcium levels within normal levels; supplementation is&#xD;
             allowed. In cases where the serum calcium is below the normal range, 2 options would&#xD;
             be available: 1) the calcium adjusted for albumin is to be obtained and substituted&#xD;
             for the measured serum value. Exclusion is to then be based on the adjusted for&#xD;
             albumin values falling below the normal limit. 2) Determine the ionized calcium&#xD;
             levels. Exclusion is then to be based on whether these ionized calcium levels are out&#xD;
             of normal range despite supplementation. These tests must be performed within 14 days&#xD;
             prior to registration. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must either not be receiving steroids, or be on a stable dose of steroids for&#xD;
             at least five days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of AZD7451 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because AZD7451 is known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men&#xD;
             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or herpartner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, the treating physician should be informed immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to be performed within 2 weeks of trial entry with&#xD;
             QTc less than or equal to 470 msec.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 55% or normal by NIH Clinical Center criteria).&#xD;

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who, in the view of the treating physician, have significant active hepatic,&#xD;
             renal, pulmonary or psychiatric diseases are ineligible.&#xD;

             cava syndrome (SVC), New York Heart Association (NYHA, Appendix I) classification of&#xD;
             heart disease &gt;2 within 6 months before entry; or presence of cardiac disease that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, including transient ischemic attacks and other central&#xD;
             nervous system bleeding in the preceding 6 months that were not related to glioma&#xD;

          -  QTc with Bazett s correction that is unmeasurable, or &gt;470 msec on screening ECG.&#xD;
             (Note: If a subject has a QTc interval &gt;470 msec on screening ECG, the screen ECG may&#xD;
             be repeated twice (at least 24 hours apart). The average QTc from the three screening&#xD;
             ECGs must be less than or equal to 470 msec in order for the subject to be eligible&#xD;
             for the study. Patients who are receiving a drug that has a risk of QTc prolongation&#xD;
             excluded if QTc is greater than or equal to 460 msec.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any concurrent medication that may cause QTc prolongation or induce&#xD;
&#xD;
        Torsades de Pointes 1) Drugs listed in Appendix H, Table 2, that in the investigator s&#xD;
        opinion cannot be discontinued are allowed; however, must be monitored closely.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant medications that are moderate or potent inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4&#xD;
             are not permitted within the specified wash-out periods prior to or during treatment&#xD;

             by the investigator, that would significantly affect the absorption of AZD7451,&#xD;
             including the ability to swallow the oral solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to have active hepatitis B or C (testing not required for entry on&#xD;
             study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other concomitant anti-cancer therapy except corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a peripheral neuropathy CTCAE &gt; 1 in the prior 4 weeks or active muscle&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active infection or active bleeding diatheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD7451 is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with AZD7451, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with AZD7451. Female patients must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of&#xD;
             dosing if of child-bearing potential or must have evidence of non-childbearing&#xD;
             potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post-menopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least 12&#xD;
             months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments.&#xD;

             required treatment in the last 12 months and/or is expected to require treatment in&#xD;
             the next 12 months (except for non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ in the&#xD;
             cervix or ductal carcinoma in situ).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks or incompletely healed surgical incision before starting&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to be HIV-positive (testing is not required for entry on study) and on&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with AZD7451. In addition, these patients are at&#xD;
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
