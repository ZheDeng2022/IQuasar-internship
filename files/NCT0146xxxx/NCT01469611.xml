      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine the maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or maximum-feasible dose (MFD) of&#xD;
           JX-594 administered by biweekly intravenous (IV) infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine the safety of JX-594(TK- GM-CSF+ Wyeth strain vaccinia) administered by&#xD;
           biweekly IV infusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation trial in patients with advanced colorectal&#xD;
      carcinoma (CRC) that have failed both oxaliplatin based and irinotecan based prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Patients will receive treatment at one of three&#xD;
      dose levels in a sequential dose-escalating design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three patients will be treated at each dose level unless a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is&#xD;
      observed. Enrollment will proceed to the next dose level if 0 of 3 patients experiences a&#xD;
      DLT; if one of the first 3 patients experiences a DLT, additional patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      until a second patient experiences a DLT (which defines the toxic dose) or until six total&#xD;
      patients have been treated at that dose level, whichever comes first. If a second DLT is not&#xD;
      experienced within that cohort, dose escalation may continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled a minimum of 14 days after the first treatment of the immediately&#xD;
      preceding patient for the first patient in any cohort or all remaining patients in a cohort&#xD;
      with DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 2 DLTs are observed within a cohort, enrollment into the cohort will cease and the dose&#xD;
      level immediately preceding that dose will be determined to be the MTD. Regulatory&#xD;
      Authorities and the IRB will be notified as required if any patient dies within 28 days of&#xD;
      product administration due to a serious and unexpected ADR that is determined by the&#xD;
      Investigator to be possibly or probably related to JX-594.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD and/or MFD is defined, an additional 3-6 patients may be enrolled at that dose&#xD;
      level. Note: once the MTD and/or MFD is defined, treatment of additional patients at this&#xD;
      dose level will no longer require inter-patient delays of 14 days.&#xD;
