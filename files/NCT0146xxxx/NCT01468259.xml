      This study will be an open-label, single-treatment, single-dose, parallel group study to&#xD;
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of droxidopa in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe&#xD;
      renal dysfunction and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) after a single dose compared to matched&#xD;
      healthy subjects with normal renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 48 male or female subjects, 16 subjects with normal renal function (eGFR greater&#xD;
      than 90 mL/min/1.73m²) and eight each (8) with mild (60 less than eGFR less than 89&#xD;
      mL/min/1.73m²), moderate (30 less than eGFR less than 59 mL/min/1.73m²), or severe (15 less&#xD;
      than eGFR less than 29 mL/min/1.73m²) renal impairment or ESRD (eGFR &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73m² and&#xD;
      requiring hemodialysis) will be selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      The medical and laboratory examinations will take place within 28 days before dosing. A&#xD;
      single dose of 600 mg of droxidopa as an investigational drug will be administered with 240&#xD;
      mL of water after an overnight fast (minimum 10 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for the measurement of plasma concentrations of droxidopa and metabolites&#xD;
      including but not limited to 3-OM-DOPS, NE, vanillic acid, and protocatechuic acid will be&#xD;
      collected before and 0, .5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 30, 36 hours after dosing&#xD;
      for healthy volunteers and subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and&#xD;
      those with ESRD. For the latter, samples will be collected on both a non-hemodialysis and a&#xD;
      hemodialysis visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During dialysis, samples of dialysate, from the arterial and venous sides of the dialyzer&#xD;
      will be collected at 30-minute intervals during the dialysis period. In addition, the entire&#xD;
      dialysate will be collected, its volume recorded, and a sample retained for the measurement&#xD;
      of droxidopa and metabolites including but not limited to 3-OM-DOPS, NE, vanillic acid, and&#xD;
      protocatechuic acid concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples for the measurement of urinary excretion of droxidopa and metabolites including&#xD;
      but not limited to 3-OM-DOPS, NE, vanillic acid, and protocatechuic acid will be collected&#xD;
      before and over the following intervals after dosing: 0 2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-12, 12-24, and&#xD;
      24-36 hours for healthy volunteers and subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A post-study visit with physical examination and laboratory tests will take place within&#xD;
      seven (7) days after the last PK blood sampling.&#xD;

      Introduction Droxidopa (L-DOPS) is an orally administered, synthetic catecholamine that is&#xD;
      converted to the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) through a single step of&#xD;
      decarboxylation by the endogenous enzyme 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) decarboxylase.&#xD;
      Droxidopa was originally developed by Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., and has been&#xD;
      marketed in Japan since 1989 for the indications listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement of frozen gait and dizziness on standing up in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
           Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement of orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and dizziness on standing up in&#xD;
           patients with Shy-Drager syndrome and familial amyloid polyneuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement of the following symptoms of orthostatic hypotension in patients undergoing&#xD;
           hemodialysis: dizziness, light-headed feeling, dizziness on standing up, malaise, and&#xD;
           weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chelsea hypothesizes that these indications have an deficiency or lack of activity of the&#xD;
      adrenergic neurotransmitter NE which can be affected by the use of a NE prodrug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1 clinical studies conducted in Japanese and Caucasian subjects, droxidopa was well&#xD;
      tolerated and no differences were noted in oral absorption between the two groups. Apart from&#xD;
      a moderate increase in heart rate in one Caucasian subject (receiving 600 mg droxidopa),&#xD;
      which was considered to be possibly related to study medication, there were no other adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) that were considered to be related to droxidopa treatment. The maximum plasma&#xD;
      concentration (Cmax) was reached between 2 and 3 hours after single, oral doses of droxidopa&#xD;
      (100 to 900 mg). The plasma elimination half-life (t½) of droxidopa was 1.4 - 1.5 hours and&#xD;
      approximately 15% of the drug was recovered unchanged in the urine. No drug accumulation was&#xD;
      observed after multiple oral dosing with droxidopa (300 mg twice daily for 5 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the therapeutic effects of droxidopa are believed to be due to the conversion of&#xD;
      droxidopa to NE, the major metabolite of droxidopa is methylated droxidopa (3-OM-DOPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After administration of single 100 mg and 300 mg doses to healthy volunteers, droxidopa,&#xD;
      3-OM-DOPS, and NE were observed in the urine. The 24-hour excretions of droxidopa and&#xD;
      3-OM-DOPS accounted for approximately 15% and 8% of the administered dose (3-OM-DOPS&#xD;
      uncorrected for molecular weight), suggesting that renal function may impact the clearance of&#xD;
      droxidopa and 3-OM-DOPS.1,2 A population PK study conducted in patients with Primary&#xD;
      Autonomic Failure indicated that increasing age was associated with decreased clearance of&#xD;
      both droxidopa and 3 OM DOPS (Apparent clearance decreased 0.8% per year of age [referenced&#xD;
      to age 65 years]). Further it was identified that patient's concurrently taking L-Dopa or&#xD;
      dopamine derivatives had approximately 50% of the clearance seen with patients not taking&#xD;
      droxidopa. 6 From a safety perspective, droxidopa has been generally very well-tolerated&#xD;
      across a large variety of patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a precursor of NE that can be administered orally, droxidopa is expected to provide a&#xD;
      therapy for NOH in patients with autonomic failure associated with neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator's Brochure3 should be reviewed for a complete description of the non&#xD;
      clinical and clinical experience with droxidopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Objectives 2.1 Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of droxidopa in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal&#xD;
      dysfunction and ESRD after a single oral dose compared to matched healthy subjects with&#xD;
      normal renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK parameters Cmax, Tmax, AUC(inf), CL/F, Vz/F, t½, and CLr are considered the primary&#xD;
      parameters for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Secondary Objective The secondary objective of this study is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of Droxidopa in matched healthy subjects and those with mild to severe renal&#xD;
      dysfunction and ESRD through participant AEs and laboratory measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Investigational Plan 3.1 Study Description This study will be an open-label,&#xD;
      single-treatment, single-dose, parallel group study to evaluate the PK of droxidopa in&#xD;
      subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal dysfunction and ESRD after a single dose&#xD;
      compared to matched healthy subjects with normal renal function.&#xD;
