    <textblock>
      The proposed project is testing two behavioral interventions designed to improve long-term&#xD;
      weight loss among participants who struggle with eating in response to stress or emotional&#xD;
      experiences. Group treatment lasts for 1 year, with assessments lasting 2 years. Participants&#xD;
      must live in the greater Providence, Rhode Island area in order to be eligible.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major health problem and behavioral weight control programs are the treatment of&#xD;
      choice for mild and moderate obesity. However, there is marked variability among participants&#xD;
      in the weight losses achieved in these programs and the maximum weight losses are typically&#xD;
      achieved at month 6, followed by weight regain. Thus innovative approaches are needed to&#xD;
      improve longer-term treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the same behavioral treatment program is offered to all participants, with no&#xD;
      tailoring to meet the needs of specific subgroups. One subgroup that may need a specialized&#xD;
      approach are those who report high levels of internal disinhibition, i.e. eating in response&#xD;
      to negative thoughts or emotions. Over 50% of individuals entering behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      programs report high levels of internal disinhibition on the Eating Inventory (EI), this&#xD;
      subgroup is distinct from those with binge eating disorder, and most importantly, these&#xD;
      individuals lose significantly less weight than other participants during weight loss&#xD;
      treatment [particularly at 18 months]. Thus efforts are needed to develop more effective&#xD;
      treatments for this subgroup. The proposed research is significant because it may help move&#xD;
      the field from a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach, to the development of interventions for&#xD;
      specific subgroups of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that individuals who report problems with internal&#xD;
      disinhibition may achieve better weight losses in an enhanced behavioral weight loss program&#xD;
      that focuses on acceptance-based strategies. Whereas standard behavioral treatments teach&#xD;
      patients to control their negative thoughts with techniques such as cognitive restructuring&#xD;
      and distraction, acceptance based strategies teach patients to experience thoughts and&#xD;
      feelings as they are, without attempting to control them and to continue to pursue their&#xD;
      behavioral goals despite experiencing negative thoughts and feelings. Acceptance-based&#xD;
      strategies have been shown to be helpful for a number of behavioral problems including weight&#xD;
      loss and maintenance, however are yet untested in large trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a randomized controlled trial comparing standard behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      treatment with a program which incorporates acceptance based strategies in the treatment of&#xD;
      overweight/obese individuals with problems with internal disinhibition. A total of 160&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to a standard behavioral weight loss treatment program&#xD;
      (SBT) or to an innovative approach that combines standard behavioral weight loss with&#xD;
      acceptance based strategies (referred to hereafter as &quot;Acceptance Based Behavioral&#xD;
      Intervention&quot; or ABBI). Both groups will meet weekly for 6 months, biweekly for 3 months and&#xD;
      then monthly for 3 months. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 6 month intervals&#xD;
      for 24 months total, with measures of weight, acceptance of negative emotions, distress&#xD;
      tolerance, and adherence to the weight loss program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that participants in the ABBI program will achieve greater changes&#xD;
      in weight (in the form of weight reductions) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months when compared to&#xD;
      baseline weight than participants in SBT. Secondary hypotheses are that participants in ABBI&#xD;
      will experience greater improvements in acceptance of weight related negative thoughts and&#xD;
      emotions and distress tolerance and better treatment adherence than participants in SBT.&#xD;
