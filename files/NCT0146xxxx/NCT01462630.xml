  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating patients with&#xD;
      advanced angiosarcoma. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) at 3 months and response rate defined as&#xD;
      complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) in angiosarcoma patients treated with&#xD;
      pazopanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall survival of patients treated with pazopanib. II. To gather more safety&#xD;
      data for pazopanib in this patient population. III. To explore the ability of [F-18]&#xD;
      fludeoxyglucose (FDG) (positron emission tomography [PET])/computed tomography (CT) imaging&#xD;
      to assess response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 21&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
