    <textblock>
      Phase I trial will be conducted in patients suffering local metastatic melanoma with relapsed&#xD;
      cutaneous/subcutaneous tumors including melanoma-in-transit. Based on the preclinical data&#xD;
      package, DNA Therapeutics has considered that the risk-benefit ratio of DT01 supports the&#xD;
      initiation of a phase I clinical study in this population. The recommended starting dose of&#xD;
      DT01 for the first injection to human was based on NOAELs and Maximum Recommended Starting&#xD;
      Dose (MRSD) calculations and by considering both local and systemic approaches. It was set at&#xD;
      16 mg (4 mg per injection site, 2 injections per tumor, 2 tumors to be treated). This&#xD;
      starting dose will be increased up to 96 mg if no DLT occurred during dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DT01 will be locally administered by peritumoral subcutaneous and/or intratumoral injections&#xD;
      in combination with hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (RT) (10x 3 Gy) and chloroquine (100 mg&#xD;
      oral QD) starting one week before DT01 and RT treatments. DT01 will be administered 3 times a&#xD;
      week during two weeks; The study will be an open, non-randomised, multicentre, phase I dose&#xD;
      escalation (16, 32, 48, 64 and 96 mg) safety study with a 3+3 design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics of DT01&#xD;
      in association with palliative radiotherapy and to evaluate pharmacodynamics and the&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of DT01 according to RECIST criteria on day 26, 40 and 54. The duration&#xD;
      of response (Time-To-Local Recurrence, TTLR), will be monitored 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after&#xD;
      the beginning of the DT01 treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the WHO, the incidence of melanoma is 199,627 worldwide in 2008, of which the&#xD;
      melanoma-in-transit is about 4%. When melanoma spreads, it does so by the lymphatic system&#xD;
      which drains to the regional lymph nodes. Uncommonly, melanoma can become trapped in the&#xD;
      lymphatic vessels and grow to cause tumor nodules in the skin and subcutaneous tissues&#xD;
      between the primary site and the regional lymph node basin. These nodules are termed&#xD;
      in-transit metastases and carry an ominous prognosis. The American Joint Committee on Cancer&#xD;
      (AJCC) defines such in-transit metastases as any skin or subcutaneous metastases that are&#xD;
      more than 2 cm from the primary lesion but are not beyond the regional nodal basin. The 2010&#xD;
      tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system considers the melanoma-in-transit a N2c stage when&#xD;
      they arise in the absence of nodal metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current treatment options (approved or in late stage development) are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local excision, if there are only a few;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolated limb perfusion (local high dose chemotherapy);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic chemotherapy (Dacarbazine, Temozolomide, Cis-platine);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Targeted therapy (B-raf inhibitors: Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib; MEK inhibitor:&#xD;
           Trametinib);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunotherapy (Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, OncoVEX GM-CSF, Tumor Infiltrating&#xD;
           Lymphocytes and interleukin-2 [IL-2]);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photodynamic therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laser vaporization. With rare exceptions, none of these treatments are curative.&#xD;
           Immunotherapy results in prolongation of survival although overall response rate remains&#xD;
           low (ref: oncovex phase II study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Sponsor's clinical development strategy and plan, the local metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma with relapsed cutaneous/subcutaneous tumors, including melanoma-in-transit, has been&#xD;
      chosen as the 1st indication for evaluating safety, tolerance and PK of DT01 in combination&#xD;
      with a palliative radiotherapy (10x3 Gy). The presence of multiple cutaneous/subcutaneous&#xD;
      tumor should provide an initial clinical evaluation of the safety and skin tolerance of the&#xD;
      combined treatment of DT01 and 10x3 Gy irradiation, as well as a preliminary assessment of&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity (proof of concept) of DT01 to sensitize and improve the response rate of&#xD;
      radiotherapy (estimated about 50% response rate), and to delay local relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the pharmacologically active dose in human melanoma xenografted tumor in mice and&#xD;
      the wide safety margin estimated from the toxicology data, the starting dose of 16 mg and the&#xD;
      planned dose escalation represent a conservative approach for titration. The dose escalation&#xD;
      will provide valuable information about the safety, tolerance and preliminary efficacy data.&#xD;
