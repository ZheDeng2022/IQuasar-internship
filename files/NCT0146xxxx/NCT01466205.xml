      Currently, no study to date has directly tested a selective D1R agonist in relation to the&#xD;
      cognitive impairment of Schizophrenia without the confound of neuroleptics. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to examine the efficacy of DAR-0100A, a highly selective, full D1R agonist supported&#xD;
      by pre-clinical and preliminary pilot clinical data, in ameliorating the cognitive deficits&#xD;
      in Schizotypal Personality Disordered subjects receiving no medications including&#xD;
      antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that 1) Baseline primary outcome measures will be impaired in&#xD;
      Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) subjects compared to controls, 2) SPD subjects on&#xD;
      DAR-0100A will show improvement on primary measures greater than healthy controls and SPD&#xD;
      patients randomized to placebo, and 3) SPD patients will show significant improvements on&#xD;
      primary outcome variables on drug compared to placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Working memory deficits are central to the cognitive impairment of schizophrenia and other&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders. The D1 receptor (D1R) is probably the best established mediator of&#xD;
      working memory in neuroscience studies for over three decades and represents a highly&#xD;
      promising therapeutic target for enhancing working memory in these disorders, yet this&#xD;
      mechanism has never been tested in humans. Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) patients&#xD;
      who evidence moderate, focal impairments in working memory represent a unique population to&#xD;
      test the effect of a D1 agonist on working memory impairment in humans. Cognitive impairment&#xD;
      is the most salient predictor of functional outcome in schizophrenia (SCZ) and is essentially&#xD;
      refractory to conventional treatments. Identifying pharmacologic agents that target the&#xD;
      cognitive deficits of SCZ is thus the top priority in SCZ research, but so far, clinical&#xD;
      trials of a number of drugs with preclinical promise have yielded disappointing results.&#xD;
      Currently, no study to date has directly tested a selective D1R agonist in relation to the&#xD;
      cognitive impairment of SCZ without the confound of neuroleptics. The investigators propose&#xD;
      to examine the efficacy of DAR-0100A, a highly selective, full D1R agonist supported by&#xD;
      pre-clinical and preliminary pilot clinical data, in ameliorating the cognitive deficits in&#xD;
      SPD subjects receiving no medications including antipsychotics. SPD will be classified as a&#xD;
      schizophrenic disorder in DSM-5 and ICD-10. The investigators have characterized the&#xD;
      cognitive deficits of SPD and demonstrated that, as with chronic SCZ, a core component&#xD;
      consists of impairments in working memory. Studies of SPD obviate confounds associated with&#xD;
      SCZ, such as the effects of overt psychotic episodes, medication history, severe, persistent&#xD;
      functional impairment and multiple treatments. Furthermore, the cognitive deficits of SPD are&#xD;
      less global and more readily reversible than those of chronic SCZ, providing a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to test the D1 mechanism of cognitive enhancement. DAR-0100A, which is the active&#xD;
      enantiomer of dihydrexidine (DHX), is a full D1R agonist with a10-60 fold selectivity over&#xD;
      the D2R. DHX administration improves cognition in single doses in young adult and aged&#xD;
      monkeys and rodents. A single treatment with DAR-0100A in adult humans with SCZ was&#xD;
      demonstrated to enhance prefrontal perfusion. Pilot data from our group and Columbia suggest&#xD;
      DAR-0100A improves cognitive performance, particularly working memory, in the schizophrenia&#xD;
      spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims: 1. To perform a 5-year study in which three consecutive days of DAR-0100A at a&#xD;
      dose of 15 mg or placebo are administered intravenously over 30 minutes to 60 patients with&#xD;
      SPD (12/yr) in a between-groups, randomized, double-blind design. Cognitive testing will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline (Day 1) and on the third day of drug/placebo administration (Day 4).&#xD;
      Subjects will return at Day 15 to receive drug (if randomized initially to placebo) or&#xD;
      placebo (if randomized to drug) in a double blind fashion in an identical protocol. This&#xD;
      allows all patients to receive drug for Secondary Aim 1 while maintaining the blind. Baseline&#xD;
      (Day 1) and repeat cognitive testing (Day 4) is also administered to 60 healthy controls per&#xD;
      year (12/yr). The cognitive tests of working memory serving as primary outcome measures will&#xD;
      include the modified AX-CPT (d'), the N-back (% correct at the 2-back condition), the DOT&#xD;
      Task (distance error at 30 second delay - no delay), and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition&#xD;
      Task (PASAT)( correct responses). The investigators will also include other tests of memory,&#xD;
      executive function, and verbal learning for secondary outcome measures (see Methods) as well&#xD;
      as comparison tests not hypothesized to change with drug: the Benton line orientation test&#xD;
      (JLOT) and the Trail Making Test A. 2. To compare changes on the primary outcome measures&#xD;
      from baseline to Day 4 testing between drug and placebo administration in SPD subjects. 3. To&#xD;
      compare primary outcome variables at baseline and change from baseline to Day 4 testing&#xD;
      between patients groups and healthy controls. 4. To obtain plasma DHX concentrations on Day 4&#xD;
      to evaluate plasma concentrations in relation to cognitive changes as a potential covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims: 1. To evaluate the change between baseline and Day 4 cognitive testing in all&#xD;
      SPD patients receiving drug in the first or second phase. 2. To evaluate secondary outcome&#xD;
      and comparison variables between SPD patients on placebo and drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypotheses: 1. Baseline primary outcome measures will be impaired in SPD subjects&#xD;
      compared to controls. 2. SPD subjects on DAR-0100A will show improvement on primary measures&#xD;
      greater than healthy controls and SPD patients randomized to placebo between baseline and Day&#xD;
      4. 3. SPD patients will show significant improvements on primary outcome variables on drug&#xD;
      compared to placebo but not on comparis¬on perceptual (JLOT) and processing speed/attentional&#xD;
      tasks (Trails A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is critical to establish efficacy for cognitive enhancement with a selective D1 agonist in&#xD;
      a schizophrenic disorder with cognitive impairment and without concomitant neuroleptic&#xD;
      treatment to provide momentum for these efforts. The more readily reversible cognitive&#xD;
      impairment of SPD provides a unique opportunity for this critical study of the D1 hypothesis&#xD;
      to pave the way for development for more severe schizophrenic disorders with their inevitable&#xD;
      complicating artifacts.&#xD;
