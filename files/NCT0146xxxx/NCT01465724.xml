  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current prevalence of hypertension as part of the metabolic syndrome is substantial and&#xD;
      is increasing with the rise of obesity worldwide. Chronic elevation of sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system (SNS) activity has been identified as a common and key factor in disease states as&#xD;
      obesity-related hypertension (ORH). The renal sympathetic nerves are a major contributor to&#xD;
      the complex pathophysiology of this elevated SNS activity. Percutaneous renal denervation&#xD;
      (PRDN), the deliberate disruption of the nerves connecting the kidneys with the central&#xD;
      nervous system, has been shown to be an effective means of modulating elevated SNS activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study is an observational feasibility study, with the aim to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of renal denervation on changes in insulin resistance and blood pressure in patients&#xD;
      with obesity related hypertension. The investigators will study different variables: a&#xD;
      laboratorial set, a set of blood pressure measurements and a set of investigations in the&#xD;
      vascular laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators hypothesize that renal denervation has a beneficial effect on insulin&#xD;
           resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators hypothesize that there will be no complications related to the device&#xD;
           or procedure.&#xD;

      Objectives: The objectives of this study are: to compare changes in insulin resistance in&#xD;
      patients with ORH after RDN; to evaluate the safety of PRDN in this patient group; to compare&#xD;
      changes in blood pressure, laboratory parameters, arterial stiffness and SNS-activity after&#xD;
      PRDN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective observational feasibility-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with a high fasting glucose (fasting serum glucose ≥5.6 mmol/L(100&#xD;
      mg/dL)) and with an ambulatory systolic blood pressure &gt;130mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major endpoints: The effect of RDN on: insulin resistance, blood pressure and major adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
