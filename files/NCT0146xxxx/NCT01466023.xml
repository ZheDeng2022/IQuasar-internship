    <textblock>
      Transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity (THOP) is a typical entity of the preterm infant,&#xD;
      affecting the majority of preterm infants, born less than 30 weeks of gestational age. It is&#xD;
      defined as a temporary postnatal reduction from cord values in serum levels of T4 and FT4,&#xD;
      but with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.The etiology of THOP is complex and&#xD;
      multifactorial. Loss of maternal T4, limited postnatal thermogenesis, hypothalamic-pituitary&#xD;
      immaturity, limited thyroid gland reserve, persistent fetal thyroid hormone metabolism and&#xD;
      predisposition to nonthyroidal illness syndrome are several factors that contribute in less&#xD;
      or more intensity to THOP.The association between THOP and poor neurodevelopmental outcome is&#xD;
      well established and several therapeutic clinical trials have been set up. However, there is&#xD;
      currently no evidence for prophylactic or therapeutic supplementation with thyroxine (T4) for&#xD;
      premature infants with THOP. One study of van Wassenaer et al. showed a beneficial effect of&#xD;
      treatment of THOP in a subgroup of preterm infants with gestational age less than 28 weeks,&#xD;
      but a reverse effect in the group with a gestational age of 29 weeks. This is an illustration&#xD;
      of the limited comprehension of the pathophysiology of THOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although studies about THOP usually involves the preterm infants born at 33 weeks or earlier,&#xD;
      one study of Paul et al. showed a decreased thyroid function in late preterm and term infants&#xD;
      with respiratory distress syndrome as function of severity of illness. Unpublished data of&#xD;
      our center showed also the presence of THOP, although less frequent, in the group of late&#xD;
      preterm infants. Other data about this group of preterm infants are scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first half of pregnancy, the fetus is completely dependent of maternal thyroid&#xD;
      hormone supply and the fetal thyroid gland starts thyroid hormone secretion from about 17-19&#xD;
      weeks of gestational age. Conditions of maternal (sub)clinical hypothyroidism are associated&#xD;
      with complications like hypertension, preterm birth, low birth weight, placental abruption,&#xD;
      and fetal death. One can wonder if there are compensating mechanisms in the placenta,&#xD;
      providing the fetus with sufficient thyroid hormone in cases of compromised thyroid supply.&#xD;
      One study showed that total placenta deiodinase type 3 (D3) activity in pregnancies with&#xD;
      severely hypothyroid fetuses was not significantly lower than in euthyroid controls. Two&#xD;
      studies showed increased monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) and decreased MCT10 expression&#xD;
      within placentae of pregnancies complicated by IUGR. As far as we know, nothing is known&#xD;
      about possible compensating effects in placentae of mothers with subclinical hypothyroidism&#xD;
      and the possible influence on the development of THOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy is a predisposition for the development&#xD;
      of overt hypothyroidism. The influence of maternal thyroid antibodies during pregnancy&#xD;
      towards thyroid hormone function of the fetus and consequently neurodevelopmental outcome is&#xD;
      still not clear. One single study of Negro et al. showed that euthyroid pregnant women who&#xD;
      are positive for thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) develop impaired thyroid function,&#xD;
      which is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and premature deliveries. They also&#xD;
      showed that substitutive treatment with levothyroxine (LT4) is able to lower the chance of&#xD;
      miscarriage and premature delivery.A study of Pop et al. concluded that children of pregnant&#xD;
      women who had elevated titers of TPO-Ab but normal thyroid function are at risk for impaired&#xD;
      development.Nothing is known about the possible influence of maternal thyroid antibodies&#xD;
      towards the development of THOP, although a theoretical link is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to investigate whether there are compensatory mechanisms in placentas&#xD;
      of premature born infants and whether the maternal thyroid hormone condition is a prediction&#xD;
      of the development of THOP in the premature infant. The investigators want to investigate the&#xD;
      differences between several groups of preterm infants: 24-28 weeks, 28-32 weeks and 32-36&#xD;
      weeks. The further aim of this study is to investigate the impact of maternal thyroid hormone&#xD;
      condition during pregnancy on neurodevelopmental outcome of the neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Belgium, 8% of the newborns are born preterm. There are about 2000 deliveries each year in&#xD;
      the University Hospitals Leuven. Between 2 and 5% of all pregnant women are considered to&#xD;
      have subclinical hypothyroidism and preterm birth is almost 2-fold higher in women with&#xD;
      subclinical hypothyroidism.The incidence of THOP is 30 %. We performed a statistical power&#xD;
      calculation with a confidence level of 95%. Given the above data and with the assumption that&#xD;
      50% of the premature babies born to a hypothyroid mothers will develop THOP, we need to&#xD;
      include 320 patients who give premature birth to obtain a statistical power of 80%.&#xD;
      Therefore, the inclusion time will be 2 years.&#xD;
