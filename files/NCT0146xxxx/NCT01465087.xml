  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex multi-factorial disease, with underlying both genetic&#xD;
      and environmental factors. Different populations have different susceptibility to MS. The&#xD;
      disease is characterized by 2 main phenotypes: relapsing-remitting or progressive course.&#xD;
      Clinical disability is due to distraction of the central nervous system (CNS) myelin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repair processes are mainly noted after the acute relapse - and recovery of function can be&#xD;
      spontaneous. However, in severe relapses sometimes there is need for STEROID TREATMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the long term prophylaxis - following the increased understanding of the disease, in the&#xD;
      last 10-15 years, there are new immunotherapies available (COPAXON / TEVA; Interferon -beta).&#xD;
      However these can attenuate the disease (reduce the number of relapses per year) but cannot&#xD;
      cure it. Also, they are beneficial in only ~40 % of the Relapsing -Remitting patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are no biomarkers available for MS (other than oligoclonal Immunoglobulin G&#xD;
      (IgG) in the cervical spine fluid (CSF) - which helps confirm diagnosis but require an&#xD;
      invasive procedure and are not correlated with disease activity nor response to therapy) and&#xD;
      monitoring of MS and its treatment is by magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) - which is an&#xD;
      expensive procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr Hossam Haick from the Technion developed an electronic nose based on nanomaterials for&#xD;
      diagnosis of diseases (e.g., cancer, kidney failure, etc.) via breath samples.The research&#xD;
      hypothesis is that Biomarkers of CNS inflammation and/or neurodegeneration and/or CNS repair&#xD;
      in persons with MS can be detected by the &quot;electronic nose&quot;.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MS is the most common chronic neurological disease affecting young adults, with onset usually&#xD;
      at the age 20-40 years. Women are affected 3-4 times more than men. It is a complex&#xD;
      multi-factorial disease, with underlying both genetic and environmental factors. Different&#xD;
      populations have different susceptibility (Compston and Coles 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease is characterized by 2 main phenotypes: relapsing-remitting or progressive course.&#xD;
      Clinical disability is due to destruction of the CNS myelin (mainly oligodendrocytes) due to&#xD;
      3 processes (Franklin 2002; Franklin and Ffrench-Constant 2008; Frischer, Bramow et al.&#xD;
      2009):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inflammation- immune cells with aberrant activity invade the brain and spinal cord and&#xD;
           cause destruction of CNS myelin (a process called demyelination and secondary&#xD;
           neurodegeneration - axonal and neuronal loss)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Primary neurodegeneration (axonal and neuronal loss) - without prominent inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Repair - the inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes are followed by an attempt of&#xD;
           the CNS to repair - however, this partial and incomplete repair is often the basis of&#xD;
           residual deficits and disability (Chandran, Hunt et al. 2008) .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The acute MS relapse (presented as paralysis, visual loss, etc.) - is considered to&#xD;
                be due to an aberrant acute immune activation and inflammatory process in the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The chronic accumulating disability - is considered to be due to the&#xD;
                Neuro-degenerative process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repair processes are mainly noted after the acute relapse - and recovery of function can be&#xD;
      spontaneous. However, in severe relapses sometimes there is need for STEROID TREATMENT&#xD;
      (Tischner and Reichardt 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the increased understanding of the disease, new immunotherapies were developed&#xD;
      (COPAXON /; Interferon -beta )in the last 10-15 years for long term treatment. However these&#xD;
      can attenuate the disease (reduce the number of relapses per year) but do not cure it. In&#xD;
      addition, they are beneficial in only ~40 % of the Relapsing -Remitting patients. Currently&#xD;
      there are no treatments for patients with the Progressive Disease - who have gradual&#xD;
      increased disability (Murray 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently there are no biomarkers available for diagnosis and routine follow-up of MS.&#xD;
      Oligoclonal IgG in the CSF - which help confirm the diagnosis, require an invasive procedure&#xD;
      and are not correlated with disease activity nor response to therapy; and MRI, which allows&#xD;
      monitoring of MS activity and response to treatment is too expensive to routine use (Link and&#xD;
      Huang 2006; Murray 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr Hossam Haick from the Technion, developed an electronic nose for diagnosis of diseases via&#xD;
      breath samples. Dr Haick's previous studies have shown that an electronic nose based on gold&#xD;
      nanoparticles could form the basis of an inexpensive and non- invasive diagnostic tool for&#xD;
      lung cancer (Peng, Tisch et al. 2009) and kidney diseases (Haick, Hakim et al. 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis Biomarkers of CNS inflammation and/or neurodegeneration and/or CNS repair&#xD;
      can be detected by the &quot;electronic nose&quot; in breath samples of persons with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of biomarkers of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CNS inflammation and CNS-autoimmunity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Neurodegeneration&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CNS repair&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  that may serve as markers for: disease (vs controls), disease activity (predicting&#xD;
                aggressive disease course, predicting Relapse; predicting Malignant vs Benign MS);&#xD;
                response to therapy (Steroid , immunotherapies or neuroprotective agents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work plan outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate few groups clinically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MS patients at acute relapse pre - vs- after 7 ,30 and 90 days of steroids treatment -&#xD;
           to assess indicators of the acute inflammatory process and of the effects of Steroid&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relapsing MS patients vs Progressive MS patients vs controls which include healthy&#xD;
           individuals as well as patients suffering from neurological and autoimmune diseases&#xD;
           other than MS - to assess inflammatory vs neurodegenerative indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MS patients who are Good- vs Poor- Responders to immunotherapy or Steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BREATH COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alveolar breath of the volunteers is collected using an &quot;offline&quot; method that effectively&#xD;
      separates the endogenous from the exogenous breath volatile biomarkers and excludes the nasal&#xD;
      entrainment. Two bags of 750 ml of breath samples per volunteer are collected in inert Mylar&#xD;
      bags (Eco Medics, Duerten, Switzerland). Vapor sampling was performed by extended breath&#xD;
      sampling into the collection apparatus for 15-20 minutes, with several stops during this&#xD;
      process. The first three minutes of breath sampling are discarded due to the possible&#xD;
      contamination of the upper respiratory air. The subsequent deep air is retained for testing&#xD;
      purposes. The samples are collected with a tube that was introduced in the volunteer's mouth&#xD;
      and connected to the collection bag. All participants provide a signed informed consent to&#xD;
      this study, which is performed following the approval and according to the guidelines of the&#xD;
      Helsinki Committee of Carmel Medical Center and Technion's committee for supervision of&#xD;
      experiments in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE BREATH SAMPLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gas-Chromatography/Mass-Spectrometry (GCMS-QP2010; Shimadzu Corporation, Japan), combined&#xD;
      with a thermal desorption system (TD20; Shimadzu Corporation, Japan), is used for the&#xD;
      chemical analysis of the breath samples. A Tenax® TA adsorbent tube (Sigma Aldrich Ltd.) is&#xD;
      employed for pre-concentrating the VOCs in the breath samples. Using a custom-made pump&#xD;
      system, the breath samples from the Mylar bags are sucked up through the TA tube at 100&#xD;
      ml/min flow rate, being then transferred to a thermal desorption (TD) tube (Sigma Aldrich&#xD;
      Ltd.) before being analyzed by GC-MS. The following oven temperature profile was set: (a) 10&#xD;
      min at 35°C; (b) 4°C/min ramp until 150°C; (c) 10°C/min ramp until 300°C; and (d) 15 min at&#xD;
      300°C. An SLB-5ms capillary column (Sigma Aldrich Ltd.) with 5% phenyl methyl siloxane (30 m&#xD;
      length, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.5 μm thicknesses) is employed. The splitless&#xD;
      injection mode is used for 2 min, at 30 cm/sec constant linear speed and 0.70 ml/min column&#xD;
      flow. The molecular structures of the VOCs are determined via the standard modular set, using&#xD;
      10 ppm isobutylene (Calgaz, Cambridge, Maryland, USA) as standard calibration gas during each&#xD;
      run. GC-MS chromatogram analysis is realized using the GCMS solutions version 2.53SU1&#xD;
      post-run analysis program (Shimadzu Corporation), employing the National Institute of&#xD;
      Standards and Technology (NIST) compounds library (Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1070, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SENSING MEASUREMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon interaction between the breath samples and the detector, the volatile organic compounds&#xD;
      adsorb into the organic part of the sensing material The result of this adsorption is&#xD;
      translated to an electrical signal (resistance) that is transmitted to the macro-world (e.g.,&#xD;
      the screen of the device) through the (semi-)conductive material found in the same film. The&#xD;
      results are then presented on the computers screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An automated system controlled by a custom LabView (National Instruments) program is used to&#xD;
      perform the sensing measurements. The sensors are tested simultaneously, in the same exposure&#xD;
      chamber, using an Agilent 34980A multifunction switch. A Stanford Research System SR830 DSP&#xD;
      lock-in amplifier controlled by an IEEE 488 bus is used to supply the AC voltage signal (0.2&#xD;
      V at 1 kHz) and to measure the corresponding current (&lt;10μA in the studied devices). This&#xD;
      setup allows for measuring normalized changes in conductance as small as 0.01%. Sensor&#xD;
      resistance was continuously acquired during the experiments. Sensing experiments were&#xD;
      continuously performed using subsequent exposure cycles (see SOI, section 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Features extraction. For VOC analysis, three parameters are extracted from each sensor&#xD;
      response: (i) the normalized change of sensor resistance at the middle of the exposure (S1);&#xD;
      (ii) the normalized change of sensor resistance at the end of the exposure (S2); and (iii)&#xD;
      the area under the response curve (S3). S1 and S2 are calculated with regard to the value of&#xD;
      sensor resistance prior to the exposure. For breath analysis, two parameters are extracted&#xD;
      from each sensor response (either to the control VOC or to each release of breath sample):&#xD;
      (i) the normalized change of sensors resistance soon after the exposure (S4); and (ii) the&#xD;
      normalized change of sensors resistance at the middle of the exposure (S5). S4 and S5 are&#xD;
      calculated with regard to the value of sensor resistance prior to the exposure. A&#xD;
      compensation and calibration process is posteriorly applied to these parameters to retain&#xD;
      from sensor responses only that information related to their response to the VOCs from the&#xD;
      breath samples. The mean values of the parameters obtained over the two successive exposures&#xD;
      to the same sample are then calculated.&#xD;
