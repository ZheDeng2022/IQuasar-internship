  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI) post contrast injection remains mandatory given its&#xD;
      association to morbidity and mortality1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast nephropathy (CN) was classically defined as an increase in 25% or more or absolute&#xD;
      increase of 44 umol/l of creatinine levels within three days following contrast injection2.&#xD;
      Markers such as cystatine C may be more sensitive to identify CN and also to correlate to&#xD;
      mortality8 although a definition of CN using these markers is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients undergoing elective radiological procedures, CN can be prevented by hydration,&#xD;
      withdrawal of diuretics and nephrotoxic drugs. N Acetylcysteine (NAC) has been proposed to&#xD;
      protect against contrast nephropathy since 200013. While hydratation is clearly beneficial in&#xD;
      preventing CIN14, the role of NAC administration is still uncertain and results of RCTs gave&#xD;
      conflicting results regarding its effect15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may be the form of choice in emergency procedures given&#xD;
      its rapid disponibility and its ease of administration in patients whose consciousness is&#xD;
      altered or who can not eat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is therefore to determine whether 6000 mg of intravenous NAC is&#xD;
      efficient in preventing CN after emergency contrast injection in CKD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and thirty consecutive patients with an estimated GFR &lt; 60 mL/min and an&#xD;
      indication to undergo an emergent contrast-enhanced CT will be included in the study.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: asthma, pregnancy, obstructive nephropathy and patient or family's&#xD;
      refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be blindly randomized by computer to either placebo (0.45% saline) or high dose&#xD;
      (6000 mg) iv n-acétylcystéine (flumicil) iv diluted in 0.45% saline. All patients will&#xD;
      receive intravenous hydration (250 ml NaCl 0.45% at least) before the CT scan and 1000 ml&#xD;
      after the examination depending on clinical possibilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatinine and cystatine C serum levels will be collected one hour before CT scan and at day&#xD;
      2, 4 and 10. The T0 value will be the value measured before the CT-scan and not the baseline&#xD;
      admission value in order to correct for differential hydratation due to different waiting&#xD;
      time and hydratation before tomography. Serum Creatinine and Cystatine C will be measured by&#xD;
      the Jaffe method, and by a nephelometric assay respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study will be the occurrence of contrast nephropathy at day 2, 4&#xD;
      or 10, defined as an increase of at least 25% and/or 44 umol/l in serum creatinine level or&#xD;
      cystatine C levels at day 2, 4 or 10 compared to day 0. We will also assess the proportion of&#xD;
      patients with contrast nephropathy regarding the biomarker used and according to AKIN&#xD;
      criteria as well. D The AKIN criteria defined a stage 1 AKI as an increase in creatinine&#xD;
      between 150% and 199% from baseline or an absolute increase of at least 26.2 umol/l, a stage&#xD;
      2 AKI as an increase between 200% and 299% from baseline and a stage 3 AKI as an increase of&#xD;
      at least 300% from baseline or a creatinine concentration higher than 354 umol/l with an&#xD;
      acute rise of at least 44 umol/l or initiation of RRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be the mean increases in creatinine and cystatin C concentrations in&#xD;
      days 2, 4 and 10 and the maximum increase during the time periods from day 2 to day 10 (peak&#xD;
      increase).&#xD;
