    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate two potential treatments for children with&#xD;
      Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) that do not involve the use of medication.&#xD;
      Our goal is to develop new interventions for preschoolers with ADHD that will result in&#xD;
      enduring reductions of ADHD symptoms and associated impairments in children, and thus prevent&#xD;
      long-term difficulties characteristic of many children with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both interventions involve weekly playgroups (of roughly five children) in which children&#xD;
      engage in designated activities while parents engage in groups focusing on parent education,&#xD;
      support, and their children's activities. It is hypothesized that both interventions will be&#xD;
      helpful, but that only one will have lasting effects well beyond the end of active treatment.&#xD;
