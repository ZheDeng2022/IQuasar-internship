      The specific aims of the project are to conduct a three-phase study to develop a data-driven&#xD;
      Clinical Alert feature to the RecoveryTrackâ„¢ Concurrent Recovery Monitoring (CRM) system and&#xD;
      test its efficacy, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - Analyze RecoveryTrack and outcomes data to create a clinical algorithm that&#xD;
      predicts early treatment attrition; adapt elements of a cognitive behavioral intervention&#xD;
      (CBI) for use in addressing Clinical Alerts, as well as adapting training and adherence&#xD;
      measures; reprogram RecoveryTrack with a Clinical Alert feature for each of the first three&#xD;
      monitoring assessments to inform counselors when a client is at High Risk to leave treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II -Conduct a feasibility trial to refine Clinical Alerts + CBI intervention and the&#xD;
      study measures/procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III - Conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial comparing outcomes of clients whose&#xD;
      counselors were randomized to Clinical Alerts + CBI to those of clients whose counselors were&#xD;
      assigned to TAU (control condition). The primary hypothesis is that clients who evidence a&#xD;
      High Risk for attrition will have longer lengths of stay in the Clinical Alerts + CBI&#xD;
      condition than High Risk clients in the control condition. Secondary client hypotheses are&#xD;
      that High Risk clients in the Clinical Alert + CBI condition will attend more treatment&#xD;
      sessions, have more drug-free urine results, and receive more ancillary services than High&#xD;
      Risk clients in the control condition.&#xD;

      Phase 1:Our study team completed Phase I of the project in June, 2011. Our initial plans&#xD;
      called for our team to analyze RT data that was collected by Delaware treatment programs to&#xD;
      determine specific predictors for early attrition from treatment. Eleven counselors were&#xD;
      trained to use RT as part of their standard practice in May, 2011. In an effort to generate a&#xD;
      predictive algorithm for Phase II, we analyzed data from three datasets available from IRB&#xD;
      approved research projects. However, the results were inconclusive, possibly due to small&#xD;
      sample sizes and differences in the recruitment and definition of drop out across samples. In&#xD;
      order to proceed with Phase II, we created an algorithm based largely on severity of&#xD;
      substance use, a consistent predictor of drop-out across the alcohol and illicit substance&#xD;
      literature; the algorithm also addresses when clients are not using but their Risk factors&#xD;
      greatly outweigh the influence of Protective factors. We determined that the algorithm did&#xD;
      work to identify clients who self-reported using substances or high levels of risk. However,&#xD;
      the identification rate of high-risk cases was too low, and so we modified the algorithm to&#xD;
      identify: 1) clients with high use at baseline, 2) clients with positive urine samples, 3)&#xD;
      clients with any use at subsequent [post-baseline] interviews, and 4) clients whose risk&#xD;
      factors outweighed their protective factors. This increased our rate of identification of&#xD;
      risk cases by about 32%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of Phase I, we also completed the programming changes to RT to add a Clinical Alert&#xD;
      feature that informs counselors when a client is at high risk based on the algorithm. The CBI&#xD;
      intervention and training materials for Phase II was created. We developed the CBI into a&#xD;
      brief clinical &quot;toolkit&quot; that enabled counselors to respond to clinical risk based on their&#xD;
      judgment. This Toolkit allows counselors to exercise clinical judgment to determine whether&#xD;
      clients are generating a Clinical Alert because 1) they are using drugs or alcohol, or are at&#xD;
      risk to start using, 2) they have unmet psychosocial needs [i.e., need for psychiatric&#xD;
      consultation], or 3) they have a poor alliance with the counselor / treatment provider and&#xD;
      need some help building on the relationship. The Clinical Alert Toolkit included a series of&#xD;
      exercises / interventions that counselors could deploy once they had determined which of the&#xD;
      client's needs were most pressing (either based on their own judgment or in agreement with&#xD;
      the client).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:Three counselors consented to participate in this study and were trained to use RT in&#xD;
      May, 2011 and were trained on the CBI intervention in June, 2011. Recruitment of client&#xD;
      participants began in July, 2011. The training and intervention materials were well received&#xD;
      by the participating counselors. One counselor ended their employment prior to the research&#xD;
      staff beginning client recruitment. 30 clients out of 35 who were approached participated in&#xD;
      the feasibility trial; 28 clients completed baseline (93%), 23 completed the one month follow&#xD;
      up (77%), 21 completed the two month follow up (70%), and 21 completed the three month follow&#xD;
      up (70%). Out of these clients, two clients were incarcerated for their 1 month follow up&#xD;
      window, 2 clients were incarcerated for their 2 month follow up window, and three clients&#xD;
      were incarcerated for their three month follow up window therefore they were not approached&#xD;
      to complete the follow-up interview. We used our experiences during Phase II to make several&#xD;
      changes in our training and clinical protocol for counselors to follow. We revised several of&#xD;
      our Toolkit components (specifically the worksheets to make them more user-friendly and to&#xD;
      reduce training burden). We also simplified our feedback strategy which took place during the&#xD;
      clinical supervision sessions to focus much less on general therapeutic skills and more&#xD;
      specifically on actual compliance with the trained Clinical Alert CBI. Additionally, we found&#xD;
      that while our Phase II training counselors verbalized motivation to try to learn to use the&#xD;
      CBI techniques, that the learning curve was slower than we desired, and we decided to employ&#xD;
      a contingency management feedback strategy to increase their incentive to acquire the basic&#xD;
      elements of the CBI more quickly. This revision required IRB approval; in the revised&#xD;
      approach, counselors could earn bonuses when a rated audio recorded session showed that they&#xD;
      had been at least minimally adherent in delivering the CBI. Finally, during Phase II we&#xD;
      completed the Attention Control training (focused on treatment planning) for use in the TAU&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Because we needed to move the study from Delaware Site 1 (our original clinical site&#xD;
      and partner), our team recruited Alternate Site 1 in Philadelphia and Alternate Site 2 in&#xD;
      central New Jersey to conduct the Phase III clinical pilot trial. We enrolled 20 counselors&#xD;
      who were trained to use RT on a monthly basis with their clients, starting at the first&#xD;
      scheduled individual session and monthly thereafter. We randomly assigned these counselors to&#xD;
      receive either TAU treatment planning training or to receive Clinical Alert (CA) training.&#xD;
      After training, recruitment began. During the trial, three counselors in the CA condition&#xD;
      either were noncompliant with the study protocol (N = 2), or never had any clients report any&#xD;
      high risk (N = 1). We worked with all three of these counselors to encourage improved&#xD;
      engagement with the intervention and study procedures, but this was not successful.&#xD;
      Consequently, we decided that we would over-recruit additional counselors into the CA&#xD;
      condition, to create additional opportunities to determine whether the Clinical Alerts +&#xD;
      Intervention training would impact outcomes. We recruited an additional three counselors, but&#xD;
      did not randomize them; rather, we assigned them directly to the CA condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We enrolled 336 clients in Phase 3. 142 self-reported clinical RT data which would result in&#xD;
      a Clinical Alert profile (TAU: N = 78, CA: N = 64). Because of a low recruitment rate, the&#xD;
      study was severely underpowered for our subanalyses to examine specific effects of the&#xD;
      intervention training on dealing with High Risk cases; this is where we believed our&#xD;
      strongest effects would present themselves.&#xD;
