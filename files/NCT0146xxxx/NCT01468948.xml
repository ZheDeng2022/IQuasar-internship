      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Essential tremor (ET) is a condition of out-of-control shaking. Several drugs are used to&#xD;
      treat ET. However, they are often only partly helpful and can have side effects. Many people&#xD;
      with ET get some relief from drinking alcohol. Octanol, a food additive similar to alcohol,&#xD;
      can improve tremor in animals and is less likely to make people feel drunk. One form of&#xD;
      octanol, called 1-octanol, has been shown to improve tremor in some people and had few side&#xD;
      effects. 1-octanol is converted to octanoic acid, and research suggests that octanoic acid&#xD;
      itself might suppress ET with no significant side effects such as drunkenness. Researchers&#xD;
      want to see what dose of octanoic acid is most useful in reducing ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test different doses of octanoic acid to treat essential tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 21 years of age who have ET that responds to treatment with&#xD;
           alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be able to stop taking certain ET medications during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires three visits. Visit 1 is a screening visit that will take up to 5&#xD;
           hours. Visit 2 is a 2- to 3-day inpatient admission to the National Institutes of Health&#xD;
           Clinical Center. Visit 3 is a followup outpatient visit 1 to 2 weeks after the hospital&#xD;
           admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the screening visit, participants will have a physical exam, neurological exam, and&#xD;
           medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Participants will also have&#xD;
           an alcohol dose test to measure the tremor s response to alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the study visit, participants will enter the hospital for testing. Participants will&#xD;
           have the study drug and test the tremor's response to it. Frequent blood samples will be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One to two weeks after leaving the hospital, participants will have a final followup&#xD;
           study visit. Blood samples will be collected.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral octanoic acid (OA) in patients with essential&#xD;
      tremor. Further study objectives include the evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      octanoic acid with escalation doses, as well as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 subjects with ethanol-responsive essential tremor (ET) will be included in the&#xD;
      study. Subjects will be recruited in groups of 6 per dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives will be tested using a 3+3 dose escalation design. Per dose level, 3&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited, and dose levels will be 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 mg/kg, with&#xD;
      additional 3 subjects at the same level if one of the three subjects exhibits dose limit&#xD;
      toxicity. Subjects will undergo a screening visit, followed by a 2 to 3-day inpatient&#xD;
      admission during which the study drug OA will be administered. An outpatient follow-up visit&#xD;
      will conclude the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be measured by evaluating dose-limiting toxicity, which will be&#xD;
      reached once 2 or more subjects exhibit a grade 2 adverse event (CTCAE) on the same&#xD;
      dose-level, which is related to OA. The dose below the level at which 2 or more grade 2&#xD;
      OA-related adverse events have been observed, will then be defined as maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and the study stopped. Toxicity for the primary outcome will be monitored by an&#xD;
      unblinded independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB), who will determine when the&#xD;
      primary outcome is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measures will include safety measures such as routine laboratory parameters, EKG&#xD;
      measures, vital signs as well as a standardized assessment for signs of intoxication.&#xD;
      Additional secondary outcome measures will include efficacy measures such as tremor&#xD;
      accelerometry and digital spiral analysis, as well as a standardized clinical tremor rating&#xD;
      scale. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of essential tremor with bilateral hand tremor as the predominant feature,&#xD;
             which is known to be responsive to ethanol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unequivocal accelerometric tremor of both hands on screening examination (bilateral&#xD;
             central tremor component during postural tremor accelerometry, consistent with ET)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reduction of accelerometric tremor power of at least 35% following a formal ethanol&#xD;
             challenge during the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing and safely able to abstain from any medication for the&#xD;
             treatment of tremor for a period of at least 5 plasma half-lives of the individual&#xD;
             drug prior to study participation. (For Propranolol/Inderal , Gabapentin/Neurontin&#xD;
             this will be 1 day; for Primidone/Mysoline : 26 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must be willing to refrain from alcohol and drinks or food containing caffeine&#xD;
        starting 48 hours prior to the study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any other significant pathological finding in the neurological&#xD;
             examination other than typical symptoms of ET&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute or chronic severe medical conditions which would preclude the subject from&#xD;
             participating (e.g., severe heart disease NYHA grade 3 or 4, renal failure, hepatic&#xD;
             failure, lung disease, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with concomitant therapy with warfarin or NSAIDs (other than aspirin), when&#xD;
             taken on a regular basis and cannot be discontinued at least 14 days prior to study&#xD;
             participation, because of potential interactions with octanoic acid (displacement of&#xD;
             albumin binding in human serum)(Noctor et al. 1992)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, as fasting-periods of up to 12 hours are&#xD;
             required in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with active or past alcohol abuse or dependence (AUDIT score greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 8)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Elevated liver function parameters (AST, ALT, GGT), higher than the 1.5 fold upper&#xD;
             limit of the normal range (as defined by the NIH Clinical Center Laboratory Medicine&#xD;
             Department), or any other clinically significant abnormalities on their baseline&#xD;
             laboratory tests. The limit for AST therefore will be 51 U/l, for ALT 62 U/L, and GGT&#xD;
             128 U/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects aged &lt; 21 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known flushing symptoms after alcohol intake or allergy to alcohol (any yes answer in&#xD;
             the standardized Alcohol Flushing Questionnaire)&#xD;
