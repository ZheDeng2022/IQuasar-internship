    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common form of organic sexual dysfunction in males with&#xD;
      diabetes, with estimated incidence rates between 35 and 75%. Fifty percent of men with&#xD;
      diabetes are afflicted with ED within 10 years of their diagnosis. Long-term poor glycemic&#xD;
      control increases the risk ED. Although comparatively costly, advantages of CSII over other&#xD;
      modes of insulin delivery include better glycemic control, fewer hypoglycemic episodes, and&#xD;
      improved quality of life. In a previously published study, on CSII in T2DM, in our center,&#xD;
      83% of men reported an improvement in sexual function as a secondary endpoint. The current&#xD;
      study is planned to further explore this finding.&#xD;

      Background Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common form of organic sexual dysfunction in males&#xD;
      with diabetes, with estimated incidence rates between 35 and 75%. Fifty percent of men with&#xD;
      diabetes are afflicted with ED within 10 years of their diagnosis. Long-term poor glycemic&#xD;
      control increases the risk ED. Neuropathy is a major contributor to diabetic ED. Other causes&#xD;
      of ED in diabetes include vascular disease, metabolic control, nutrition, endocrine&#xD;
      disorders, psychogenic factors, and drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Sub-cutaneous Insulin Infusion The Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII)&#xD;
      Pump (insulin pump for short) is a pager-sized device which can be connected to the body&#xD;
      through an infusion set so as to deliver insulin continuously. It consists of a disposable&#xD;
      reservoir for insulin, a disposable infusion set, including a cannula for subcutaneous&#xD;
      insertion and a tubing system which connects the insulin reservoir to the cannula. Insulin&#xD;
      pump therapy by itself is not a new therapy for diabetes mellitus. It is an alternative&#xD;
      delivery mechanism for administration of insulin and is found to be superior to ordinary&#xD;
      syringes and insulin pens. Insulin pumps were popularly used in T1DM but nowadays insulin&#xD;
      pumps are commonly used in T2DM patients as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A guideline for use of insulin pumps in India has been recently published in Diabetes&#xD;
      Technology and Therapeutics journal, which included participation from Jothydev's Diabetes&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although comparatively costly, advantages of CSII over other modes of insulin delivery&#xD;
      include better glycemic control, fewer hypoglycemic episodes, and improved quality of life.&#xD;
      Our own center has reported a significant reduction in HbA1c when subjects in multiple daily&#xD;
      insulin switched to CSII.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant Clinical Data In the aforementioned study of CSII in Type 2 diabetes patients in our&#xD;
      study, 83% of men reported an improvement in sexual function when queried after 6 months on&#xD;
      CSII. The mode of improvement and magnitude of this effect is not known, and needs to be&#xD;
      ascertained in prospective trials. The present study proposal is to corroborate the findings,&#xD;
      and obtain clarification of effect size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits &amp; Risks The following improvements can be expected following initiation of&#xD;
      insulin pump therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in blood sugar fluctuations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in major and minor hypoglycemic episodes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in total daily dose of insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in QOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are some risks/disadvantages of using insulin pump therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost of pumps and consumables is higher than other modes of insulin delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is a risk of infection if the cannula is not changed once in every three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improper use of insulin pump boluses can lead to insulin stacking and low sugars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper patient education and monitoring will be part of the study to overcome the risks of&#xD;
      insulin pump therapy.&#xD;
