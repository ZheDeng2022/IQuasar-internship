    <textblock>
      Serum levels of isolated anti-thyroperoxidase (TPOab) and anti-thyreoglobulin (Tgab)&#xD;
      autoantibodies are strongly associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and premature&#xD;
      deliveries in euthyroid pregnant women. Replacement of thyroxine (LT4) or other&#xD;
      supplementations in euthyroid-Ab positivity during pregnancy has not been established. The&#xD;
      development of a safe and effective intervention that modulates inappropriate inflammatory&#xD;
      responses could be a very important component of prevention against adverse health outcomes&#xD;
      during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-oxidant Selenium (Se) suppresses autoimmune destruction of thyrocytes and at daily&#xD;
      dose of 200 mcg and 100 mcg decreases titers of serum TPOAb and TgAb also in Se-non-deficient&#xD;
      patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Se in AIT has been shown to reduce the incidence of postpartum thyroiditis and&#xD;
      hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with recurrent pregnancy loss had lower Se levels and Se deficiency has been implicated&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of AIT and in the impairment of T/B cell-mediated immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is performed to establish the effect of Se supplementation&#xD;
      in euthyroid women with AIT (pregnant and in whom embryo transfer is expected within 60 days)&#xD;
      on Ab trend, thyroid function and structure, implantation rates, pregnancy rates, pregnancy&#xD;
      outcome and number of obstetrical, fetal and neonatal complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adverse outcomes, postpartum thyroid dysfunction and permanent hypothyroidism have been&#xD;
      associated with isolated TPOab positivity in euthyroid pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of thyroiditis due to a&#xD;
      decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity within thyroid&#xD;
      cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have several modifying effects on the immune system.&#xD;
      Therefore, even mild selenium deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of&#xD;
      autoimmune thyroid diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selenium substitution exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Se could&#xD;
      represents an important supplementation in euthyroid women with AIT in order to improve&#xD;
      thyroid function and structure and to prevent obstetrical adverse events related to&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases and reactive oxygen species, such as recurrent miscarriage and&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to document the effects of Selenium Supplementation with and without&#xD;
      L-thyroxine (LT4) in euthyroid women with AIT, during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will evaluate the trend of TPOab and Tgab, selenium concentration, thyroid&#xD;
      volume and echogenicity, nodule formation and number of adverse effects that affect the&#xD;
      mother (during and after pregnancy), the fetus, the infant and the heath service, needing to&#xD;
      elucidate the nature of the emerging associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also aims to assess the impact of Selenium Supplementation on implantation rate and&#xD;
      pregnancy rate in women with transfer planned within the next 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is designed as a phase IV study on treatment with a cohort size of pregnant women and&#xD;
      women in whom embryo transfer is expected within 60 days with TSH value into the normal range&#xD;
      (0.4-2.5 mUI/mL) and Tgab and/or TPOab positivity. We have performed two randomizations arms:&#xD;
      Randomization arm A will include women LT4 replacement-free that will take Selenium or&#xD;
      Placebo and Randomization arm B will include women already under LT4 replacement that will&#xD;
      take Selenium or Placebo. Patients included in Randomization A will move into Randomization&#xD;
      B, if TSH increases above 2.5 mUI/mL during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women with TSH &gt; 2.5 mU/mL at time 0 will begin (or will adjust) LT4 replacement and&#xD;
      will be included in Randomization arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accounting for a 30% drop off, a total enrolment of 150 patients is planned. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized at time 0 (10°± 2 weeks of gestation). Follow-up visits will take place at weeks&#xD;
      14 ± 2, 24 ± 2, 32 ± 2, 36 ± 2 weeks, and between months 3° and 6° after labour. An optional&#xD;
      visit could be done 12 months after labor. Plasma and serum monitoring of thyroid hormones,&#xD;
      Tgab, TPOab, Se concentration, Selenoproteins and cytokines, thyroid US, SF12 questionnaire&#xD;
      will be made at all the follow-up visits. At visit 3 (24 ± 2 weeks) patients will optionally&#xD;
      do the OGTT). Gestational, obstetrical, maternal, fetal, and infant anamnestic data will be&#xD;
      taken, during the follow up visits and at labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objective is to identify a safe and easily administered supplementation that&#xD;
      improves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. implantation and pregnancy rates in infertile women Tgab and/or TPOab positives&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. maternal and fetal complication in pregnant euthyroid women Tgab and/or TPOab positives.&#xD;
