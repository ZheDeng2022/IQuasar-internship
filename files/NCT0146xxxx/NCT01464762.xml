    <textblock>
      The purpose of this is a study to provide early access of TMC207 to patients with pulmonary&#xD;
      infection due to strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) with resistance to&#xD;
      isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RMP), and to a fluoroquinolone (FQ) and/or injectable second line&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) drug (kanamycin, amikacin, or capreomycin) and who are unable/ineligible to&#xD;
      participate in any other TMC207 study. In addition, information on safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      TMC207 in combination with anti-TB drugs will be assessed and the results of microbiology&#xD;
      assessments which are recommended to be performed during the early access study will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TMC207 is being investigated for the treatment of TB. TB is a contagious bacterial infection&#xD;
      caused by M. tuberculosis that commonly affects the lungs, but can also affect other organs.&#xD;
      Treatment of TB is protracted and burdensome and is further complicated by the emergence of&#xD;
      multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains. TMC207 is a diarylquinoline investigational&#xD;
      compound that offers a novel mechanism of anti-TB action by specifically inhibiting&#xD;
      mycobacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-synthase. Multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) is&#xD;
      defined as infection with a strain of M. tuberculosis that is resistant to both INH and RMP&#xD;
      (also known as rifampicin), two important drugs used to treat drug susceptible TB.&#xD;
      Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is defined as MDR-TB with additional resistance to the&#xD;
      most important second-line TB drugs, ie, one of the injectables (kanamycin, amikacin, or&#xD;
      capreomycin) and fluoroquinolones. Pre-XDR TB is defined as MDR-TB with additional resistance&#xD;
      to either a FQ or an injectable (kanamycin, amikacin, or capreomycin), but not to both a FQ&#xD;
      and an injectable. Patients with either XDR-TB or pre-XDR will be included in this early&#xD;
      access study. Patients who qualify for the study will be provided with a 24-week regimen of&#xD;
      TMC207 which will be administered along with their background regimen (BR). BR drugs will be&#xD;
      provided by the site investigator or designated study personnel in accordance with national&#xD;
      TB program (NTP) guidelines. The BR should be constructed with at least 3 anti-tuberculosis&#xD;
      drugs to which the patient's infection is known to be susceptible from recent drug&#xD;
      susceptibility testing (DST) results (within the previous 6 months) or likely to be&#xD;
      susceptible, based on known treatment history. The selection of the BR, including the number&#xD;
      of companion drugs for TMC207, will be the responsibility of the investigator. At the&#xD;
      screening visit, a completed inclusion/exclusion checklist list will be sent to the sponsor&#xD;
      or its representative together with the patient's recent smear or culture and DST results&#xD;
      (within preceding 6 months) and laboratory safety results to confirm eligibility. At&#xD;
      baseline, a chest X-ray (CXR) will be taken in case no CXR or results of other imaging of the&#xD;
      lungs are available within the previous month. Once treatment has been initiated, patients&#xD;
      will be instructed to follow the visit schedule based on routine clinical care. Recommended&#xD;
      visits and assessments should be planned 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks following initiation of&#xD;
      TMC207 in combination with the BR and 4 weeks (Week 28) and every 24 weeks (Weeks 48, 72, 96,&#xD;
      and 120) after completion of TMC207 intake during the 96-week follow-up period. If needed,&#xD;
      extra visits and assessments can be planned at the discretion of the investigator in order to&#xD;
      best manage the patient's TB treatment. Patients who are taking clofazimine with TMC207 will&#xD;
      require electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring at mandatory protocol-specified visits. Serum&#xD;
      chemistry (electrolytes) assessment will be performed at every visit in which an ECG is&#xD;
      performed. After their last intake of TMC207, all patients will continue to take their BR&#xD;
      under the supervision of their treating physician or local health center/hospital in&#xD;
      accordance with NTP guidelines and local multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB treatment practice&#xD;
      (i.e., treatment may be extended for reasons of complicated lung disease, etc.). Patients&#xD;
      will be followed up for 96 weeks (2 years) after their last dose of TMC207 to evaluate the&#xD;
      microbiological effect (verification of microbiological status [measured locally as per local&#xD;
      standard of care; eg, smear, culture, DST] is recommended to be performed every 24 weeks)&#xD;
      that TMC207 has provided these patients, as well as to monitor the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      TMC207. Patients who withdraw early, unless due to withdrawal of informed consent, will be&#xD;
      followed for survival/clinical outcome (approximately every 6 months) until the early access&#xD;
      study comes to an end in the patients' corresponding country. Patients can enter the study&#xD;
      until TMC207 will be commercially available in the patient's country or can be accessed from&#xD;
      another source or until discontinuation of the development program of TMC207.&#xD;

             Confirmation should include previous (within the preceding 6 months) smear or culture&#xD;
             and drug susceptibility testing (DST) results demonstrating pulmonary TB with an XDR&#xD;

             Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) Stop TB Partnership, OR, following an&#xD;
             assessment of the site confirms that the site meets equivalent standards. Patients&#xD;
             must be able to receive at least 3 anti-TB drugs to which the patient's infection is&#xD;
             known to be susceptible from recent DST results (within the previous 6 months) or&#xD;

             country&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is medically stable in the opinion of the investigator on the basis of&#xD;
             physical examination, and safety examinations performed at screening&#xD;
