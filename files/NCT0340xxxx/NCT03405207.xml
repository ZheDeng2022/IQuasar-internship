    <textblock>
      The leading cause of death in the world is due to cardiovascular events, which originate from&#xD;
      coronary artery stenosis therefore it affects myocardial blood flow and finally may cause&#xD;
      infarction. Atherosclerosis is the most debatable hypothesis in coronary stenosis. Scientists&#xD;
      think body inflammation is one of the main etiologies. There are many factors affect this&#xD;
      inflammatory process, which Vitamin D is one of them. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to&#xD;
      various inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanism by which vitamin D reduces inflammation&#xD;
      remains poorly understood. Vitamin D deficiency is pandemic around the world with 30-50%&#xD;
      prevalence in adult population and several evidences advocated its association with&#xD;
      immune-based disease. Additionally, there are some study suggesting patients who suffered&#xD;
      from myocardial infarction have lower serum vitamin D level. It has been revealed Vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency has numerous major drawbacks on cardiovascular system. Its deficiency benefits&#xD;
      atherosclerosis progression and may cause endothelial inflammation and dysfunction in&#xD;
      coronary artery. There is not any evidences study vitamin D deficiency treatment on non&#xD;
      ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction nor there is any study demonstrating its effect on&#xD;
      cardiovascular health through Holick's protocol. Furthermore endothelial function, cardiac&#xD;
      work retrieval and inflammation after 8 weeks has not been studied with this protocol yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to current data, the investigators assume by treating this vital and worldwide&#xD;
      deficit in our body, doctors can help decrease inflammation, decelerate the atherosclerosis&#xD;
      progression and enhance ventricular function after infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides all of the recognized risk factors, vitamin D deficiency should be considered a very&#xD;
      important and mischievous cardiovascular alarm for the body, which should be treated and&#xD;
      maintained through the whole life due to lack of sufficient sunlight exposure and nutrition&#xD;
      intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preventive medicine domain, the investigators anticipate by maintaining a high level of&#xD;
      this vitamin in the body, cardiovascular events decrease and its burden on society will&#xD;
      decline to much extend leading to a higher quality of life and health worldwide.&#xD;

      The leading cause of death in the world is due to cardiovascular events, which originate from&#xD;
      coronary artery stenosis therefore it affects myocardial blood flow and finally may cause&#xD;
      infarction. ST-Segment elevation is an indicator of infarction (STEMI) in electrocardiography&#xD;
      (ECG) besides cardiac enzymes like troponin; however, there is another type of infarction&#xD;
      without elevation, which called non ST-Segment Elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most established method of treating this condition is percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI) and balloon angiography although in some cases coronary artery bypass grafting surgery&#xD;
      is more beneficial. Atherosclerosis is the most debatable hypothesis in coronary stenosis.&#xD;
      Scientists think body inflammation is one of the main etiologies. There are many factors&#xD;
      affect this inflammatory process, which Vitamin D is one of them. Vitamin D deficiency has&#xD;
      been linked to various inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanism by which vitamin D&#xD;
      reduces inflammation remains poorly understood. Vitamin D Inhibits Monocyte/Macrophages&#xD;
      Pro-inflammatory Cytokine Production by Targeting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)&#xD;
      Phosphatase-1 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)&#xD;
      pathway therefore decrease production of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and&#xD;
      increasing interleukin (IL) 10 and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) from human&#xD;
      monocytes. Chronic inflammatory diseases that are vitamin D deficient (20 ng/ml) may benefit&#xD;
      from oral supplementation of vitamin D to get their serum vitamin D level&gt;30 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Galectin-3 is emerging fibrotic biomarkers that is thought to be causally involved in the&#xD;
      development of heart failure. Galectin-3 is a beta-galactoside binding lectin that is&#xD;
      produced by macrophages during myocardial stress and activates fibroblasts. Besides its roles&#xD;
      in inflammation and in cellular adhesion, galectin-3 plays an important role in cardiac&#xD;
      fibrosis. Furthermore, galectin-3 has an established role as a modulator in tumor&#xD;
      progression. Galectin-3 is released in the circulation, and can be measured reliably and has&#xD;
      been shown to independently predict outcomes in heart failure patients and in the general&#xD;
      population. However, galectin-3 is not cardiac specific, but is expressed in several fibrotic&#xD;
      and inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D is one of the fat-soluble micronutrients, which sunlight is the principle key to&#xD;
      make this vitamin in our body. Vitamin D deficiency is pandemic around the world with 30-50%&#xD;
      prevalence in adult population and several evidences advocated its association with&#xD;
      immune-based disease like asthma, multiple sclerosis (MS), Type 2 diabetes and many cancers.&#xD;
      Additionally, there are some study suggesting patients who suffered from myocardial&#xD;
      infarction have lower serum vitamin D level. It has been revealed Vitamin D deficiency has&#xD;
      numerous major drawbacks on cardiovascular system. Its deficiency benefits atherosclerosis&#xD;
      progression and may cause endothelial inflammation and dysfunction in coronary artery.&#xD;
      Endothelial malfunction with lipid sedimentation beneath the intima layer attract leukocytes&#xD;
      and make foam cells. Therefore it leads to produce active agents and make smooth muscle cells&#xD;
      to proliferate and lead the lumen to be narrower, which consequently decrease oxygenated&#xD;
      blood flow and causes ischemia and infarction. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and&#xD;
      n-terminal fragment of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) are two newly discovered&#xD;
      molecules associated independently with coronary calcification level. MCP-1 has a role in&#xD;
      representing the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system has a principle role in blood pressure maintenance. It&#xD;
      has been shown this vitamin can regulate this system too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypocalcemia in vitamin D deficiency activate parathyroid gland to produce parathormone&#xD;
      (PTH), which makes bones to release calcium and kidneys to reabsorb calcium from urine more.&#xD;
      PTH activates the α1-hydroxylase of the Kidney to produce activated vitamin D (calcitriol or&#xD;
      1,25(OH)2 VitD) from stored-form (cholecalciferol or 25(OH) VitD). Calcium is the leading&#xD;
      cation in the cardiac myocyte which contributes in contraction, contractility and voltage&#xD;
      conduction. Also phosphorous excrete more due to PTH effect on distal convoluted tubule.&#xD;
      Alkaline phosphatase is an indicator of bone metabolism in resorbing the hydroxyapatite&#xD;
      crystals. Body regulate the level of phosphorous by fibroblasts growth factor (FGF) 23 and&#xD;
      PTH accurately. FGF-23 is secreted by osteocytes in response to elevated calcitriol. FGF-23&#xD;
      decreases the reabsorption and increases excretion of phosphate in Kidneys. FGF-23 may also&#xD;
      suppress α1-hydroxylase, reducing its ability to activate vitamin D and subsequently&#xD;
      impairing calcium absorption. It has been shown in some studies that FGF-23 level was&#xD;
      independently associated with endothelial function, arterial stiffness, vascular&#xD;
      calcification, ventricular hypertrophy, renal failure progression, and cardiovascular related&#xD;
      mortality. Similarly, PTH level has the same relationship. In conclusion, these studies&#xD;
      proposed vitamin D deficiency has a major role in endothelial dysfunction, inflammation,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FGF21 has lately emerged as a potent metabolic regulator with multiple effects that&#xD;
      ultimately improve the lipoprotein profile. Early studies show that FGF21 is associated with&#xD;
      the presence of atherosclerosis and may play a protective role against plaque formation by&#xD;
      improving endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High level of Homocysteine which is one of the amino acids metabolism end products, make the&#xD;
      patient to be more susceptible to endothelial cell injury which therefore make inflammation&#xD;
      and atherosclerosis and finally ischemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia is therefore a risk factor for&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. In one randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 3096 patients who&#xD;
      referred for PCI treated with a combination of Vitamin B 6, 9 and 12 and suggested although&#xD;
      these vitamins has a lot of major effects in biochemical metabolism and antioxidant action,&#xD;
      hospital readmission and re-infarction was not decreased. This study was just the beginning&#xD;
      of the new era in managing cardiovascular events by controlling its biological risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMO trial of 196 participants who had renal failure and left ventricular hypertrophy&#xD;
      consumed an analog of activated vitamin D called paricalcitol and assessed left atrial volume&#xD;
      index after 24 and 48 weeks. This trial had come to an end and had a lot of problems&#xD;
      including they study population, type of drug they chose, co-founder variables and lack of&#xD;
      sufficient follow up. To follow this field, VITDAMI trial ameliorate the PRIMO problems and&#xD;
      investigate the effects of consuming 0.266 milligrams calcifediol each 2 weeks in 144 acute&#xD;
      anterior STEMI patients on left ventricular remodeling using cardiac magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) and assessing its left ventricular end diastolic volume (LV-EDV) after 1 year.&#xD;
      Its result has not been published yet. To power up their study, they will evaluate&#xD;
      endothelial function, calcium metabolism products and aspects of inflammation. Calcifediol is&#xD;
      produced by the liver enzyme 25-hydroxylase from its pro-hormone cholecalciferol (Vitamin&#xD;
      D3), and its blood concentration is considered the best indicator of vitamin D status.&#xD;
      Although there are several vitamin D deficiency treatment protocol, using calcifediol is not&#xD;
      prevalent worldwide. Holick et al. demonstrated a type of protocol in which the patient with&#xD;
      hypovitaminosis D (25(OH) Vitamin D less than 20 ng/ml) received 50,000 international units&#xD;
      (IU) of Vitamin D3 or D2 (Cholecalciferol or Ergocalciferol respectively) once a week for 8&#xD;
      weeks to achieve calcifediol levels higher than 30 ng/ml then continue on maintenance dose&#xD;
      (50,000 IU every month or 1,500-2,000 IU/day) for the rest of the life. This procedure has&#xD;
      been tolerated well by patients and has high acceptance rate. One study compared Holick's&#xD;
      method with another common protocol and established there were no difference in increasing&#xD;
      the serum level of vitamin D nor patients' preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the CANTHOS study, the anti-IL-1β antibody prescribed in three different doses for&#xD;
      patients with established atherosclerosis and high level of C-reactive protein (CRP) and&#xD;
      follow them up to 48 months and evaluated nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or&#xD;
      cardiovascular death. They suggested the anti-inflammatory effects of canakinumab led to a&#xD;
      significantly lower rate of recurrent cardiovascular events at a dose of 150 mg every 3&#xD;
      months. For the first time, in this RCT, which the most valuable methodology in medical&#xD;
      investigations and causality evaluations, the investigators will evaluate one of the most&#xD;
      prevalent management protocols of vitamin D deficiency (Holick's) on one of the most dramatic&#xD;
      human disease which obtained the higher burden of disease worldwide, myocardial infarction.&#xD;
      There is currently only one evidence studying the effects of consuming calcifediol on&#xD;
      anterior ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infraction. the investigators decided to choose a&#xD;
      different drug (cholecalciferol) with different approach and different MI (NSTEMI). In this&#xD;
      study the investigators will use no invasive instruments and assessing controversial&#xD;
      variables outcomes to open a big door to cardiovascular disease management and preventive&#xD;
      medicine to much extend.&#xD;
