  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year, at the Nice University Hospital, about sixty deliveries take place before 24&#xD;
      weeks of amenorrhea. The child is not viable because of his extreme immaturity. In most&#xD;
      cases, a child born before 24 years of age is stillborn, but in about one in three cases, it&#xD;
      shows signs of life such as heartbeat, breathing, gasps or limb movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these too small children showing signs of life, three attitudes are possible: doing&#xD;
      nothing and waiting for this life to stop by themselves, setting up palliative care to ensure&#xD;
      the child's comfort, or administering a medication to shorten his or her life. The attitude&#xD;
      to have is not univocal and the feeling of the teams confronted with their management is&#xD;
      difficult even if the goal of the caregivers is always to act as best as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to describe the clinical state of the child and the&#xD;
      practices implemented in the birth room at the Nice University Hospital when children showing&#xD;
      signs of life before 24 weeks of amenorrhea are born.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to describe caregivers' experiences, their experiences of these&#xD;
      situations and attitudes towards children and their parents, and to identify ethical dilemmas&#xD;
      in these situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an observational cohort study including all births of live children before 24&#xD;
      weeks of amenorrhea at Nice University Hospital for 12 months. It consists of two parts: a&#xD;
      quantitative study describing the child's condition and caregiving practices, and a&#xD;
      qualitative study of caregivers' experiences and the determinants of their attitudes towards&#xD;
      the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will coordinate the collection of the data necessary to conduct the&#xD;
      quantitative study, and then conduct individual semi-directive interviews with each of the&#xD;
      caregivers present at the birth of the child. The qualitative study will be based on the&#xD;
      analysis of these interviews.&#xD;
