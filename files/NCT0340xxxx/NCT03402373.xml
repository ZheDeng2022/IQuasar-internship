  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carotenoids and polyphenols are assumed to have an active role in skin health. Sources for&#xD;
      these phytonutrient are fruits and vegetables. They are widely applied as skin protectants,&#xD;
      and supplementation with carotenoids have shown to protect against erythema caused by&#xD;
      UV-radiation. UV radiation generates reactive oxygen species in the skin, which induces&#xD;
      cellular signaling that may impair cell cycle, cell growth, and regeneration or repair&#xD;
      processes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The face holds an integral role in human social communication and how humans are perceived as&#xD;
      attractive. In addition to structural facial features, studies have shown that skin&#xD;
      appearance is highly weighed in the perception of beauty and is determined primarily by its&#xD;
      coloration and surface topography. Aging is caused by two processes, intrinsic and extrinsic.&#xD;
      The sun is the primary cause of extrinsic aging and has also been shown to alter the normal&#xD;
      course of intrinsic or natural aging. On the molecular level, various hypotheses have been&#xD;
      proposed to explain aging, with free radical theory being prominent. The free radical theory&#xD;
      addresses the concept of intrinsic biological instability of living systems, in which free&#xD;
      radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage biomolecules, and this damage results&#xD;
      in aging of the skin (as well as other systems).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of an oral antioxidant supplement on skin&#xD;
      aging and skin condition.&#xD;
