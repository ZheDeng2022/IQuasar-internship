  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and HER2Bi-armed activated T cells work in&#xD;
      treating patients with castration resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. HER2Bi-armed activated T cells are made using T cells and may&#xD;
      target and kill cancer cells. Giving pembrolizumab and HER2Bi-armed activated T cells may&#xD;
      work better in treating patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the clinical efficacy of 8 infusions of HER2 HER2Bi-armed activated T cells&#xD;
      (BATs) (up to 10^10/infusion) twice per week for 4 weeks in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      once every 3 weeks starting with one dose 3 weeks before the 1st BATs infusion, by assessing&#xD;
      the percentage of patients free of clinical progression at 6 months after registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate phenotype, cytokine profiles and IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spots&#xD;
      (ELISpots), cytotoxicity and antibodies directed at laboratory prostate cancer cell lines for&#xD;
      proof of principle of immune system activation and to correlate with clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      response, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the magnitude of change in tumor infiltrating T cells, PD-1 expression, and the&#xD;
      Th1/Th2 ratio in prostate cancer tumor tissue before and after immunotherapy and correlate it&#xD;
      with the clinical outcomes of response, PFS, and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning at least 1 week after pembrolizumab, patients receive&#xD;
      HER2Bi-armed activated T cells IV over 5-15 minutes 2 times a week for 4 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
