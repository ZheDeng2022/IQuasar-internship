      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artificial sweeteners like sucralose are found in many foods and drinks. Sucralose might&#xD;
      affect hormones and cause health changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if sucralose changes how medicines are absorbed and processed, how hormones are&#xD;
      secreted, gut bacteria, and how fat cells are metabolized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-60 who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are black or Hispanic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weigh more than 110 pounds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a body mass index of 25-40&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not have a condition that requires drug treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, heart, and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must not eat or drink anything with artificial sweeteners throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 7 days, Participants will answer questions, and give daily urine samples and 1 stool&#xD;
      sample. Participants will repeat these throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overnight Visit 1: participants will fast starting the night before. They will get breakfast&#xD;
      at the visit. The visit includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An IV will be placed in the arm. Participants will get 2 tablets of medicines. Blood&#xD;
           will be drawn several times over 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A piece of fat tissue may be taken from the abdomen (biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a sweet drink. Blood samples will be taken over 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then participants will be randomly assigned to take either a sucralose capsule or placebo.&#xD;
      They will take it twice a day for 2 weeks. They will complete two 24-hour food diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overnight Visit 2 repeats Visit 1 except the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then participants will take the capsules for another 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overnight Visit 3 repeats Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be contacted by phone within 4 weeks after they finish.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) has dramatically increased worldwide and is&#xD;
      more prevalent in women than men. Similarly, obesity rates have continued to rise, most&#xD;
      notably in minorities. Since NNS consumption has been linked to obesity, we propose studying&#xD;
      NNS effects specifically in minority women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NNS are frequently consumed in combination with prescription medications. This necessitates&#xD;
      the study of possible NNS-drug interactions. The hypothesis that NNS may affect drug&#xD;
      absorption and metabolism is based on a rodent study. In 2008, Abou-Donia et al reported that&#xD;
      sucralose increased the activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a membrane transporter involved in&#xD;
      absorption and distribution of a wide range of pharmacologic compounds, and CYP3A, a&#xD;
      cytochrome P-450 enzyme important to the first-pass metabolism of many drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, NNS effects in clinical studies were mostly observed after acute (one time) or short&#xD;
      term exposure. For example, we and others found increased incretin and insulin concentrations&#xD;
      in response to sucralose alone or in combination with acesulfame-potassium prior to a glucose&#xD;
      load. The effects were most pronounced in obese African American women. We also found&#xD;
      upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in subcutaneous fat biopsies of obese individuals who&#xD;
      reported consumption of NNS compared to non-consumers. Whether these hormonal and tissue&#xD;
      responses persist after prolonged exposure needs to be investigated. NNS have also been shown&#xD;
      to influence the microbial composition of the oral cavity and the gut. However, most data&#xD;
      were generated in mice and do not exist in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To determine the effects of sucralose (4 mg/kg/day) administered to overweight&#xD;
      and obese minority women for 28 days on drug metabolism using digoxin and midazolam as probes&#xD;
      for P-glycoprotein and CYP3A, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims: To investigate the effects of sucralose on&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. glucose metabolism and incretin secretion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. lipid metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. intestinal microflora&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 3 periods. In the first period (run-in, 7 days), participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to avoid all NNS (including NNS in cosmetics or health care products). During the&#xD;
      second and third periods (14 days each), participants will be randomized to consume either&#xD;
      sucralose containing capsules (4 mg/kg/day) or placebo. At the end of each period, the&#xD;
      following measurements will be obtained during an overnight hospitalization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serial measurements of plasma concentrations of midazolam and digoxin for 24 hours&#xD;
           following a single oral dose of each drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Frequently sampled 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to measure glucose,&#xD;
           insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1, and other gut hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of P1 (run-in, no intervention) and after P3 (sucralose exposure x 4 weeks),&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat biopsies will be performed. Stool samples will be obtained throughout.&#xD;
