    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in treating patients with stage IIB-IIC&#xD;
      melanoma that can be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy nivolumab administered in the adjuvant setting in patients with&#xD;
      resected stage IIB or stage IIC cutaneous melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate and estimate the median duration of overall survival (OS) in stage IIB-IIC&#xD;
      melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate and estimate the median duration of distant metastases-free survival (DMFS)&#xD;
      in stage IIB-IIC melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess safety and toxicity using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE) version (V)5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess quality of life using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma&#xD;
      (FACT-M) quality of life instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess and compare clinical, histological, immunological and molecular panels as&#xD;
      prognostic and predictive biomarkers.&#xD;

          -  Patients must not have a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that might confound the trial results, interfere with the&#xD;
             patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or indicate that&#xD;
             participation in the trial is not in the patient's best interests, in the opinion of&#xD;

&#xD;
