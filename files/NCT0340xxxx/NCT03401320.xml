  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label, dose escalation study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of single intramuscular injections of Letrozole&#xD;
      ISM® at different strengths in voluntary healthy post menopausal women&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of a single ascending&#xD;
      doses of Letrozole ISM® (Rovi), and secondly, to evaluate safety and tolerability of single&#xD;
      ascending doses of Letrozole ISM, measure estrogen levels, and characterize oral letrozole&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile to be used in subsequent comparison to Letrozole ISM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in healthy post-menopausal women who satisfy inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. The study design includes a screening period and 2 treatment periods.&#xD;
      Treatment Period 1 will comprise of 14 oral dose administrations of 2.5 mg Femara®. Treatment&#xD;
      Period 2 will comprise of a single IM dose of 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg Letrozole ISM®. The&#xD;
      total planned study duration is 71 weeks, approximately.&#xD;
