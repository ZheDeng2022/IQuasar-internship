  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to conduct a four arm randomized controlled pilot trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of an innovative peer support program that incorporates leadership&#xD;
      training, mentorship, recognition, reward systems and supportive/reminder text messaging for&#xD;
      patients discharged from acute (hospital) care. Methods and analysis: This is a prospective,&#xD;
      rater-blinded, four arm randomized controlled trial. 180 patients discharged from acute&#xD;
      psychiatric care in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada will be randomized to one of four conditions:&#xD;
      treatment as usual follow-up care, enrollment in usual follow-up care plus daily&#xD;
      supportive/reminder text messages, enrollment in a peer support system plus daily&#xD;
      supportive/reminder text messages or enrollment in a peer support system without daily&#xD;
      supportive text messages. Patients in each group will complete evaluation measures (e.g.,&#xD;
      recovery, general symptomatology, functional outcomes) at baseline, six and twelve weeks &amp;&#xD;
      six and 12 months. Service utilization data and data regarding the experience of the peer&#xD;
      support workers will also be collected. Data will be analyzed with descriptive statistics,&#xD;
      repeated measures, and correlational analyses. We hypothesize that patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      peer support system plus daily supportive/reminder text messages condition will achieve&#xD;
      superior outcomes in comparison to other groups. Peer support worker experience will be&#xD;
      derived from exploratory data analysis.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale Peer support is emotional, social and practical help provided by&#xD;
      non-professionals to assist people with sustaining health behaviours. The peer support&#xD;
      workers share a similar condition as patients, effectively manage their condition, and have&#xD;
      received training to provide support. Peer support is provided to people with psychological&#xD;
      health complaints by peer supporter workers with lived experience, and the position of peer&#xD;
      support worker may include activities such as advocacy, connecting patients with resources,&#xD;
      and experiential sharing, among others .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer support is consistent with the recovery paradigm in mental health, and is differentiated&#xD;
      from psychiatric models of traditional diagnosis and treatment. The purported mechanisms&#xD;
      through which peer support may function are through experiential knowledge sharing, modeling&#xD;
      of adaptive coping strategies, social comparison, and enhancing social support. Moreover,&#xD;
      peer support may be particularly useful for clients who have difficulty engaging in&#xD;
      conventional services . It may be the case that peer support systems can serve as an entry&#xD;
      point into the healthcare system for 'hardly reached' individuals and at the very least,&#xD;
      serve as a means of providing supportive services for those who would otherwise not engage in&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, providing peer support may offer benefits to the peer supporter&#xD;
      her/himself, by enhancing feelings of competence and personal value .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer support is valued in recovery-oriented models of mental health and is becoming&#xD;
      increasingly implemented organizationally [see Myrick and del Vecchio for a discussion]. Many&#xD;
      studies have reported positive effects of peer support, including lower inpatient service&#xD;
      use, better relationships with providers, and increased engagement. However, a recent&#xD;
      rigorous evaluation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of peer support studies reported&#xD;
      that outcomes were generally mixed and often non-significant. In their review, the authors&#xD;
      noted a high degree of bias and methodological limitations in the studies they reviewed, and&#xD;
      concluded that &quot;peer support programmes should be implemented within the context of high&#xD;
      quality research projects wherever possible&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to methodological improvements of research on peer support, there is a need to&#xD;
      further develop the peer support workforce. Identified areas of development for peer support&#xD;
      programs include: how to define &quot;peerness&quot;, role clarity and integration with existing&#xD;
      systems, credentialing, and workforce development. Within our local context, in the province&#xD;
      of Alberta, Canada, peer support for patients has been in existence for many years. Anecdotal&#xD;
      evidence suggests there is low uptake and high attrition for peer support worker roles within&#xD;
      the province. There has been a drive to develop curricula and organizational infrastructure&#xD;
      to formally train and support peer support workers. Administrators who have worked with peer&#xD;
      support workers suggest the lack of adequate incentives may contribute to peer support&#xD;
      workforce challenges. Relatedly, there are often limited incentives for mental health&#xD;
      professionals to provide supervision and mentorship for peer support workers locally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the existing literature suggests there is opportunity for innovation in peer&#xD;
      support programs, and there is a need for rigorous methodology to better evaluate outcomes&#xD;
      from peer support programs. There is also a need to further develop the peer support&#xD;
      workforce. The current paper describes a randomized controlled trial that is designed to&#xD;
      systematically evaluate a novel peer support model termed the &quot;Edmonton Peer Support System&quot;&#xD;
      (EPSS), which incorporates innovative features of service delivery (i.e., an incentive-based&#xD;
      model of training, text messaging) and rigorous methodological design to minimize bias and&#xD;
      confounds (e.g., comprehensive measures of outcome; methodological design features including&#xD;
      longitudinal, prospective, three arm parallel design, and rater-blinding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the innovative features of this study is the incorporation of text messaging. Text&#xD;
      messaging is a relatively low cost, high impact, and easily scalable program that uses&#xD;
      existing technology, is devoid of geographic barriers, and is easily accessible to end users.&#xD;
      There is evidence that supportive text messaging demonstrates positive effects in terms of&#xD;
      symptom improvement and patient satisfaction. For example, patients with depression and&#xD;
      comorbid alcohol use disorder showed significantly lower depressive symptoms on standardized&#xD;
      self-report than a similar patient group who did not receive messages [large effect&#xD;
      size)(9)]. A second randomized trial demonstrated similar results [(Cohen's d= 0.67)(10)]. In&#xD;
      terms of satisfaction, over 80% of subscribers reported that a texting program improved their&#xD;
      mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also evidence that reminder text messaging improves appointment attendance rates.&#xD;
      For example, in a systematic review and meta-analysis of eight randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      involving 6615 participants, the authors found moderate quality evidence from seven studies&#xD;
      (5841 participants) that mobile text message reminders improved the rate of attendance at&#xD;
      healthcare appointments compared to no reminders [risk ratio (RR) 1.14 (95% confidence&#xD;
      interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.26)]. They also found that text messaging reminders were similar to&#xD;
      telephone reminders in terms of their effect on attendance rates, yet cost less than&#xD;
      telephone reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another innovative feature of this study is the incorporation of a peer support incentive&#xD;
      system. As discussed, the peer support workforce has been identified as an area in need of&#xD;
      development, including role clarity, integration with healthcare professionals, and&#xD;
      credentialing. Specifically, a lack of a &quot;career ladder&quot; or a clear movement within positions&#xD;
      of peer support work has been identified, with movement possible laterally (but not upward)&#xD;
      within many program structures. In this project, peer support workers will participate in an&#xD;
      incentive based system that formally recognizes performance. The EPSS is structured as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peer support workers are people with lived mental health experience who are at a point&#xD;
           in their personal recovery where they consistently demonstrate the ability to share&#xD;
           their individual story in a manner that inspires hope and builds relationships with&#xD;
           others. Peer support workers who are employed by Alberta Health Services (AHS), our&#xD;
           provincial health authority, will be invited to enroll as foundational members of the&#xD;
           EPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Members will be provided with formalized training developed within our health region,&#xD;
           involving knowledge training, practice, and ongoing meetings throughout offering the&#xD;
           program to assist peer support workers in adhering to principles consistent with a peer&#xD;
           support framework and recovery philosophy and problem-solving concerns or challenges&#xD;
           that may arise. Peer support workers will receive clinical support/mentorship from&#xD;
           mental health therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient beneficiaries of EPSS will receive supportive face-to-face visits, phone calls,&#xD;
           and interactive text message support from their peer support workers. They will also&#xD;
           receive reminder text messages for their appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient beneficiaries will be enrolled as associate members of the EPSS and will be&#xD;
           provided with training to act as peer support workers when they are an advanced stage in&#xD;
           their recovery. At this time they can apply for AHS peer support worker roles as&#xD;
           available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contributions of peer support workers will be recognized via attainment of different&#xD;
           levels of membership (e.g. &quot;star&quot; levels) and certificates of recognition (bearing logos&#xD;
           of collaborating institutions) at formal ceremonies. Star-level recognition will be&#xD;
           categorized into: Silver Star Memberships (five stars), Gold Star Memberships (ten&#xD;
           stars), and Star Fellowships (twenty stars).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contributions of mental health therapists towards supporting/mentoring peer support&#xD;
           workers will also be recognized through star memberships and certificates at formal&#xD;
           ceremonies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hope of EPSS is to increase compassion and decrease stigma, foster multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      teamwork, incorporate client/caregiver experiences, and strengthen service provider skills&#xD;
      and abilities. Our proposed EPSS will provide training for those with mental health&#xD;
      challenges that will enable them to contribute providing compassionate care for mental health&#xD;
      patients. This program philosophy is aligned with regional goals relating to improvement of&#xD;
      mental health services in our province.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and Objectives The aim of the project is to evaluate the effectiveness of an EPSS which&#xD;
      incorporates leadership training, mentorship, recognition, reward systems and&#xD;
      supportive/reminder text messaging for patients discharged from acute (hospital) care. The&#xD;
      client outcomes will be organized according to: recovery variables (e.g., recovery, stigma),&#xD;
      functional variables (quality of life, employment), symptom variables (psychological&#xD;
      symptoms, general outcomes), and service variables (e.g., heath service utilization, cost,&#xD;
      satisfaction), as further described in Methods and Analysis. Peer support worker outcomes&#xD;
      will also be evaluated, including effectiveness, job satisfaction, acceptability, and&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the project include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare mean changes in recovery, functional outcomes, clinical symptoms, and service&#xD;
           variables after six weeks, twelve weeks, six months and twelve months for patients in&#xD;
           each of the three arms: those discharged from acute care and enrolled in peer support&#xD;
           system plus daily supportive/reminder text messages; those with usual follow-up care&#xD;
           plus daily supportive/reminder text messages, and those receiving usual follow-up care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess job satisfaction, acceptability, and recovery of peer support workers at six&#xD;
           and twelve months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess job satisfaction among mental health therapists offering support and&#xD;
           mentorship for peer support workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that patients enrolled in the peer support system&#xD;
      plus daily supportive/reminder text messages will achieve superior outcomes compared to&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the other arms of the study on each outcome measure used. In turn,&#xD;
      patients enrolled in peer support will have superior outcomes to patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      treatment as usual condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, we aimed to deploy intention-to-treat analysis, whereby patient data are analyzed&#xD;
      according to their original assigned groups, regardless of time spent in the study. However,&#xD;
      after randomization and due to clinical logistic reasons, a significant number of patients&#xD;
      did not receive access to the Peer Support Worker service in the two intervention arms of&#xD;
      Peer Support Worker. Thus we have made a strategic decision to adapt the protocol to a&#xD;
      Controlled Observational Study and to change the analysis approach to as-treated, rather than&#xD;
      intention-to-treat to maximize the investigational value of the study without compromising or&#xD;
      biasing outcomes.&#xD;
