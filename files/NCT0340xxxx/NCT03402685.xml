  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The caesarean section is a frequently performed procedure in obstetrics and accounts for&#xD;
      about 30% of all births in Germany. 55% to 68% of all caesarean sections are performed under&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia. A possible side effect of spinal anesthesia is arterial hypotension with a&#xD;
      prevalence of 70% to 80%. A placental hypoperfusion in the context of a reduced preload due&#xD;
      to hypotension can reduce the fetal outcome. Early diagnosis and treatment of the hypotensive&#xD;
      episode could reduce and at best prevent increased fetal morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to their invasiveness due to the necessity of puncturing a distal artery of the extremity&#xD;
      and the insertion of a catheter, established continuous blood pressure measurement procedures&#xD;
      have disadvantages such as potential circulatory disorders of the hand, infections, bleeding&#xD;
      and thrombosis and are therefore often not indicated in the context of an elective sectio.&#xD;
      Non-invasive procedures such as NIBP, however, are discontinuous and may make a timely&#xD;
      diagnosis of hypotension more difficult and delay therapy. The ClearSightTM system, which&#xD;
      allows a continuous non-invasive blood pressure measurement, has been used in hip and knee&#xD;
      joint surgery. There, a good correlation with invasive blood pressure measurements was found,&#xD;
      particularly with regard to systolic and mean arterial pressure. An application in obstetrics&#xD;
      has not yet been investigated. Due to the continuous measurement provided by ClearSightTM,&#xD;
      continuous monitoring of blood pressure appears to be ensured, so that a faster reaction to&#xD;
      previously undetected fluctuations in blood pressure can be expected compared to interval&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The determination of arterial blood pressure is a basic monitoring measure during spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia in obstetrics for the operative delivery of the child via the caesarean section.&#xD;
      Adequate arterial blood pressure is essential to ensure adequate placental perfusion,&#xD;
      sufficient cerebral perfusion pressure of the mother and is the basis for any hemodynamic&#xD;
      optimization to significantly improve patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now, two standard methods for determining blood pressure have always been the&#xD;
      oscillating non-invasive, intermittent blood pressure measurement (NIBP) and the invasive&#xD;
      continuous blood pressure measurement (IBP). The NIBP derives blood pressure values using&#xD;
      upper arm cuffs at defined intervals. As a result, no continuous measurement is possible and&#xD;
      nerve damage and pain are risks of this method. The indication for the establishment of IBP&#xD;
      is often not given due to potential side effects such as aneurysm formation, infections,&#xD;
      thrombosis and circulatory impairment of the hand. The application of a novel non-invasive,&#xD;
      patch-clamp-based continuous blood pressure measurement system (ClearSightTM, Edwards&#xD;
      Lifesciences Corporation, Irvine, California, USA) promises to combine the advantages of&#xD;
      NIBP, namely non-invasiveness and IBP, the continuous pressure measurement. So far, there&#xD;
      have been no randomized, controlled trials for application. Spinal anesthesia is a widespread&#xD;
      anaesthetic procedure for performing Caesarean sections. Within the clinical standard, an&#xD;
      intermittent blood pressure measurement is used at intervals of 2 to 5 minutes. Continuous&#xD;
      invasive blood pressure measurement is not a standard procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard procedure: The standard procedure corresponds to the SOPs of the Clinic for&#xD;
      Anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine. After admission to the operating room, the&#xD;
      patient is monitored by means of a 3-channel ECG and pulse oximetry. The NIBP measurement by&#xD;
      means of an upper arm cuff is carried out intermittently with a measurement interval of 2&#xD;
      minutes according to SOP (standard operating procedure) and is continued until the umbilical&#xD;
      cord of the fetus is removed. Subsequently, a peripheral venous access is applied and 500 ml&#xD;
      of full electrolyte solution are infused. Subsequently, the spinal anesthesia is applied in a&#xD;
      seated position. Size-adapted 1.6 - 2.0 ml hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5%, 0.1 mg morphine and 5&#xD;
      µg sufentanil are used. According to SOP, local skin infiltration with lidocaine 1% is&#xD;
      carried out. After application of the spinal anaesthesia, the patient is positioned in a&#xD;
      supine position with the operating table tilted 15° to the left. If the systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure drops below 100 mmHg or by more than 20 % of the initial value, 100 µg phenylephrine&#xD;
      is applied. After a sufficient entry into action (target height according to SOP TH4) the&#xD;
      Caesarean section is performed. After birth, APGAR values are recorded after 1,5 and 10&#xD;
      minutes, and umbilical cord blood gas analysis is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure: Randomisation of patients based on a randomisation list drawn up by an&#xD;
      independent statistician in either NIBP or ClearSight group. In both groups, the&#xD;
      above-mentioned standard procedure according to SOP and also the non-invasive continuous&#xD;
      blood pressure measurement to improve blood pressure monitoring with the ClearSight? system,&#xD;
      so that all patients are monitored by both monitoring systems. In the NIBP Group,&#xD;
      anaesthetists are blinded against the ClearSight measurement. In the ClearSight group,&#xD;
      anaesthetists are blinded against the NIBP measurement. Blinding is achieved by completely&#xD;
      covering the measured values of the other method. (please describe in detail). The&#xD;
      installation of the measuring sensors does not involve any risks for patients.&#xD;
