  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of moderate intensity aerobic exercise and caffeine ingestion on cognition (more&#xD;
      specifically working memory) in non-caffeine drinker and caffeine drinkers will be examined.&#xD;
      The non-caffeine drinkers will be recruited for two visits, whereas, the caffeine drinkers&#xD;
      will be recruited for three visits. The study involves a baseline assessment of cognition and&#xD;
      examines the effects of exercise and caffeine. Finally the caffeine group will consist of a&#xD;
      baseline and intervention assessment when deprived of caffeine (overnight abstinence). The&#xD;
      exercise intervention is to complete 20-minutes of moderate intensity exercise (brisk walk)&#xD;
      while the caffeine condition is to consume 1.2 mg/kg of caffeine. Immediately following both&#xD;
      intervention the n-back assessment will be conducted.&#xD;

      Phase 1 will assess non-caffeine consumers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 will utilize a within subjects counter-balanced design. Previous to arrival for phase&#xD;
      1, participants will be asked to abstain from alcohol and drugs for at least 18 hours&#xD;
      previous. Participants will be urged to arrive at the same time for each visit. Upon arrival&#xD;
      to the Exercise and Health Psychology lab (located in room 408 of the Arthur and Sonia Labatt&#xD;
      Health Science Building at Western University) participants will be given the letter of&#xD;
      information, and asked to sign the informed consent form. After consent, participants will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete a demographic survey, PAR-Q readiness for exercise, Godin&#xD;
      Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, caffeine consumption questionnaire-R (CCQ-R) and a&#xD;
      caffeine withdrawal questionnaire (CWSQ). Vitals (heart rate and blood pressure) will be&#xD;
      assessed following the completion of the questionnaires as well as post intervention in the&#xD;
      seated position. Prior to evaluation on the N-back task (cognitive memory task described&#xD;
      below) a practice stage with be conducted until the participant can consistently score 75% or&#xD;
      higher on three consecutive trials to eliminate a learning effect. After establishing test&#xD;
      familiarity, a baseline cognition score will be conducted through the n-back assessment. The&#xD;
      subject will then be given a 5-minute break (i.e., to use the lavatory). Following the break,&#xD;
      the participants will be randomized into either moderate intensity exercise or caffeine&#xD;
      ingestion group. The interventions are as follows; Moderate Intensity Exercise will consist&#xD;
      of a 20-minute bout of moderate intensity aerobic exercise. Exercise will consist of a&#xD;
      2-minute warm-up, followed by 15 minutes of walking at a rate, which will allow you to reach&#xD;
      2/3 of your max heart rate ((220-age)x0.6) followed by a 3-minute cool down on a treadmill&#xD;
      (together equaling 20 minutes). HR will be monitored through heart rate monitors worn by the&#xD;
      participants. The caffeine ingestion group will ingest 1.2 mg/kg of caffeine orally in powder&#xD;
      form with water to drink, after ingestion of caffeine participants will wait 20 minutes to&#xD;
      ensure peak plasma levels. The participants both the exercise group and the caffeine&#xD;
      ingestion group will be asked to refrain from conversation. The post intervention assessment&#xD;
      will begin within two minutes of the completion of either intervention. The second visit of&#xD;
      phase I will take place the following day at the same time (if possible). During the second&#xD;
      visit the participant's will complete the pre caffeine or pre exercise questionnaire, the&#xD;
      CWSQ and vitals will be monitored pre and post intervention. The participants will&#xD;
      participate in the intervention that they have not received on the first visit (for example,&#xD;
      if the participant received caffeine ingestion on the first visit the participant will&#xD;
      receive moderate intensity aerobic exercise on the second visit). Within two minutes of&#xD;
      completion the post treatment N-back task assessment will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phases 2 and 3 will assess caffeine consumers (phase 3 in an acutely deprived state)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will utilize a within subjects counter-balanced design. Previous to arrival for phase&#xD;
      2 participants will be asked to keep consumption of caffeine to a regular dose (morning&#xD;
      coffee) on the day of testing, abstain from alcohol and drugs for at least 18 hours prior to&#xD;
      testing. Participants will be urged to arrive at the same time for each visit. Upon arrival&#xD;
      to the Exercise and Health Psychology lab (located in room 408 of the Arthur and Sonia Labatt&#xD;
      Health Science Building at Western University) participants will be given the letter of&#xD;
      information, and asked to sign the informed consent form. Participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete a demographic survey, PAR-Q readiness for exercise, Godin Leisure-Time Exercise&#xD;
      Questionnaire, CCQ-R, and the CWSQ. Vitals (heart rate and blood pressure) will be assessed&#xD;
      following the completion of the questionnaires as well as post intervention in the seated&#xD;
      position. Prior to evaluation on the N-back task (cognitive memory task described below) a&#xD;
      practice stage with be conducted until the participant can consistently score 75% or higher&#xD;
      on three consecutive trials to eliminate a learning effect. After establishing familiarity, a&#xD;
      baseline cognition score will be conducted through the n-back assessment. The subject will&#xD;
      then be given a 5 minute break (i.e., to use the lavatory). Following the break the&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into either the moderate intensity exercise or caffeine&#xD;
      ingestion group. The interventions are as followed; Moderate Intensity Exercise will consist&#xD;
      of a 20-minute bout of moderate intensity aerobic exercise. Exercise will consist of a&#xD;
      2-minute warm-up, followed by 15 minutes of walking at a rate, which will allow you to reach&#xD;
      2/3 of your max heart rate (moderate intensity exercise= (220-age) x 0.6), and then a&#xD;
      3-minute cool down on a treadmill (together equaling 20 minutes). HR will be monitored&#xD;
      through heart rate monitors worn by the participants. The caffeine ingestion group will&#xD;
      ingest 1.2 mg/kg of caffeine in powder form with water to drink, after ingestion of caffeine&#xD;
      participants will wait 20 minutes to ensure peak plasma levels.The participants in both the,&#xD;
      exercise group and caffeine ingestion group will be asked to refrain from conversation. The&#xD;
      post intervention assessment will begin within two minutes of the completion of either&#xD;
      intervention. The second visit of phase I will take place the following day at the same time&#xD;
      (if possible). During the second visit the participant's will complete the pre caffeine or&#xD;
      pre exercise questionnaire, the CWSQ and vitals will be monitored pre and post intervention.&#xD;
      The participants will participate in the intervention that they have not received on the&#xD;
      first visit (for example, if the participant received caffeine ingestion on the first visit&#xD;
      the participant will receive moderate intensity aerobic exercise on the second visit). Within&#xD;
      two minutes of completion the post treatment N-back task assessment will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to arrival for phase 3, participants will be asked to refrain from caffeine for at&#xD;
      least 12 hours, and abstain from alcohol and drugs for at least 18 hours prior to testing.&#xD;
      Phase 3 will utilize the same participants as phase 2, but they will be examined in a&#xD;
      caffeine-deprived state (12 hours) for baseline N-back scores the CWSQ will also be&#xD;
      administered. Participants will then be randomized into either the caffeine ingestion group&#xD;
      or exercise treatment group where post intervention N-back scores will be obtained.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete the same pre-intervention questionnaires as the&#xD;
      previous phase. Vitals (heart rate and blood pressure) will be assessed pre and post&#xD;
      intervention. Caffeine abstinence will be validated through self-report with the use of&#xD;
      deception (participants being told that their saliva sample is being tested for the presence&#xD;
      of caffeine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-back task explanation: Three tasks will be administered to subjects for each treatment&#xD;
      condition (after caffeine administration and after exercise). The 1-back, 2-back, and 3-back&#xD;
      cognitive tests will assess working memory by measuring both the percentage of correct&#xD;
      responses, as well as reaction time. In these 5 minute tasks, a letter will appear on a&#xD;
      computer screen for an interval of 500ms, followed by a 2000ms blank screen interstimulus&#xD;
      (totaling 120 letters/5 minutes). Participants will be instructed to click the left button of&#xD;
      a computer mouse as soon as a target appears, and to keep in mind both the speed and accuracy&#xD;
      components of the task. In the 1-back condition, the target is defined as a letter flashing&#xD;
      that is the same as the one preceding it. For example, &quot;x, interstimulus, x&quot; would be the&#xD;
      target. In the 2-back condition, the target is defined as a letter appearing that is the same&#xD;
      as what preceded it 2 letters before. For example, &quot;a, interstimulus, b, interstimulus, a&quot;,&#xD;
      would be the target. In the 3-back condition, the target is defined as a letter appearing&#xD;
      that is the same as what preceded it 3 letters before. For example, &quot;a, interstimulus, b,&#xD;
      interstimulus, c, interstimulus, a&quot;, would be the target. All tasks call into action the&#xD;
      participant's working memory abilities, as a measure of cognition.&#xD;
