  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well brentuximab vedotin and lenalidomide work in treating&#xD;
      patients with stage IB-IVB T-cell lymphoma that have come back or do not respond to&#xD;
      treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin, may interfere with the ability&#xD;
      of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving brentuximab vedotin and&#xD;
      lenalidomide may work better in treating patients with T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of the combination of brentuximab vedotin&#xD;
      (BV) and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      (CTCL)/peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the duration of response and 2 year progression-free survival (PFS) and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) associated with the combination of brentuximab vedotin (BV) and&#xD;
      lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory CTCL/PTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of the combination of brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin (BV) and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory CTCL/PTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate between the expression of CD30 in neoplastic cells by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      (IHC) and overall response rate (ORR) of the combination of brentuximab vedotin (BV) and&#xD;
      lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory CTCL/PTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell subset numbers, phenotype, and&#xD;
      functional status in relapsed or refractory (rel/ref) CTCL/PTCL patients, and whether the&#xD;
      combination of brentuximab vedotin and lenalidomide alters these parameters during therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine changes in plasma cytokine levels and other biomarkers in this patient&#xD;
      population during therapy with the combination of brentuximab vedotin and lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on day 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up&#xD;
      to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
