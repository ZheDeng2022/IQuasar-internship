      Patients who are suffer from CIF often develop muscle wasting because of hypercatabolism.The&#xD;
      relationship between different nutrition support formulas and lean body mass is still&#xD;
      unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between nutrition&#xD;
      support and muscle mass and attempt to find the nutrients which will benefit lean body mass&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic intestinal failure (CIF) is defined as the malabsorption and nutrients deficiency&#xD;
      mainly caused by severe gastrointestinal benign diseases such as intestinal ﬁstula, short&#xD;
      bowel, and mechanical obstruction and some malignant diseases such as end-stage&#xD;
      intra-abdominal or pelvic cancers . CIF is one of the rarest of organ failures all over the&#xD;
      world and patients suffer from CIF often requires a prolonged time to recover .&#xD;
      Hypercatabolism caused by diseases stress, inflammation and reduced nutrient intake indicates&#xD;
      that patients with CIF need long-term nutritional support .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are suffer from CIF often develop muscle wasting because of hypercatabolism.&#xD;
      Moreover, studies showed that low muscle mass and muscle wasting during critical illness are&#xD;
      associated with poor clinical outcomes and hampered rehabilitation. Except Resistance&#xD;
      training, sufficient nutrients supplement also play important roles in maintaining the&#xD;
      skeletal muscle mass. Guidelines recommended that nutritional support regimens in patients&#xD;
      should be individualized and adjusted over time based on formal nutritional assessment .&#xD;
      However, almost all guidelines only recommended the total energy and protein requirements&#xD;
      based on the results of basal metabolic rate (BMR) and nitrogen balance rather than the lean&#xD;
      body mass . The relationship between different nutrition support formulas and lean body mass&#xD;
      is still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between nutrition support and&#xD;
      muscle mass and attempt to find the nutrients which will benefit lean body mass in patients&#xD;
      with CIF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult CIF patients (age ≥18 years) receiving nutrition support were included. The&#xD;
      exclusion criteria were hepatic insufficiency (alanine transaminase/aspartate transaminase&#xD;
      ratio 200% above normal range or bilirubin &gt;3 mg/dL), renal insufficiency (serum creatinine&#xD;
      [Scr] &gt;1.5 mg/dL), acute or life-threatening diseases (e.g., shock, collapse, stroke, coma of&#xD;
      unknown etiology, or recent cardiac infarction), and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The&#xD;
      study was approved by the ethics committee of Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lean body mass include soft lean mass (SLM), skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and fat free mass&#xD;
      (FFM) which were measured and recorded by body composition analyzer (InBody S10, Biospace) at&#xD;
      the time of admission and discharge respectively.The deviation of lean body mass was&#xD;
      calculated by the difference between admission and discharge, and then symbolized as ∆SLM,&#xD;
      ∆SMM and ∆FFM. Basic and nutritional information of CIF patients was measured weekly after&#xD;
      hospital admission, including age, sex, BMI, NRS-2002 score, SGA grade, etiology of&#xD;
      malnutrition, daily energy &amp; protein intake via EN &amp; PN.&#xD;
