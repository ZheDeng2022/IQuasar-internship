    <textblock>
      The efficacy of intranasal kinetic oscillation stimulation using the Chordate System S211 as&#xD;
      a preventative treatment will be examined in patients diagnosed with chronic migraine. The&#xD;
      medical device system will be applied in 6 treatments at weekly intervals. The study will&#xD;
      examine the effects on monthly headache days with moderate to severe intensity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical investigation of&#xD;
      a medical device. The study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 6-week treatment period&#xD;
      (2 weeks run-in and a 4-week observation window to assess the treatment effect), and a 4-week&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study primarily aims at evaluating the effect of intranasal kinetic oscillation&#xD;
      stimulation using the Chordate System S211 as a preventative treatment on monthly headache&#xD;
      days with moderate to severe intensity.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Due to uncertainties in EU data protection legislation individual deidentified participant data are not shared. The main uncertainty is the concept of what &quot;deidentified&quot; means. It appears not to mean that the data set of a person is simply separated from the person's name. What additional operations have to be done appears to depend on technological capabilities to re-identify the persons associated with the data set. A common perception is that the technological capabilities for re-identification are permanently increasing. This could have the effect that public data sets that are regarded as deidentified now might become re-identifiable data sets in the future. Once this happens, the sponsor is no longer able to make the publication of the data sets un-happen. This could result in punishment by EU data protection authorities. The sponsor wants to avoid this.</ipd_description>
