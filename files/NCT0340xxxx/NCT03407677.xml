  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ROTO track® is an electronic injection form and injection log for keeping track of&#xD;
      injection sites in the abdominal region. The device attaches directly to the insulin pen and&#xD;
      activates whenever the insulin pen is picked up. Small LED lights on the device will indicate&#xD;
      where the next injection site is according to the individual patient's injection plan. By&#xD;
      moving the pen and device to an &quot;anchor point&quot; in front of the navel, the device is able to&#xD;
      start tracking where the insulin pen is being moved to. The device additionally contains a&#xD;
      haptic interface to indicate to the user when the device has been moved to the next area in&#xD;
      the injection plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device registers the location, the time and the dosage automatically when the patient&#xD;
      injects insulin with the pen&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of the trial is that the ROTO track® can help patients rotate their injections&#xD;
      sites and that this will provide the healthcare system with a new cost-effective tool for&#xD;
      improving insulin injection techniques.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both observational and interventional studies have reported that proper rotation of injection&#xD;
      sites can be obtained through intensive injection technique training, education and follow up&#xD;
      of patients. Furthermore, this has significant beneficial effects on daily glycaemic&#xD;
      variations, hypoglycaemic events, long term blood glucose levels, and insulin dose&#xD;
      requirements. This is however frequently not done appropriately in every day practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a small workshop at Nordsjællands Hospital in November 2017 with patients with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes the value of a device to registrar time, dose and rotation of insulin injections&#xD;
      were discussed. All patients considered their own injection patterns as satisfying - although&#xD;
      only one in four used a systematic approach. Most patients relied on their healthcare&#xD;
      provider to identify side effects like lipohypertrophy, half of the patients re-used needles&#xD;
      more than once and two took injections through the clothes now and then. All subjects would&#xD;
      prefer a simple and small device to be used with the pen for the lifetime of the pen to&#xD;
      minimize time used for injections and attraction of attention from other people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the ROTO track® can reduce the number of insulin injections in the&#xD;
      same subcutaneous skin area as compared with standard insulin injection instructions in&#xD;
      patients with type 1 diabetes. The reduction of injection in same skin area will be&#xD;
      quantified by a rotation score&#xD;

    <masking_description>During the baseline period patients will be blinded to the feature of the ROTO track®, which registers site of insulin injection and the features (vibration and light) that can assist the patient in rotation of injections. Patients will in the first week of the study be informed, that the ROTO track® is being developed as a new automatic device to register data on insulin injections including day, time and dose of insulin.</masking_description>

    <description>Number of insulin injections taken in a given subcutaneous skin area will be captured in a rotation score by the ROTO track® .&#xD;
The rotation score is a single ratio value that combines the distribution over the skin areas used with the time between re-use of a field. The value is set from 0 (meaning every injections in a single area) to 1 (meaning perfect rotation with the maximum possible time between two injections in the same skin area).</description>
