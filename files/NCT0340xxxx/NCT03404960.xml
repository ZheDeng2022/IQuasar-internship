        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with&#xD;
             locally advanced or metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. ≥18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Expected life expectancy of at least 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be able to understand the study procedures and agree to participate in&#xD;
             the study by providing written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have received treatment with platinum-based (cisplatin, oxaliplatin or&#xD;
             carboplatin) treatment for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer and have&#xD;
             received a minimum of 16 weeks of therapy without evidence of disease progression&#xD;
             based on the investigator's opinion. This does not have to be the patient's current&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  This requires at least stable imaging and a stable or decreasing tumor marker as&#xD;
                  applicable and as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a patient has demonstrated a biochemical and imaging response to platinum&#xD;
                  therapy and has not progressed within 16 weeks of starting this therapy but had&#xD;
                  to discontinue platinum prior to 16 weeks for a legitimate medical reason (as&#xD;
                  determined by the investigator), the patient may still be considered for the&#xD;
                  trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients may have previously failed non-platinum containing therapy or may never&#xD;
                  have previously progressed on treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Discontinuation of the platinum component of the regimen for chemotherapy-related&#xD;
                  toxicity is permissible provided the patient has previously received at least 16&#xD;
                  weeks of platinum-based therapy without evidence of disease progression ≤8 weeks&#xD;
                  after treatment with the platinum agent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Measurable disease is not a requirement for study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient agrees to peripheral blood samples during screening and at the end of&#xD;
             treatment for cytogenetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patients who have demonstrated resistance to platinum agents (e.g. oxaliplatin,&#xD;
             cisplatin) are not eligible to participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinical evidence of uncontrolled malabsorption and/or any other gastrointestinal&#xD;
             disorder or defect that would, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption of niraparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Acute infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, antiviral or antifungal agents&#xD;
             during the 14 days prior to first dose of study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients will be excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune&#xD;
             disease, defined as: patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease are&#xD;
             excluded from this study, as are patients with a history of symptomatic autoimmune&#xD;
             disease (eg rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis (scleroderma),&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Has received a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial therapy&#xD;
             (Note: seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated and are&#xD;

             participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
