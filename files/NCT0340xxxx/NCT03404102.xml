  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intrauterine device (IUD) is one of the most widely used reversible, long-term&#xD;
      contraceptive methods in the world. But despite all its advantages; discontinuation rate of&#xD;
      IUD ranged from 9.6% to 37.3 % (according to Demographic and Health Surveys data). In Egypt,&#xD;
      in 2014, the discontinuation rate of IUD (within 12 months of use) was 14.3%.This study&#xD;
      explores the differences around this rate in Egyptian university clinic and primary&#xD;
      healthcare clinic with detailed percentages of possible causes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare between primary health care unit and university family&#xD;
      planning clinic in discontinuation rate among copper IUD users.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Research Hypothesis: (Null hypothesis)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • In women using copper IUD, discontinuation rate in primary health care unit and&#xD;
           university clinic may be similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • In women using copper IUD, Does discontinuation rate in primary health care unit and&#xD;
           university clinic differ?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family planning Outpatient clinic of Ain Shams Maternity Hospital, (ASUMH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  primary health care unit in ain shams area&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study period: 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size: was calculated using Sample size computer program 11. After review of&#xD;
           literature, no previous similar study was done before, so assume a discontinuation rate&#xD;
           of 50% among Cu-IUD users in primary healthcare unit and 25% among Cu-IUD users in&#xD;
           university clinic. Based on these values; the study will include 170 Cu-IUD users;&#xD;
           equally selected as 85 subjects from each clinic. But due to the expected drop outs,&#xD;
           recruitment will start by 200 women from each clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Descriptive statistics for measured variables will be expressed as range, mean&#xD;
                     and standard deviation (for metric data); range, median and interquartile&#xD;
                     range (for discrete data); and number and proportions (for categorical data).&#xD;
                     Cu-IUD discontinuation findings in each clinic will be compared using the&#xD;
                     t-test or the Mann-whitney U test depending on whether the measured parameters&#xD;
                     are guassian variables. A P-value of 0.05 or less will be considered&#xD;
                     statistically significant.&#xD;
