  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With our SWIDINEP cohort, we propose to explore the relationship between vascular risk&#xD;
      markers and renal function decline in CKD stage 1-5. In order to realize these goals, we&#xD;
      intend to recruit 200 patients within a 7y recruitment period (2014-2021). Recruitment is&#xD;
      done in the nephrology and diabetes ambulatory clinics in the CHUV at Lausanne. Each eligible&#xD;
      patient is identified and whether he/she can be proposed the study is discussed with the&#xD;
      physician in charge of the patient. Once the patient is informed and has signed the consent&#xD;
      form, he/she is examined in the Service of Nephrology at baseline, 2y and 5y.&#xD;

      Serum, plasma, and fresh urine samples as well as whole blood (buffy coat for DNA extraction&#xD;
      and genotyping) are stored at -80°C in a local biobank according to the latest guidelines of&#xD;
      the Académie Suisse des Sciences Médicales (ASSM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vascular phenotype includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24h ABPM with the examination of diurnal variations of blood pressure, pulse pressure&#xD;
           and heart rate. Central pulse pressure is also calculated based on the pulse wave&#xD;
           analysis providing information on stroke volume, central BP, aortic stiffness and&#xD;
           arterial wave reflection. It increases with age and could expose glomerular capillaries&#xD;
           to damage. It has been independently related to proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arterial stiffness is assessed non-invasively with the commercially available Sphygmocor&#xD;
           system (Version 8.0, At Cor Medical, Sydney, Australia) using applanation tonometry to&#xD;
           measure carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid and radial augmentation&#xD;
           indexes. Pulse wave velocity is a strong surrogate for carotid-femoral arterial&#xD;
           stiffness. Generally around 3-4m/s in the young population it increases with age. A high&#xD;
           PWV brings to a greater transmission of pulsating pressure to the renal microcirculation&#xD;
           and is associated with accelerated eGFR decline. Recently, a study has described its&#xD;
           independent relationship with cardio-vascular mortality in CKD stage 2-4. Patients with&#xD;
           a PWV at least at 10m/s had a HR for mortality of 5. Carotid and radial augmentation&#xD;
           indexes measure the difference between the second and first systolic peak of the aortic&#xD;
           wave and is expressed as a percentage of pulse pressure. They increase with age and have&#xD;
           been correlated with eGFR and albuminuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carotid ultrasound is performed to assess carotid intima-media thickness. Carotid-intima&#xD;
           media thickness is a direct measurement of atherosclerosis and can help stratify&#xD;
           patients at CV risk. It has been associated with eGFR decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants undergo a renal ultrasound including renal resistance index measurements as&#xD;
           marker of intrarenal vascular disease according to a pre-specified protocol used&#xD;
           previously in other local cohorts by the same experienced operator (PD Dr Menno Pruijm).&#xD;
           The assessment of the intrarenal vessels is made by duplex Doppler sonography on 3&#xD;
           segmental arteries (superior, middle, and inferior) in each kidney. The values are then&#xD;
           averaged to obtain the mean value for each participant. Renal resistive index (RRI) is&#xD;
           calculated as [(peak-systolic velocity - end-diastolic velocity)/peak-systolic&#xD;
           velocity]. The Service of nephrology has performed an important study providing&#xD;
           reference values in a population with normal renal ultrasounds. Renal resistive index&#xD;
           has been associated with eGFR decline. Besides, all participants are screened for&#xD;
           underlying renal artery stenosis based on well established intrarenal Doppler criteria.&#xD;
           The presence of other renal structural abnormalities (renal cysts, tumors,&#xD;
           calcifications and/or hydronephrosis) is also assessed. Finally, the bladder area is&#xD;
           systematically visualized, as well as the prostatic gland in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects undergo ocular examination, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit&#xD;
           lamp biomicroscopic exam, measurement of intraocular pressure with a non-contact&#xD;
           tonometer and fundus examination. Choroidal thickness is measured by the EDI-OCT&#xD;
           technique. The subfoveal choroidal thickness is measured at macular fovea from the outer&#xD;
           portion of the hyperreflective line corresponding to the RPE to the hyporeflective line&#xD;
           or margin corresponding to the sclerochoroidal interface. Central macular retinal&#xD;
           thickness is determined automatically in all eyes. There are emerging data regarding the&#xD;
           relationship of choroidal circulation and various systemic and ocular diseases. The&#xD;
           choroid is highly vascularized tissue that supplies blood to the outer retina, including&#xD;
           the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and photoreceptors, especially in the foveal&#xD;
           region where there is no retinal vasculature. The choroid plays a crucial part in the&#xD;
           physiopathology of many retinal diseases. Details of the choroidal circulation remained&#xD;
           largely unknown due to poor resolution and reproducibility of previous choroidal imaging&#xD;
           techniques. Imaging of the choroid was dramatically improved with the development of&#xD;
           spectral domain optical coherence tomography and was further augmented with the advent&#xD;
           of enhanced depth imaging. The relation between renal dysfunction and impaired ocular&#xD;
           microcirculation remains unclear, especially in early-stage diabetes. It's been reported&#xD;
           that the blood flow in the retinal arterioles is decreased in patients with type 2&#xD;
           diabetes with chronic kidney disease. Though, data on the relationship between choroidal&#xD;
           thickness and diabetic nephropathy are sparse. As far as we are aware today, there is&#xD;
           only one study that evaluated choroidal thickness alterations in diabetic nephropathy&#xD;
           patients with early or no diabetic retinopathy. More precisely the subfoveal, temporal&#xD;
           and nasal choroidal thickness was noted to be thinner in patients with diabetic&#xD;
           nephropathy patients compared with non- diabetic nephropathy patients and normal&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life questionnaires: A number of studies have shown that as kidney function&#xD;
      decreases, disease burden increases, with lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for&#xD;
      patients with late stages of chronic kidney disease. However, few studies have looked into&#xD;
      HRQoL and its determinants in the specific population of diabetic patients with kidney&#xD;
      disease. Assessing HRQoL and its determinants is important in chronic care as studies have&#xD;
      shown that patients with higher HRQoL function better within the healthcare system and&#xD;
      perform more health-promoting activities. HRQoL is assessed at baseline in patients enrolled&#xD;
      in the cohort. The impact of baseline HRQoL on renal function decline will be analysed.&#xD;
