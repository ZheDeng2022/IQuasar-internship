  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal study that will collect demographic, anthropometric and dietary data&#xD;
      to determine the relationships between meat and egg intake and the incidence of Type 2&#xD;
      Diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects of the Adventist Health Study who are non-diabetic will provide demographic,&#xD;
      anthropometric and dietary data at baseline. Meat and egg intake will be assessed with a&#xD;
      validated quantitative food frequency intake questionnaire. The relationship between meat and&#xD;
      egg intake and the incidence of Type 2 Diabetes will be determined using&#xD;
      multivariate-adjusted logistic regression.&#xD;

        The AHS-2 is a prospective cohort of &gt;96,000 Seventh-day Adventist adults recruited from&#xD;
        the USA and Canada between February 2002 and May 2007. Designed primarily to examine&#xD;
        associations between diet and health outcomes, the study is composed of approximately 65%&#xD;
        females and 27% blacks. Recruitment and data collection methods for the parent cohort have&#xD;
        been described previously. The cohort is composed of participants with different dietary&#xD;
        patterns and a wide variation in egg and meat intake ranging from non-consumption to daily&#xD;
        consumption. Approval for the AHS-2 study was obtained from the Loma Linda University Human&#xD;
        Subjects Committee Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was acquired&#xD;
        from all AHS-2 participants upon enrollment.&#xD;
