      The object is to develop a physical activity promotion program by applying social cognitive&#xD;
      theory and wearable technology and evaluate its feasibility in people with MI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I: Accuracy, Acceptability, Feasibility. Stage II: Effectiveness Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stage II, will conduct a single-blinded, randomized controlled study. 90 participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to experimental group or control group. The intervention for both groups&#xD;
      will last for 12 weeks, with a 12-week of follow-up. The measurements include physical&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The health condition of individuals with chronic mental illness (MI) is usually&#xD;
      poorer than the general population. This health disparity may be related to their lower&#xD;
      physical activity level. One of the critical issues in psychiatric rehabilitation is to&#xD;
      develop a health promotion program which utilizes less clinical resources and results in&#xD;
      long-term effectiveness. Compared with structure exercise, lifestyle physical activity might&#xD;
      be one of the solutions. With the mobile technology and wearable technology becoming popular,&#xD;
      mobile health (mHealth) emerges and has showed some preliminary effects on other population.&#xD;
      The mHealth may be an innovative health promotion program for people with MI and deserves&#xD;
      more research to examine the effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This study is (1) to examine the accuracy and acceptability of wearable technology&#xD;
      in persons with MI; (2) to develop a physical activity promotion program by applying social&#xD;
      cognitive theory and wearable technology and evaluate its feasibility in people with MI ; (3)&#xD;
      to examine the effectiveness of the program on physical activity level and health outcomes ;&#xD;
      and (4) to examine the moderators of the program's effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I: completed (Accuracy, Acceptability, Feasibility) Stage II: (RCT) The investigators&#xD;
      will conduct a single-blinded, randomized controlled study. 90 participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to experimental group or control group. The intervention for both groups will last&#xD;
      for 12 weeks, with a 12-week of follow-up. The measurements include physical activity level,&#xD;
      physical fitness, cognitive function and sleep quality, as well as the moderators of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contributions: The results of study will be one of the evidence-based health promotion&#xD;
      programs for individuals with MI. With wearable technology and telecommunication technology,&#xD;
      it makes possible to expand the health care services from traditional clinical settings to&#xD;
      client's natural milieu, and to serve more people with MI by using less resources. The&#xD;
      results of study may also form a much appreciated basis for future studies of mHealth on&#xD;
      other heath behavior (e.g., healthy diet) or in other disability groups (e.g., stroke).&#xD;
