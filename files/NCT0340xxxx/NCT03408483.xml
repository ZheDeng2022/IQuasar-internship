  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral nerve blocks for joint and extremity surgeries have long been proven to provide&#xD;
      effective post-operative analgesia. Of these surgeries, total hip arthroplasty (THA) remains&#xD;
      one of the most common orthopedic procedures in the United States with approximately 300,000&#xD;
      operations performed annually. At our institution, post-operative analgesia in these patients&#xD;
      is primarily provided through parenteral and oral opioid medications. Quadratus lumborum&#xD;
      blocks (QLB) have been described and implemented for various surgical procedures including&#xD;
      caesarean and laparoscopic ovarian surgery. Recently, there has been increasing interest in&#xD;
      the efficacy of quadratus lumborum blocks for THA. Currently, case reports have established a&#xD;
      precedent regarding the efficacy of the QLB for THA in providing superior analgesia and&#xD;
      decreasing visual analog pain scores (VAS), but randomized trials are still lacking. The goal&#xD;
      of this study is to compare pain scores (VAS), opioid consumption, physical therapy scores,&#xD;
      and patient and surgeon satisfaction in patients that receive QLB versus no peripheral nerve&#xD;
      blockade in patients undergoing THA. The results of this study have the potential to change&#xD;
      standard of care for patients undergoing THA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, regional anesthesia techniques for total hip arthroplasty are limited. Fascia&#xD;
      iliac blocks have been employed to provide analgesia for hip surgeries with blockade of the&#xD;
      femoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, and obturator nerves via injection of local anesthetic in&#xD;
      the iliacus fascia. In addition, lumbar plexus blocks have also been employed for&#xD;
      post-operative analgesia, but the complexity of the block is high, and complications&#xD;
      including epidural anesthesia are not infrequent. The quadratus lumborum block is an&#xD;
      abdominal truncal block in which local anesthetic is deposited into the thoracolumbar fascia&#xD;
      or the quadratus lumborum muscle itself with the goal of providing analgesia to the&#xD;
      ipsilateral T6 - L1 sensory dermatomes. It has already been demonstrated to provide effective&#xD;
      post-operative analgesia for certain abdominal and pelvic surgeries, but its use in total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty is limited to case reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The block is accomplished by identifying the quadratus lumborum muscle, which originates from&#xD;
      iliac crest and iliolumbar ligament, and inserted on transverse processes of upper four&#xD;
      lumbar vertebrae and posterior border of the 12th rib. Local anesthetic is then deposited at&#xD;
      the anterior, posterior or middle thoracolumbar fascia, or intramuscularly, depending on the&#xD;
      technique used. Cadaveric studies8 have demonstrated dye spread to the lumbar nerve roots and&#xD;
      nerves within the transversus abdominis plane (TAP). Carney et al9 described a &quot;posterior&#xD;
      TAP&quot; block, now known to be synonymous with QLB, that demonstrated contrast spread to the&#xD;
      thoracic paravertebral space from T5-L1. Case reports have described analgesia in the&#xD;
      corresponding sensory dermatomes after QLB4, and have demonstrated efficacy in patient&#xD;
      undergoing THA. The QLB block has potential to cover lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, femoral&#xD;
      nerve, obturator nerve and portions of lumbar plexus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed to investigate the efficacy of the quadratus lumborum block as a&#xD;
      primary method of providing post-operative analgesia in patients undergoing THA. Previous&#xD;
      trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of the block for abdominal and pelvic surgeries,&#xD;
      and case reports have shown its applicability in hip arthroplasty. In this randomized&#xD;
      controlled study we aim to compare QLB (intervention) with control (no intervention) group in&#xD;
      patients undergoing THA with regard to the VAS pain scores (at PACU arrival &amp; discharge12, 24&#xD;
      &amp; 36 hours), duration of analgesia, time to first opioid medication, physical therapy&#xD;
      evaluations, time to discharge, and surgeon and patient satisfaction scores.&#xD;

        <title>Pain Scores Using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scores</title>
        <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which is used in surveys/questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured.&#xD;
The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) is an 11-point scale for patient self-reporting of pain. It is for adults and children 10 years old or older:&#xD;
Rating - Pain Level&#xD;
0 - No Pain&#xD;
1-3 - Mild Pain (nagging, annoying, interfering little with *ADLs)&#xD;
4-6 - Moderate Pain (interferes significantly with ADLs)&#xD;
7-10 - Severe Pain (disabling; unable to perform ADLs)&#xD;
*ADL=Activities of Daily Living</description>
        <time_frame>Assessed between immediately postoperatively to 12 hours postoperatively</time_frame>
        <population>Three patients in each group were excluded for failed spinal anesthesia. Three patients were excluded in the QLB group for missing data due to early discharge.</population>

Standard noninvasive monitors applied, and oxygen administered via nasal cannula. Parenteral midazolam and fentanyl titrated to patient comfort.&#xD;
Standard skin sterilization, prepping and draping will be applied to the area. Under ultrasound guidance, needle will be advanced to anterior border of quadratus lumborum muscle. After negative aspiration, a bolus of 30 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine will be injected in 5 mL aliquots.&#xD;
After QLB is placed, patients will have THA under spinal anesthesia.</description>

        <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which is used in surveys/questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured.&#xD;
The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) is an 11-point scale for patient self-reporting of pain. It is for adults and children 10 years old or older:&#xD;
Rating - Pain Level&#xD;
0 - No Pain&#xD;
1-3 - Mild Pain (nagging, annoying, interfering little with *ADLs)&#xD;
4-6 - Moderate Pain (interferes significantly with ADLs)&#xD;
