      The goal of this proposal is to assess the biodistribution of 18F-Clofarabine, a new tracer&#xD;
      developed for use in PET/CT scans. The investigator's hypothesis is this tracer will allow&#xD;
      for imaging immune activation in patients with melanoma before and after treatment with&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 10 subjects are intended to be included in this study. Each subject will undergo&#xD;
      a maximum of two 18F-Clofarabine PET/CT scans, with each visit taking up to 4 hours. The&#xD;
      first visit will be prior to the first cycle of immunotherapy treatment, and the second scan&#xD;
      will take place 2-4 weeks after the immunotherapy treatment has started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the PET scan an IV line will be placed. Blood pressure, heart rate, blood oxygen and&#xD;
      ECG will be obtained. Then the 18F-Clofarabine will be injected and the PET/CT scan&#xD;
      acquisition started. After a maximum of 120 min of scanning, subjects will undergo again&#xD;
      blood pressure, heart rate, blood oxygen and ECG.&#xD;

      This is a non-interventional pilot study dedicated to PET imaging for patients with&#xD;
      metastatic or recurrent advanced cancer melanoma before and after immune therapy&#xD;
      interventions with an anti-TIM-3 monoclonal antibody, with or without an anti-PD1 antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT will be used to investigate the bio-distribution of 18F-Clofarabine in patients with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic melanoma before and 2 to 4 weeks after immune system activating&#xD;
      interventions, namely an anti-TIM-3 monoclonal antibody, alone or in combination with an&#xD;
      anti-PD1 antibody. Clofarabine is a FDA-approved drug for treatment of relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (December 2004) and is gaining importance for treating&#xD;
      adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Despite extensive preclinical toxicity studies&#xD;
      and multiple human phase I studies, the exact bio-distribution of Clofarabine remains&#xD;
      unknown. The labeling of Clofarabine with 18F allows the in vivo imaging of its&#xD;
      bio-distribution using only minimal concentrations of the therapeutically active doses. The&#xD;
      radioactive labeling of clofarabine does not change the parent molecule since a 19F present&#xD;
      in the parent compound is simply replaced by an 18F.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that imaging the bio-distribution of clofarabine non-invasively&#xD;
      will provide insights into the bio-distribution of the drug in vivo. Imaging the&#xD;
      bio-distribution of radiolabeled Clofarabine may help to better understand the side effects&#xD;
      caused by therapeutic doses. Importantly, the investigators want to understand if&#xD;
      interventions activating the immune system impact the bio-distribution of 18F-Clofarabine.&#xD;
      This is because the enzyme dCK that is required to activate the prodrug clofarabine is highly&#xD;
      expressed in activated immune cells (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic PET/CT imaging with 18F-Clofarabine will be performed in 10 patients with advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma who have progressed following treatment with an anti-PD-1 antibody.&#xD;
      18F-Clofarabine PET/CT scans will be collected before and 2-4 weeks after treatment with an&#xD;
      anti-TIM-3 monoclonal antibody, with or without an anti-PD1 antibody. Imaging can be&#xD;
      completed without exposing human subjects to any significant risk. It should be noted, that&#xD;
      only trace amounts (nano-molar concentrations in saline solution) of the labeled&#xD;
      18F-Clofarabine will be administered intravenously. Thus, mass effects of the drug and any&#xD;
      toxic effects can be ruled out. Tracer concentrations in all organs can be quantified&#xD;
      non-invasively in organs which may provide insights into the whole-body drug distribution.&#xD;
      Investigators have now seen in humans and non-human primates the exact bio-distribution that&#xD;
      one would expect with uptake in bone marrow, spleen, LN and, if patients are young, in&#xD;
      thymus. Liver uptake is non-specific and likely due to hepatic clearance via biliary system.&#xD;
      There is no retention in other organs which does not mean that there is no low background&#xD;
      activity. Tracer uptake is proportional to dCK activity in tissues.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following inclusion criteria also apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject must be able to tolerate PET/CT (i.e. not claustrophobic and able to remain&#xD;
             supine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must be 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participation in a main study of anti-TIM-3&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who meet the exclusion criteria are excluded from this study. 1. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Women of childbearing potential will have to undergo a pregnancy test that will&#xD;
                  be provided free of charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Current knowledge indicates no confirmed detrimental effects to a developing&#xD;
                  fetus of radiation doses below 10,000 mrem. The radiation dose received from the&#xD;
                  study procedure is very small in comparison, however, the exclusion criteria is&#xD;
                  in place to minimize any potential for exposure of a fetus.&#xD;
