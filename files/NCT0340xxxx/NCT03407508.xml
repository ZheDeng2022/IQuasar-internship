  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant and growing interest in nutrition and health in the general population&#xD;
      and there is also, paradoxically, an increasing problem with obesity and general debilitating&#xD;
      conditions of affluence, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Igelösa Life Science AB has&#xD;
      developed a modified Okinawan-based Nordic Diet (OBND) diet based on evidence primarily from&#xD;
      the diet of the long-lived and healthy Okinawa population. The diet includes fish and whole&#xD;
      grains, with a high level of vegetables, but is low in fat. In 2016, a clinical nutrition&#xD;
      study was carried out at Kristianstad University with the intention to determine if the OBND&#xD;
      resulted in reductions/changes in clinical and medical markers of importance for treatment of&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus and gingivitis/periodontitis. The diet had a positive impact on the&#xD;
      clinical progress of otherwise debilitating conditions such as diabetes and the health&#xD;
      benefits on clinical parameters was extremely rapid, that is, within two weeks. Not only did&#xD;
      the patients with type 2 diabetes receive the OBND, their partners were also offered the same&#xD;
      option. This is a key innovation and the participants stated that it was a great support,&#xD;
      which facilitated adherence and promotes the long-term impact on health. Ingrained habits&#xD;
      such as poor diet, can only be defeated by a concerted team effort and our work to date&#xD;
      provides a glimpse of the potential benefits to Sweden and the rest of the developed world&#xD;
      through this shared approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial studies have shown promising effects of the OBND on both diabetes and periodontal&#xD;
      conditions. The objective of this study is to compare the OBND to the current recommended&#xD;
      standard diet. Assuming the study provides positive evidence of health impact due to improved&#xD;
      food quality, it will also be seen that the production and delivery of such 'healthy-living'&#xD;
      meals will be of commercial interest for industry. The mission is to offer an evidence-based&#xD;
      natural food alternative that both prevents disease and improves the health status of&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes. The long-term goal is to design efficient and effective products&#xD;
      that will protect against diabetes and other chronic diseases. The combination of scientific&#xD;
      credibility and commercial interests may be a key factor to transfer the new knowledge about&#xD;
      healthy dieting into actual improvements in public health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The project has one main goal: to perform a clinical trial to compare the OBND with standard&#xD;
      of care diet. The outcome of the clinical trial will be analyzed in the areas:&#xD;
      medicine/odontology, sensory science, nursing, public health and health economics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if the consumption of the designated diet results in added medical/dental&#xD;
           health outcome for the OBND in comparison to standard of care diet. The study is a&#xD;
           randomized case control clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform cost-effectiveness analyses comparing costs and health benefits for the test&#xD;
           and control diets with focus on individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and otherwise&#xD;
           healthy individuals living in close relationship to those with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess consumer acceptance of the diet: (I) acceptance of the diets (questionnaire,&#xD;
           focus groups and food diary), (II) acceptability of the diet in relation to taste of the&#xD;
           diet, and the prospect of adopting the diet in everyday life, and (III) sensory analysis&#xD;
           of identical dishes prepared according to the OBND and the standard of care diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study design is a randomized double-blinded clinical trial with four&#xD;
      subgroups including 20 individuals per study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Group A: OBND, individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with a need for insulin&#xD;
      intake&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Group B: OBND, relatives who do not have T2D&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group C: Standard of care diet, individuals diagnosed with T2D with a need for&#xD;
      insulin intake&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group D: Standard of care diet, relatives who do not have T2D&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above reported studies and available data on blood sugar and lipid values, the&#xD;
      investigators have identified that 18 individuals in each group will provide adequate&#xD;
      statistical power (alpha=0.05, beta=0.85). While lost to follow up occurs, the investigators&#xD;
      will enroll 20 individuals in each group. Thus, a total of 80 study individuals (test and&#xD;
      control) will be enrolled. Data analyses will be performed according to per protocol as well&#xD;
      as per intent to treat. Clinical examination procedures in medicine and dentistry will follow&#xD;
      principles of good clinical practice. Study group assignment will be based on a randomization&#xD;
      using the SPSS statistics package. A pre-baseline examination will be performed to ensure&#xD;
      that all study individuals fulfill study requirements. The investigators will monitor that&#xD;
      study individuals are compliant to protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study time schedule The study design includes a pre-baseline study examination two weeks&#xD;
      before study start to ensure that study individuals meet the criteria for study participation&#xD;
      and to control for Hawthorne effects. Study individuals will be enrolled in groups of 8 to 10&#xD;
      individuals and re-examined at baseline. The primary study endpoint is the third examination&#xD;
      will be performed 4 weeks after baseline examination. A follow-up examination will occur&#xD;
      after 6 months (plus/minus 14 days). All study enrollments will be completed within one&#xD;
      month. Study individuals will receive phone calls during the study period to encourage&#xD;
      compliance and respond to specific questions.&#xD;
