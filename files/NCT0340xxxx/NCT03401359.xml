    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a biomarker and molecular profiling study in&#xD;
      longitudinally paired tumor biopsies and serum from patients with Hormone Receptor positive&#xD;
      (HR+) metastatic Breast Cancer (BC) treated with Palbociclib(Palbo) in combination with&#xD;
      endocrine therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to obtain tumor biopsy and blood samples, taken at both pre-treatment&#xD;
      and post-progression, from 40 patients who develop acquired resistance to Palbo + endocrine&#xD;
      combination treatment. All assays will be conducted in parallel on both pre and&#xD;
      post-treatment samples to identify differences that may account for acquired resistance.&#xD;
      Cyclin E1 and E2 levels will be assessed by IHC on tumor biopsies. Neuregulin-1 levels will&#xD;
      be assessed by ELISA assay on serum. Tumor biopsies will be further profiled using&#xD;
      whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Matched blood&#xD;
      samples will be subject to WES to facilitate somatic mutation detection. Paired tumor&#xD;
      biopsies will undergo immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of TIL markers to assess&#xD;
      Palbo-induced changes. Finally, we will apply the in-house circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)&#xD;
      assay, which employs a custom-designed panel for studying Palbo acquired resistance, towards&#xD;
      the analysis of 40 pairs of plasma samples. The custom ctDNA panel will be extended to&#xD;
      include additional mutations identified from this study that confer acquired resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further evaluate the effects of Palbo treatment on intratumoral TILs, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to acquire paired tumor biopsy and matched blood samples, at baseline and two time&#xD;
      points (6 weeks, 12 weeks) during the course of Palbo treatment, from 20 patients. And they&#xD;
      will select metastatic BC patients who exhibit stable diseases (SD) in response to Palbo for&#xD;
      tumor biopsies, prior to knowledge of whether post-progression biopsy would be available.&#xD;
      Tumor biopsies will be subject to WES, RNA-Seq and IHC analyses. Further, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to quantify the abundance of immune cell sub-populations in the matched blood samples&#xD;
      using flow cytometry (FACS) to assess Palbo treatment effects on systematic immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on-treatment samples can be collected after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of initiating Palbo&#xD;
      treatment, it takes about 18 months on average for initially treated patients with late stage&#xD;
      HR+ breast cancers to develop acquired resistance. Only an estimated 40% of relapsed cases&#xD;
      will have successful biopsies due to a lack of consent or difficult-to-operate biopsies such&#xD;
      as bone-only metastases. Hence, the investigators plan to bank pre-treatment biopsies and&#xD;
      blood samples from about 100 patients by Q2 2018 in order to collect 40 post-progression&#xD;
      biopsies as matched pairs within the 2-year time frame. FFPE slides will be made from all&#xD;
      tumor biopsies, including the 100 cases at baseline, and subject to H&amp;E staining. The&#xD;
      investigators will detect and quantify TILs through machine learning and digital imaging&#xD;
      analysis of the H&amp;E data.&#xD;
