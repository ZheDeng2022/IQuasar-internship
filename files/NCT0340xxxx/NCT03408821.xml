  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a Problem Solving Therapy&#xD;
      intervention for the treatment of late life depression (LLD). Participants diagnosed with LLD&#xD;
      will participate in 8 weekly sessions of Problem Solving Therapy, a form of talk-therapy,&#xD;
      over a period of eight weeks. A Case Manager (CM) trained in this therapy will lead the PST&#xD;
      sessions. Participants will attend a clinical assessment pre and post study intervention to&#xD;
      assess depression severity, quality of life, anxiety, insomnia, functional disability, and&#xD;
      participant's acceptability of the intervention. Additionally self-rated depression will be&#xD;
      collected weekly over 8 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a single-centre, open-label, longitudinal, pragmatic, pilot trial. Research&#xD;
      participants at this site will be 40 men and women between the ages of 60 and 85 who have&#xD;
      mild to moderate major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      primary, secondary and tertiary care centres in London, Ontario and surrounding areas. Study&#xD;
      participation will involve 10 study visits over a total of 10 weeks. This includes 8 weekly&#xD;
      sessions of case manager (CM) implemented Problem Solving Therapy (PST) over a period of 8&#xD;
      weeks and 2 clinical assessment visits pre and post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROBLEM-SOLVING THERAPY INTERVENTION: PST is a minimally invasive treatment. This&#xD;
      intervention will be taught in groups of approximately 10 individuals. The eight sessions of&#xD;
      CM implemented PST will involve psychotherapy also known as talk therapy between the CM's and&#xD;
      study participants in a group setting. Psychogeriatric interdisciplinary staff (CM's) i.e.&#xD;
      psychiatric nurses, social workers, occupational therapists, and recreation specialists who&#xD;
      have been previously trained in PST will function in the roles of facilitator, cofacilitator&#xD;
      and scribe. The roles can be shared amongst the professionals to build capacity in each role&#xD;
      or maintained over time if so desired. Sessions will be approximately one-and-a-half to two&#xD;
      hours in length and conducted at libraries in London, ON. The first meeting will be informal&#xD;
      in which the staff and potential group participants will be welcomed, introductions made,&#xD;
      group rules regarding confidentiality discussed, an overview of problem solving approach&#xD;
      described and the depression/problem solving cycle introduced. Participants will be told of&#xD;
      the relationship between effective problem solving and changes in feelings of depression and&#xD;
      anxiety. At the second meeting group participants will be welcomed to the initial problem&#xD;
      solving session, group rules of confidentiality reviewed again and then each of the&#xD;
      participants will be asked to describe important psychosocial aspects of their lives in the&#xD;
      previous week. Facilitation will be kept to a minimum with questions designed to encourage&#xD;
      further exploration of problems experienced. The staff person acting as the scribe shall make&#xD;
      notes of each participant's comments. Once all the group members have checked in, the scribe&#xD;
      shall summarize problems that have been mentioned. One of the participants will be then asked&#xD;
      to volunteer to act as the problem solver over the next week and if there is a particular&#xD;
      problem that they are interested in completing. Once a volunteer has identified the problem&#xD;
      it will be listed on a flipchart and the group shall take a ten minute break. After the&#xD;
      break, the problem will be discussed again to ensure that the correct problem has been&#xD;
      determined. Then the goal shall be listed on the flipchart and solutions to the problem will&#xD;
      be discussed. Once they are listed the group shall review each and note the reasons why this&#xD;
      is a good choice and the reasons why this may not be a good choice. Considerations include&#xD;
      effort required, time commitment, emotional impact, the need to involve others and&#xD;
      desirability from the participants perspective. Then the participant shall narrow the options&#xD;
      and make a decision about what solutions he/she will try in the next week. An action plan&#xD;
      will be then developed to achieve the solutions e.g. what is the first step, when will it be&#xD;
      made, any resources that are needed before beginning the problem solving. In addition, the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to engage in pleasant activities on a daily basis noting the date,&#xD;
      activity and rate how satisfied the activity made them feel on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0= Not&#xD;
      at all and 10=Super. At the third meeting, the facilitator shall ask the participant who&#xD;
      volunteered to solve a problem to report to the group first. That person would have made&#xD;
      notes about their experience and use these as a reference to report back to the group. Some&#xD;
      may make diagrams to describe their experience and share these with the group. Each session&#xD;
      shall continue using the above format and participants will be encouraged to volunteer at&#xD;
      least one time to practice the problem solving approach. As the group continues to meet,&#xD;
      there will be more peer support evident as the participants begin to know each other, realize&#xD;
      their common bonds and experience a sense of community within the group setting. The final&#xD;
      meeting will be a time to celebrate the accomplishments of the group, listing all of the&#xD;
      problems mentioned and those solved by the participants and an opportunity to share social&#xD;
      time together. Participants will be asked to complete a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)&#xD;
      at the beginning of the initial problem solving session and continue to do so at each&#xD;
      session. The facilitator shall comment on the changes in the scores and shall ask the&#xD;
      participants if their experience mirrors the scores, their anxiety and depression or not.&#xD;
      Each time point will provide an opportunity to remind the group of the depression - problem&#xD;
      solving cycle. The CM's will teach the participant's a structured approach to cope with and&#xD;
      resolve issues in the participant's life. Using the six stages of problem resolution&#xD;
      including: a) identifying and clarifying the problem b) setting clear achievable goals c)&#xD;
      brain-storming to generate solutions d) selecting a preferred solution e) clarifying steps to&#xD;
      implement solutions, and f) evaluation. Focus will be on issues the study participant&#xD;
      currently has in their life and not on problems from their past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING AND INITIAL ASSESSMENTS: Potential participants will be provided a Letter of&#xD;
      Information (LOI) and given at least 24 hours to review the letter. The Research Assistant&#xD;
      (RA) will then contact potential participants by phone and pre-screen these participants for&#xD;
      potential eligibility using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). This is essential so&#xD;
      that participants who will not be eligible do not unnecessarily travel to the hospital for&#xD;
      screening. Those participants who score a 0 on the PHQ-2 will not be invited to a screening&#xD;
      assessment. The screening assessment will begin with a review of the LOI, an opportunity for&#xD;
      the potential participant to ask any questions, and a signing of the LOI by both the&#xD;
      participant and a witness. Participants will then be screened as per inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria by the RA, administered a Mini Mental State Exam, section A of a Mini-International&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), and a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17).&#xD;
      Participants meeting eligibility criteria at this point will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      this study. This initial assessment shall also include administration of a Cumulative Illness&#xD;
      Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G), EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 level (EQ-5D-5L), Athena Insomnia&#xD;
      Scale, World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2 (WHODAS-2), and a&#xD;
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). Following the final PST session participants will be&#xD;
      asked to return for a final assessment with the RA. This post intervention assessment will&#xD;
      include a HAM-D17, EQ-5D-5L, Athens Insomnia Scale, WHODAS-2, a GAD-7, and a likert scale to&#xD;
      measure acceptability. At each PST session the CM's will ask participant's to complete a&#xD;
      Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess changes in depressive symptoms. These&#xD;
      questionnaires will be provided to the RA by the CM's following completion of the group's&#xD;
      intervention, so that this data can be included in the studies final report. Following the&#xD;
      first groups and last groups completion a focus group will be conducted. This focus group&#xD;
      will collect qualitative data to determine long-term sustainability of PST for seniors in&#xD;
      London, ON and surrounding area. The focus group will be lead by a research staff member who&#xD;
      has experience with focus group interviews and qualitative study design.&#xD;

    <description>The European Quality of Life (EQ-5D-5L) scale will be used to assess the quality of life of study participants. This scale has two scores; the descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system consists of 5 questions each with 5 possible answers allowing for 5 possible health states. A score of 1 indicates no problems with the 5 measured dimensions, while a score of 5 would indicate the most severe possible state for each dimension. The descriptive system includes 5 sub-scores ranging from 1 (no issues) to 5 (severe problems), which will be converted to a specific single index value. The EQ VAS consists of only one question ranging from 0 (worst possible state of health) to 100 (best possible state of health).This assessment will be completed pre and post study intervention.</description>
