  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) among patients presenting with&#xD;
      diarrhea and bloating as their chief complaints is not well studied. Diarrhea and or bloating&#xD;
      can be due to different etiologies such as celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome.&#xD;
      However, concomitant EPI can exacerbate these conditions, or be the main cause of the&#xD;
      symptoms. Furthermore, some of these diagnoses can be epiphenomena or consequences of EPI.&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesize that EPI will be detected in significant proportion of patients&#xD;
      with bloating or diarrhea and that early detection and management of EPI can prevent&#xD;
      unnecessary work up for other causes of diarrhea.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) diagnosis can be challenging due to several reasons.&#xD;
      First, the main symptoms of EPI such as diarrhea, loose stool, bloating or weight loss have&#xD;
      low specificity because they could be associated with many other conditions such as IBS or&#xD;
      celiac disease. Second, EPI could be found concomitantly as an exacerbating factor with other&#xD;
      causes of diarrhea and bloating leading to incomplete treatment and increased patient&#xD;
      dissatisfaction due to partial resolution of symptoms. Although the prevalence of EPI in&#xD;
      general population is not well known, a recent population study in 914 patients from Norway&#xD;
      showed up to 10% prevalence of EPI using the measurement of fecal elastase-1 level in&#xD;
      elderly. In another study, the prevalence of EPI diagnosed by low fecal elastase-1 in 314&#xD;
      patients with chronic diarrhea who satisfied the Rome II criteria for irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome diarrhea (IBS-D) was 6.1%.Furthermore, an EPI prevalence of 4.4% (diagnosed by low&#xD;
      fecal elastase-1) was documented in 90 patients who had serological and histological evidence&#xD;
      of celiac disease. Interestingly, MRI was normal in all patients diagnosed with EPI in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard tests for diagnosing EPI is three-day fecal fat quantification and&#xD;
      determination of the coefficient of fat absorption. The patient is required to keep an intake&#xD;
      of 100g of fat for five days and then collect feces for a time period of three days. Direct&#xD;
      measurement of pancreatic function test with secreting stimulation is another sensitive test.&#xD;
      . However these tests are cumbersome to apply to large number of patients with common&#xD;
      complaints. Spot fecal elastase-1 measurement using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#xD;
      has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific in diagnosing moderate to severe chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis in several studies. The favorable operating characteristics combined with the&#xD;
      ease of using of the test makes it a good initial screening test for EPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary data indicate that a large proportion (10 %) of patients with undiagnosed&#xD;
      bloating and or diarrhea have EPI initially detected by low fecal elastase-1 and subsequently&#xD;
      confirmed with Endoscopic Ultrasound and or direct measurement of pancreatic function tests.&#xD;
      Therefore, Investigators propose to test the hypothesis that including fecal elastase-1 as&#xD;
      part of the initial work-up for patients presenting with diarrhea and or bloating will&#xD;
      identify patients who are confirmed EPI and may benefit from pancreatic enzyme replacement&#xD;
      therapy and limit further unnecessary work up.&#xD;

        Study Population ages 18-80 will be recruited from St. Luke Baylor's Clinic during their&#xD;
        clinic visit. Patients will receive full complete details about the research protocol and&#xD;
        then will receive a consent form with all steps taken in details for the research.&#xD;
        Participating in this research will be voluntary and if the patient decides to participate&#xD;
        in the research they will need to sign and date the consent form. Patients to be recruited&#xD;
        during the clinic visits are patients of the PI and/or of the Co-Investigators in this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
