  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are limited evidence-based treatments for adolescents with binge eating and fewer&#xD;
      specifically targeting adolescents with both binge eating and overweight/obesity. The&#xD;
      existing research for adolescents with overweight/obesity and loss of control (LOC) eating&#xD;
      supports a stepped-care model of treatment in which enhanced behavioral weight loss treatment&#xD;
      is the first line of treatment followed by more intensive therapeutic treatment for&#xD;
      individuals with remaining emotional eating difficulties. Thus, in this proposed study, the&#xD;
      investigators will systematically develop a stepped-care protocol and manualized&#xD;
      interventions for adolescents with LOC and binge eating behaviors. The investigators will&#xD;
      then evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the interventions in a pilot trial and&#xD;
      gather preliminary outcome data to inform development of a subsequent randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Binge eating affects a significant number of adolescents. Among adolescents seeking obesity&#xD;
      treatment, rates of binge eating behavior range from 20-36%. Studies of non-treatment seeking&#xD;
      adolescents have also identified high rates of binge eating, suggesting that this behavior is&#xD;
      not exclusive to clinical samples. Moreover, as in adults, binge eating in youth is&#xD;
      associated with numerous psychosocial problems, including depression, anxiety, low&#xD;
      self-esteem, body dissatisfaction and weight concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stepped-care models provide a lower intensity treatment and modify subsequent treatment&#xD;
      intensity based on early treatment response. A stepped-care model would build upon the&#xD;
      clinical treatment resources already established at the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will conduct a small pilot of the stepped-care model. All&#xD;
      participants will begin with the same initial treatment, an introductory behavioral weight&#xD;
      loss group for parents and adolescents with abnormal weight gain and/or overweight/obesity.&#xD;
      Early responders will continue in this treatment for an additional 12 weeks. Participants who&#xD;
      show a weaker early response will be assigned to a higher intensity individualized treatment.&#xD;
      All participants will receive 16 weeks of treatment.Assessments will occur at three time&#xD;
      points: prior to intervention (baseline), mid-treatment (4 weeks), and end of treatment (16&#xD;
      weeks). The investigators will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of the stepped care approach. These data will inform the development of a&#xD;
      subsequent RCT.&#xD;

    <description>This intervention is grounded in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The core elements include regulating eating patterns, self-monitoring, developing openness to an acceptance perspective, fostering a willingness to accept distress, teaching defusion from distressing thoughts and feelings, practicing mindful awareness, fostering self-as-context, and directing patients towards clarifying and focusing on life values. Self-monitoring of eating behaviors and emotions are encouraged using a free app that facilitates electronic self-monitoring of eating patterns and symptoms. For participants who elect not to use this app, paper self-monitoring records are provided.</description>
