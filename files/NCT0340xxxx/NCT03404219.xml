  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social impairment contributes to more severe symptoms, higher rates of hospitalization, and&#xD;
      increased disability in persons with schizophrenia. In this study the investigators will&#xD;
      develop a smartphone application and test its impact on improving real-world social&#xD;
      functioning in persons with schizophrenia. Findings from this study will allow researchers&#xD;
      and clinicians to better understand ways to improve social skills and social motivation, two&#xD;
      common problems in the daily lives of persons with schizophrenia. The investigators hope this&#xD;
      mobile phone-based support application will ultimately contribute to increased access to&#xD;
      effective treatments for social functioning in this population.&#xD;

      This project will involve an examination of the impact of a mobile intervention to improve&#xD;
      social functioning in schizophrenia using an evidence-based treatment framework to target&#xD;
      deficits in social skills and social motivation. Social impairment is a key characteristic of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, present prior to onset and predictive of long-term course. The approach of the&#xD;
      current project is to use Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI), administered by mobile&#xD;
      phone, to integrate features from social skills training (SST; an evidence-based treatment&#xD;
      for schizophrenia) with social motivation support to improve social functioning. Aim 1 of the&#xD;
      project will involve iterative development of the mobile application, using expert panel&#xD;
      input and conducting usability testing to inform intervention content and approach. As an&#xD;
      exploratory aim, social sensing technology (e.g., GPS and automated conversation detection)&#xD;
      will be implemented to test the promise of this technology in identifying and intervening in&#xD;
      social isolation. In Aim 2, 30 persons with schizophrenia will use the application over a&#xD;
      2-month period (data collection will occur across 2 sites). The investigators will test the&#xD;
      impact of the application on social motivation (EMA reports of social anticipatory pleasure&#xD;
      and presence of social interaction) across the intervention period. Investigators will also&#xD;
      examine the impact on social functioning, measured with standard clinician-administered&#xD;
      assessments, from baseline to 90-day follow-up. Additional clinical, neurocognitive, and&#xD;
      social cognitive assessments will be gathered on study participants to identify potential&#xD;
      moderators of outcome and predictors of application usability. This study will result in a&#xD;
      better understanding of the feasibility and initial impact of a scalable intervention&#xD;
      designed to support lasting, sustainable improvements in social functioning in schizophrenia.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Social Functioning as Measured by the Social Functioning Scale (SFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (study entry) and follow-up (3 months post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Functioning Scale (SFS; Birchwood, Smith, Cochrane, Wetton, and Copestake, 1990) is a validated measure of social functioning commonly used in schizophrenia research studies. This clinician-administered measure consists of 7 sub-scales where higher scores indicate better social functioning: Social Engagement/Withdrawal (7 items. Score range: 0-15), Interpersonal (5 items. Score range: 0-30), Prosocial (5 items. Score range: 0-66), Recreation (23 items. Score range: 0-48), Independence - competence (15 items. Score range: 0-39), Independence - performance (13 items. Score range: 0-39), and Employment (13 items. Score range is 0-6 if the participant is unemployed and 7-10 if the participant is employed). The total score is the sum of the 7 sub-scales (Possible range of 0-247) and higher scores indicate better functioning. The investigators will examine the difference in total score from baseline (study entry) to follow-up (3 months after study termination).</description>

    <measure>Changes in Social Engagement as Measured by the Quality of Life Scale (QLS) - Interpersonal Relations Subscale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (study entry) and follow-up (3 months post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Heinrich Quality of Life Scale - Interpersonal Relations subscale (Heinrichs, Hanlon, &amp; Carpenter, 1984) is a validated measure of social engagement used in studies of schizophrenia. This clinician-administered measure consists of 8 items that address different facets of social engagement (e.g., social network, acquaintances, intimate relationships, social withdrawal). Possible scores range from 0-48 with higher scores indicating better outcomes. The investigators will administer this measure at baseline (study entry) and follow-up (3 months post-intervention).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Experience-Sampling-Based Self-Reports of Social Appraisals</measure>
    <time_frame>2 times per day for 2 months (intervention period).</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will ask participants to report on positive social appraisals (unpublished measure) of recent interactions 2 times per day over the 2-month intervention period. Specific items and response options are the following:&#xD;
&quot;How well do you think you communicated in those conversations?&quot; (from 1 [I did not communicate well at all] to 4 [I communicated very well])&#xD;
&quot;To what extent were those interactions worth the effort?&quot; (from 1 [not worth the effort at all] to 4 [definitely worth the effort])&#xD;
&quot;What do you think other people thought of you in those conversations?&quot; with response options ranging from 1 [very unlikable] to 4 [very likable]) We will average scores on the above items across all available time points (total possible time points = 120) to form a composite variable representing social appraisals. Higher scores represent more positive appraisals. Investigators will examine changes in appraisals over the intervention.</description>

        <title>Changes in Social Functioning as Measured by the Social Functioning Scale (SFS)</title>
        <description>The Social Functioning Scale (SFS; Birchwood, Smith, Cochrane, Wetton, and Copestake, 1990) is a validated measure of social functioning commonly used in schizophrenia research studies. This clinician-administered measure consists of 7 sub-scales where higher scores indicate better social functioning: Social Engagement/Withdrawal (7 items. Score range: 0-15), Interpersonal (5 items. Score range: 0-30), Prosocial (5 items. Score range: 0-66), Recreation (23 items. Score range: 0-48), Independence - competence (15 items. Score range: 0-39), Independence - performance (13 items. Score range: 0-39), and Employment (13 items. Score range is 0-6 if the participant is unemployed and 7-10 if the participant is employed). The total score is the sum of the 7 sub-scales (Possible range of 0-247) and higher scores indicate better functioning. The investigators will examine the difference in total score from baseline (study entry) to follow-up (3 months after study termination).</description>

        <title>Changes in Social Engagement as Measured by the Quality of Life Scale (QLS) - Interpersonal Relations Subscale.</title>
        <description>The Heinrich Quality of Life Scale - Interpersonal Relations subscale (Heinrichs, Hanlon, &amp; Carpenter, 1984) is a validated measure of social engagement used in studies of schizophrenia. This clinician-administered measure consists of 8 items that address different facets of social engagement (e.g., social network, acquaintances, intimate relationships, social withdrawal). Possible scores range from 0-48 with higher scores indicating better outcomes. The investigators will administer this measure at baseline (study entry) and follow-up (3 months post-intervention).</description>

        <title>Changes in Experience-Sampling-Based Self-Reports of Social Appraisals</title>
        <description>The investigators will ask participants to report on positive social appraisals (unpublished measure) of recent interactions 2 times per day over the 2-month intervention period. Specific items and response options are the following:&#xD;
&quot;How well do you think you communicated in those conversations?&quot; (from 1 [I did not communicate well at all] to 4 [I communicated very well])&#xD;
&quot;To what extent were those interactions worth the effort?&quot; (from 1 [not worth the effort at all] to 4 [definitely worth the effort])&#xD;
&quot;What do you think other people thought of you in those conversations?&quot; with response options ranging from 1 [very unlikable] to 4 [very likable]) We will average scores on the above items across all available time points (total possible time points = 120) to form a composite variable representing social appraisals. Higher scores represent more positive appraisals. Investigators will examine changes in appraisals over the intervention.</description>
