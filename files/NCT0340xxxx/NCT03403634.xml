    <textblock>
      This early phase IIA trial studies how well celecoxib, recombinant interferon alfa-2b, and&#xD;
      rintatolimod work in treating patients with colorectal cancer that as spread to the liver.&#xD;
      Celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a substance that can improve the body's natural&#xD;
      response and may interfere with the growth of tumor cells. Rintatolimod may stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system. Giving celecoxib, recombinant interferon alfa-2b, and rintatolimod may work&#xD;
      better at treating colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the impact of a chemokine-modulatory regimen on the immune microenvironment&#xD;
      of colorectal liver metastases, specifically the changes in the ratio between cytotoxic&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte (CTL) marker (CD8a gene expression) to regulatory T cell (Treg) markers (FoxP3&#xD;
      gene expression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the objective response rate of a chemokine-modulatory regimen in metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Examine the safety and tolerability profile of the combination of recombinant interferon&#xD;
      alfa-2b (interferon alpha-2b), rintatolimod, and celecoxib when given as chemokine modulation&#xD;
      to colorectal cancer patients prior to surgical resection using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation&#xD;
      Program (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE version 4.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the median progression free survival of a chemokine-modulatory regimen in&#xD;
           metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate overall survival in participants with recurrent and/or metastatic unresectable&#xD;
           colorectal cancer who received the chemokine-modulatory regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison (using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence [IF] and immunohistochemistry [IHC] on&#xD;
           serial sections) of the metastatic tissue specimen with regard to total numbers of&#xD;
           infiltrating T cells, their CD4/CD8 ratios, frequencies of FoxP3 cells, and the&#xD;
           expression of chemokine receptors on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (CXCR3, CCR5, CCR4, CCR6, and&#xD;
           CXCR4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the local expression of effector T cells (Teff)-attracting chemokines (CCR5,&#xD;
           CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) and Treg-favoring chemokines (CCL22 and CXCL12) using IF and&#xD;
           RT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), recombinant interferon alfa-2b&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes, and rintatolimod IV QD on days 1, 2,3,8,9,10,15,16 and 17&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
