    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicentre, Phase 3 study. Patients will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      Study drug or its comparator. The study will be blinded for the staff members in charge of&#xD;
      the endpoint assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be scheduled to receive a chemotherapy regimen with risk of febrile&#xD;
      neutropenia ≥20%. Study drug will be administered more than 24 hours after completion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and every 3 weeks with chemotherapy. Eligible patients scheduled to receive four&#xD;
      or six cycles of chemotherapy in every three weeks will be screened in the preceding 28± 3&#xD;
      days and will be randomized (1:1) to one of two treatment arms (Peg-Filgrastim of GEMA&#xD;
      BIOTECH, or Peg-Filgrastim of Roche).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 4 or 6 cycles of chemotherapy supported by Peg-Filgrastim will be administered&#xD;
      with an interval of three weeks between each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for 28± 3 days after the last dose of Peg-Filgrastim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematological assessment (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC]) will be assessed on day 1 or up to&#xD;
      -3 (before administration of anticancer chemotherapy), day 2 or 3 and 5 through 9 of the&#xD;
      first cycle, and thereafter every day until post-nadir ANC recovery to ≥ 1.5 x 109/l&#xD;
      following each cycle of chemotherapy. In the following cycles, hematological assessment shall&#xD;
      be performed on day 1 or up to -3 (before administration of anticancer chemotherapy), on day&#xD;
      2 or 3 and on days 5 and 7. This schedule only applies if the subject did not develop Severe&#xD;
      Neutropenia on the previous cycle. If the patient develops Severe Neutropenia on the first&#xD;
      cycle or at any cycle, then the schedule corresponding to first cycle shall be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During baseline (before the administration of Peg-Filgrastim), day 5 and day 9 following the&#xD;
      first cycle of chemotherapy CD34+ (cluster of differentiation) count will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening (up to 4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment period (6 cycles each of 3 weeks. i.e. a total of 18 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up period for safety (4 weeks after Peg-Filgrastim last dose)&#xD;
