  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to evaluate a rehabilitation program as treatment and uncover potential&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms of a newly identified chronic condition named &quot;Post Pulmonary&#xD;
      Embolism Syndrome&quot; (PPS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The newly identified Post Pulmonary Embolism Syndrome (PPS) is characterized by chronic&#xD;
      persistent, but unexplained dyspnea (i.e. without signs of pulmonary hypertension or&#xD;
      pulmonary abnormality). Symptoms are considerable, but less severe than in CTEPH patients. A&#xD;
      recent study performed by our group confirmed that up to 50% of our patients complained of&#xD;
      various grades of persistent unexplained dyspnea 1-10 years after the diagnosis of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multifaceted project we wish to evaluate the effect of an eight week rehabilitation&#xD;
      program led and supervised by a trained physiotherapist on exercise capacity in PPS patients.&#xD;
      This interventional part of the study will be formed as a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either usual care or a physiotherapist-supervised&#xD;
      rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also aims to explore potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in PPS,&#xD;
      using state of the art methods such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography involving novel methods focusing on the right ventricle. The&#xD;
      pathophysiological part of the study will be formed as a case control study, where post&#xD;
      PE-patients who do not fulfill the criteria for PPS will serve as controls.&#xD;
