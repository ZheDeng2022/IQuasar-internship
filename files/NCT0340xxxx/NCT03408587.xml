    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1b clinical study of ipilimumab in combination with intravenous&#xD;
      CVA21 in subjects who have uveal melanoma metastatic to liver. Subjects will receive up to 8&#xD;
      cycles of CVA21 at a planned dose of 1 x 10e9 TCID50 per infusion, with the first cycle being&#xD;
      a 28-day cycle consisting of an intravenous infusion on Days 1, 3, 5 and 8 and subsequent&#xD;
      cycles every 21 days from Day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab will be given by intravenous administration at a dose of 3mg/kg, for a maximum of&#xD;
      4 doses, given on Days 8, 29, 50 and 71. On days when both CVA21 and ipilimumab are given,&#xD;
      CVA21 will be given first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored for treatment toxicity using the current version of CTCAE.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Known sensitivity to any of the products or components to be administered during&#xD;
             dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participation in a study of an investigational agent or device within 4 weeks of Day&#xD;
             1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with any other concurrent, uncontrolled illness, including known psychiatric&#xD;
             or substance abuse disorders which may interfere with the ability of the subject to&#xD;
             cooperate and participate in the trial. Other examples of such conditions would&#xD;
             include unstable angina, myocardial infarction (MI) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA)&#xD;
             within 6 months of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with tumors lying close to an airway, major blood vessel or spinal cord that,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, could cause occlusion or compression in the case&#xD;
             of swelling, or erosion into a major vessel in the case of necrosis.&#xD;
