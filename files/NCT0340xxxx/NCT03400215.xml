  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of fat in breast cancer development and growth has been studied extensively using&#xD;
      body mass index, a measure of whole body fatness, and dietary fat intake in a number of&#xD;
      epidemiological studies. However, there is a paucity of studies, on an individual level, to&#xD;
      assess the role of breast fat itself in breast cancer due to lack of a non-invasive and fast&#xD;
      measurement method. Since breast fibroglandular cells are surrounded by breast fat cells, the&#xD;
      characteristics of breast fat may have a stronger relationship with breast cancer&#xD;
      development, as supported by recent studies showing that a majority of breast cancer develops&#xD;
      at the interface between fibroglandular tissue and adipose tissue. However, it is not trivial&#xD;
      to study the role of breast fat, mainly due to the lack of a non-invasive and fast&#xD;
      measurement method sensitive enough to important features of breast fat, such as types of&#xD;
      fat.Recently, we have developed a rapid MRI method, referred to as Gradient-echo&#xD;
      Spectroscopic Imaging (GSI), to measure fatty acid composition during clinical breast MRI&#xD;
      exams. GSI can provide map of saturated fat and unsaturated fats in the breast adipose tissue&#xD;
      without performing tissue biopsy. Our pilot study found that the postmenopausal women with&#xD;
      aggressive breast cancer, known as invasive ductal carcinoma, have a significantly higher&#xD;
      percentage of saturated fat in their breast adipose tissue than the postmenopausal women with&#xD;
      only benign lesions.&#xD;

      The overarching goal of this study is to determine the role of saturated fatty acid in breast&#xD;
      cancer development and growth. In this proposal, GSI will be used for non-invasive in vivo&#xD;
      measurement of saturated fat in the breast adipose tissue of postmenopausal women who undergo&#xD;
      diagnostic breast MRI exams (Aims 1 and 2) or MRI-guided biopsy scans (Aim 3). The central&#xD;
      hypotheses is that (i) the breast saturated fatty acid fraction measured by GSI is associated&#xD;
      with the presence of malignant lesions in the breast and (ii) the breast saturated fatty acid&#xD;
      fraction correlates positively with inflammation in the breast adipose tissue that may lead&#xD;
      to increase in estrogen production in adipocytes.The proposed study will evaluate whether&#xD;
      breast saturated fat is an independent risk factor for breast cancer, and whether it can&#xD;
      provide additional diagnostic information to current clinical diagnostic exams. In addition,&#xD;
      the proposed imaging measure of breast saturated fat can be used to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      any intervention to reduce cancer-related inflammation in the breast adipose tissue and to&#xD;
      investigate the possible role of fatty acid composition in prevention and clinical management&#xD;
      of breast cancer.&#xD;
