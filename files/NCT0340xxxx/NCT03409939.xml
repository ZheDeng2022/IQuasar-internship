  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phenylalanine and tyrosine are aromatic amino acids that people need to obtain in their&#xD;
      diets. Amino acids are the building blocks for protein, are are therefore required to form&#xD;
      tissues in the body. It is well known that pregnant women require more protein in their&#xD;
      diets, but the exact amount for each amino acid is undetermined. To find out how much of&#xD;
      phenylalanine and tyrosine pregnant women require, the investigators plan to study pregnant&#xD;
      women in early and late gestation with a modern minimally invasive technique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a study to determine phenylalanine requirements in pregnant women, the&#xD;
      investigator's purpose for this study is to determine the phenylalanine and tyrosine&#xD;
      requirements (also know as the total aromatic amino acid requirement) in healthy pregnant&#xD;
      women as part of a Doctoral Thesis project. The determined requirements can be taken into&#xD;
      account when giving dietary recommendations, to ensure healthy pregnancies. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the current recommendations for phenylalanine and tyrosine intake given to pregnant&#xD;
      women are underestimated. The investigators also hypothesize that the phenylalanine and&#xD;
      tyrosine requirements at early stages of pregnancy will be lower than the requirements&#xD;
      towards the later stages of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current dietary intake recommendations for the aromatic amino acids are based on factorial&#xD;
      (mathematical) calculations and do not account for requirement differences between early and&#xD;
      late pregnancy. Static recommendations throughout all stages of pregnancy are not appropriate&#xD;
      because of the multitude of adaptations the human body goes through during gestation. Whether&#xD;
      phenylalanine and tyrosine requirements differ between different stages of gestation is&#xD;
      unknown. The DRI gives a recommendation for total aromatic amino acids of 36 mg/kg/d during&#xD;
      pregnancy. The results from this study would allow for a more accurate recommendations in&#xD;
      future DRIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit healthy pregnant women aged 20 to 40 in their 13th-19th week&#xD;
      of gestation or 33rd to 39th week of gestation. Once they get in contact with the lab, an&#xD;
      initial visit (pre-study) will take place. Here, the participants will be measured for their&#xD;
      eligibility and taken through the consent form. They have to participate in a pre-study for&#xD;
      each stage of pregnancy, if they wish to participate in both stages. If they meet all the&#xD;
      criteria and agree to participate, they will return for up to four study days per stage of 8&#xD;
      hours each. Therefore, if they are recruited during late pregnancy they are only able to&#xD;
      participate in four study days in total. During these study days they will be fed protein&#xD;
      shakes containing the stable isotope, and then oxidation of this isotope will be measured to&#xD;
      determine a breakpoint (requirement) of phenylalanine. Breath samples, urine samples, and a&#xD;
      small blood sample will be taken during the study day.&#xD;
