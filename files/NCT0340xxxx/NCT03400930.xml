      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014, 50 million children under 5 suffered from acute malnutrition, of which 16 million&#xD;
      suffered from SAM, most of them living in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. SAM children&#xD;
      have higher risk of mortality (relative risk between 5 and 20). It is an underlying factor in&#xD;
      over 50% of the 10 - 11 million preventable deaths per year among children under five. At&#xD;
      present, 65 countries have implemented WHO recommendations for SAM treatment (both in-patient&#xD;
      for complicated cases and outpatient for uncomplicated cases) but these programs have very&#xD;
      low coverage, reaching only around 10 - 15 % of SAM children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009 the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)&#xD;
      issued a joint statement in an effort to harmonize the application of anthropometric criteria&#xD;
      for SAM diagnosis and monitoring in child aged 6 - 59 months; the statement presents&#xD;
      recommended cut-offs, and summarizes the rational for the adoption, of the following two&#xD;
      anthropometric criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Weight-for-Height Z-Score (WHZ): &quot;WHO and UNICEF recommend the use of a cut-off for&#xD;
           weight-for-height of below -3 standard deviations (SD) of the WHO standards to identify&#xD;
           infants and children as having SAM.&quot; Additionally, analysis of existing data show that&#xD;
           children with a WHZ &lt; -3 have a highly elevated risk of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC): &quot;WHO standards for the MUAC-for-age show that in a&#xD;
           well-nourished population there are very few children aged 6 - 59 months with a MUAC&#xD;
           less than 115 mm. Children with a MUAC less than 115 mm have a highly elevated risk of&#xD;
           death compared to those who are above. Thus it is recommended to [use] the cut-off point&#xD;
           [of] 115 mm to define SAM with MUAC.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To generate new evidence on pathophysiological process, nutritional needs and risks&#xD;
      associated with different types of anthropometric deficits in children under 5, in order to&#xD;
      optimize the diagnosis and treatment of SAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare nutritional status, metabolism, pathophysiological process and risks in&#xD;
           different types of SAM anthropometric diagnosis, with or without concomitant stunting&#xD;
           (growth retardation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the extent to which current SAM treatment is promoting recovery and healthy&#xD;
           growth in different categories of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the relevance of current discharge criteria used in nutrition programs and&#xD;
           their association with metabolic recovery, in different age groups and among those who&#xD;
           are stunted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test novel rapid tests of emerging biomarkers predicting long-term outcomes and&#xD;
           mortality risk in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wide range of supplementary information related to nutritional status, body composition,&#xD;
      metabolic and immune status, including emerging biomarkers of metabolic deprivation and&#xD;
      vulnerability, will be collected besides anthropometry during prospective observational&#xD;
      studies. They will be collected with minimum level of invasiveness, compatible with field&#xD;
      work requirements in the humanitarian context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Cross-sectional surveys. Phase 2: Prospective cohort studies involving SAM children&#xD;
      between 6 months and 5 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children admitted as SAM at the nutrition centers will be enrolled into the cohort. The&#xD;
      follow up duration will be at least three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of current hypotheses related to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. possible misdiagnosis of SAM made by MUAC or WHZ criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. varying degree of severity and need for admission to treatment of the different&#xD;
                types of diagnosis,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. underlying heterogeneity of the pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generation of new algorithms for the assessment and classification of malnourished&#xD;
           children, based on the combined use of emerging biomarkers and anthropometric measures,&#xD;
           or on the modification of anthropometric criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generation of new treatment paradigms based on the predictive value of biomarkers in&#xD;
           combination with traditional anthropometric measures. This will enable us to assess the&#xD;
           power of current treatment regimens to promote long-term weight gain and growth and will&#xD;
           allow us to tailor treatment to the physiological needs of the child.&#xD;

      DIAGNOSTIC DISCREPANCY&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to WHO experts, WHZ and MUAC can be used independently to indicate severe acute&#xD;
      malnutrition (WH. There is however a significant and sometimes huge discrepancy between these&#xD;
      two criteria: they do not usually identify the same children as acutely malnourished;&#xD;
      moreover when used as proxy indicator to assess a deteriorating nutritional situation at a&#xD;
      population level, these criteria do not report the same level of global acute malnutrition in&#xD;
      the same zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was reported that only about 40% of SAM cases identified by one indicator are also&#xD;
      diagnosed as such by the other. For example, among severely malnourished children&#xD;
      hospitalized in rural Kenya, 65.1% (486/746) of the WHZ -3 cases also had a MUAC &lt; 115 mm,&#xD;
      whereas 56% (489/873) of the MUAC &lt; 115 mm cases were also identified by WHZ &lt; -3. In that&#xD;
      study, 42.9% (489/1140) of the SAM cases were identified by both indicators. The discrepancy&#xD;
      between the two indicators can be even more extreme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fernandez et al. reported that among 34,937 children between the ages of 6 - 59 months from&#xD;
      39 nutritional surveys, 75% of the children with a WHZ &lt; -3 were not identified by a MUAC &lt;&#xD;
      115 mm. In Cambodia, this proportion was above 90%, whereas 80% of MUAC &lt; 115 mm were not&#xD;
      detected by WHZ &lt; - 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the time, caseloads defined by WHZ are much larger than by MUAC, but the contrary may&#xD;
      happen as well, especially in the younger age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROGRAMMATIC CONFUSION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such discrepancy generates important programmatic challenges and confusion. On the one hand,&#xD;
      a strategy where the diagnosis can be based on either indicator, as recommended by some&#xD;
      authors may unduly inflate the workload of nutritional rehabilitation programs, as the most&#xD;
      appropriate management of children identified by one indicator and not by the other is&#xD;
      uncertain. On the other hand, relying on only one of these indicators, e.g. using only MUAC &lt;&#xD;
      115 mm in community-based programs, may under-detect true acute malnutrition cases and result&#xD;
      in missed opportunities to treat a severe condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, however, the use of MUAC alone for admission has been discussed, and is&#xD;
      increasingly applied in a variety of contexts. In particular, more and more national&#xD;
      protocols for SAM management consider MUAC only management as programmatic option. The&#xD;
      national guidelines in Bangladesh, for example consider only low MUAC as an admission&#xD;
      criterion for uncomplicated SAM management, which by de facto excludes a vast majority of the&#xD;
      SAM children, those who have WHZ &lt; - 3 and MUAC ≥ 115mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many benefits of using MUAC exist: MUAC is predictive of death, easy to use, acceptable, and&#xD;
      favors community-based screening methods. Yet, as these two anthropometric tools select&#xD;
      different children for treatment, as outlined above, this complicates the programmatic&#xD;
      paradigm shift from admitting children using MUAC &lt; 115 mm and/or WHZ &lt; -3 to a new model&#xD;
      admitting children using MUAC &lt; 115 mm only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on context, up to 63-79% of children currently recommended for therapeutic feeding&#xD;
      with WHZ &lt; -3 and/or MUAC &lt; 115 mm would not be eligible if using MUAC &lt; 115 mm alone for&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To inform decision making regarding the use of MUAC as a standalone admission criterion in&#xD;
      nutrition programming, more information on the programmatic and clinical implications of&#xD;
      using MUAC alone is urgently needed. Despite WHO clearly highlighting the importance of this&#xD;
      anthropometric diagnostic heterogeneity, and requesting more investigation, very little has&#xD;
      been done so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary reports demonstrate demographic and anthropometric differences among children&#xD;
      identified by WHZ and MUAC: MUAC is more likely to identify children that are younger, female&#xD;
      and with concomitant stunting. These data have been used to suggest a role for MUAC to&#xD;
      identify children that are potentially more vulnerable or at a higher risk of death,&#xD;
      supporting the transition to a MUAC-only based admission criterion. Recent secondary analysis&#xD;
      of the clinical profile and outcomes of SAM children admitted to an outpatient SAM program in&#xD;
      Niger infirmed this hypothesis, by showing a similar vulnerability profile in SAM children&#xD;
      presenting with a MUAC &lt; 115 mm (with or without concomitant WHZ &lt;- 3) and in SAM children&#xD;
      with a MUAC ≥ 115mm, i.e. only with WHZ &lt; -3, who would not be considered for treatment in&#xD;
      case of MUAC-only programming. Furthermore, according to this study, and a similar one from a&#xD;
      SAM management program in South-Sudan, the anthropometric category of SAM children displaying&#xD;
      the highest vulnerability at admission and the worse treatment outcomes are those combining&#xD;
      MUAC &lt; 115mm and WHZ &lt; -3. These results are in line with previous observations from an&#xD;
      in-patient SAM management program in Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond the investigation of possible variations in mortality risks, all reviews of available&#xD;
      evidence on this issue highlight the need for robust research to further investigate the&#xD;
      physiological significance of the different anthropometric criteria and to better understand&#xD;
      how the clinical status and nutritional needs of the children are addressed over the course&#xD;
      of nutritional rehabilitation. A key issue is indeed that these two different indicators&#xD;
      identify different populations of children, the reason for which is unknown due to the lack&#xD;
      of a gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current hypotheses to explain the diagnosis discrepancy are that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WHZ&lt;-3 overestimates the diagnosis of acute malnutrition in populations with a slender&#xD;
           morphology (i.e. with a low sitting-to-standing-height ratio; SSR) as observed in&#xD;
           pastoralists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MUAC at a fixed cut-off overestimate SAM in the younger children, in girls and in the&#xD;
           stunted children, and on the contrary underestimates SAM in older, male, and non-stunted&#xD;
           children. Young age, being a girl and stunting are indeed factors known to be associated&#xD;
           with lower MUAC measurements and were already shown to be independently associated with&#xD;
           MUAC diagnosis: lesser levels of acute nutritional deficits and wasting might thus be&#xD;
           necessary to reach the 115mm cut-off in these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These hypotheses have recently been supported by the analysis of the strength of the&#xD;
      association between these factors and the diagnosis discrepancy in nutritional&#xD;
      cross-sectional surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHZ and MUAC criteria also may identify a separate kind of physiological deficit. It has been&#xD;
      hypothesized that this might be related to differing impairments of fat and muscle mass&#xD;
      stores, with MUAC reflecting preferentially fat mass for some authors and muscle mass for&#xD;
      others. An analysis of body composition in a cohort of Ethiopian infants recently confirmed&#xD;
      WHZ as a good marker of tissue masses independent of length, while MUAC appeared more as a&#xD;
      composite index of poor growth indexing jointly tissue masses and length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children identified by different criteria may thus require different treatment, one that is&#xD;
      tailored to nutritional deficit. For instance, lower anthropometric response to treatment&#xD;
      (lower MUAC gain and weight gain, longer treatment duration and higher proportion of&#xD;
      non-responders) has already been observed in younger, stunted girls identified by MUAC. This&#xD;
      might be linked to a suboptimal response in less severely wasted children, or might be due to&#xD;
      a higher proportion of false positives in this sub-population, or be an indicator that the&#xD;
      treatment is less effective or required in such children. Also, a recent meta-analysis of&#xD;
      follow-up datasets evidenced a dramatic increase in mortality risk in children combining low&#xD;
      WHZ and stunting (MUAC was not factored in).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, in the absence of a gold standard for SAM, it is difficult to interpret different and&#xD;
      often divergent anthropometric diagnoses. Additionally, there is a vital need to better&#xD;
      understand if and how far physiological recovery, beyond anthropometric growth (which might&#xD;
      be transient or sub-optimal) is achieved under the current SAM management strategy. Moreover,&#xD;
      this understanding should encompass the whole population of children affected by&#xD;
      anthropometric deficit, beyond just those few complicated cases that reach the hospital for&#xD;
      inpatient nutritional rehabilitation. It should also account for potential contextual&#xD;
      variation in the link between anthropometry and nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to describe and compare nutritional needs and risks associated with the different&#xD;
      types of diagnosis as they are present in the community, we propose to conduct prospective&#xD;
      cohort studies of SAM children who will be detected and referred to treatment in the&#xD;
      catchment areas of community-based acute malnutrition management programs. Such programs&#xD;
      combine both outpatient and inpatient nutritional rehabilitation, and an effective community&#xD;
      outreach component. Nutritional needs and risks will be evaluated using a range of&#xD;
      indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  proxy indicators of nutritional, metabolic and immune status, among which several&#xD;
           biomarkers whose association with risk of death has been recently evidenced in SAM&#xD;
           children;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical characteristics; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  response to treatment in terms of cure rates, recovery speed, relapse. The indicators&#xD;
           necessary to do so must be easy to collect with low invasiveness and should provide&#xD;
           reliable information regarding the severity of nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ISOTOPIC EVALUATION OF HAIR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isotopic analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen in human hair can be investigated and&#xD;
      measured throughout the course of nutritional deprivation to reconstruct the onset and&#xD;
      duration of undernourishment as well as tracing the temporal evolution of nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have revealed that factors like diet, disease and injury can influence&#xD;
      nitrogen isotope ratios (d15N) in human tissues. Specifically, d15N values reflect the&#xD;
      nitrogen balance of an organism in that during a catabolic state (tissue breakdown) d15N&#xD;
      values increase while during an anabolic state (tissue buildup) d15N values decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, carbon isotope ratios (d13C) are shown to decrease during catabolism and&#xD;
      increase during anabolism. Thus, during starvation the body becomes enriched in 15N and&#xD;
      depleted in 13C at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since keratin remains unchanged after synthesis, and the speed of hair growth is constant&#xD;
      (around 2.5 mm per week), weekly information on protein-energy metabolism can be traced back&#xD;
      along the hair follicle, thereby indicating not only the severity of the episode of wasting&#xD;
      but also the metabolic effects of the nutritional rehabilitation (on both lipid and protein&#xD;
      anabolism). Isotopic evaluation of stable carbon and nitrogen in hair will therefore be used&#xD;
      to create a retrospective timeframe of nutritional status and trace the physiological&#xD;
      recovery of children during SAM management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEPTIN AND IL-6&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study using non-targeted metabolomics analysis to characterize changes a broad array&#xD;
      of hormones, cytokines, growth factors and metabolites during the treatment of SAM has&#xD;
      revealed that a major biochemical predictive factor for mortality is low-level leptin. Low&#xD;
      leptin and interleukin 6 levels reflect the adequacy of fat stores. Depletion of white&#xD;
      adipose stores is postulated to limit the ability of a child to sustain energy production&#xD;
      during the course of the illness and thereby increase the child's risk of death.&#xD;
      Alternatively, hypoleptinemia may reduce viability affecting glucose and energy homeostasis&#xD;
      or immune competence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leptin and interleukin 6 targeted analysis will therefore be used to create a metabolic&#xD;
      profile of SAM patients at presentation and during nutritional rehabilitation, and may&#xD;
      predict mortality prior to and during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Michael Freemark and colleagues at DUMC are currently developing novel point-of-care&#xD;
      micro-assays to characterize the hormonal status of leptin and interleukin 6 in SAM children&#xD;
      from a single fingerstick that will be piloted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MICRONUTRIENT AND IMMUNE RESPONSE BIOMARKERS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deficiencies of vitamin A and iron are among the most common micronutrient deficiencies&#xD;
      related to childhood undernutrition and are both linked to compromised immune function.&#xD;
      Manifestations of isolated iron deficiency include anemia, fatigue, impaired cognitive&#xD;
      development and reduced growth and physical strength. Vitamin A deficiency contributes to&#xD;
      anemia by immobilizing iron in the reticuloendothelial system, reducing hemopoiesis and&#xD;
      increasing susceptibility to infections; it is essential for the functioning of the immune&#xD;
      system and its deficiency has been clearly shown to be associated with diarrhea and related&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin A deficiency has been evidenced as frequent in SAM children. Vitamin A status,&#xD;
      measured by the surrogate marker RBP, has been shown to be low in SAM children and to rise&#xD;
      during nutritional rehabilitation. Mean serum vitamin A has been shown to decrease with&#xD;
      increasing stunting (HAZ), wasting (WHZ) and underweight (WAZ). Additionally, there are&#xD;
      indications that the storage levels of iron in SAM children are increased not decreased, even&#xD;
      in the presence of quite severe anemia. However, there is a major lack of evidence on this&#xD;
      point; we know that these parameters also need to be adjusted for inflammation biomarker,&#xD;
      anemia and malaria, which was not done in the studies mentioned by Golden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune response biomarkers like C-reactive protein (CRP) are elevated in SAM children with&#xD;
      severe bacterial infections. CRP is therefore a potentially valuable clinical tool for&#xD;
      identifying bacterial infections, and recent research has shown that a rapid CRP could be&#xD;
      useful in field settings to identify children most at risk for dying, with a relatively good&#xD;
      negative predictive value (81% sensitivity, 85% specificity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to evaluate the relationship between micronutrient status, immune response&#xD;
      and anthropometric diagnosis of SAM children at and to examine the extent to which&#xD;
      nutritional rehabilitation is effective in treating deficiencies of vitamin A and iron and to&#xD;
      prevent deficiencies during catch up growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An inexpensive and sensitive simple sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#xD;
      technique was recently developed to measure indicators of vitamin A and iron deficiency. Due&#xD;
      to the low cost, high throughput, and comparability to traditional tests, this procedure has&#xD;
      several advantages for assessing vitamin A and iron status on the field. Moreover, it can&#xD;
      easily be combined with the measurement of immune response biomarkers like CRP and α1-acid&#xD;
      glycoprotein (AGP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRP, AGP, as well as biomarkers of iron (serum ferritin and serum transferrin receptor) and&#xD;
      vitamin A status (serum retinol binding protein) can be assessed in a few drops of capillary&#xD;
      blood. CRP and AGP will be used to adjust for the effect of inflammation on the micronutrient&#xD;
      status indicators. Inflammation is indeed known to elevate serum ferritin and depress retinol&#xD;
      binding protein as part of the biological acute phase response to inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      URINE TESTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of ketones in the urine, indicating lipid catabolism (fat tissue disintegration&#xD;
      and rapid weight loss) was evidenced during fasting and SAM. Metabolic status for SAM&#xD;
      children at the time of enrollment in CMAM has been characterized by ketonemia; yet,&#xD;
      lipolysis decreases in response to nutritional rehabilitation suggested by total ketones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, biomarkers of urinary infections like urinary nitrites and urinary leucocyte&#xD;
      esterase (LE) have also been shown to be associated with an increased mortality risk in SAM&#xD;
      children. Positive dipstick urinalysis administered as a bedside screening test for either&#xD;
      nitrates or LE is associated with a higher case fatality and was shown to be a strong&#xD;
      predictor of mortality in children admitted with SAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-sterile urine sample will be also carried out when possible, and these biological&#xD;
      parameters will be measured using through the urinary multiple indicator strips (e.g. Roche&#xD;
      laboratory, or Combi Screen of Analyticon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE (BI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that different anthropometric diagnoses identify children with&#xD;
      different body composition, and associated nutritional needs. Restoration of body composition&#xD;
      indicates successful management of SAM. Bioelectral impedance (BI) is a safe, rapid and easy&#xD;
      technique often used to assess body composition, predicting total body water (TBW) in&#xD;
      non-edematous children. It has demonstrated utility for indexing acute changes in hydration&#xD;
      in children with SAM during in-patient treatment. This technique could also potentially&#xD;
      distinguish tissue versus hydration relates weight catch-up during or post treatment. Lastly,&#xD;
      BI analysis may predict survival outcomes for children hospitalized for SAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BI parameters will therefore be used to describe body composition at admission and the&#xD;
      restoration of body composition throughout nutritional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of three prospective follow-up studies (Bangladesh, Burkina Faso and&#xD;
      Liberia) including cohorts of SAM children between 6 and 59 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be recruited according to the current WHO recommended anthropometric criteria&#xD;
      for SAM diagnosis, WHZ and MUAC. Clinical examination, interviews with caregivers and blood&#xD;
      and hair samples will be collected at admission and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective follow-up cohort studies will be nested into currently operational&#xD;
      Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programs run with the technical&#xD;
      support of ACF-France, in hospitals and primary health-care centers involved in SAM&#xD;
      management. All participants will be treated according to the standard of care outlined in&#xD;
      the national protocol for SAM management of the country; this included a medical examination&#xD;
      and standard treatment for infections as well as hospital referral for any complications&#xD;
      requiring medical attention. The follow-up duration for enrolled SAM cases will be three&#xD;
      months at minimum. Each individual cohort study will last approximately one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study design is multi-centric, and will be conducted in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso and&#xD;
      Indonesia to account for potential contextual variation in the link between anthropometry and&#xD;
      nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The various biomarkers assessed in this study, alongside anthropometry and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, at admission and follow-up times, can be grouped into the following three&#xD;
      main groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Biomarkers of micronutrient deficiencies: (1) iron status biomarkers like serum ferritin&#xD;
           and serum transferrin receptor; (2) vitamin A status biomarkers like retinol binding&#xD;
           protein; and (3) vitamin C in the urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biomarkers and indicators of body composition and energy metabolism: (1) urinary&#xD;
           ketones; (2) natural enrichment of nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes in hair; and (3)&#xD;
           circulating leptin and IL-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Biomarkers of non-specific immune response or urinary infections: (1) c-reactive protein&#xD;
           level; (2) urinary nitrites; and (3) urinary leucocytes esterase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUESTIONNAIRES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection sheets, hereafter referred to as case report forms (CRF) will be linked to&#xD;
      the patient's information by his or her unique study ID number. All data will be collected by&#xD;
      trained ACF research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline questionnaire will be administered upon admission by means of a structured&#xD;
      interview with the caregiver. The interview content includes socioeconomic indicators, family&#xD;
      size, income, expenditure as well as the medical history of the child (including changes in&#xD;
      the child's weight, quantity and quality of food consumed and global health status). This&#xD;
      questionnaire will include changes in the child's weight, quantity and quality of food&#xD;
      consumed and overall health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each weekly visit, caregivers will answer a morbidity questionnaire (regarding fever,&#xD;
      diarrhea, respiratory infection, and appetite) over the past week. Additionally, the&#xD;
      caregiver will be asked to score the child's health status using a visual analog scale (VAS),&#xD;
      table 4 the VAS is a psychometric response scale used in questionnaires to measure subjective&#xD;
      characteristics or attitudes that cannot otherwise be directly measured (&quot;Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale,&quot; 2015). The use of a VAS in the assessment of severity of illness has been shown to be&#xD;
      a strong predictor of mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will be compared to the patient's nutritional progress to assess the relationship&#xD;
      between maternal health perception and nutritional indicators of recovery. Additional&#xD;
      questions will probe adherence to treatment ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) on a weekly&#xD;
      basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANTHROPOMETRY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight, height, MUAC, edema, will be measured weekly in all children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg with an electronic SECA scale, which will allow&#xD;
      for simultaneous weighing of caregiver and patient. A standard weight of 5-10 kg will be used&#xD;
      for daily calibration of the scale, and it will be stabilized on wooden plank to ensure the&#xD;
      scale stays in a horizontal position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length and height will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with a UNICEF model wooden height&#xD;
      board with graduated index strips in millimeters on each side. A standardized length stick&#xD;
      will be used to check the accuracy of the equipment. Children less than 2 years of age will&#xD;
      be measured lying down and older children will be measured standing up. In case the age&#xD;
      cannot be verified, children less than 87cm will be measured lying down. Children above 2&#xD;
      years of age, or above 87 cm who are not able to stand, will be measured lying, and 0.7 cm&#xD;
      will be subtracted the recumbent length during data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MUAC will be measured with a non-stretchable MUAC tape on the left arm to the nearest&#xD;
      millimeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry will be measured and recorded twice. Measurements will be repeated by the same&#xD;
      person and directly after each other to minimize discomfort for the child. The measurer will&#xD;
      read out loud his measurement, which will then be repeated by the assistant who will record&#xD;
      the results. In case of large differences between the measurements, the procedure will be&#xD;
      repeated. All measuring tools will be calibrated and checked daily for accuracy and replaced&#xD;
      if needed. To quantify the inter-measurer error, as part of training and refresher training&#xD;
      programs, anthropometry measurements will be repeated by a second person. This procedure will&#xD;
      be done on a small sample of children and will take place at the beginning, mid-way and end&#xD;
      of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND EDEMA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of bilateral pitting edema of nutritional origin will be assessed by applying normal&#xD;
      thumb pressure on the tops of both feet for three seconds. In the presence of edema (a&#xD;
      remnant impression remains for some time, where the fluid has been temporarily pressed out of&#xD;
      the tissue) the same procedure will be repeated on the lower legs, hands. Generalized, severe&#xD;
      edema can be observed sacral pad and face (forehead, eyelids). The degree of edema&#xD;
      generalization will be recorded according to WHO categorization of edema severity outlined in&#xD;
      the guidelines for the management of severe acute malnutrition in children 6 to 59 months of&#xD;
      age with edema, presented in table 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurse will conduct a weekly clinical assessment of the child (i.e. temperature,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, pulse rate, diarrhea, vomiting, and malaria). Symptoms, diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatments prescribed will be recorded. The clinical assessment will also serve to monitor&#xD;
      the development of medical complications requiring inpatient care. Any serious adverse&#xD;
      effects or development of medical complications will be immediately reported to the study&#xD;
      supervisor and the child will be referred for inpatient treatment if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLOOD SAMPLES AND ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since no laboratory in the study area performs all the desired analyses required, the samples&#xD;
      must be exported for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serum sample of 0.5 mL of serum from baseline and at two weeks and two months after&#xD;
      nutritional rehabilitation will be sent to Dr. Juergen Ehardt at VitMin Laboratory in&#xD;
      Wilstaett, Germany for the following analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a1-acid glycoprotein (AGP),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum ferritin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retinol Binding Protein (RBP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Soluble Transferrin Receptor (sTfR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A duplicate serum sample will be kept in the event that the first sample is lost or destroyed&#xD;
      during transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum RBP will be used to assess vitamin A status. Serum ferritin and sTfR will be used to&#xD;
      assess iron status. Additionally, the two acute phase reactants, CRP and AGP, will be&#xD;
      measured and used to adjust for the effect of inflammation on the micronutrient status&#xD;
      indicators. These five proteins will be measured using a specialized ELISA kit which analyses&#xD;
      all five components simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAIR SAMPLES AND ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single lock of 20 - 25 hair follicles will be shaved at the back of the skull at admission&#xD;
      and throughout treatment to both retrospectively characterize the nature and magnitude of&#xD;
      metabolic deficits at admission; and also the efficacy of treatment in correcting them. Hair&#xD;
      samples will be sent to Dr. Jean-Francois Huneau and Dr. Helene Fouillet at the Human Biology&#xD;
      and Nutrition Laboratory at AgroParisTech in Paris, France. Hair samples will be&#xD;
      sub-sectioned into 2.5 mm samples and analyzed for d13C and d15N through EA-IRM analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      URINE SAMPLES AND ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Freshly voided, clean catch urine samples will be tested using reagent test strips (e.g.&#xD;
      Multistix) at admission and at the end of treatment to assess biomarkers of urinary&#xD;
      infections, urinary nitrites and urinary LE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      BI parameters will be measures using a NutriGuard-S (DataInput, Germany) using protocols&#xD;
      described elsewhere. Self-adhesive disposable electrodes will be attached to the right hand&#xD;
      and foot. Measurements will be taken in triplicate, each spaced 5 minutes apart, while&#xD;
      children are supine with limbs abducted from the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      All questionnaire data and measurements will be measured on paper print-outs. The field&#xD;
      supervisor will digitize, back-up and share data with the project coordinator at least&#xD;
      weekly. Appropriate consistency checks and completeness rules will be applied to all data&#xD;
      templates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements will be standardized using the ENA SMART software standardization&#xD;
      tools; additionally, regular supervision and refresher training workshops will be organized&#xD;
      to maintain the highest quality data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to a digital database, paper forms including the date, the patient's and&#xD;
      caregiver's name, study ID, age, length and height at admission will be produced at&#xD;
      enrollment. These forms will be kept at each health center and new anthropometric values will&#xD;
      be added at each visit to track the child's health progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field tables for anthropometric conversion to z-scores will be available at all health&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maximize the follow-up rate, all participants will be registered in a digital logbook (for&#xD;
      example using Epidata) where each visit will be registered with the date of attendance.&#xD;
      Weekly lists of expected participants will be produced and printed for reminder calls.&#xD;
      Participants who do not show up at the health center will be contacted per telephone, and if&#xD;
      not successful, a team of community health workers will try to trace the family at the home&#xD;
      address and encourage them to go to the health center for continuation of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be analyzed using STATA Data Analysis and Statistical Software version 13&#xD;
      (StataCorp, College Station; Lakeway, Texas, U.S.A.).&#xD;
