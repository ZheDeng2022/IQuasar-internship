  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to characterize changes in gluten-specific T cells and&#xD;
      pathology in the small intestine with specific focus on biomarkers likely to change with&#xD;
      therapeutic celiac disease (CeD) treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gluten challenge studies are used to test the effectiveness of therapies designed to prevent&#xD;
      immune response to gluten in participants with CeD. The study will enroll approximately 20&#xD;
      participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Gluten 3 gm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Gluten 10 gm&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take an oral dose of gluten at the same time on Days 1 to&#xD;
      14 throughout the study. This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The&#xD;
      overall time to participate in this study is 10 weeks. Participants will visit to the clinic&#xD;
      on Day -45 and will be contacted for follow-up assessment on Days 15 to 42.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Small Intestine Histology Based on Villous Height to Crypt Depth (Vh:Cd) Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Attenuation of the effects of gluten exposure was assessed by measuring the change from baseline in villous height (Vh) to crypt depth (Cd) ratio after 15 days of gluten challenge. Villi were the small finger like projections that line the small intestine and promote nutrient absorption and are often shortened in participants with CeD. Crypts were grooves between the villi that are often elongated in participants with CeD. A decreased Vh:Cd ratio indicates more extreme CeD disease symptoms. Baseline values was defined as the last observed value before the first dose of gluten.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Small Intestine Histology Based on Intraepithelial Lymphocytes (IEL) Counts</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>IELs are white blood cells (WBCs) interspersed between epithelial cells of the small and large intestine where they function to preserve the integrity of the mucosal barrier by protecting the epithelium against pathogen or immune-induced pathology. Increased IELs count indicated more extreme CeD disease symptoms. Baseline values was defined as the last observed value before the first dose of gluten.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation Coefficient Changes Between Gluten-specific Blood T Cells and Standard CeD Histological Assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Days 6 and 15</time_frame>
    <description>Standard measures used for diagnosing CeD: Vh:CD ratio and IEL counts. T cell measurements taken before first dose of gluten were correlated with Baseline Vh:Cd ratio and IEL counts, and T cell measurements taken after first dose of gluten were correlated with Day 15 Vh:Cd ratio and IEL counts using Spearman correlation. Villi were small finger like projections that line small intestine, promote nutrient absorption and are often shortened in CeD participants. Crypts were grooves between villi that were often elongated in CeD participants. IELs were WBCs interspersed between epithelial cells of intestine where they function to preserve integrity of mucosal barrier by protecting epithelium against pathogen/immune-induced pathology. Decreased Vh:Cd ratio and increased IELs count indicated more extreme CeD symptoms. Baseline value: last observed value before first dose of gluten. Tr: T cell value taken before first dose of gluten. T6: T cell value at Day 6. T15: T cell value at Day 15.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Gluten-specific T Cells in Blood Based on Enzyme-linked Immune Absorbent Spot (ELISPot) Assay and T Cell Receptor (TCR) Human Leukocyte Antigen Serotype (HLA-DQ2)-Tetramers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>ELISpot assay and gluten specific TCR measures drug response by quantifying changes in the number or function of gluten-specific T cells. Baseline value was defined as the last observed value before the first dose of gluten.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Be a non-smoker who has not used tobacco- or nicotine-containing products (example,&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Have well-controlled biopsy-proven CeD, compliant with a gluten-free diet (GFD) for&#xD;
             greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 6 months preceding screening, with resolution of CeD&#xD;
             symptoms, normalization of CeD serology, and in the judgment of the investigator, have&#xD;
             inactive or minimally-active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Be willing to delay a planned procedure involving the use of powerful electromagnetic&#xD;
             fields (example, magnetic resonance imaging), until the PillCam SB 3 capsule is&#xD;
             excreted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Not undergo VCE or optical coherence tomography (OCT) if has an implanted&#xD;
             electromedical device or a swallowing disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Not undergo OCT if has a contraindication to the device or procedure as per reference&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Consume excessive amounts of coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks, or other caffeinated&#xD;
             beverages per day. An excessive amount is defined as greater than 6 servings (1&#xD;
             serving is approximately equivalent to 120 mg of caffeine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have positive IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG), IgA anti-deamidated gliadin&#xD;
             peptide (DGP), and IgG DGP serologies at Screening.&#xD;

        <title>Change From Baseline in Small Intestine Histology Based on Villous Height to Crypt Depth (Vh:Cd) Ratio</title>
        <description>Attenuation of the effects of gluten exposure was assessed by measuring the change from baseline in villous height (Vh) to crypt depth (Cd) ratio after 15 days of gluten challenge. Villi were the small finger like projections that line the small intestine and promote nutrient absorption and are often shortened in participants with CeD. Crypts were grooves between the villi that are often elongated in participants with CeD. A decreased Vh:Cd ratio indicates more extreme CeD disease symptoms. Baseline values was defined as the last observed value before the first dose of gluten.</description>

        <description>Standard measures used for diagnosing CeD: Vh:CD ratio and IEL counts. T cell measurements taken before first dose of gluten were correlated with Baseline Vh:Cd ratio and IEL counts, and T cell measurements taken after first dose of gluten were correlated with Day 15 Vh:Cd ratio and IEL counts using Spearman correlation. Villi were small finger like projections that line small intestine, promote nutrient absorption and are often shortened in CeD participants. Crypts were grooves between villi that were often elongated in CeD participants. IELs were WBCs interspersed between epithelial cells of intestine where they function to preserve integrity of mucosal barrier by protecting epithelium against pathogen/immune-induced pathology. Decreased Vh:Cd ratio and increased IELs count indicated more extreme CeD symptoms. Baseline value: last observed value before first dose of gluten. Tr: T cell value taken before first dose of gluten. T6: T cell value at Day 6. T15: T cell value at Day 15.</description>

          <title>Correlation Coefficient Changes Between Gluten-specific Blood T Cells and Standard CeD Histological Assessments</title>
          <description>Standard measures used for diagnosing CeD: Vh:CD ratio and IEL counts. T cell measurements taken before first dose of gluten were correlated with Baseline Vh:Cd ratio and IEL counts, and T cell measurements taken after first dose of gluten were correlated with Day 15 Vh:Cd ratio and IEL counts using Spearman correlation. Villi were small finger like projections that line small intestine, promote nutrient absorption and are often shortened in CeD participants. Crypts were grooves between villi that were often elongated in CeD participants. IELs were WBCs interspersed between epithelial cells of intestine where they function to preserve integrity of mucosal barrier by protecting epithelium against pathogen/immune-induced pathology. Decreased Vh:Cd ratio and increased IELs count indicated more extreme CeD symptoms. Baseline value: last observed value before first dose of gluten. Tr: T cell value taken before first dose of gluten. T6: T cell value at Day 6. T15: T cell value at Day 15.</description>
