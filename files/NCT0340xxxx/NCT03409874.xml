  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare two different approaches for treating patients&#xD;
      with temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD): Dry needling and spinal manipulation or&#xD;
      Interocclusal Appliance (Splint), NSAIDs and Temporomandibular Joint Mobilization .&#xD;
      Clinicians commonly use all of these techniques to treat TMD. This study is attempting to&#xD;
      find out if one treatment strategy is more effective than the other.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stress temporomandibular dysfunction will be randomized to receive 1-2&#xD;
      treatment sessions per week for up to 4 weeks ( up to 8 sessions total) of either: (1) dry&#xD;
      needling and spinal manipulation or (2) Interocclusal appliance (splint), NSAIDs,&#xD;
      temporomandibular joint mobilization.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in average jaw pain intensity rated by the patient over last 24 hours and last 7 days (VAS: 0-100mm) between baseline and the following time points: 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months.&#xD;
Even though patients will be treated 1-2 treatments per week for 4 weeks (up to 8 treatments total), the visual analogue score after 2 weeks of treatment, at 6 weeks (2 weeks post treatment) and at 3 months (2 months post treatment) will be compared to baseline (pre-treatment). Scores closer to 0 represent less pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Rating of Perceived Change</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Global rating of perceived change rated rated by the patient according to a -7 to +7 scale. More specifically, the Global Rating of Perceived Change is rated as follows:&#xD;
A very great deal worse (-7)&#xD;
A great deal worse (-6)&#xD;
Quite a bit worse (-5)&#xD;
Moderately worse (-4)&#xD;
Somewhat worse (-3)&#xD;
A little bit worse (-2)&#xD;
A tiny bit worse (almost the same) (-1)&#xD;
About the same (0)&#xD;
A very great deal better (+7)&#xD;
A great deal better (+6)&#xD;
Quite a bit better (+5)&#xD;
Moderately better (+4)&#xD;
Somewhat better (+3)&#xD;
A little bit better (+2)&#xD;
A tiny bit better (almost the same) (+1)&#xD;
The patient will choose a rating (the closer to +7, the better the score / the closer to -7, the worse the score) after 2 weeks of treatment, at 6 weeks (2 weeks post-treatment) and 3 months (2 months post-treatment).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Active Pain Free Mouth Opening</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the distance between upper and lower central incisors after patient has opening mouth &quot;as wide as possible&quot; without causing pain between baseline and the following time points: 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months. Measurements will be taken in mm. The greater the distance, the better the score.&#xD;
Even though patients will be treated 1-2 treatments per week for 4 weeks (up to 8 treatments total), active pain free mouth opening after 2 weeks of treatment, at 6 weeks (2 weeks post treatment) and at 3 months (2 months post treatment) will be compared to baseline (pre-treatment)&#xD;
Greater scores represent greater pain free mouth opening.</description>
