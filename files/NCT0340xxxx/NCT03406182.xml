      Background Over the last 10 years there has been an increase in the female agriculture labour&#xD;
      force, in Pakistan, resulting in a feminisation of agriculture; which could have either a&#xD;
      positive or negative impact on maternal and young child nutrition. It could have a positive&#xD;
      impact through increased female wage earnings that improve her bargaining/decision-making&#xD;
      power within the household. Women are more likely than men to make pro-nutrition choices with&#xD;
      regards to household expenditure. Conversely, women's involvement in agricultural work may&#xD;
      have a negative impact on infant or maternal nutrition by reducing time available for child&#xD;
      care, through increased expenditure of physical energy without compensatory increases in food&#xD;
      consumption or exposure to harmful toxins present in pesticides and other chemicals used in&#xD;
      farming. Understanding the dynamics of these pathways, in a specific context, is important to&#xD;
      ensure agriculture programmes and policies do not disadvantage women or their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall aim To provide insights into positive and negative pathways between women's work in&#xD;
      agriculture and maternal and child nutritional status, in different agriculture workload&#xD;
      contexts, to inform agriculture interventions and policies in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether the number of hours a mother participates in agriculture work is&#xD;
           associated with maternal body mass index and infant nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify factors that modify the influence of maternal participation in agriculture&#xD;
           work on maternal and infant nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design A cohort study was conducted from September 2015 in irrigated rural areas of&#xD;
      Pakistan. Infant-mother dyads were recruited when the infant was between 2 and 12 weeks of&#xD;
      age inclusive. Anthropometric measurements (maternal and infant height / recumbent length and&#xD;
      weight), interviewer administered questionnaires and spot observations were collected at&#xD;
      recruitment (Time 1) and again when the infants were between 9-15 months of age (Time 2). The&#xD;
      interviewer administered questionnaires were collected from each infant's mother (or the&#xD;
      household head if the father was not present). A one page questionnaire was also completed at&#xD;
      recruitment to record the numbers of women who agreed to participate in the study, the number&#xD;
      who were approached but were not recruited into the study and the reasons they were not&#xD;
      eligible to participate or their reasons for refusal.&#xD;

      Study Design This study is an longitudinal observational study which was used to generate&#xD;
      hypotheses rather than testing them. Mother-infant dyads were recruited between December 2015&#xD;
      and February 2016; and were followed up between November 2016 and January 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling The sample size (n=1000) was calculated to detect an increase/decrease in maternal&#xD;
      BMI of around 0.18 for every additional hour worked with 80% power at a 5% level of&#xD;
      significance. To estimate it, simulations were run to explore the power we would have to&#xD;
      detect the relationship between maternal BMI and number of hours worked. It was based on a&#xD;
      mean number of working hours of 6 and a standard deviation of 4 and a within cluster&#xD;
      variation of 0.2 . This is a small effect size and suggests that the proposed sample size&#xD;
      will provide adequate power to allow us to explore proposed relationships and generate&#xD;
      hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were selected via systematic random cluster sampling. Initially, administrative&#xD;
      villages with perennial canal irrigation were selected; villages with a population&lt;10% or&#xD;
      &gt;90% of average village size were excluded, and random sampling was used to select villages&#xD;
      from the eligible villages (n=2,909). All dyads, in the selected villages (n=62) were invited&#xD;
      to participate in the study if: (i) the infant was a singleton birth ≥2 weeks and ≤ 12 weeks&#xD;
      of age on the day of the first interview; healthy without congenital deformations that would&#xD;
      impact on their ability to eat and (ii) the primary caregiver (i.e. the biological mother)&#xD;
      intended to reside in the study area over the next 10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To recruit these dyads, all recent births in the identified village were listed through a&#xD;
      systematic multi-stage community profiling procedure using local key informants/resource&#xD;
      persons including: health workers, midwives, doctors and paramedics, and locally&#xD;
      well-informed individuals. In the first stage, several key informants per village were asked&#xD;
      to exhaustively list all kinship groups or castes and localities within the village. Then&#xD;
      they were asked to list all births from within those castes/localities within a given time&#xD;
      period. Probes were used at both stages to counter exclusions. Afterwards a team of&#xD;
      recruiters visited each of the listed mothers to confirm eligibility (i.e. correct age of the&#xD;
      new born). Recruiters also probed for other births within the locality, to identify new cases&#xD;
      through this snowballing technique. All dyads in the village who fulfilled this condition and&#xD;
      met the inclusion criteria were recruited and actual date of birth was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and Methodology At each of the two data collection periods, interviewer&#xD;
      administered questionnaires were collected from the mothers; and included questions related&#xD;
      to socio-demographic status, health, dietary intakes, maternal agency and nutrition&#xD;
      knowledge. These questionnaires were pilot tested and modified to ensure each questionnaire&#xD;
      took less than 60 minutes per respondent to complete. For mothers, questions related to&#xD;
      infant feeding, immunisation and pregnancy varied between the first and second data&#xD;
      collection periods to reflect differences in infant age and maternal status. All data were&#xD;
      entered directly into an android tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements of maternal height and weight and infant weight and recumbent&#xD;
      length were done in duplicate by trained anthropometrists using high quality equipment. If&#xD;
      the first and second measurements did not agree to within a specified limit (e.g., 0.5 kg or&#xD;
      0.5 cm) a third measurement was taken. These data were entered directly into an android&#xD;
      tablet to allow consistency checks for quality assurance. Spot observations were also done to&#xD;
      determine housing materials and the hygienic conditions of the environment, which were&#xD;
      entered directly into an android tablet.&#xD;
