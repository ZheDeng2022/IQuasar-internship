  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to examine and compare the efficacy of supervised injections of long&#xD;
      acting insulins degludec and glargine to protect youth with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      (T1D) from development of ketones.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study will compare the proportion of days with fasting β-hydroxybutyrate levels ≥0.6&#xD;
      mmol/L at the start of the school week following weekend/holiday breaks in subjects who have&#xD;
      been randomized to receive daily injections of I-deg or I-glar. Hypothesis: β-hydroxybutyrate&#xD;
      levels will be lower in the morning of the first day of the school week in subjects receiving&#xD;
      I-deg than in subjects receiving I-glar, since the long half-life of I-deg will compensate&#xD;
      for missed insulin doses over the weekend/holidays. To remove variability due to potential&#xD;
      non-compliance during the school week, this study will utilize our routine clinical practice&#xD;
      of supervised insulin administration and monitoring of blood glucose and ketones during the&#xD;
      school day.&#xD;
