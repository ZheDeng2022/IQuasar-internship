      The LITES Network is an operational trauma center consortium which has the expertise, track&#xD;
      record and confirmed capabilities to conduct prospective, multicenter, injury care and&#xD;
      outcomes research of relevance to the Department of Defense (DoD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhage and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) are responsible for the largest proportion of all&#xD;
      trauma-related deaths. It is the poly-trauma patient who suffers both hemorrhagic shock and&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury where a paucity of evidence exists to direct treatment, limiting the&#xD;
      development of beneficial trauma practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Whole Blood (WB) for early trauma resuscitation has been touted as the 'essential&#xD;
      next step' in the evolution of trauma resuscitation. Despite its historical and more recent&#xD;
      use, little is known regarding WB's benefit relative to the 'current practice' ratio-based&#xD;
      blood component therapy in the acutely bleeding patient, and even less is known regarding its&#xD;
      effects in patients with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM#1: Evaluate patient centered outcomes associated with early whole blood resuscitation&#xD;
      practice as compared to component resuscitation in poly-trauma patients with hemorrhagic&#xD;
      shock and further characterize outcome benefits in those with traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM#2: Characterize blood pressure and resuscitation endpoints during the acute resuscitation&#xD;
      phase of care and the associated/attributable outcomes for traumatic brain injury in patients&#xD;
      with hemorrhagic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Hypothesis #1: Whole blood resuscitation will be associated with improved mortality&#xD;
      and resuscitation outcomes in poly-trauma patients and long term neurological outcome in&#xD;
      those patients with traumatic brain injury as compared to those resuscitated with component&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Hypothesis #2: Differences in prehospital and acute phase resuscitation systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure will be associated with differential outcomes in patients with traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury at discharge and at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The LITES network will perform a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort&#xD;
      study over a 4 year period to determine the impact of whole blood resuscitation in trauma&#xD;
      patients with hemorrhagic shock at risk of large volume resuscitation with and without TBI.&#xD;
      Early whole blood resuscitation will be compared to standard component resuscitation. The&#xD;
      study will also further characterize blood pressure and resuscitation endpoints in&#xD;
      poly-trauma patients with traumatic brain injury. Six Trauma sites with appropriate&#xD;
      characteristics will be selected from 12 LITES Network sites across the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: The study will be performed utilizing busy level I trauma centers within the&#xD;
      LITES Network located across the country, at sites where either whole blood has currently&#xD;
      been incorporated into standard of care or where component blood transfusion is being&#xD;
      utilized for patients in hemorrhagic shock at risk for large volume resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The study will focus on patients who suffer blunt or penetrating injury,&#xD;
      transported to a SWAT participating LITES trauma center with evidence of hemorrhagic shock at&#xD;
      risk of large volume blood resuscitation.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LITES Network is an operational trauma center consortium which has the expertise, track&#xD;
      record and confirmed capabilities to conduct prospective, multicenter, injury care and&#xD;
      outcomes research of relevance to the Department of Defense (DoD). Clinical trials from the&#xD;
      point of injury in the prehospital arena through the trauma bay and operating theatre, thru&#xD;
      ICU and beyond discharge are feasible and critical to the overall goals of the network. Novel&#xD;
      capabilities include prehospital point of care testing for shock severity and sequential&#xD;
      coagulopathy measurements. The network and leadership have a track record of Exception From&#xD;
      Informed Consent (EFIC) trials and expertise with those injury subtypes including traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury, hemorrhagic shock and coagulopathy of trauma, poly-trauma and severe extremity&#xD;
      trauma. In addition to the track record and proven capabilities, the LITES Network uses a&#xD;
      central IRB and efficient methods to minimize time, resources, cost and regulatory burdens&#xD;
      and improve recruitment, consent rates and ease of data acquisition to promote successful&#xD;
      execution of those task orders provided to the network from the DoD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traumatic injury represents an incredible health care burden in the United States and&#xD;
      worldwide.1 Hemorrhage and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) are responsible for the largest&#xD;
      proportion of all trauma-related deaths. Despite advances in trauma resuscitation and brain&#xD;
      injury management, few therapeutic interventions are available to reduce the downstream&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality attributable to these injury patterns. It is the poly-trauma patient&#xD;
      who suffers both hemorrhagic shock and traumatic brain injury where a paucity of evidence&#xD;
      exists to direct treatment, limiting the development of beneficial trauma practice&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ongoing traumatic blood loss is complicated by trauma induced coagulopathy which results in&#xD;
      further unbridled hemorrhage and resultant shock and organ dysfunction. Secondary to&#xD;
      increasing evidence and knowledge, in-hospital resuscitation of traumatic hemorrhage has&#xD;
      changed over the past decade to reduce the coagulopathic response to ischemia and tissue&#xD;
      injury. The underlying principle of current resuscitation practice focuses on preventing or&#xD;
      reversing the effects of coagulopathy with the early use of a balanced component transfusion&#xD;
      strategy (1:1:1 - plasma: packed red blood cells: platelets). This reconstituted strategy has&#xD;
      also been coined 'whole blood-like' resuscitation despite being inferior from a compositional&#xD;
      standpoint relative to Whole Blood (WB). The use of WB was historically the gold standard for&#xD;
      treating hemorrhagic shock during World War I and II, prior to sweeping changes in blood&#xD;
      banking practice. The use of WB for early trauma resuscitation is making a resurgence,&#xD;
      primarily based upon the military experience and has been touted as the 'essential next step'&#xD;
      in the evolution of trauma resuscitation. Despite its historical and more recent use, little&#xD;
      is known regarding WB's benefit relative to the 'current practice' ratio based blood&#xD;
      component therapy in the acutely injured patients and even less is known regarding its&#xD;
      effects in patients with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permissive hypotension has been thought to improve outcome in injured patients with&#xD;
      hemorrhagic shock in the prehospital and acute resuscitation phase of treatment allowing for&#xD;
      the ability to obtain surgical control of bleeding while minimizing ongoing hemorrhage.&#xD;
      Despite this benefit for hemorrhagic shock patients, hypotension has been consistently shown&#xD;
      to be associated with worse outcomes in patients with TBI. Interestingly, newer animal data&#xD;
      suggests permissive hypotension may be beneficial in a swine TBI model.The majority of prior,&#xD;
      high level TBI trials have excluded patients with concomitant hemorrhagic shock. Prospective&#xD;
      evidence and long term TBI outcome data are lacking for these complex poly-trauma patients&#xD;
      and the most appropriate blood pressure and most efficacious resuscitation target for&#xD;
      patients with TBI and acute hemorrhage remain poorly characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1A: Whole blood resuscitation will be associated with a lower 4 hour mortality in&#xD;
      poly-trauma patients as compared to those resuscitated with component therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1B: Whole blood resuscitation will be associated with a lower incidence of 12&#xD;
      hour and 24 hour mortality, a lower incidence of death from exsanguination, incidence of MOF,&#xD;
      nosocomial infection, improved transfusion ratios, lower overall blood transfusion&#xD;
      requirements and shorter time to hemostasis as compared to those resuscitated with component&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1C: Whole blood resuscitation will be associated with an improved Glasgow Outcome&#xD;
      Score-Extended at 6 months post injury as compared to those resuscitated with component&#xD;
      therapy in patients with traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2A: A nadir prehospital and acute phase resuscitation systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 120 mmHg will be associated with improved traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      outcomes at discharge and at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2B: The magnitude of the dose depth curve of systolic blood pressure during the&#xD;
      prehospital and acute phase resuscitation will be associated with neurological outcome&#xD;
      differences at discharge and at 6 months following traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The LITES Network will perform a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort&#xD;
      study over a 4 year period to determine the impact of whole blood resuscitation in trauma&#xD;
      patients with hemorrhagic shock at risk of large volume resuscitation with and without TBI.&#xD;
      Early whole blood resuscitation will be compared to standard component resuscitation. The&#xD;
      study will also further characterize blood pressure and resuscitation endpoints in&#xD;
      poly-trauma patients with traumatic brain injury. Six trauma sites with appropriate&#xD;
      characteristics will be selected from 12 network sites across the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: The study will be performed utilizing busy level I trauma centers from within&#xD;
      the LITES Network located across the country, at sites where either whole blood has currently&#xD;
      been incorporated into standard of care or where component blood transfusion is being&#xD;
      utilized for patients in hemorrhagic shock at risk for large volume resuscitation. Due to the&#xD;
      paucity of trauma centers who are currently utilizing whole blood for trauma patients as&#xD;
      standard of care, the potential to incorporate sites outside of the current LITES Network may&#xD;
      be required over time.&#xD;
