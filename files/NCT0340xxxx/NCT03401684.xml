  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the impact of a mental health training program in&#xD;
      volunteer and career firefighters.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      THE PROBLEM: Firefighters are frequently exposed to distressing events, or critical incidents&#xD;
      such as motor vehicle accidents, burnt bodies, failed rescue attempts, threats to one's own&#xD;
      life, and completed suicides that can trigger posttraumatic stress reactions. Previous&#xD;
      research show that first responders and other public safety personnel report frequent&#xD;
      exposure to traumatic events and are at increased risk for mental health illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a mental health training program in volunteer&#xD;
      and career firefighters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE STUDY SAMPLE: 600 firefighters: 300 Prince Edward Island volunteer or career&#xD;
      firefighters, 300 Vancouver career firefighters&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: Vancouver Fire &amp; Rescue Services and the Canadian Mental Health&#xD;
      Association-Vancouver Fraser co-developed a new program called, &quot;Resilient Minds-Building the&#xD;
      Psychological Health of Fire Fighters.&quot; The Resilient Minds training will educate&#xD;
      firefighters about the effects of trauma, how to recognize signs of mental health illness and&#xD;
      how to access support after critical events. It also trains firefighters to recognize mental&#xD;
      health and addictions in co-workers and how to facilitate their help-seeking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES: The impact of the program will be assessed by pre- and post-program surveys,&#xD;
      3-month, 6-month, 12-month follow-up surveys.&#xD;
