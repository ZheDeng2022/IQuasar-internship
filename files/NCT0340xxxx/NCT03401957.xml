      To evaluate the emergence of RAS mutation in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer,&#xD;
      circulating free DNA will be analyzed using mass spectrometric genotyping in subjects during&#xD;
      cetuximab treatment. The hypothesis of this study is that acquired RAS mutation is&#xD;
      responsible for the resistance to cetuximab treatment in wild-type colorectal cancer. The&#xD;
      usefulness of liquid biopsy to monitor dynamic genetic alterations in colorectal cancer&#xD;
      during treatment will also be investigated in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, non-interventional, uncontrolled, multicenter study in metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients receiving cetuximab-based infusional 5-FU regimen as 1st line&#xD;
      treatment. Patients who are pathologically diagnosed as metastatic colorectal cancer with RAS&#xD;
      wild type genotyping will be recruited in this study. Patients enrolled will be those for&#xD;
      whom it is planned to treat their colorectal cancer with a cetuximab-based infusional 5-FU&#xD;
      regimen according to the locally approved label. Cetuximab-based treatment is anticipated to&#xD;
      be continued until disease progression, intolerable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent&#xD;
      occurs. Blood samples from patients enrolled in this study will be collected before the start&#xD;
      of cetuximab-based chemotherapy, and every 3 months during the 1st line treatment with the&#xD;
      cetuximab-based regimen. Blood sampling is also required at 2-3 weeks after disease&#xD;
      progression following cetuximab treatment and after disease progression on 2nd line&#xD;
      treatment. The blood samples will be sent to a central laboratory at the Taipei Institute of&#xD;
      Pathology and evaluated for RAS genotype, using MassARRAY technique. The objectives of this&#xD;
      study are described as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To observe the percentage of detected RAS mutations (circulating DNA) during 1st line&#xD;
      cetuximab exposure in Taiwanese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To observe the time to onset of detected RAS mutation in circulating DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To observe the quantification mutation load change under treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate clinical response and resection rate of metastases with 1st line cetuximab&#xD;
           exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate treatment duration with 1st line cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To investigate the correlation between the occurrence and levels of acquired RAS&#xD;
           mutations post-cetuximab treatment and clinical outcomes (progression free survival and&#xD;
           overall survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To calculate total 1st line cetuximab exposure dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To investigate correlation between the irinotecan or oxaliplatin dosage and acquired&#xD;
           resistance.&#xD;
