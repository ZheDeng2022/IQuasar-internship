  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy to the breast and lymph nodes is routinely planned using CT scans. The&#xD;
      introduction of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to better visualise the&#xD;
      lymph nodes and so define a smaller treatment area or 'target'. This means that the dose&#xD;
      delivered to the target could be increased without increasing the dose to normal tissues. The&#xD;
      MIRABELLE study is designed to test if this is possible by recruiting patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      breast cancer including lymph node disease. The investigators will ask participants to have a&#xD;
      CT scan and an MRI scan before they have radiotherapy. The investigators will then plan&#xD;
      radiotherapy using both these scans and compare the possible dose delivered to the lymph&#xD;
      nodes using the MRI and CT defined lymph nodes. This will not affect the patient's future&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MR imaging has the potential to improve both the localisation of pan-LN treatments and the&#xD;
      subsequent treatment delivery using MR-linac technology. The MIRABELLE study will apply the&#xD;
      MR sequences developed in LN-negative volunteers/patients to the context of node-positive&#xD;
      breast cancer patients with the aim of reducing the delineated nodal volume thereby&#xD;
      facilitating dose-escalation to involved LNs. The benefit of using MRI for LN localisation as&#xD;
      compared to conventional CT imaging will be investigated by determining whether a higher dose&#xD;
      can be delivered using MRI- as compared to CT-based delineation. Any increase in dose will be&#xD;
      deemed a success as this has potential to improve tumour control. In addition, inter-observer&#xD;
      errors in outlining will be explored to investigate whether these are reduced using MRI.&#xD;
      Reduced inter-observer errors would result in smaller margins for error such that less normal&#xD;
      tissue could be irradiated.&#xD;

    <time_frame>During a radiotherapy planning process, an average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MR images are acquired with patient in a position as close as possible to the radiotherapy CT planning position. Images are acquired in a radiotherapy CT scanner with patient in a position replicating that achieved in the MRI scanner. The images are imported into a treatment planning system and consensus lymph node volume agreed between an expert radiation oncologist and MR radiologist. All pan-LN will be delineated on co-registered MRI sequences and on CT (using ESTRO guidelines) by 7 observers.</description>
