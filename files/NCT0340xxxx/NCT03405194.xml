      Randomized, open-label study comparing Elvitegravir-Cobicistat-Tenofovir&#xD;
      Alafenamide-Emtricitabine (Genvoya) vs. Efavirenz-Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate-Lamivudine&#xD;
      (EFV-TDF-3TC) in patients starting ART on the day of HIV diagnosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with WHO Stage 1 or 2 disease at HIV diagnosis will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      either the Genvoya group or the EFV-TDF-3TC group. ART will be initiated on the day of HIV&#xD;
      diagnosis. Participants who are found to have a contraindication to their assigned treatment&#xD;
      regimen will change ART, and be classified as a failure for their assigned treatment arm.&#xD;
      Participants in the EFV-TDF-3TC group with CrCl of 30-50 mL/minute, or with baseline&#xD;
      mutations that significantly reduce the susceptibility of EFV will switch to Genvoya.&#xD;
      Participants in the Genvoya group who are diagnosed with TB after enrollment will be switched&#xD;
      to an ART regimen that can be administered with rifampin. If the study physician determines&#xD;
      that a treatment change is indicated due to intolerability or side effects, the relevant&#xD;
      clinical data will be presented to a safety committee that is blinded to group assignment.&#xD;
      The ART regimen will be changed if the safety committee determines that it is indicated, and&#xD;
      the participant will be considered a failure to their assigned treatment group. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed for 48 weeks.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Haiti gained access to dolutegravir as first-line ART, so we cancelled the study before any&#xD;
    patient was enrolled (we didn't want SOC group to receive EFV)&#xD;
