      This randomized controlled trial will compare the outcome of surgery (fasciectomy) with that&#xD;
      of local injection of Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum in patients with recurrent finger&#xD;
      joint contracture after previous treatment with Surgery, collagenase injection or needle&#xD;
      fasciotomy. Half of the participants will be treated with surgery while the other half will&#xD;
      receive collagenase injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No definitive cure for Dupuytren disease (DD) currently exists and recurrence of finger&#xD;
      contractures after treatment is common. Surgical fasciectomy is considered the standard&#xD;
      treatment method for patients with recurrence. However, the procedure is associated with a&#xD;
      high incidence of complications. Injection of Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum into&#xD;
      Dypuytren cords causing the contracture is a non-surgical treatment for DD and has been shown&#xD;
      to be a safe and effective method. Most studies regarding collagenase injection have involved&#xD;
      first-time treatment. Efficacy of collagenase injection in patients with recurrent DD, beyond&#xD;
      the immediate effect, has not yet been determined. This randomized trial will compare the&#xD;
      outcome of surgical fasciectomy and collagenase injection in treating patients with finger&#xD;
      joints contracture due to recurrent DD. The study is a single-center randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. Patients referred to an orthopedic department are screened for eligibility. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria are recurrence of DD in one or more fingers after previous treatment with&#xD;
      fasciectomy, collagenase injection or needle fasciotomy, a passive extension deficit ≥30&#xD;
      degrees in the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and/or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint in a&#xD;
      previously treated finger, and a palpable cord believed to cause the recurrent contracture. A&#xD;
      total of 56 patients will be randomized (computer-generated randomization list, stratified&#xD;
      according to type of previous treatment and affected finger), to either surgical fasciectomy&#xD;
      or collagenase injection. A blinded hand therapist will measure range of motion (including&#xD;
      active and passive extension deficit) at baseline and 3 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60&#xD;
      months after treatment. The primary outcomes are the total active extension deficit (MCP plus&#xD;
      PIP) at 3 months and the proportion of patients with contracture worsening ≥20 degrees in the&#xD;
      treated finger joint at 2 years compared to 3 months. The secondary outcomes include total&#xD;
      passive extension deficit, the 11-item disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (QuickDASH)&#xD;
      score, EuroQol 5-dimensions (EQ-5D) index, cold intolerance symptom severity score, palmar&#xD;
      pain score, pain visual analog scale (VAS) score, satisfaction VAS score, adverse events and&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
