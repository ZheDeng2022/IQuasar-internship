      This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of ADAPT vs Stentriever techique in a&#xD;
      multicenter stroke cohort of patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Andalusia, current data show that the mortality rate from stroke is 50% higher than in&#xD;
      Spain as a whole. Endovascular therapy has revolutionized the treatment of acute stroke and&#xD;
      could improve these high mortality rates. The investigators propose to take the great advance&#xD;
      that the thrombectomy has given to the community of Andalusia in which there are more limited&#xD;
      resources with several strategies such as the implementation of strict protocols of inclusion&#xD;
      through a common registry, use of cheaper equipment (aspiration vs stent-retrievers)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the TRIANA trial is thus to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Demonstrate that the use of thrombectomy systems with direct aspiration first pass&#xD;
      technique (ADAPT ) using the new large-bore 6F SOFIA Plus catheter (MicroVention, Inc., a&#xD;
      wholly owned subsidiary of Terumo Corporation) is equal in safety and efficacy to the results&#xD;
      of thrombectomy with stent retriever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) The use of mechanical aspiration systems would lead to a decrease in cost per procedure,&#xD;
      shortening the duration of treatment and decrease the rate of embolism to new territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Identify futile recanalization blood biomarkers that will allow the investigators in the&#xD;
      future to treat only those patients who will benefit from the most adequate reperfusion&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is an observational, prospective and multicentric study of patients with acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke of anterior circulation and less than 8 hours of evolution treated with&#xD;
      neurointerventionist rescue techniques to study safety, effectiveness, costs of the&#xD;
      intervention and duration (puncture-recanalization) of the thrombectomy system with&#xD;
      aspiration with Sofia Plus in comparison with the stent retrievers system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of thrombectomy with manual mechanical&#xD;
           aspiration with Sofia Plus under clinical practice conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if the duration (puncture-recanalization) of thrombectomy with aspiration is&#xD;
           less than that of stents retrievers; And if the number of embolisms distal to new&#xD;
           vascular territories decreases with aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate the cost savings by procedure in the treatment of ischemic stroke and to&#xD;
           analyze the efficiency (cost effectiveness) of thrombectomy with aspiration.&#xD;

    <description>Is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability.&#xD;
Score Description: The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death.&#xD;
0 No symptoms at all&#xD;
No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities&#xD;
Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance&#xD;
Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance&#xD;
Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance&#xD;
Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention&#xD;

    <description>It´s a tool for determining the response of thrombolytic/thrombectomy therapy for ischaemic stroke. In neurointerventional radiology it is commonly used for patients post endovascular revascularisation. Like most therapy response grading systems, it predicts prognosis.&#xD;
Classification&#xD;
The description is based on the angiographic appearances of the treated occluded vessel and the distal branches:&#xD;
Grade 0: no perfusion Grade 1: penetration with minimal perfusion Grade 2: partial perfusion Grade 2A: only partial filling (less than two-thirds) of the entire vascular territory is visualized Grade 2B: complete filling of all of the expected vascular territory is visualized but the filling is slower than normal Grade 3: complete perfusion</description>
