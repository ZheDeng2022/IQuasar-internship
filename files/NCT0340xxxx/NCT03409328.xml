  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately&#xD;
      affected by HIV. Despite this burden, most HIV prevention interventions target adult MSM&#xD;
      (most of whom identify as gay) and heterosexual youth, creating an urgent need for&#xD;
      interventions for gay and bisexual adolescents. Further, self-identified bisexual men,&#xD;
      especially adolescents, have been neglected in research. Therefore, little is known about&#xD;
      factors that drive engagement in risk behavior among self-identified bisexual adolescent men.&#xD;
      The goals of this study are to: (1) examine factors that drive engagement in HIV risk&#xD;
      behavior and substance use among self-identified bisexual adolescent men; and (2) develop and&#xD;
      pilot test a tailored HIV and substance use prevention intervention for this population.&#xD;

      Young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately&#xD;
      affected by HIV. Despite this burden, most HIV prevention interventions target adult MSM&#xD;
      (most of whom identify as gay) and heterosexual youth, creating an urgent need for&#xD;
      interventions for gay and bisexual adolescents. Further, self-identified bisexual men,&#xD;
      especially adolescents, have been neglected in research. This is a critical problem because:&#xD;
      (1) there are as many, if not more, bisexual adolescent men than gay adolescent men; (2)&#xD;
      bisexual adolescent men engage in several HIV risk behaviors more than their gay peers; (3)&#xD;
      bisexual adolescent men are at increased risk for substance use-a robust risk factor for HIV;&#xD;
      and (4) bisexual men face unique HIV prevention issues. Given that bisexual men are rarely&#xD;
      included in research and most existing research on them focuses on &quot;behaviorally bisexual&quot;&#xD;
      adult men, little is known about factors that drive engagement in risk behavior among&#xD;
      self-identified bisexual adolescent men. Attending to bisexual identity is critical to&#xD;
      reducing HIV and substance use, because bisexuality is highly stigmatized and stigma-related&#xD;
      stressors (e.g., concerns about disclosing one's bisexual identity) impact sexual behavior,&#xD;
      substance use, and healthcare utilization. Interventions are also more effective when&#xD;
      tailored to populations, underscoring the need for an intervention for self-identified&#xD;
      bisexual adolescent men. The goals of this study are to: (1) examine factors that drive&#xD;
      engagement in HIV risk behavior and substance use among self-identified bisexual adolescent&#xD;
      men; and (2) develop and pilot test a tailored HIV and substance use prevention intervention&#xD;
      for this population. In Phase 1, interviews will be conducted with 60 diverse self-identified&#xD;
      bisexual adolescent men ages 14-17 focused on sexual identity, sexual decision-making,&#xD;
      substance use motivations, and intervention preferences/barriers. In Phase 2, a tailored&#xD;
      intervention will be developed using findings from Phase 1. In Phase 3, feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy will be tested in a pilot randomized trial (N = 60)&#xD;
      with a waitlist control and one-month follow-up. In sum, self-identified bisexual adolescent&#xD;
      men are at increased risk for HIV and substance use, but little is known about factors that&#xD;
      drive their engagement in risk behavior. By focusing on self-identified bisexual adolescent&#xD;
      men-an underrepresented, health disparity population-this study can identify prevention&#xD;
      targets and reduce disparities in HIV and substance use.&#xD;
