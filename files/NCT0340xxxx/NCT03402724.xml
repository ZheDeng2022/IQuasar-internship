      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is became the gold-standard therapy for&#xD;
      patients with severe and symptomatic aortic stenosis with high operative risk or not suitable&#xD;
      for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All studies assessed TAVI showed excellent results at short and mid-term follow-up. The&#xD;
      current and future development of the devices predict an extension of indications to&#xD;
      &quot;intermediate-risk&quot; and younger patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, long-term evaluation of these valves is a priority to determine their durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, standardized echographic follow-up of patients implanted with TAVI is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, there was not consensual definition of TAVI degeneration until now. Recently,&#xD;
      European Society of Cardiology published echographic criteria to precise and standardized&#xD;
      TAVI deterioration based on simple hemodynamic and morphological criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, very few studies have been interested in monitoring more than 5 years of these&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, nowadays we did not know if TAVI evolution is the same as surgical bioprosthesis.&#xD;

      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is became the gold-standard therapy for&#xD;

&#xD;
      Therefore, long-term evaluation of these valves is a priority to determine their durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes of these patients are well documented by large registers. Thus, FRANCE 2&#xD;
      registry studying more than 3000 patients realized in 34 French centers showed at 30 days a&#xD;
      rate of death of 9.7%, and incidence of stroke of 3.4%. SOURCE registries studied more than&#xD;
      5000 patients in Europe and United-States with three generations of TAVI. All-cause mortality&#xD;
      at 1 year was respectively 23.9%, 19.4% and 11.7% in SOURCE, SOURCE XT (Sapien XT) and SOURCE&#xD;
      3 (Sapien 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, standardized echographic follow-up of patients implanted with TAVI is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, there was not consensual definition of TAVI degeneration until now. Recently,&#xD;
      European Society of Cardiology published echographic criteria to precise and standardized&#xD;

&#xD;
      In addition, very few studies have been interested in monitoring more than 5 years of these&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, nowadays the investigator did not know if TAVI evolution is the same as surgical&#xD;
      bioprosthesis.&#xD;
