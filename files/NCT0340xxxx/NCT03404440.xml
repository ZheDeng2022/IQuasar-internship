  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meta-analyses involving &gt;4000 subjects with probiotics added to antimicrobial Helicobacter&#xD;
      pylori eradication therapy in populations with antibiotic resistance have reported a mean&#xD;
      increase in eradication rate of 12.2%. It is unclear how to translate that result into&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether administration of Lactobacillus reuteri plus a PPI without antibiotics&#xD;
      would eradicate H. pylori infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized 2 site study of L. reuteri (2 x 108 CFU&#xD;
      L. reuteri DSM 17938 plus 2 x 108 CFU L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475) 7 times per day or matching&#xD;
      placebo plus 20 mg pantoprazole b.i.d. for 4 weeks. Cure was defined by negative 13C-UBT, 4&#xD;
      weeks after therapy. Sample size was based on obtaining &gt;50% cures to be clinically useful as&#xD;
      monotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aim of study This double-blind study will assess if the combination of PPI and a strain&#xD;
      combination (Gastrus) of L.reuteri can yield higher eradication rates if doses are increased&#xD;
      and dose interval shortened. The aim is to achieve at least 50% eradication as assessed by&#xD;
      UBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrus capsules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2x108 CFU Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 + 2x108 CFU Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo capsules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identical in shape, colour and taste to Gastrus capsules but without the Lactobacillus&#xD;
      reuteri components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both study products are delivered in identical containers containing 30 capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing Group 1: 1 Gastrus capsule 7 times per day + Pantoprazole 20 mg b.i.d. Group 2: 1&#xD;
      placebo capsule 7 times per day + Pantoprazole 20 mg b.i.d. One capsule of the Study Product&#xD;
      are to be taken every 2-3 hours 7 times per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Product containers will be collected at the day 28 visit and remaining tablets are&#xD;
      counted and compliance checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 mg Pantoprazole is to be taken just before breakfast and dinner (i.e. daily dose 80 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of treatment The optimal length of dosing needed is unknown. Saggioro and Francavilla&#xD;
      used 30 and 28 days respectively and Dore et al had a 60-day regimen. From a&#xD;
      practical/economical/tolerability point of view, a 28-day regimen is suggested in order to&#xD;
      shorten the time to triple-therapy for those non-eradicated. Those patients with H. pylori at&#xD;
      the second UBT/Endoscopy (i.e. treatment failures) will be offered standard eradication&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance, PP and ITT In order to be assessed as &quot;compliant&quot; the participant should have&#xD;
      consumed at least 75% (or other?) of the allotted doses. In order to improve compliance, the&#xD;
      participants will be equipped with alarm-devices. Compliant patients will be assessed as&#xD;
      Per-Protocol (PP). Patients that are non-compliant but have consumed at least one full day of&#xD;
      doses (i.e. 14 tablets) will be included in the Intention-To-Treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Primary efficacy parameter Number of H. pylori-eradicated at 9 weeks as evidenced by&#xD;
      Δ-13C-UBT &lt; 5 ppm. The difference between active and placebo treatment will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory parameters Changes in GSRS at 4 and 9 weeks as compared to baseline and between&#xD;
      groups. Changes of the gastric microbiota in the presence of PPI with or without Gastrus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Assuming that the spontaneous eradication is 5% or less, and that the&#xD;
      desired eradication rate on active treatment is &gt;50%, 23 subjects are needed in each group&#xD;
      with a power of 90% and a confidence level of 95%. To correct for potential drop-outs, 25&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited to each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical committee The study protocol will have to be approved by the local ethical committee&#xD;
      before study start. Once approved, a protocol summary will be posted on clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study flow and procedures Randomisation &amp; labelling Randomisation will be computerised using&#xD;
      the tool provided by randomizer.org. A third party not otherwise involved in the study will&#xD;
      label active and placebo Study Product. Randomisation lists will be kept in sealed envelopes&#xD;
      at the study sites and a sealed copy will also be kept at BioGaia. The envelopes may not be&#xD;
      open until all study data have been entered into the database and until the database has been&#xD;
      locked. However, see &quot;Serious Adverse Event&quot; below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be entered into the study sequentially by allocating the lowest available&#xD;
      remaining randomisation number to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Histology During endoscopy two biopsy specimens are taken from the antrum, one&#xD;
      from the angulus and two from the corpus. Hp-infection is defined as the presence of typical&#xD;
      histology and bacteria on histological examination of biopsies stained by H&amp;E and GIEMSA. One&#xD;
      additional biopsy from the corpus area is placed in PBS with 5% glycerol and stored at - 70&#xD;
      oC until further processing for microbiota analyses (see below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric microbiota analysis Bacterial DNA extraction and sequencing for microbiota analyses&#xD;
      is performed according to a standardised protocol (Willing BP et. al 2010). Analysis of&#xD;
      community structure focuses on sequencing of targeted regions e.g. the 16S rRNA gene using&#xD;
      the Illumina Miseq high-throughput sequencing platform. Sequences are finally processed with&#xD;
      the QIIME 1.8.0 pipeline (Caporaso JG et. al 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      13C-UBT According to standard protocol (Gatta L., et al. 2006). After the first UBT needed&#xD;
      for inclusion, a second UBT will be performed at 8-9 weeks (4-5 weeks after end of study&#xD;
      treatment) to assess Hp status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). Participants will be asked to fill out the GSRS&#xD;
      questionnaire after inclusion but before taking the first dose of study product, at 4 weeks&#xD;
      (end of treatment) and at 8-9 weeks (at follow-up UBT) (Svedlund J. et al. 1988) Data&#xD;
      collection The Principal Investigator will prepare one set of Case Record Forms (CRF) for&#xD;
      each patient in which all data pertinent to the study will be entered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods All efficacy parameters will be analysed according to both ITT and PP.&#xD;
      Safety considerations The investigator is responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects&#xD;
      who have entered the study. All adverse events (AE) occurring after any administration of the&#xD;
      study product will be followed to the end of the study or until resolution. AE will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the Investigator and reported in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse events, as defined below, must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of&#xD;
      when the investigator became aware of the SAE. It is also important to report all adverse&#xD;
      events that result in permanent discontinuation of the study product, whether serious or&#xD;
      non-serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable medical occurrence in a subject&#xD;
      administered a study product, regardless of causality assessment. An adverse event can&#xD;
      therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding),&#xD;
      symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study product, whether or not&#xD;
      considered related to the study product. All adverse events, including observed or&#xD;
      volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms are to be recorded on the case report form&#xD;
      (CRF). Each adverse event is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, and causal relationship&#xD;
      with the study product or other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects should be instructed to report any AE that they experience to the Investigator.&#xD;
      Investigators should assess for AE at each visit. AE occurring during the clinical trial,&#xD;
      including the follow-up period should be recorded on the appropriate AE CRF. To capture the&#xD;
      most potentially relevant safety information during a clinical trial, it is important that&#xD;
      investigators record accurate AE terms on CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If discernible at the time of completing an AE in CRF, a specific disease or syndrome rather&#xD;
      than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by the investigator and&#xD;
      recorded on the CRF. However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a&#xD;
      component of a specific disease or syndrome by the investigator, it should be recorded as a&#xD;
      separate AE on the CRF. Laboratory values will be collected on the laboratory CRF. Do not&#xD;
      enter changes from baseline in laboratory values on the AE CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that results in death is&#xD;
      immediately life threatening requires or prolongs hospitalisation results in persistent or&#xD;
      significant disability/incapacity is a medically significant event for any reason. Breaking&#xD;
      the randomisation code In case that the responsible investigator decides that the&#xD;
      randomisation code has to be revealed because that the AE may have been caused by the Study&#xD;
      Product and that un-blinding is of essence for the further treatment of the patient, the&#xD;
      following procedure will be followed: The responsible investigator will assign a professional&#xD;
      otherwise not involved in the study to un-blind the Study Product for the specific patient.&#xD;
      He/she will open the sealed envelope, find the relevant randomisation number and inform the&#xD;
      responsible investigator without revealing any other randomisation numbers. He/she will then&#xD;
      re-seal the envelope with transparent tape, date and sign on the tape.&#xD;
