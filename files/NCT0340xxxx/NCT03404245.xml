    <textblock>
      Self-management is a key component of successful chronic disease management and patients can&#xD;
      benefit from learning about how daily activities and treatments relate to their symptoms and&#xD;
      health status on an ongoing basis. The primary goal of this randomized controlled trial is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of an e-health intervention, OPERAS, which includes two components: 1)&#xD;
      the use of a newly developed web app to self-monitor symptoms/disease activity and treatment&#xD;
      use, and help patients identify when a medical visit or treatment change is needed; 2) remote&#xD;
      activity counselling provided by a physiotherapist, with the use of a wearable device&#xD;
      (Fitbit) and the app to provide activity level feedback. The app component of OPERAS is&#xD;
      hosted by the secure network of Arthritis Research Canada.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-management is a fundamental component in arthritis care, however, it is often neglected&#xD;
      as most models of arthritis care focus on early access to medical consultation and surgical&#xD;
      interventions. Patient self-management refers to the active participation of patients in a&#xD;
      variety of activities that contribute to lessening the physical and emotional impact of&#xD;
      illnesses. There are several factors attributing to a lack of self-management practice, such&#xD;
      as frustration from managing health on a trial-and-error basis, a lack of knowledge to&#xD;
      effectively monitor symptoms and disease, and being unsure about how to manage physical&#xD;
      activities without aggravating symptoms. The variety of risk factors highlight the need for a&#xD;
      multifaceted approach that provides support in terms of knowledge, skill development and&#xD;
      timely advice from health professionals, as well as motivational support for patients to be&#xD;
      engaged in their care and to stay physically active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective is to assess the efficacy of an e-health intervention, OPERAS, which&#xD;
      integrates the Arthritis Health Journal and a Physical Activity Counselling program, to&#xD;
      improve self-management ability. Our secondary objectives are to explore the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention on disease status and physical activity levels and to assess barriers to&#xD;
      implementation and sustainability of the e-health intervention in RA management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a mixed-methods approach, involving a RCT and in-depth interviews.&#xD;
      The proof-of-concept study will employ a stepped wedge RCT design, whereby the intervention&#xD;
      will be sequentially rolled out to participants over a number of time periods. The order in&#xD;
      which individuals receive the intervention will be determined at random. The strength of this&#xD;
      design is that it can properly address the efficacy question, while avoiding the dilemma of&#xD;
      withholding the intervention to some participants, as in a parallel group design.&#xD;

    <description>Patient Activation Measure is a 13-item self-reported measure of individuals' confidence in managing chronic diseases. Each item has a 4-point response (1 &quot;strongly disagree&quot;; 4 &quot;strongly agree&quot;), with the aggregate raw score converted to 0-100. Hibbard et al presented a 4-stage activation model derived from the standardized scores: 1) Believing an active role is important (PAM score &lt;47); 2) Having confidence and knowledge to take action (47.1 - 55.1); 3) Taking action (55.2 - 67); 4) Maintaining healthy behaviours despite setbacks (&gt; 67.1).</description>

    <description>Education, Fitbit/self-management web app, physiotherapist counselling. These 3 components will be delivered to the participants in Months 1 and 2. The session will include a short presentation about physical activity in everyday life, an individual goal-setting session with a registered PT, and an orientation to the Fitbit device and the web app. Participants will be provided access to a Fitbit and an app account. The PT will review physical activity goals with participants via bi-weekly phone calls and progressively modify their activities. In Month 3-6, participants will continue using Fitbit and the app and have access to a PT via email as needed, but no phone call. In Months 7-12, participants may keep their Fitbit and app account, but will not have access to a PT.</description>
