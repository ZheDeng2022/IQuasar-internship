      Prospective, randomized and controlled study who will be conducted at Maisonneuve-Rosemont&#xD;
      hospital with the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if an infusion of carbetocin over 10 minutes will reduce hemodynamic side&#xD;
      effects, especially the peak of heart rate, in comparison to a rapid intravenous bolus (less&#xD;
      than 2 seconds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if an infusion of carbetocin will reduce the other side effects of duratocin in&#xD;
      comparison to a rapid intravenous bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study plans to enroll 70 adult patients scheduled to undergo elective cesarean delivery under&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the patient will receive Carbetocin 100 mcg intravenous as a bolus (less than 2&#xD;
      seconds) and the other half will receive Carbetocin 100 mcg intravenous infusion over 10&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective pragmatic study is to determine if an infusion of carbetocin&#xD;
      over 10 minutes will reduce hemodynamic compromise in comparison to a rapid intravenous bolus&#xD;
      (less than 2 seconds) during elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective, randomized and controlled study, each parturient will enter the&#xD;
      operating room on the day scheduled for there surgery. All the classic monitors will be&#xD;
      installed, along with the Edwards (Clear sight system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive an antacid prophylaxis of 30 ml of sodium citrate per mouth 30 min&#xD;
      before surgery. Baseline measures of BP (blood pressure), HR (Heart Rate), O2 Arterial&#xD;
      Saturation will be taken before entering in the operating room, in a calm environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthetic technique will be standardized. Spinal anesthesia will be performed in the&#xD;
      sitting position by the anesthesiologist in charge of the patient, with the local anesthetic&#xD;
      injected between L2 to L5 spinal level. The anesthetic solution will consist of hyperbaric&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.75% 10.5 mg, fentanyl 15 μg, and morphine 150 μg with a Whitacre needle 25G ou&#xD;
      27G. Then, the patient will be immediately placed in the supine position, with a cushion&#xD;
      under their right hip or a left lateral tilt. Antibiotic prophylaxis will be administered to&#xD;
      each patient before incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient included in the study will have a phenylephrine infusion of 0.5 mcg/kg/min (lean&#xD;
      body weight) started immediately after the injection of local anesthetic. A bolus of&#xD;
      phenylephrine 1.5 mcg/kg (lean body weight) will be administered in case of a hypotensive&#xD;
      episode. A hypotensive episode will be defined as 2 consecutive Systolic BP (SBP)&#xD;
      measurements less than 20% below the baseline value. The treatment of hypotension consists of&#xD;
      Phenylephrine 1.5 mcg/kg intravenous bolus will be administered if HR &gt; 55 bpm or Ephedrine 5&#xD;
      mg intravenous bolus if HR is &lt; 55 bpm. If only the HR is &lt; 55 bpm, but SBP is normal,&#xD;
      Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intravenous bolus will be administered and the patient will be&#xD;
      excluded. In the case of a hypertensive episode, where systolic BP is &gt; 120% Baseline value,&#xD;
      treatment will consist of a decrease in the phenylephrine infusion rate by 0.2 mcg/kg/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, each patient included in the study will receive an intravenous volume co-load of&#xD;
      1000 ml of Lactate Ringer administered under pressure in 5 to 10 minutes immediately after&#xD;
      installing the intravenous catheter, and before and during the spinal anesthesia. Then, an&#xD;
      infusion of Lactate Ringer at 300 mL/h will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will begin after the confirmation of a sensory block to cold stimulus at the T4&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be realized with the Edwards monitor, and HR (Heart Rate), BP (Blood&#xD;
      Pressure), SV (Stroke Volume), SVV (Stroke Volume Variation), CO (Cardiac Output), SVR will&#xD;
      be taken continuously every 20 seconds. HR, BP, and pulse oxymetry values will also be&#xD;
      measured every 2.5 minutes with the applied standard monitoring, from the intrathecal&#xD;
      injection of the local anesthetic until the neonate is born. After the injection of the study&#xD;
      drug, those values will be measured every minute for 20 minutes (All these data are&#xD;
      electronically recorded every 5 seconds). Hemodynamic values recorded at skin incision will&#xD;
      be used as baseline values for comparison with hemodynamic measurements recorded over the 20&#xD;
      minutes following the beginning of study drug infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive Metoclopramide 10mg intravenously at the induction of anesthesia&#xD;
      for anti-emesis prophylaxis and Ondansetron 4 mg IV for intraoperative treatment of nausea&#xD;
      and/or vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of post-partum hemorrhage will be with the study drug carbetocin 100 mcg given&#xD;
      intravenously, either as a bolus or an infusion over 10 min, depending on the randomization.&#xD;
      Two syringes per subject will be prepared by the research nurse :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. one 3 ml syringe containing 1 ml of either carbetocin 100 mcg or normal saline same&#xD;
           volume (according to the patient's study group);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. one 10 ml syringe containing carbetocin 100 mcg (1 ml) diluted with 9 ml of normal&#xD;
           saline for a total volume of 10 ml, or 10 ml of normal saline (according to the&#xD;
           patient's study group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume in the 3 ml syringe will be injected as an IV push bolus after cord clamping and&#xD;
      the volume in the 10 ml syringe will be infused over 10 minutes at cord clamping. The study&#xD;
      subject, the attending anesthesiologist and the anesthesiologist collecting intraoperative&#xD;
      data will be blinded to patient group allocation. The research nurse will not be blinded to&#xD;
      patient group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uterine repair will be done in situ and not by exteriorization. In the eventuality that&#xD;
      the attending obstetrician proceeded to exteriorization of the uterus for safety reasons, the&#xD;
      patient would then be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine tone will be assessed by the attending obstetrician as adequate or inadequate at the&#xD;
      end of the 10 minutes study drug infusion. If uterine tone is judged inadequate, patient care&#xD;
      will be carried on by the attending anesthesiologist and obstetrician according to best&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines. These patients will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will be achieved by the ClearSight (Edwards) system. It will start before&#xD;
      the uterine incision and will continue until 20 minutes after the beginning of the carbetocin&#xD;
      (or normal saline) 10 minutes infusion.&#xD;
