      Hemorrhoidal disease diagnosis is based on medical history combined with physical exam and&#xD;
      complementary exam. Physical exam should include inspection at exertion, digital rectal exam&#xD;
      ,and anoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment indicated in patients with hemorrhoidal disease varies according to the disease&#xD;
      grade, and it may be clinical or surgical. The classic surgical approach is an open surgical&#xD;
      correction , a technique that has high success rates and low recurrence rates; however, it is&#xD;
      accompanied by intense pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the concept that hemorrhoids are formed by pathological changes in submucosal pads&#xD;
      vascularization in anal channel transition zone, selective embolization of upper rectal&#xD;
      artery branches were performed in 14 patients with long-term severe rectal bleeding secondary&#xD;
      to hemorrhoidal disease by Vidal et al. with no pain or ischemic symptoms being seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main Objective To determine the feasibility of implementing upper rectal artery&#xD;
           embolization in the treatment of patients with grade 2 (protrude beyond the anal verge&#xD;
           with straining or defecating but reduce spontaneously) and 3 hemorrhoids (protrude&#xD;
           spontaneously or with straining and require manual reduction), relating its short- and&#xD;
           long-term outcomes with patients undergoing surgical repair through the classic&#xD;
           technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis The expectation is that, with upper rectal artery embolization, patients&#xD;
           experience a decrease or remission of symptoms, such as bleeding, pain and symptoms&#xD;
           related to hemorrhoidal pads edema. Another expectation is that the decrease in the&#xD;
           number of days to return to daily activities&#xD;

      Proposal description 1.1. Hemorrhoids: Epidemiology, Clinical Presentation and Diagnostic&#xD;
      Assessment: In the normal anal channel, there are three highly-vascularized areas (pads),&#xD;
      forming slight masses in the submucosa made of blood vessels, smooth muscle and elastic and&#xD;
      connective tissue, and are located at the left lateral, right anterior and right posterior&#xD;
      quadrants, and contribute in anal continence . The term hemorrhoids refers to clinical&#xD;
      situations where these hypervascularized pads are abnormal and cause clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact disease prevalence of symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease is difficult to establish,&#xD;
      since many symptomatic patients do not seek an assessment, while others assign varied&#xD;
      anorectal symptoms as being resulting from hemorrhoids. Some series estimate prevalence&#xD;
      between 4 and 40 %. Although many patients will exhibit symptomatic hemorrhoids along life,&#xD;
      the peak incidence occurs between 45 and 65 years old and its development prior to 20 years&#xD;
      old is rarely frequent . Among the factors related to a higher risk of developing the disease&#xD;
      are: pregnancy, white race, females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhoids may be divided as external and internal. External hemorrhoids are covered by&#xD;
      anoderm (richly enervated layer), are located distally to the dentate line and their main&#xD;
      symptoms are edema, causing discomfort and difficult local hygiene, which may also exhibit an&#xD;
      intense pain when thrombosed. Internal hemorrhoids are located proximally to the dentate line&#xD;
      and are lined with poorly enervated anorectal mucosa, and rarely cause pain, except when&#xD;
      thrombosed and combined with prolapse and necrosis; often their symptoms are prolapse and&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internal hemorrhoids may be subdivided into 4 grades: grade 1 are defined by a protuberance&#xD;
      in anal channel and may show prolapse beyond the dentate line at great exertion; grade 2 are&#xD;
      hemorrhoids prolapsing beyond the dentate line at exertion, but reduced spontaneously; grade&#xD;
      3 are hemorrhoids prolapsing beyond the dentate line, requiring manual reduction; and grade 4&#xD;
      are defined by non-reducing prolapsed hemorrhoids, being at risk of strangulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhoidal disease diagnosis is based on medical history combined with physical exam and&#xD;
      complementary exam. Physical exam should include inspection at exertion, digital rectal exam&#xD;
      (which allows an assessment of internal and external hemorrhoids, anal channel tonus&#xD;
      assessment, in addition to excluding other diseases, such as neoplasm and sphincter spasm)&#xD;
      and anoscopy. Among complementary tests, flexible rectal sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, barium&#xD;
      enema may be requested at complementary diagnosis, mainly to rule out other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Hemorrhoids: conventional treatment: non-surgical and surgical&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment indicated in patients with hemorrhoidal disease varies according to the disease&#xD;
      grade, and it may be clinical or surgical. Non-surgical management is indicated for patients&#xD;
      with internal and external hemorrhoids (grade 1 to 4) and consists in better local hygiene,&#xD;
      avoiding excessive exertion and improving food habits (including more fibers in the diet),&#xD;
      combined or not with laxative drugs. Patients with prolapsed external or internal hemorrhoids&#xD;
      may further benefit from the combination of clinical measures and more invasive measures such&#xD;
      as rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy and electrocoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical management is best indicated in patients failing clinical measures and patients with&#xD;
      grade 3 and 4 hemorrhoids, and is indicated in about 10% of cases . The classic surgical&#xD;
      approach is an open surgical correction through Milligan and Morgan technique, which&#xD;
      comprised resection and ligation as high as possible of the three arterial pedicles feeding&#xD;
      the hemorrhoids, a technique that has high success rates and low recurrence rates; however,&#xD;
      it is accompanied by intense pain ( with pain scale in the first 24 hours of approximately&#xD;
      6.1 ± 1.5; in the first evacuation 4.5 ± 1.5) and a prolonged recovery period to return to&#xD;
      normal activities (6.95 ± 3.6 days). Currently, two less invasive new techniques with less&#xD;
      intense post-operative pain were proposed: anopexy with circular stapler (Longo's technique-&#xD;
      which consists of interrupting the superior rectal branches and resecting the rectal mucosal&#xD;
      ring, it is less invasive, but not free from complications which may range from urinary&#xD;
      retention (1.9 to 5%) rectal-vaginal fistulae, bleedings requiring blood transfusion (1.5 a&#xD;
      9%), external hemorrhoidal thrombosis (1.2 a 4.7%) and perforations) and Doppler-guided&#xD;
      elective ligation of hemorrhoidal artery through endoanal access ; however, these have a&#xD;
      recurrence higher than 10% and complications from 6 to 22% of cases such as: bleeding,&#xD;
      urinary retention, hematoma in the submucosa, fissure, abscess. Both techniques are&#xD;
      associated with reduction of arterial flow with subsequent reduction of hemorrhoids .&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Hemorrhoids: Hemorrhoidal Artery Embolization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the concept that hemorrhoids are formed by pathological changes in submucosal pads&#xD;
      vascularization in anal channel transition zone, Galkin in 1994 reported the first cases of&#xD;
      treating hemorrhoidal disease through embolization of upper hemorrhoidal branches in 34&#xD;
      patients, without recurrence after 24 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Vidal et al 2014 describe the &quot;emborrhoid&quot; technique, consisting in super selective&#xD;
      embolization of upper rectal artery branches. &quot;Emborrhoid&quot; technique was performed through&#xD;
      right common femoral artery puncture (inserting a 5Fr introducer) and catheterization of&#xD;
      lower mesenteric artery with a Simmons catheter, followed by a super selective&#xD;
      catheterization of lower rectal arteries with a microcatheter and embolization with Nester&#xD;
      0.018 coils with 2 and 3 mm of diameter and 3-cm long. This technique was performed in 14&#xD;
      patients with long-term severe rectal bleeding secondary to hemorrhoidal disease grades 2 (10&#xD;
      patients), 3 (3 patients) and 4 (1 patient) who were not candidates to other clinical or&#xD;
      surgical therapies after a multidisciplinary discussion . The technical success was seen in a&#xD;
      100% of cases. After a follow-up between 2 and 13 months, clinical success (no bleeding or&#xD;
      minimum bleeding and well tolerated by the patient) occurred in 72% (10/14) of cases, with no&#xD;
      pain or ischemic symptoms being seen. Four patients experienced new bleeding, of these, 2&#xD;
      underwent a new embolization and 2 refused further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moussa et al performed upper rectal arteries embolization with the &quot;emborrhoid&quot; technique&#xD;
      described by Vidal et al in 30 patients with hemorrhoidal disease and an immediate technical&#xD;
      success was observed in 93% of cases, with no pain in the postoperative period and absence of&#xD;
      complications related to puncture site or ischemic, such as rectal ulceration, anal fissure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3.1. Complications Related to Conventional Surgical Treatment The possible early&#xD;
      complications related to conventional surgical treatments are pain, urinary retention&#xD;
      (2-36%), intestinal constipation, bleeding (0.03- 6%) and infection (0.5-5.5%). And the late&#xD;
      complications may include anal incontinence (flatulence and / or stools- 2-12%) and anal&#xD;
      stenosis (0-6%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3.2 Complications Related to Upper Rectal Artery Embolization: The possible complications&#xD;
      related to upper rectal artery embolization relate to the puncture site and potential rectal&#xD;
      ischemia. However, with the use of coils, this risk is decreased, since it does not cause&#xD;
      distal embolization, as per Vidal et al, who reported 14 cases of coil embolization at upper&#xD;
      rectal arteries, with no rectal ischemia symptoms seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Study Objectives: Main Objective To determine the feasibility of implementing upper rectal&#xD;
      artery embolization in the treatment of patients with grade 2 (protrude beyond the anal verge&#xD;
      with straining or defecating but reduce spontaneously) and 3 hemorrhoids (protrude&#xD;
      spontaneously or with straining and require manual reduction), relating its short- and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes with patients undergoing surgical repair through the classic technique&#xD;
      (Milligan and Morgan technique).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The expectation is that, with upper rectal artery embolization, patients&#xD;
      experience a decrease or remission of symptoms, such as bleeding, pain and symptoms related&#xD;
      to hemorrhoidal pads edema. Another expectation is that the decrease in the number of days to&#xD;
      return to daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Materials and Methods This project will be developed by using the &quot;Emborrhoid&quot; technique&#xD;
      described by Vidal et al. , consisting in upper rectal artery embolization with coils for&#xD;
      patients with hemorrhoidal disease exhibiting chronic bleeding, and it has been shown to be&#xD;
      safe and efficient .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project will be developed together with the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein&#xD;
      - Morumbi Unit and the Vila Santa Catarina Municipal Hospital, with patients recruited from&#xD;
      grade 2 and 3 hemorrhoidal disease patients requiring surgical treatment referred to Hospital&#xD;
      Vila Santa Catarina-Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein who accept to take part in the&#xD;
      research protocol. Patients will undergo a detailed clinical and proctological evaluation, in&#xD;
      addition to colonoscopy, and will then be assigned to 2 groups with 20 patients each&#xD;
      (embolization or conventional surgical treatment groups) in a random way. Patients assigned&#xD;
      to embolization group will be referred to the hemodynamics department of Hospital Israelita&#xD;
      Albert Einstein - Morumbi Unit to undergo upper hemorrhoidal artery embolization, by an&#xD;
      experienced interventional radiology team (&gt;5 years of experience) and patients assigned to&#xD;
      conventional surgical treatment group will be treated at Hospital Vila Santa Catarina by an&#xD;
      experienced proctologists team (&gt; 10 years of experience).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be performed with visits at post-operative days 7 and 30 , as well as&#xD;
      telephone calls at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients will fill out a questionnaire at home&#xD;
      during the first week, to evaluate their pain symptoms through the Visual Analogue Scale, at&#xD;
      the following moments: first evacuation, first and third days, and report the number and&#xD;
      number of times it was necessary to use analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Inclusion Criteria Male and female patients aged above 18 years old, with internal&#xD;
      and/or external hemorrhoids experiencing clinical symptoms (anemia, persistent / recurrent&#xD;
      bleeding hemorrhoidal source&gt; 3 months, episodes of recurrent hemorrhoidal thrombosis (&gt; 2&#xD;
      episodes) or associated the symptoms of hemorrhoidal disease) with surgical indication and&#xD;
      contraindication of band ligation and / or photocoagulation infrared accepting the items&#xD;
      pointed in the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Exclusion Criteria Patients with contraindications for angiogram performance (allergy to&#xD;
      intravenous contrast), patients with aortic atherosclerosis (femoral pulse and difference&#xD;
      Doppler angiography or with stenosis 20%) patients in the daily use of NSAIDs or weak opioids&#xD;
      or who refuse to take part in this project will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4. Study Dynamics Patients from conventional surgical treatment group will undergo the&#xD;
      standard treatment for hemorrhoidal disease at Hospital Vila Santa Catarina and patients from&#xD;
      embolization group will be referred to Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, where they will&#xD;
      undergo pelvic angiogram, assessing possible anatomical variations, followed by a super&#xD;
      selective catheterization of upper rectal artery branches and coil embolization of these&#xD;
      branches, followed by a controlled pelvic angiography and compression for 30 minutes of the&#xD;
      puncture site after the end of the procedure. After the procedure, the rates of technical&#xD;
      success and early and intermediate-term clinical success will be assessed, as well as&#xD;
      potential complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5. Sample Calculation Based on the literature, the expected value of pain given by the&#xD;
      visual analogue scale on the first 10 days of surgery was 4.2 in patients submitted to&#xD;
      hemorrhoidectomy using the classic Milligan-Morgan technique, with the variability of 2.24&#xD;
      (DP = 2,24 pontos) . It is expected patients who underwent the procedure present a maximum of&#xD;
      2 points at pain scale in the same period. With an 80% of power and 95% confidence - it's&#xD;
      only required 20 subjects for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6. Randomization Allocation of patients in the 2 groups will be performed through&#xD;
      randomization, in blocks consisting of 4 individuals in each block, in order to reduce the&#xD;
      variability and potential confounding between the 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients should be given informed consents&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Ethical Considerations 5.1. Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating researcher will ensure that this program will be conducted in full&#xD;
      compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and all local and national regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2. Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.1 Adverse Events and Complications Graduation Criteria Adverse events and complications&#xD;
      were classified according to the terminology criteria of the National Institutes of Health&#xD;
      (NIH) (4.0; edition 28.05.2009 version).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.2. DSMB - Data Safety Monitoring Board The primary safety result of the study (local&#xD;
      complications of puncture site and rectal ischemia) will be reviewed by an independent Data&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board, composed of at least one general surgeon / proctologist and one&#xD;
      interventional vascular radiologist. In locu analyzes will be performed at every 10 patients&#xD;
      submitted to treatment (according to the randomization of the groups). The meeting will be&#xD;
      programmed according to the recruitment and will be schedule with the inclusion of 1/4, 1/2,&#xD;
      3/4 of the participants (10 participants, 20 participants, 30 participants respectively)&#xD;
