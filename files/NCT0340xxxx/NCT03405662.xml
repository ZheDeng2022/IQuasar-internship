  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photobiomodulation (PBM) describes the use of near-infrared light (which is not visible to&#xD;
      the eye) to heal and protect tissue that has either been injured, is degenerating, or else is&#xD;
      at risk of dying. Research suggests that the light delivered during PBM enhances the body's&#xD;
      biochemical ability to store and use energy and increase blood flow, which triggers the&#xD;
      body's natural healing processes. The goal of this study is to determine if PBM administered&#xD;
      transcranially (through the scalp and skull) and intranasally (inside the nose) has an effect&#xD;
      on cognitive function and behavioral symptoms in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The&#xD;
      study will also examine whether PBM has an effect on biomarkers of AD in the blood and spinal&#xD;
      fluid of patients with AD. A biomarker is a specific physical trait used to measure the&#xD;
      progress of a disease or condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by the loss of&#xD;
      higher brain function such as memory, problem-solving abilities, and language.&#xD;
      Photobiomodulation (PBM) describes a kind of light therapy that uses red or near-infrared&#xD;
      light to stimulate, heal, regenerate, and protect tissue that has either been injured, is&#xD;
      degenerating, or else is at risk of dying. The pathological hallmarks of AD include senile&#xD;
      plaques rich in β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles composed of&#xD;
      hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau). In animal models of AD, PBM reduces the size and number of&#xD;
      brain Aβ plaques, p-tau, and neurofibrillary tangles. PBM also mitigates behavioral deficits&#xD;
      in transgenic AD mouse models and humans with dementia. The goal of this sham-controlled&#xD;
      pilot trial is to investigate the effects of PBM on the cognitive function, behavioral&#xD;
      symptoms, and fluid (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood) biomarkers of AD pathology&#xD;
      including amyloid burden, tangle pathology, axonal injury, microglia activation/inflammation,&#xD;
      and neurotrophic factors in 16 patients with biomarkers-supported probable Alzheimer's&#xD;
      dementia, according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and&#xD;
      Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One aim of the study is to examine the effect PMB on cognitive function and behavioral&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with probable AD. A second aim is to examine the effects of 16 weeks of&#xD;
      PBM on fluid biomarkers of inflammation (i.e., monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and 3&#xD;
      [MCP-1 and MCP-3] and macrophage inflammatory protein 1β [MIP-1β]), neurodegeneration (i.e.,&#xD;
      ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 [UCH-L1] and neurofilament light chain&#xD;
      [NfL]) and neurotrophic factors (i.e., vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] and&#xD;
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF]). The final aim of the study is to explore the&#xD;
      relationship between cognitive and behavioral changes after 16 weeks of PBM with changes in&#xD;
      biomarkers of inflammation, neurotrophic factors, and neurodegeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixteen patients with biomarkers-supported probable Alzheimer's dementia will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to an active or sham PBM group. All patients will be asked to use the&#xD;
      Vielight Neuro Gamma (real or sham) device for 20 minutes/day, every other day, for 16 weeks.&#xD;
      Randomization with blind assignment will be determined by a computer-generated random&#xD;
      allocation. Upon completion of the post-treatment assessments, the Sham-treated patients will&#xD;
      be offered an opportunity to use an active Vielight Neuro Gamma device for 16 weeks. We will&#xD;
      assess cognition and behavioral symptoms in Sham patients who opt to undergo active PBM 16&#xD;
      weeks after they start the active PBM treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker measures will be assessed in all study participants at baseline and after 16 weeks&#xD;
      of PBM. Biomarkers will be obtained through a blood draw and lumbar puncture. A lumbar&#xD;
      puncture (also called a spinal tap) is a procedure to collect cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF),&#xD;
      which surrounds the brain and spinal cord. During a lumbar puncture, a needle is carefully&#xD;
      inserted into the spinal canal low in the back (lumbar area).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive and behavioral function will be assessed in all study participants at baseline and&#xD;
      after 16 weeks of PBM. Study partners (e.g., caregivers) will be asked to answer questions&#xD;
      about the study participant's memory and daily functioning at baseline and after 16 weeks of&#xD;
      PBM. Study partners will also be trained and ask to help the study partners administer PBM&#xD;
      treatments with the Vielight Neuro Gamma device at home for 16 weeks.&#xD;
