      This study is designed to investigate belzutifan as a treatment for VHL disease associated&#xD;
      RCC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label Phase 2 study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of belzutifan in&#xD;
      participants with VHL disease who have at least 1 measurable RCC tumor. Belzutifan will be&#xD;
      administered orally and treatment will be continuous. Participants will be evaluated&#xD;
      radiologically approximately 12 weeks after initiation of treatment and every 12 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter while continuing in the study. Changes in VHL disease-associated non-RCC tumors&#xD;
      will also be evaluated.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) in VHL Disease-Associated RCC Tumors</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a best confirmed response of Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). ORR will be assessed by independent review committee (ICR) for the primary analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR) in VHL Disease-Associated RCC Tumors</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>

Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD.</description>

    <measure>Time to Response (TTR) in VHL Disease-Associated RCC Tumors</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>TTR is defined as the interval from the start of study treatment to the first documentation of a response per RECIST 1.1, and calculated for participants with a best confirmed response of CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) in VHL Disease-Associated RCC Tumors</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the interval from the start of study treatment to the first documented PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD.</description>
