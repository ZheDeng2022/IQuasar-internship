    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed informed consent form (ICF) indicating that the subject has been informed of&#xD;
             the procedures to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives,&#xD;
             potential benefits, side effects, risks, and discomforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Men or non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding women 16 to 55 years-of-age who are able to&#xD;
             read and understand written and spoken local language.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinical diagnosis of IGE (including, but not limited to, CAE, JAE, juvenile myoclonic&#xD;
             epilepsy, or Jeavons syndrome) with absence seizures consistent with the International&#xD;
             League against Epilepsy Revised Classification of Seizures (2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Absence seizures persisting despite standard of care (SOC) treatment, defined as&#xD;
             treatment with at least 2 AEDs appropriate for the patient's epilepsy syndrome. SOC&#xD;
             failure, per investigator discretion, will be defined as insufficient clinical&#xD;
             response or intolerable side effects, which precludes use of the appropriate AED.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Observation of at least 3 instances of generalized discharges of approximately 2.5 - 4&#xD;
             Hz lasting ≥2 seconds via 24-hour ambulatory EEG (centrally reviewed), with&#xD;
             approximately 75% normal background based on age and medication use per the central&#xD;
             EEG reader's discretion. Intermittent focal spikes are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. On stable doses of one or more antiepileptic medication(s) for at least 30 days. If a&#xD;
             subject is not on medication, adequate documentation justifying lack of therapy may be&#xD;
             acceptable for the subject after sponsor review. Ketogenic, modified Atkins diet&#xD;
             (MAD), or low glycemic diet with stable carbohydrate ratio for at least 30 days before&#xD;
             screening is an acceptable antiepileptic therapy. Vagal nerve stimulation at stable&#xD;
             settings (for at least 30 days before screening), without use of the magnet, is also&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Body weight ≥ 45 kg at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with reproductive capability including all males and women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential (WOCBP) must agree to practice continuous abstinence or adequate&#xD;
             contraception methods (appropriate double barrier method or oral, patch, implant, or&#xD;
             injectable contraception) from as soon as feasible during screening period until at&#xD;
             least 30 days after the last dose (i.e., intermittent abstinence based on &quot;rhythm&quot;,&#xD;
             temperature monitoring, or other means of timing is not acceptable). WOCBP include any&#xD;
             woman who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical&#xD;
             sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, and/or bilateral oophorectomy)&#xD;
             or is not post-menopausal. Post-menopausal is defined as amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive&#xD;
             months without another cause, and a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
             (FSH) level ≥ 35 mIU/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male subjects with a partner of child-bearing potential must be surgically sterilized&#xD;
             or be willing to use condoms with spermicide from as soon as feasible during screening&#xD;
             period until at least 30 days after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Able and willing to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests,&#xD;
             and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Approval by the sponsor medical personnel or delegate as to final eligibility for the&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Presence of severe intellectual disability, severe autism spectrum disorder, or severe&#xD;
