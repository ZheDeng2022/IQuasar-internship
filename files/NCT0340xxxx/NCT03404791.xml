    <description>Participants will receive the TAR-200 transuretherally on Day 0 in to the bladder through an Inserter and gradually releases gemcitabine during the 21-day indwelling period before being removed on Day 21 via flexible or rigid cystoscopy. Participants will undergo an 84-day induction period comprised of four consecutive 21-day dosing cycles. Participants may undergo 21 day cycle every 3 months for a maximum of 3 cycles as maintenance (Up to 14 months). Each TAR-200 system will be removed at 21 days after insertion.</description>
