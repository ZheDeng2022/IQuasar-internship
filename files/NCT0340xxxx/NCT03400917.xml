      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II clinical trial in which approximately 55 patients&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) will be enrolled with the intent to receive an&#xD;
      autologous dendritic cell vaccine consisting of autologous dendritic cells loaded with&#xD;
      autologous tumor-associated antigens (AV-GBM-1).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II clinical trial in which approximately 55 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled with the intent to receive AV-GBM-1. Patients eligible for treatment will be&#xD;
      those (1) who have recovered from surgery such that they are about to begin concurrent&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CT/RT), (2) for whom an autologous tumor cell line has&#xD;
      been established, (3) have a KPS of &gt; 70, and (4) have undergone successful leukapheresis&#xD;
      from which peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained that can be used to&#xD;
      generate dendritic cells (DC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this trial is overall survival (OS), death from any cause measured&#xD;
      from the date of study enrollment for treatment with AV-GBM-1. Secondary endpoints will&#xD;
      include (1) PFS measured from date of enrollment, (2) OS/PFS measured from date of diagnosis&#xD;
      and (3) OS/PFS from date of enrollment based on KPS, age, and extent of surgical resection.&#xD;
      Tertiary endpoints will include (1) OS/PFS from date of first injection and (2) OS/PFS from&#xD;
      date of first injection in patients who completed concurrent CT/RT and had not progressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: Patients 18 years or older with newly diagnosed glioblastoma [World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV glioma, Grade IV anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma or&#xD;
      gliosarcoma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)] who have recovered from surgery, for whom an&#xD;
      autologous tumor cell culture and leukapheresis product are available, who have a KPS of &gt;&#xD;
      70, and who are about to begin concurrent CT/RT.&#xD;
