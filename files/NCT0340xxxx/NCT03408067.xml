  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In several hospital clinical trials, the nutritional intervention has been proven to be&#xD;
      effective in preventing and/or reducing malnutrition. Therefore, a procedure to identify the&#xD;
      risk of malnutrition or malnourishment in hospitalized patients is necessary to guarantee an&#xD;
      adequate and timely nutritional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: to compare two validated nutritional screening tools: NRS 2002 and SGA. These are used&#xD;
      to identify the risk of malnutrition or malnourishment in hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: The study is currently carried out at the Federico II University&#xD;
      Hospital of Naples, Italy. The in patients admitted in the Clinical Wards since September&#xD;
      2016 are being evaluated. The two screening test results and the assessment of the patients'&#xD;
      parameters are collected within 72 hours following admission. Age, sex, height, weight, Body&#xD;
      Mass Index (BMI), calf circumference and dominant hand of the participants are being noted.&#xD;
      Venous blood samples are collected for routine biochemistry and inflammatory parameters ; all&#xD;
      measurements are determined by routine laboratory methods at the Department of Laboratory&#xD;
      Medicine of the University Hospital Federico II, Naples.&#xD;

      In several hospital clinical trials, the nutritional intervention has been proven to be&#xD;
      effective in preventing and/or reducing malnutrition. Therefore, a procedure to identify the&#xD;
      risk of malnutrition or malnourishment in hospitalized patients is necessary to guarantee an&#xD;
      adequate and timely nutritional treatment. It is mandatory for clinics and health services to&#xD;
      perform the screening test for the evaluation of the nutritional status and need in&#xD;
      hospitalized patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The first aim of this study is to compare two validated nutritional screening tools:&#xD;
      Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) and Subjective Global Assessment (SGA). These are&#xD;
      used to identify the risk of malnutrition or malnourishment in hospitalized patients. The&#xD;
      second aim is to evaluate possible correlations between the tests score and body composition&#xD;
      parameters (phase angle of the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, BIA), handgrip strength and&#xD;
      biochemical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: The study is currently carried out at the Federico II University&#xD;
      Hospital of Naples, Italy. The inpatients admitted in the Clinical Wards coming from the&#xD;
      Emergency Room of the Hospital since September 2016 are being evaluated. The two screening&#xD;
      test results and the assessment of the patients' parameters are collected within 72 hours&#xD;
      following admission. The SGA and NRS 2002 are administered separately. Age, sex, height,&#xD;
      weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), calf circumference and dominant hand of the participants are&#xD;
      being noted. Venous blood samples are collected for routine biochemistry and inflammatory&#xD;
      parameters (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen) early in the morning in the fasting state; all&#xD;
      measurements are determined by routine laboratory methods at the Department of Laboratory&#xD;
      Medicine of the University Hospital Federico II, Naples.&#xD;
