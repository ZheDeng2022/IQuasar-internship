    <textblock>
      The objectives of this pilot study are to evaluate the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      intramyocardial injection of autologous c-kit+ cells during the Stage II BDCPA operation and&#xD;
      to observe effects on clinical outcome including right ventricular myocardial function,&#xD;
      severity of tricuspid regurgitation, incidence of serious adverse events,&#xD;
      re-hospitalizations, changes in health status, the need for transplantation, or mortality.&#xD;
