  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to seek academic/non-industry research funding support to&#xD;
      independently investigate the incidence and density of lens glistenings in cataract patients&#xD;
      who are implanted with the latest generations of intraocular lenses (IOL) manufactured by&#xD;
      Alcon and AMO Medical Optics.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glistenings are tiny, clear sparkling, fluid-filled microvacuoles that form within a lens&#xD;
      after it has been placed in the eye. Glistenings are seen in all lenses but certain lenses&#xD;
      develop a higher number of glistenings than others. The effect of glistenings on patients'&#xD;
      visual functioning is largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of glistenings is in part related to the manufacturing technique. In 2013,&#xD;
      manufacturers have claimed that recent improvements in manufacturing process have reduced the&#xD;
      occurrence of glistenings. There is a lack of independent evaluation of this claim. We would&#xD;
      like to assess independently: 1) How frequently do glistenings occur in patients implanted&#xD;
      with the 2015 generation lenses? 2) Is there a difference in glistening occurrence between&#xD;
      lenses manufactured by Alcon and Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) - the two largest companies in&#xD;
      eye care products?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-hundred and seventy-six patients will be randomly assigned to receive Alcon or AMO lenses&#xD;
      for their cataract surgery at the Kensington Eye Institute (KEI). After surgery, patients&#xD;
      will be instructed to return for follow-up visits at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months and 18&#xD;
      months to assess for the occurrence of glistenings. If glistenings are observed at an earlier&#xD;
      follow-up visit (e.g., the 6 month visit), patients will still be instructed to come for&#xD;
      future visits so that changes in the glistenings over time can be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Time-line:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Months 1-8: Participants recruiting, surgical operations, follow-up visits. Months 9-24:&#xD;
      follow-up visits, data entry, cleaning and analysis, early results presentation, manuscript&#xD;
      preparation and final report.&#xD;

    <description>To determine if glistenings develop, eyes are dilated and examined. Photographs of the IOLs will be taken with a slit lamp camera for documentation. These photographs will then be assessed for glistenings in two ways: first by trained ophthalmology staff, and second using the ImageJ software&#xD;
Glistenings will be counted and graded on a scale of 0 to 5+ as following:&#xD;
0. No glistening&#xD;
Less than 10 glistenings&#xD;
10 to 25 glistenings&#xD;
25 to 50 glistenings&#xD;
50 to 100 glistenings&#xD;
