      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When people see and hear, the brain changes signals from the eyes and ears into perceptions&#xD;
      and thoughts. No one fully understands how this happens. Researchers want to explore how&#xD;
      healthy brains process sights and sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore how people understand what they see and hear when the brain processes sights and&#xD;
      sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-65 who have at least 20/40 vision in at least one eye and do not use a hearing&#xD;
      aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will take tests online anonymously. They will do computer tasks related to&#xD;
      colors and behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-person participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires and vision and hearing tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will plan how many testing sessions they will have and when. Sessions last 2-5&#xD;
      hours. They may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Magnets and radio waves to take pictures of the brain.&#xD;
      Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of a tube. They will do a task during&#xD;
      the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetoencephalography: Records magnetic field changes from brain activity. Participants will&#xD;
      sit or lie down. A cone will be lowered onto their head. They may do a task during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electromyography: Electrodes attached to the skin will measure the electrical activity of&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalogram: Electrodes on the scalp will record brain waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiography: Electrodes on the chest will record heart electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of memory, attention, thinking, vision, and hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye Tracking: Cameras will follow participants eye movements. They may wear a cap with&#xD;
      infrared cameras in front of their eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the sessions, participants vital signs may be monitored.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiments covered by this protocol aim to uncover basic knowledge about the normal&#xD;
      brain mechanisms that give rise to perception and cognition. The protocol encompasses&#xD;
      sub-studies in healthy volunteers ( participants ) to uncover behaviors and their&#xD;
      physiological basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol includes only non- or minimally-invasive techniques with minimal risk, including&#xD;
      psychophysics, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG),&#xD;
      genetic testing, and on-line tests using Amazon s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The overarching&#xD;
      goal of the research is to obtain new knowledge in the organization and operation of cortical&#xD;
      circuits involved in visual and auditory perception. The protocol covers six specific&#xD;
      inter-related aims, with specific sub-studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neurophysiological Mechanisms for Color&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Object-Color Associations (Color Memory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Connectivity of Functionally-Defined Regions&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Homologies between Monkeys and Humans&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Functional Organization of Sound Perception and Visual-Auditory Integration&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Multi-stability in Color Perception&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteer participants aged 18-65, who are in good general health and have normal or&#xD;
      corrected-to-normal vision will be recruited from the local community and studied under this&#xD;
      minimal risk protocol. We plan to recruit up to 200 in-person participants and up to 10,000&#xD;
      on-line volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some sub-studies, the same subject will be asked to participate in tasks involving fMRI,&#xD;
      MEG and psychophysics, and multiple sessions of each, so that we can control for individual&#xD;
      differences in relating the outcomes of each experimental technique. In other sub-studies,&#xD;
      participation in multiple tasks will not be required. The extent of the participant&#xD;
      involvement, and what they will be asked to do, will be clearly disclosed during consent, as&#xD;
      indicated in the consent documents. Brain activity of healthy human volunteers will be&#xD;
      monitored by fMRI and/or MEG. Anatomical MRI will be collected in some subjects to allow&#xD;
      better localization of brain dynamics. Behavioral tests will be conducted using standard&#xD;
      psychophysical approaches, involving presentation of visual and/or auditory stimuli while&#xD;
      eye-movements are monitored using non-invasive eye tracking (such as with an infra-red camera&#xD;
      directed at the participant s eyes). Subjects will be shown simple visual stimuli such as&#xD;
      blobs, stripes and spirals in assorted colors, moving dots, checkerboards, and every-day&#xD;
      images and video clips, such as of fruit rolling on a table cloth, faces, and scenery&#xD;
      recorded in a car. Auditory stimuli will include every-day sounds such as birds singing,&#xD;
      conversation, whispering, footsteps, car engines, and animal vocalizations, presented within&#xD;
      normal sound limits (60- 90 dB). We will not use provocative or sexually explicit images,&#xD;
      clips or sounds. During fMRI and MEG sessions, subjects will be asked to free view, passively&#xD;
      fixate, or engage in an attentional task during fixation, such as reporting with an eye&#xD;
      movement or button press occasions when two images of the same category are presented&#xD;
      sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance on behavioral tasks and brain activity (fMRI and MEG) will be combined to yield&#xD;
      information about the neural correlates and processes underlying different aspects of the&#xD;
      human neural visual processing stream including color perception, attention, visual&#xD;
      discrimination and object/face/place recognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. MRI: to analyze measures such as the anatomical structures of the brain (using structural&#xD;
      MRI); amplitude of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal &amp; using fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. MEG: to quantify measures such as power spectrum, event- or task-related potentials,&#xD;
      synchronization/desynchronization, and coherence between sensors or sources located close to&#xD;
      the brain areas of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Behavioral measures: to quantify measures such as hit rate, reaction times, thresholds,&#xD;
      similarity judgments, associations, naming (such as names for color stimuli and sounds) and&#xD;
      eye movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We may measure autonomic data during the course of the experiment (such as heart rate,&#xD;
      respiration, end-tidal CO2, skin conductance), which will be correlated with the outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
