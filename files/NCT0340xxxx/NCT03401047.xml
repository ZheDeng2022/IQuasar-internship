      The purpose of this study is to determine if estradiol augmentation of luteinizing hormone&#xD;
      (LH) secretion secretion (primary endpoint) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion&#xD;
      (secondary endpoint) is reduced in adult women with polycystic ovary syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-group controlled study to test the following hypothesis: compared to body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI)-matched normal controls, women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) will&#xD;
      demonstrate blunted LH responses to preovulatory estradiol concentrations. We will study both&#xD;
      normally-cycling controls and women with PCOS. We aim to recruit BMI-matched pairs (PCOS vs.&#xD;
      control within 2 kg/m2). To provoke a gonadotropin surge, subjects will receive graded&#xD;
      transdermal estradiol dosing, and we will use a dose adjustment protocol to maintain serum&#xD;
      estradiol levels of 250-400 pg/ml. To enhance reliability of estradiol delivery, transdermal&#xD;
      estradiol patches will be placed/replaced daily by Clinical Research Unit (CRU) nurses, and&#xD;
      abdominal sites will be rotated. All subjects will begin estradiol on menstrual cycle day 4.&#xD;
      Starting 24 hours before E2 administration, all subjects will collect all urine output in&#xD;
      12-hour time blocks for later urinary LH and FSH analysis; this will continue until the end&#xD;
      of the study. Additionally, subjects will have daily morning blood draws in the CRU for later&#xD;
      hormone measurements. Transvaginal ovarian ultrasound will be performed on study day 6 --&#xD;
      near the time of expected surge initiation -- to document largest follicle sizes. We will&#xD;
      measure serum estradiol daily and employ an estradiol dose-adjustment protocol to maintain&#xD;
      target estradiol levels. We will also measure LH daily. The study will be stopped after&#xD;
      either (a) serum LH increases to 5-fold higher than baseline and subsequently falls to within&#xD;
      200% of baseline, or (b) the subject has received estradiol for a full 7 days, whichever&#xD;
      comes first. The primary endpoint will be estradiol-induced change in 24-hour urinary LH&#xD;
      excretion, defined as 24-hour mean values immediately prior to estradiol administration vs.&#xD;
      peak 24-hour mean values during estradiol administration. A comparison of 24-hour LH changes&#xD;
      between healthy normal and PCOS groups will be conducted by way of a random-effects analysis&#xD;
      of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The ANCOVA model will be specified so that each BMI-matched&#xD;
      pair will represent an independent observational unit with respect to comparing 24-hour LH&#xD;
      change between groups. With regard to hypothesis testing, we will test whether the component&#xD;
      of variability in 24-hour LH change attributed to &quot;Study Group&quot; (healthy normal control vs.&#xD;
      PCOS) is a significant component of the overall variability in 24-hour LH change. Variability&#xD;
      in 24-hour LH change attributed to baseline disparities in LH will be accounted for by&#xD;
      treating subject-specific baseline LH as a covariate in the ANCOVA model. If BMI matching is&#xD;
      inadequate, we will also include BMI as a covariate in the model. If 11 women with PCOS and&#xD;
      11 controls complete study, we expect at least 80% power to detect a 33% difference in&#xD;
      E2-induced augmentation of urinary LH excretion.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PCOS group: post-pubertal (&gt; 4 years post-menarche) adult woman aged 18-30 years with&#xD;
             PCOS, defined as clinical and/or laboratory evidence of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism&#xD;
             and/or elevated serum [calculated] free testosterone concentration) plus ovulatory&#xD;
             dysfunction (irregular menses, fewer than 9 per year), but without evidence for other&#xD;
             potential causes of hyperandrogenism and/or ovulatory dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Control group: post-pubertal (&gt; 4 years post-menarche) adult woman aged 18-30 years&#xD;
             with regular menstrual periods (every 26-35 days) and no evidence of hyperandrogenism&#xD;
             (i.e., no hirsutism, normal serum [calculated] free testosterone concentration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General good health (excepting overweight, obesity, PCOS, and adequately-treated&#xD;
             hypothyroidism)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of and willing to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to strictly avoid pregnancy with use of reliable non-hormonal methods during&#xD;
             the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability/incapacity to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males will be excluded (hyperandrogenism is unique to females)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt; 18 years (we do not propose to study children because we have no preliminary&#xD;
             data that would support this particular study in children)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 30 years (since ovarian reserve may decrease beyond age 30)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obesity resulting from a well-defined endocrinopathy or genetic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive pregnancy test or current lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence for non-physiologic or non-PCOS causes of hyperandrogenism and/or anovulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of virilization (e.g., rapidly progressive hirsutism, deepening of the voice,&#xD;
             clitoromegaly)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total testosterone &gt; 150 ng/dl, which suggests the possibility of virilizing ovarian&#xD;
             or adrenal tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DHEA-S greater than upper reference range limit for controls; and DHEA-S elevation &gt;&#xD;
             1.5 times the upper reference range limit for PCOS. Mild elevations may be seen in&#xD;
             PCOS, and will be accepted in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Early morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone &gt; 200 ng/dl measured in the follicular phase,&#xD;
             which suggests the possibility of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (if elevated during&#xD;
             the luteal phase, the 17-hydroxyprogesterone will be repeated during the follicular&#xD;
             phase). NOTE: If a 17-hydroxyprogesterone &gt; 200 ng/dl is confirmed on repeat testing,&#xD;
             an ACTH stimulated 17-hydroxyprogesterone &lt; 1000 ng/dl will be required for study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): Note that subjects with stable and&#xD;
             adequately treated primary hypothyroidism, reflected by normal TSH values, will not be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperprolactinemia: Any degree of hyperprolactinemia (confirmed on repeat) will be&#xD;
             grounds for exclusion for subjects without PCOS. Hyperprolactinemia &gt; 20% higher than&#xD;
             the upper limit of normal will be grounds for exclusion for subjects without PCOS.&#xD;
             Mild prolactin elevations may be seen in PCOS, and elevations within 20% higher than&#xD;
             the upper limit of normal will be accepted in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History and/or physical exam findings suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, adrenal&#xD;
             insufficiency, or acromegaly&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History and/or physical exam findings suggestive of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism&#xD;
             (e.g., symptoms of estrogen deficiency) including functional hypothalamic amenorrhea&#xD;
             (which may be suggested by a constellation of symptoms including restrictive eating&#xD;
             patterns, excessive exercise, psychological stress, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent hematocrit &lt; 36% and hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 50,000 cells/microliter) or leukopenia (total&#xD;
             white blood count &lt; 4,000 cells/microliter)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous diagnosis of diabetes, fasting glucose &gt; or = 126 mg/dl, or a hemoglobin A1c&#xD;
             &gt; or = 6.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent liver panel abnormalities, with two exceptions. Mild bilirubin elevations&#xD;
             will be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome. Also, mild transaminase&#xD;
             elevations may be seen in obesity/PCOS; therefore, elevations &lt; 1.5 times the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal will be accepted in these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant history of cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., known or suspected&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, asthma requiring intermittent systemic corticosteroids,&#xD;
             etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Decreased renal function evidenced by GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A personal history of breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any other cancer diagnosis and/or treatment (with the exception of basal&#xD;
             cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma) unless they have remained clinically disease&#xD;
             free (based on appropriate surveillance) for five years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to transdermal estradiol patches&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI &lt; 18 or &gt; 40 kg/m2; BMI &lt; 18 kg/m2 is considered to be underweight, while &gt; 40&#xD;
             kg/m2 is considered to be class 3 obesity -- both may have marked confounding effects&#xD;
             for the outcomes of interest&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Menstrual cycles lasting fewer than 26 days: Cycle frequency &lt; 26 days suggest the&#xD;
             possibility of relatively short follicular phases (e.g., &lt; 12 days). If a subject with&#xD;
             a follicular phase shorter than 12 days participates in Aim 1c, they could experience&#xD;
             an endogenous gonadotropin surge under surveillance. Since we wish to capture only&#xD;
             experimentally-induced surges, we will exclude such subjects.&#xD;
