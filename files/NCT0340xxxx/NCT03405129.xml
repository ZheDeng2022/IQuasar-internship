  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Although&#xD;
      most smokers report that they would like to quit smoking at some point in the future, only&#xD;
      20% are ready to quit within the next 30 days. Importantly, studies have indicated that&#xD;
      interventions can increase motivation and/or readiness for cessation among smokers who are&#xD;
      not yet ready to quit and these types of intervention can increase smoking cessation&#xD;
      attempts. Smartphone apps that offer daily information about the benefits of quitting and&#xD;
      motivational/supportive messages that aim to increase cessation self-efficacy may increase&#xD;
      the likelihood of initiating a smoking cessation attempt. Previous research has indicated&#xD;
      that smoking cessation smartphone applications are feasible and well-liked by smokers who are&#xD;
      already committed to quitting smoking. However, there are no empirically supported smartphone&#xD;
      apps that provide dynamic smoking cessation content that is automatically matched to a&#xD;
      smoker's current readiness to quit. This type of dynamically tailored intervention could&#xD;
      overcome many of the barriers that have hampered the widespread use of traditional&#xD;
      empirically supported smoking cessation treatments. The current pilot study (N=150) is a&#xD;
      3-armed randomized controlled smoking cessation induction trial that will determine the&#xD;
      initial utility of a novel smartphone based intervention compared with an attention control&#xD;
      group among smokers who are not yet ready to quit. The two intervention groups (Group 1:&#xD;
      Phoenix App Only; Group 2: Phoenix App + Nicotine Replacement Therapy [NRT]) will receive&#xD;
      targeted smoking cessation messaging that is matched to a participant's readiness to quit,&#xD;
      while the attention control group (i.e., Factoid) will receive messages that are not related&#xD;
      to smoking cessation.&#xD;

      Description of Study Visit and Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Baseline Assessment Visit. Individuals who complete the online screener (i.e.,&#xD;
      REDCap) and meet initial study inclusion criteria will be invited to complete the in person&#xD;
      screener and baseline visit at the Tobacco Treatment Research Program (TTRP). Potential&#xD;
      participants will be provided with detailed information about the study and given the&#xD;
      opportunity to have their questions answered within a private room to ensure confidentiality.&#xD;
      Study staff will review the consent form with interested participants, who will be screened&#xD;
      for eligibility on-site in a private room in the clinic. Participant eligibility for the&#xD;
      current study will not influence eligibility for treatment at the TTRP. The Rapid Estimate of&#xD;
      Adult Literacy in Medicine-Short Form (REALM45) will be administered to ensure that all&#xD;
      participants are able to read at &gt; sixth grade level (i.e., required to complete EMA and&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires). Participants will also be asked to read aloud from the Informed&#xD;
      Consent form. Expired carbon monoxide (CO) will be measured with a Vitalograph BreathCO&#xD;
      carbon monoxide monitor and a Bedfont iCO carbon monoxide monitor. The purpose of using both&#xD;
      monitors is to validate the Bedfont iCO device. Participants will be questioned in person to&#xD;
      verify the information they provided during the REDCap screening process. Race/ethnicity,&#xD;
      sex, cigarettes smoked per day, education, and readiness to quit smoking will be used to&#xD;
      randomize participants to the Phoenix, Phoenix + NRT, or Factoid groups using adaptive&#xD;
      randomization software. Participants will complete the assessment portion of the baseline&#xD;
      visit on a laptop/tablet computer; and weight, and height will be measured in a private room&#xD;
      to ensure confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed that the app will prompt and deliver two messages per day and&#xD;
      that they should click the &quot;Set New Quit Date&quot; button when/if they want to set a smoking&#xD;
      cessation quit date. They will be informed that the app will offer smoking cessation&#xD;
      resources after they set a quit date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 26 Follow-Up Phone Call. All participants will be asked to complete a brief 10-15 minute&#xD;
      follow-up interview over the phone. Participants will be asked about their current smoking&#xD;
      status, their opinions about the smartphone app, and how the app could be improved for future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
