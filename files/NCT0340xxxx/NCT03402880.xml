      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and epacadostat work in combination&#xD;
      treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may assist the immune system in recognizing cancer cells leading to&#xD;
      elimination of those cells. Epacadostat may prevent down-regulation of T-cells, which means&#xD;
      it can boost the immune system. Giving pembrolizumab and epacadostat together may work better&#xD;
      than either drug alone in treating extensive stage small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) as measured by a modified Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 in subjects with extensive stage small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer undergoing treatment with combination pembrolizumab and epacadostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the progression free survival (PFS) as measured by a modified RECIST v1.1 in&#xD;
      subjects with extensive stage small cell lung cancer undergoing treatment with combination&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and epacadostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the overall survival in subjects with extensive stage small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      undergoing treatment with combination pembrolizumab and epacadostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the &gt;= grade 3 drug related adverse event profile of combination pembrolizumab&#xD;
      and epacadostat in subjects with extensive stage small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess tumor genomics, T-cell, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and receptors&#xD;
      (including PD-L1, IDO1, etc) in relation to response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA), cell free ribonucleic acid (RNA)&#xD;
      (cfRNA), micro RNA (miRNA), and exosomes as predictors for outcomes to treatment with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and epacadostat in subjects with extensive stage small cell lung cancer and to&#xD;
      evaluate plasma for predictive markers for outcomes to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Blood samples will be also be stored for future evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 and epacadostat orally (PO) twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients benefiting from treatment may&#xD;
      continue for an additional 17 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 12 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
