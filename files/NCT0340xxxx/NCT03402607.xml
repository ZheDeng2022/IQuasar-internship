    <textblock>
      This phase II, randomized trial will compare Quality of Life for patients with Hepatocellular&#xD;
      Carcinoma (HCC) who are not surgical candidates or decline surgery and are treated with&#xD;
      Percutaneous Local Ablation (PLA) or Hypofractionated Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (HIGRT).&#xD;

      Administrative clarification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol was activated on April 04, 2018. As of September 28, 2020 12 patients have been&#xD;
      enrolled: 2 at Duke, 8 at the Durham VA, and 2 at the Richmond VA. Patients were randomized&#xD;
      equally to treatment arms within each institution. Physician or patient reluctance regarding&#xD;
      randomization has impacted enrollment. The trial is, therefore, being amended, effective&#xD;
      October 28, 2020 to allow physician/patient choice of Interventional Radiology Liver Directed&#xD;
      Therapies or HIGRT delivered as part of routine medical care. The randomization for patients&#xD;
      already enrolled will be ignored. This record reflects the information for the interventional&#xD;
      portion of the study.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>A PLA procedure uses high-energy radio waves to treat liver tumors. Using CT and ultrasound guidance the doctor inserts a thin, needle-like probe into the liver tumor A high-frequency current is then passed through the tip of the probe, which heats the tumor with the goal to destroy the cancer cells. This may be done as an outpatient procedure or a short (1-2 day) hospital stay. PLA is the standard treatment for patients with liver cancer who cannot undergo liver surgery.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>HIGRT is an emerging treatment option for patients with HCC; it utilizes external radiation where multiple beams enter the body from multiple angles to treat the liver cancer over typically 5-10 treatments while minimizing radiation to normal tissues. You will receive between 5-10 fractions (treatments) of radiation. Fraction size will be either 5 or 10 Gy (pronounced Gray, a standard unit of radiation measurement) depending on your tumor size and location or underlying liver function. The total dose of radiation is 50 Gy.</description>

    <intervention_name>Percutaneous Local Abalation</intervention_name>
    <description>Microwave Ablation (MWA) is a form of percutaneous localized ablation using thermal ablation techniques to treat cancer via direct coagulative necrosis. Microwaves can generate high temperatures in a short period of time; MWA has the potential to improve treatment efficacy over radiofrequency ablation as it can be used to treat larger lesions and has less susceptibility to heat-sink due to vessel proximity. MWA uses electromagnetic waves (300 MHz to 300 GHz) to produce oscillation of polar molecules within tissue; this generates tissue necrosis through frictional heating. For HCC, one or more microwave antennae are inserted into the liver, usually under the guidance of ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT). Frequency and length of treatment is determined on a case by case basis depending on tumor size and proximity to vessels or other organs at risk.</description>

    <intervention_name>Hypofractionated Image Guided Radiation Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>HIGRT represents the only non-invasive curative modality in the management of HCC. HCC patients typically have a host of other medical comorbidities complicated by underlying liver dysfunction that makes the implementation of liver-directed therapy challenging. Presently HIGRT is typically offered only after alternative surgical (transplantation/hepatectomy) and non-operative approaches (PLA/embolization) have been exhausted.</description>
