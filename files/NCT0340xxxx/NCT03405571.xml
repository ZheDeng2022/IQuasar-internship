    <textblock>
      Patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic multiple myeloma per IMWG criteria prior to therapy&#xD;
      initiation are enrolled in the study. The aim of the study is to investigate clinical and&#xD;
      disease related risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in these patients as well as&#xD;
      possible biomarkers of hypercoagulability linked with the occurrence of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism at diagnosis and during the disease course. The purpose is to create a risk&#xD;
      assessment model for VTE in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients and make the model more&#xD;
      accurate by combining relevant clinical and disease characteristics with biomarkers of&#xD;
      cellular and plasma hypercoagulability. A standardized clinical research form is completed&#xD;
      for all patients at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 month follow up to include relevant clinical,&#xD;
      patient-related, disease-related and treatment related data. Blood sampling also takes place&#xD;
      at baseline and 3,6,12 months to assess multiple biomarkers of plasma and cellular&#xD;
      hypercoagulability. In addition lowe limb ultrasound is performed at baseline, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months. The primary endpoint is VTE occurrence. Following the elaboration of the&#xD;
      ROADMAP-CAT-MM risk assessment model we will prospectively validate it. We expect that&#xD;
      patients who are classified, as high risk according to the ROADMAP-CAT-MM will experience&#xD;
      symptomatic VTE more frequently and will have higher morbidity and mortality rates during the&#xD;
      follow-up. The prospective validation of the ROADMAP-CAT-MM will provide guidance for the use&#xD;
      and choice of thromboprophylaxis in these patients and will identify high risk patients&#xD;
      eligible for thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (tinzaparin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to symptomatic patients with multiple myeloma the study aims to investigate VTE&#xD;
      risk in all plasma cell dyscrasias and will recruit patients with monoclonal gammopathy of&#xD;
      undetermined significance, asymptomatic multiple myeloma, primary amyloidosis and&#xD;
      Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: We expect that patients who are classified, as high risk according to the&#xD;
      ROADMAP-CAT-MM will experience symptomatic VTE more frequently and will have higher morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality rates during the follow-up. The prospective validation of the ROADMAP-CAT-MM&#xD;
      (combined or not with biomarkers of hypercoagulability) will allow to identify patients&#xD;
      eligible for long-term thromboprophylaxis with intermediate dose of tinzaparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study Primary objective: using the ROADMAP-CAT-MM we will identify high&#xD;
      risk patients who will be eligible for long-term thromboprophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: to identify patients with biological resistance to the fixed dose of&#xD;
      postoperative thromboprophylaxis LMWH and to evaluate its clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-points of the study Primary end-point: the occurrence of symptomatic VTE (DVT and/or PE)&#xD;
      and asymptomatic DVT, or superficial venous thrombosis of the lower or upper limb, central&#xD;
      vein catheter thrombosis or venous thrombosis of rare localization. Venous thrombosis has to&#xD;
      be confirmed with any of the following assays: echo-Doppler, CT or MRI angiography, or&#xD;
      scintigraphy or CT scan. Occurrence of asymptomatic venous thrombosis found during routine&#xD;
      imaging for staging will also be included in the primary end point. Combined end-point&#xD;
      including all the above types of venous thrombosis will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-points: mortality, major bleeding, cancer evolution and morbidity during&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The proposed project is a prospective observational event driven study. The&#xD;
      cohort of multiple myeloma patients will be composed by pre-specified groups (1)Group MM-ASA&#xD;
      : patients with plasma cell dyscrasias on treatment with aspirin (2) Group MM-LMWH: patients&#xD;
      with plasma cell dyscrasias on treatment with usual prophylactic doses of tinzaparin (3)&#xD;
      Group MM-No: patients with plasma cell dyscrasias not receiving any antithrombotic treatment&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Patients with diagnosis of active multiple myeloma, asymptomatic multiple&#xD;
      myeloma, Patients with MGUS, Patients with amyloidosis, Patients with Waldenström's&#xD;
      macroglobulinemia, A detailed data base on clinical profile of the patients (stage, previous&#xD;
      treatments, etc) and the presence of VTE risk factors will be constructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Clinical assessment and follow up: Clinical data will be recorded in pre-specified&#xD;
      CRF: At the inclusion, at 3, 6 and 12 months patient records will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of biomarkers of cellular and plasma hypercoagulability Blood samples: At the&#xD;
      routine follow up and according to the established practice of the clinical investigation&#xD;
      centers and the standardized institutional practice for laboratory monitoring of the&#xD;
      patients, blood samples will be obtained after atraumatic vein puncture according to&#xD;
      standardized procedure, in order to assess biomarkers of hypercoagulability. No additional&#xD;
      blood samples to those routinely taken, will be required. The tests required for the present&#xD;
      study will be performed using the residual blood from that required for routine laboratory&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected in 2 Vacutainer tubes (5 ml tubes, containing 0.109 mol/L trisodium&#xD;
      citrate - 1 volume trisodium citrate to 9 volumes blood). Antecubital vein puncture will be&#xD;
      performed using 21G needles, or blood will be withdrawn from a recently (within 2-3 minutes)&#xD;
      placed peripheral venous cathether (20G). Following a double centrifugation at 1500 x g for&#xD;
      20 minutes, platelet-poor plasma (PPP) will be prepared within 30 minutes after vein&#xD;
      puncture. Plasma will be stored in -80 degrees. Blood samples will be collected at the&#xD;
      baseline visit and after 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory assays Platelet activation markers: Flow cytometry : platelet derived&#xD;
      microparticles expressing P-Selectin Blood coagulation assays: Thrombin generation in&#xD;
      platelet poor and platelet rich plasma (Thrombinoscope assay), PPL-Clotting time Other tests,&#xD;
      Fibrinogen, D-Dimers Systematic compression ultrasound examination of external iliac and&#xD;
      lower extremity veins: A systematic compression ultrasound examination will be performed by&#xD;
      one operator, unaware of the history and treatment assignments, at the following time-points:&#xD;
      baseline, at 6 months, at 1 year/ end of the study and at the event. All compression&#xD;
      ultrasound examinations will be digitally recorded for further adjudication if needed.&#xD;
      Statistics A power calculation is difficult to make because this study concerns a pilot&#xD;
      study. The results of the tests will be compared using the Student t-test or a non-parametric&#xD;
      test where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration: The study will be conducted according to the principles of the last&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects&#xD;
      Act (WMO) and other regulations, guidelines and acts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recruitment, benefits and risks: Screening and informed consent will be taken by the&#xD;
      investigator or the Clinical Research Assistant (CRA). The investigator will be responsible&#xD;
      for blood collection. Plasma samples will be prepared and stored at the investigation center&#xD;
      under the responsibility of the Investigator. The CRA will visit the Centers weakly, will&#xD;
      collect the CRF and will confirm the good quality of the plasma samples. The CRA will be&#xD;
      responsible for the follow up of the patients (the telephone interview and files revision).&#xD;
      The CRA will centralize the samples at the Institut on Thrombosis and Haemostasis and will be&#xD;
      responsible for the expedition to the Core Lab in Paris.The CRA will construct the combined&#xD;
      data base of clinical and laboratory data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No benefits can be expected for individual patients who participate in this study. However,&#xD;
      more information on this subject can help in the identification of patients with the highest&#xD;
      risk of venous thrombosis. These patients might in the future benefit from prophylactic&#xD;
      anticoagulants. If knowledge on this subject becomes incorporated into patient care, it will&#xD;
      be in the same group of patients who participate in the present study. Results from this&#xD;
      study, i.e. microparticle activity, will not have an influence on regular patient care,&#xD;
      because of its experimental character. Patients can refuse to participate in the study for&#xD;
      any reason, without consequences for regular treatment. Also, the investigator can decide to&#xD;
      withdraw a subject from the study for medical reasons. Risks are not to be expected, because&#xD;
      of the observational character of this study. The burden of the study is low, because it only&#xD;
      includes a single blood withdrawal. Each patient has to make his or her own comparative&#xD;
      assessment and decide on a voluntary base. The Medical Ethical Committee has given us&#xD;
      dispensation from the obligation to provide insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS: All investigators will have access to the research data in a coded&#xD;
      form. Patient data will be coded and the code will be stored and taken care of by the&#xD;
      responsible investigator. Patient material will be stored in a coded form.&#xD;
