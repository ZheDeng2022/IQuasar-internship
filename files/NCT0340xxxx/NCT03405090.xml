  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activity-related breathlessness (dyspnea) is the dominant symptom and persists despite&#xD;
      optimal medical care in as many as 50% of patients with advanced chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of this project is to determine the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms of the activity-related breathlessness in patients with advanced COPD. To study&#xD;
      the different pathways involved in causing breathlessness, we will compare the effects of two&#xD;
      treatments, opiates with oxygen versus bronchodilators, which relieve breathlessness in&#xD;
      different ways.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea arises during exercise in COPD patients when there is a mismatch between the&#xD;
      ventilatory demand (largely dictated by chemical stimuli) and the capacity to respond to that&#xD;
      demand (dictated by mechanical/muscular factors). Our preliminary studies have indicated that&#xD;
      treatment with opioids in COPD patients can improve activity related dyspnea by reducing&#xD;
      central respiratory neural drive and breathing frequency without a significant change in the&#xD;
      respiratory mechanics. By contrast, a reduction in exertional dyspnea following inhaled&#xD;
      bronchodilators in COPD was mainly related to an improved respiratory mechanics with&#xD;
      increased inspiratory capacity, tidal volume, and inspiratory reserve volume etcetera. By&#xD;
      comparing the physiological mechanisms of dyspnea relief during the opiate and bronchodilator&#xD;
      therapy, we hope to gain new insights into the mechanisms of dyspnea in COPD by selectively&#xD;
      manipulating inspiratory neural drive (nebulized opiates) and abnormal respiratory mechanics&#xD;
      (nebulized bronchodilators) within the same individuals. As such, the primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to compare the effects of inhaled opiate with oxygen versus bronchodilator&#xD;
      treatments on the intensity of dyspnea, electromyographic estimates of inspiratory neural&#xD;
      drive and respiratory mechanics and their interactions during a standardized exercise test&#xD;
      using a randomized, controlled, crossover design in patients with COPD.&#xD;

    <description>The 10-point Borg scale ranges from 0 &quot;nothing at all&quot; to 10 &quot;maximal/extremely strong&quot; and will be used to rate the intensity of dyspnea during exercise: a decrease in this rating signifies an improvement. Dyspnea intensity will be assessed at a standardized time (4-minutes) in both post-treatment constant-load cycle exercise tests.</description>
