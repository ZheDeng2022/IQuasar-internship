  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of PC-1005 gel when&#xD;
      used as a rectal microbicide in HIV-uninfected men and women (cis or transgender) with a&#xD;
      history of consensual receptive anal intercourse.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PC-1005 is a multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) microbicide in development that is&#xD;
      active against HIV, HPV, and HSV-2. This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of PC-1005 gel when administered rectally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll HIV-uninfected men and women (cis or transgender) with a history of&#xD;
      consensual receptive anal intercourse. All participants will receive 3 single escalating&#xD;
      doses of rectally administered PC-1005: 4 mL, 16 mL and 32 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a total of 9 clinic visits and 1 follow-up contact by phone or in person.&#xD;
      Participants will receive doses of PC-1005 at Visits 3, 5, and 7. A 2-to-6 week washout&#xD;
      period will follow each dosing visit. If no adverse events that preclude continuation to the&#xD;
      next dose are identified during this period, participants will receive the next scheduled&#xD;
      dose of PC-1005. Participation in this study will last approximately 3 to 5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will include physical examinations, throat swabs, behavioral assessments and&#xD;
      interviews, and collection of blood, urine, rectal tissue, and cervical, vaginal, and rectal&#xD;
      fluid.&#xD;
