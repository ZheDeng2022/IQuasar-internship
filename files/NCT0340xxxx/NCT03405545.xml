    <textblock>
      This human intervention study will test if 12 weeks of supervised HIIT-based intervention&#xD;
      improves skeletal muscle NOGD capacity in obese subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>

      enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will train 3 times/week under supervision during 12 weeks. Before, after and&#xD;
      during this 12-week training period, there will be multiple metabolic measurements.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skeletal muscle mitochondrial function assessed by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Scan using 31P-MRS methodology, based on the phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery kinetics after exercise.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The participant is positioned in the scanner with a home-built exercise device to perform consecutive knee-extensions, in which the participant has to lift a weight whilst laying in the scanner (50-60% max leg capacity of the subjects) for 5 minutes. Scout images of the upper leg are acquired and fine-tuned shimming is applied. Before, during and after exercise, spectra are acquired every 4 seconds. The restoration of PCr is driven almost purely by oxidative metabolism, the time to restore the normal amount reflects mitochondrial function (a faster restoration time means better mitochondrial function).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Metabolic Flexibility during exercise assessed by indirect calorimetry.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a standardized cycling test at low, moderate and high intensity (30%-50%-70%) during 10 minutes each. Throughout the test, indirect calorimetry will be performed in order to measure changes in substrate oxidation during exercise.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ectopic Fat accumulation in the liver assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan from which hepatic fat content will be quantified. In the 1H-MRS spectra, the water signal, that is dominating the proton spectra, will be suppressed using frequency-selective pre-pulse and the spectra will be fitted to quantify the lipid peak. A separate spectrum will be measured without water suppression to quantify the unsuppressed water signal. The CH2/Water ratio will be used as parameter of intrahepatic lipid content.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal Acetylcarnitine formation in the upper-leg at rest and after exercise assessed by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Scan</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to guide the spectroscopy measurements and fine shimming will be performed to optimize the magnetic field homogeneity within the region of interest. A volume of interest will be selected within the m. vastus lateralis from the MRI images and the 1H-MRS spectra will be acquired from this region of interest. The intensity of the creatine signal will be used as internal reference.</description>

    <measure>Effect of consumption of insulinogenic, CHO-rich drink post-exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigate whether the consumption of a insulinogenic, CHO-rich drink post-training prevention adverse effects related to blood glucose fluctuation while maintaining the effects of 12 weeks of HIIT on NOGD.</description>
