  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a commonly occurring, severe, and costly condition&#xD;
      that interferes greatly with quality of life. Considerable comorbidity with other disorders&#xD;
      and existing multicomponent treatments with largely untested putative mechanisms of action&#xD;
      represent obstacles for effective dissemination of BPD treatment; in light of this gap, the&#xD;
      purpose of the present study is to isolate the effects of individual treatment components on&#xD;
      putative mechanisms implicated in both BPD. This study will answer important theoretical&#xD;
      questions about the mechanism of treatment change, and might lead to more efficacious,&#xD;
      cost-effective, and easily disseminable treatment strategies for BPD, a severe and&#xD;
      understudied disorder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a commonly occurring, severe, and costly condition&#xD;
      for which treatment efforts have been hindered by several factors. First, extant treatments&#xD;
      for BPD are long-term, intensive and consist of multiple components, largely focused on&#xD;
      resolving the life-threatening dysregulation that characterizes this disorder. It is&#xD;
      important to note, however, that most individuals diagnosed with BPD never attempt suicide or&#xD;
      require inpatient hospitalization. Multi-component interventions may not be the most&#xD;
      efficient approach for patients with less severe levels of BPD and also make it difficult to&#xD;
      draw conclusions regarding which treatment strategies are influencing mechanisms maintaining&#xD;
      symptoms. Additionally, extant BPD treatments do no explicitly address high rates of&#xD;
      comorbidity with anxiety and depressive disorders; high levels of co-occurrence amongst these&#xD;
      disorders underscores the utility of identifying transdiagnostic treatment components&#xD;
      relevant to maintaining mechanisms across diagnostic boundaries. The proposed Mentored&#xD;
      Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is a four-year plan in support of&#xD;
      the applicant's long-term career goal to become a clinical scientist proficient in developing&#xD;
      parsimonious, easily disseminated treatments for BPD and other emotional disorders. This&#xD;
      project will be completed in two phases. The goal of Phase I, in line with an experimental&#xD;
      therapeutics approach, is to investigate the effect of acting inconsistent with&#xD;
      emotion-driven behavioral urges on emotional intensity in a sample of individuals diagnosed&#xD;
      with BPD in the context of a single-case experiment (alternating treatment design). Phase II&#xD;
      will also utilize single-case experimental design (in this case a multiple baseline study) to&#xD;
      explore the effects of brief intervention focused solely on acting inconsistent to emotional&#xD;
      action tendencies on emotional intensity, tolerance of emotions, and BPD symptoms in a sample&#xD;
      diagnosed with BPD. Boston University's Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders, where all&#xD;
      research and the bulk of the training activities will take place, is a world-renown clinical&#xD;
      research institution with a successful history of treatment development research. Overall,&#xD;
      the broader aim of these research and training goals is to address the need for improved&#xD;
      treatments for BPD. This study will answer important theoretical questions about the&#xD;
      mechanism of treatment change, and might lead to more efficacious, cost-effective, and easily&#xD;
      disseminable treatment strategies for BPD, a severe and understudied disorder.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (5th Edition; DSM-5) diagnosis of borderline&#xD;
             personality disorder;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. willing to maintain a stable dose on prescribed psychotropic medication throughout the&#xD;
             study duration. This avoids problems with reluctance to discontinue or difficulty with&#xD;
             discontinuing, and also the confounding of outcomes from initiation of medication&#xD;
             during treatment; this procedure is a longstanding practice at the Center for Anxiety&#xD;
             and Related Disorders (CARD) at Boston University for treatment outcome research.&#xD;
             Additionally, participants must be&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. fluent in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to maximize generalizability, exclusion criteria are based solely on the&#xD;
        well-being of the participant and will consist primarily of conditions that would require&#xD;
        prioritization for immediate treatment (e.g., severe suicidality or substance dependence).&#xD;
        These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current DSM-5 diagnoses of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,&#xD;
             or organic mental disorder;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clear and current suicidal risk (intent);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current or recent (within 3 months) history of drug dependence;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willingness to refrain from additional psychosocial treatment across the course of the&#xD;
             study; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. has access to own smartphone.&#xD;
