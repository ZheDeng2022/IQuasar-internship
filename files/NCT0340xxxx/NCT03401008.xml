  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: Acromegaly is the rare condition (3 to 4 new cases per million per year) due to&#xD;
      Growth Hormone (GH) overproduction by a somatotrope pituitary adenoma, resulting in Insulin&#xD;
      Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) excess. Consequently, many tissues of the organism become&#xD;
      hypertrophied. Hypertrophy of gingival and dental tissues can lead to alteration of oral&#xD;
      health. However, there are very few published data concerning oral impact of acromegaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To do the most accurate clinical and radiological state of oral manifestations in&#xD;
      the series of prevalent acromegaly patients followed in the endocrinology service of the CHU&#xD;
      of Clermont-Ferrand.&#xD;

      Context/ study relevance: Acromegaly is a rare condition (3 to 4 new cases per million per&#xD;
      year) due to Growth Hormone (GH) overproduction by a somatotrope pituitary adenoma, resulting&#xD;
      in Insulin Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) excess. Consequently, a dysmorphic syndrome prevailing at&#xD;
      the level of face and extremities progressively develops associated with potentially severe&#xD;
      general manifestations (cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic complications). Oral&#xD;
      manifestations of acromegaly are not well known, there is very few published data on this&#xD;
      topic and a controversy about the existence of a parodontal disease, i.e. the presence of&#xD;
      gingival sulcus deepening which can lead to tooth loss. IGF-1 excess could lead to gingival&#xD;
      hypertrophy and then to gingival sulcus deepening. Otherwise, the dental cementum, the only&#xD;
      dental tissue which can grow during all lifetime, could be influenced by an excess of IGF-1.&#xD;
      It is likely that acromegaly is associated with pathological cementum hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To do the most accurate clinical and radiological state of oral manifestations in&#xD;
      the series of prevalent acromegaly patients followed in the endocrinology service of the CHU&#xD;
      of Clermont-Ferrand. Investigator will take a special interest in parodontal status i.e. the&#xD;
      state of supporting tissues of the teeth and structural anomalies of dental cementum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objective, investigator would make a histological characterization of gingival&#xD;
      and dental (cementum) tissues when a surgical treatment of the oral condition is required.&#xD;
      Investigator will search hypertrophic anomalies linked with GH/IGF-1 excess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: This is an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional, monocentric&#xD;
      study conducted in the endocrinology/diabetology service of Clermont-Ferrand University&#xD;
      Hospital (CHU), in France, where a series of about 70 prevalent acromegaly patients is&#xD;
      annually followed. The participants will be adult acromegaly patients followed in this&#xD;
      service, with proven diagnosis of acromegaly or previous acromegaly. They will be excluded of&#xD;
      the study if they are totally toothless, if they take a medication associated with gingival&#xD;
      hypertrophy if they are in a medical or chirurgical condition interacting with oral health so&#xD;
      that the oral evaluation is not reliable or if there is no possibility of written informed&#xD;
      consent. For each participant, investigator will collect demographic data and history of the&#xD;
      pathology including previous and actual complications, biological tests results, imaging&#xD;
      exams results and treatments. The participants will answer 3 questionnaires: AcroQol (quality&#xD;
      of life in acromegaly patients), GOHAI (General Oral Health Assessment Index) and EPICES&#xD;
      (evaluation of precariousness). The primary outcome will be a quantitative assessment of the&#xD;
      oral health of the acromegalic patients with detailed assessment of 3 criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depth of gingival sulcus measured for of all teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CAO index (number of teeth with cavity or obturation or missing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thickness of dental cementum on orthopantomogram and all other abnormality on this exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome will be the histological analysis of gingival and dental tissues if&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these measures will be taken during a routine odonto-stomatological consultation, part of&#xD;
      the annual pathology evaluation at the endocrinology/diabetology service.&#xD;
