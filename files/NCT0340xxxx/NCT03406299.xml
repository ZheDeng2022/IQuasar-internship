      120 mg/day) Leucovorin 30 mg/b.i.d., day 1-7; Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 in 250 mL of 5% Glucose,&#xD;
      given as 2-hour intra- venous infusion, day 1; Gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 in 250 mL of normal&#xD;
      saline, given as fixed dose-rate (FDR, 10 mg/m2/min) infusion, day 1; After the&#xD;
      administration of gemcitabine, the infusion line should be flushed with 20 ml of normal&#xD;
      saline and then 50 ml of 5% glucose solution before the administration of oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm2: GC regimen: every 21 days as one cycle Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 in 100 mL of normal&#xD;
      saline, IV drip for 30 mins on D1 and D8 Cisplatin 25 mg/m2 in 250ml of normal saline, IV&#xD;
      drip for 2 hours on D1 and D8&#xD;
