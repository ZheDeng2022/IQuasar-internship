  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two randomized trials of reirradiation after salvage surgery have been conducted by the&#xD;
      GETTEC and GORTEC collaborative groups, both members of the French HN Intergroup: The first&#xD;
      trial compared reirradiation and a &quot;wait and see attitude&quot; and was published in 2008 [1]. The&#xD;
      second trial compared two modalities of reirradiation. Our hypothesis is that adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment with immunotherapy will lead to a DFS similar to that observed in previous trials&#xD;
      of post-operative reirradiation with possibly lower toxicity.&#xD;
