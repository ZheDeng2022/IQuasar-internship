  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) immunotherapy treatment&#xD;
      using the p53 vaccine (Ad.p53-DC) in combination with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab has on small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy is a cancer therapy that uses the body's immune system to&#xD;
      fight cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study can be divided into three different phases: initial Induction Immunotherapy,&#xD;
      Maintenance Immunotherapy and Retreatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the Induction Immunotherapy phase (4 x 21 day cycles) of the study, participants will&#xD;
      receive Ipilimumab and Nivolumab on Day 1 of each cycle for 4 cycles. Participants will&#xD;
      receive the p53 vaccine on Days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and then again on Day 8 of Cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 5 participants will start Maintenance Immunotherapy. During this&#xD;
      phase of the study, participants will receive Nivolumab only on Day 1 of every 4 week period.&#xD;
      Participants will also receive the p53 vaccine three additional times (every 4 weeks over a&#xD;
      12 week period). During Maintenance Immunotherapy you will continue to receive Nivolumab only&#xD;
      on Day 1 of each additional 4 week period that you take part until your disease progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Retreatment phase of the study may be available to participants whose doctor feels they&#xD;
      would benefit from retreatment and if they qualify for this retreatment. During retreatment,&#xD;
      participants would receive the combination of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab or Nivolumab alone&#xD;
      every three weeks for a maximum of one additional year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P53 Vaccine production&#xD;
&#xD;
      The p53 vaccine will be made by inserting the p53 gene (a gene is a hereditary unit of all&#xD;
      living organism within a cell) into a subset of the participant's own white blood cells. The&#xD;
      insertion of the gene into their white blood cells will occur in the laboratory, after their&#xD;
      cells have been extracted from their body through a procedure called leukopheresis (similar&#xD;
      to dialysis).&#xD;

    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Response will be assessed primarily using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v1.1). The immune related (ir)RECIST will also be used secondarily. DCR = Complete Response (CR) = Partial Response (PR) + Stable Disease (SD) rates. The disease control (DCR=CR+PR+SD) rates will be summarized using both point estimates and exact confidence intervals based on the binomial distribution by group.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PFS, defined as time from enrollment (eligible date) to date of progression/death, whichever happens first, or censor at last clinical follow-up date. PFS will be summarized utilizing the K-M method.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The OS, defined as the time from study enrollment (eligible date) to death from any cause. OS will be summarized utilizing the K-M method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate (ORR=CR+PR) will be summarized using both point estimates and exact confidence intervals based on the binomial distribution by group.</description>

    <description>Criteria used to determine the presence of immune responses: Individual participant will be considered responders if at any time point the response in IFN-γ ELISPOT assay is higher than 30 spots per 2 × 10^5 AND the response in IFN-γ ELISPOT to ALVAC p53 is more than 2 SD higher than the response to corresponding ALVAC control at the same time point AND 2 SD higher than the corresponding response at the base line (before start of the treatment).</description>
