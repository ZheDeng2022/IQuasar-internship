  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to assess the irritation and sensitisation potential&#xD;
      of HAT1 topical products after repeated patch applications to healthy human participants by&#xD;
      following conventional Repeated Insult (HRIPT), Cumulative Irritation (CIT), and&#xD;
      Phototoxicity (PT) methodologies under the supervision of dermatologists.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For HRIPT, a total of 9 induction patches were applied at the rate of three patches per week&#xD;
      for three weeks. The patch was retained in place for 48 hours during week days and 72 hrs&#xD;
      over the weekend. Each induction patch was applied to the same site unless the degree of&#xD;
      reaction to the test substance or the adhesive necessitates relocation. Two sites, adjacent&#xD;
      to the original site, were available if patch relocation was deemed necessary. A rest period&#xD;
      of 12-20 days between the final induction patch application and challenge patch application&#xD;
      was provided. Challenge patches were applied 12-20 days after the last induction patch&#xD;
      application. Patches were worn for 48 hours (± 1 hour), then removed at the site and&#xD;
      discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For PT, the test products along with a blank chamber as negative control were applied on the&#xD;
      back of the subjects in contralateral paired symmetry under occlusion for 24 hours. After&#xD;
      completion of 24 hours of occlusion, both patch systems were taken off. Subjects were&#xD;
      acclimatized for 30 minutes post removal of the patch and dermatological assessment of the&#xD;
      sites (including controls) was performed. Post assessment, one of the two sites and an&#xD;
      untreated blank control site (randomized and investigator blinded) was irradiated with 0.5&#xD;
      MED (specific for each subject). Follow up assessments were performed at 10 minutes post&#xD;
      irradiation and subsequently at 24 and 48 hours post irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For CIT, the patches were prepared in a vertical row and applications were made every day for&#xD;
      14 days. All applications for individual test substances were made to the same site (the site&#xD;
      used for the initial patch application) unless reactions become so strong (grade of 2.0 or&#xD;
      greater) as to make continued application inadvisable. Patches were worn for approximately 23&#xD;
      hours (± 1 hour). Subjects were instructed to keep their patches dry. Subjects were&#xD;
      instructed to return to the test facility for patch removal and disposal by test facility&#xD;
      personnel. Skin sites were gently wiped with water and patted dry to remove excess test&#xD;
      substance immediately following patch removal. Skin sites were graded approximately 20-40&#xD;
      minutes following patch removal. Subjects were not allowed to replace any patches that fall&#xD;
      off. Subjects were provided with instructions and a schedule of the study dates on the first&#xD;
      day of the study. Telephone numbers were provided to report adverse events or answer&#xD;
      questions on a 24-hour basis.&#xD;

    <description>CIT was conducted over a period of approximately 15 days for each subject to determine the irritation and/or sensitization potential of a test material(s) under occlusion by 14 repeated closed occlusive patch application every 24 hrs.

PT was conducted over a period of approximately 6 days for each subject to determine the phototoxicity of the test product.&#xD;
HRIPT was conducted over a period of approximately 6-8 weeks for each subject to confirm that the test substances will not produce evidence of delayed contact sensitization following external contact with the skin by means of a repeated patch application procedure.</description>
