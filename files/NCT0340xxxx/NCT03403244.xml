      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of US-MR image&#xD;
      fusion-guided percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy for the treatment of lumbar&#xD;
      disc herniation&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common pathological process leading to spinal surgery. Open&#xD;
      discectomy used to be a widespread procedure for surgical treatment for symptomatic LDH.&#xD;
      Currently, with rapid progress of endoscopic techniques, several minimal invasive endoscopic&#xD;
      surgeries have been developed to perform discectomy. Percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic&#xD;
      discectomy (PTED) a widely used minimal invasive surgical procedures, the effectiveness of&#xD;
      which has been proved to be comparable to conventional open discectomy. However, the use of&#xD;
      fluoroscopy may be usually required to indirectly visualize pertinent anatomy to achieve an&#xD;
      optimal result on radiographs. As we known, increased radiation exposure may be associated&#xD;
      with potential stochastic and deterministic adverse events. Therefore, it is important to&#xD;
      reduce the radiation dose of practitioners to minimize risk of potential radiation-induced&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound-MR fusion technique combines the advantages of ultrasound and MR, and overcome the&#xD;
      shortcomings of each single imaging method. It provides MR cross-sectional multiplanar images&#xD;
      that correspond to the acquired real-time US images, and all images can be displayed&#xD;
      simultaneously and in real time according to the angle of the US transducer. US-MR fusion&#xD;
      image has been widely used in prostate and liver intervention. However, to our limited&#xD;
      knowledge, there is only one research about the application of US-MR fusion image in lumbar&#xD;
      spinal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a comparative cohort study will be performed to evaluate feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of US-MR image fusion-guided percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy for&#xD;
      the treatment of lumbar disc herniation(LDH). We will conduct the study at the 3rd affiliated&#xD;
      hospitals of Sun Yat-Sen University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of patients will be investigated: patients diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation&#xD;
      undergoing US-MR image fusion-guided PTED (US-MR PTED), and fluoroscopy-guided PTED (FL&#xD;
      PTED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes of the study will be radiation exposure and puncture time. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include fusion efficacy, puncture accuracy, puncture satisfaction of surgeon,&#xD;
      comfort of patient and clinical effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the results of this trial we will, for the first time, have scientific&#xD;
      evidence as to the feasibility and efficacy of US-MR image fusion-guided percutaneous&#xD;
      transforaminal endoscopic discectomy for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation.&#xD;
