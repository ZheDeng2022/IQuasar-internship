  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site exploratory study aiming to demonstrate the effect of a fresh fermented&#xD;
      dairy drink containing a probiotic strain on stress-related intestinal hyperpermeability in&#xD;
      students defending a bachelor's or master's thesis in front of a jury at the University of&#xD;
      Leuven (Belgium).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conceived as a single-site exploratory study with a randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group design. There will be a double blind with 2 intervention arms (Test product&#xD;
      with probiotic and acidified milk Control) plus an extra open label arm without intervention&#xD;
      in a 2:2:1 ratio. The goal of the open-label arm is to confirm our previous data on the&#xD;
      effect of stress on small intestinal permeability (see reference), without powering the study&#xD;
      to detect a significant difference within this open-label arm. The participants and the&#xD;
      investigators are blinded to the allocation to the probiotic vs. acidified milk control arm.&#xD;
      However, there is no blinding in the arm without intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo intestinal permeability and salivary markers of psychological stress and activation&#xD;
      of the autonomous nervous system will be measured and questionnaires will be completed at 4&#xD;
      different test days: baseline (V2), two weeks after randomization (V3), during an oral&#xD;
      defense of a master's or bachelor's thesis (V4) and finally after pretreatment with&#xD;
      Indomethacin (V5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5 study visits are organized around the thesis defence (D0):&#xD;
&#xD;
      V1 (screening + inclusion) takes place within 2 to 3 weeks prior to the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V2 (baseline + randomization) will take place between D-35 to D-27. V3 (randomization + 2&#xD;
      weeks) will take place at D-14 +/-1day. V4 (thesis defense) is D0 and organized by the&#xD;
      University. V5 (Indomethacin) will take place at D+14 +/-1day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects in the intervention arm (Test product with probiotic and acidified milk&#xD;
      Control), products will be supplied (for 1 week). In addition, alternate product supply will&#xD;
      take place at D-21, D-7 and D+7 (each one +/-1day).&#xD;
