      the aim of this study is to document the changes brought about in the internal anatomic&#xD;
      relationships of the TMJ complex , positional changes of glenoid fossa with respect to&#xD;
      adjacent cranial structures after completion of fixed orthodontic treatment in adolescent&#xD;
      males initially treated with removable functional appliances for skeletal class II, Angle's&#xD;
      class II division 2 malocclusion&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angle's class II division 2 malocclusion is subtype of Angle's class II malocclusion with&#xD;
      unique facial, dental and craniofacial features which differentiate it from other&#xD;
      malocclusions so much that it has been said to be a syndrome itself. Its frequency lies&#xD;
      between 1.5 and 5% of all malocclusions found in a white western population.. Condyle&#xD;
      position changes from anterior to posterior with age in class II division 2 cases. The use of&#xD;
      functional orthopedic appliances to correct Class II malocclusions associated with&#xD;
      retrognathic mandibles is indicated for the first phase of orthodontic treatment. A second&#xD;
      phase of treatment is undertaken with fixed orthodontic appliances to obtain occlusal&#xD;
      refinement. Although various investigations have shown the efficiency of this method of&#xD;
      treatment, the mechanism by which the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) responds to the treatment&#xD;
      is controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various techniques have been used to image the TMJ which include Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (MRI), Cephalograms, Orthopantomograms , Tomograms , Bone scintigraphy with radiologic&#xD;
      markers like 99mTc-MDP, Arthroscopy and Arthrography , CT scanning, Cone Beam Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (CBCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a multiplanar imaging technique, has the advantage of&#xD;
      giving an accurate assessment of both the bony and the soft tissues. This technique is&#xD;
      believed to be non-invasive, radiation free and gives more superior contrast resolution than&#xD;
      any other imaging modality. MRI is considered the imaging modality of choice for assessment&#xD;
      of internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint. Bony structures and especially soft&#xD;
      tissues of the TMJ can be examined by means of MRI and the relations of the tissues with each&#xD;
      other can be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI studies have been done on fixed functional appliances which show significant displacement&#xD;
      of condyle during treatment but later condyles returned to pre treatment positions at the end&#xD;
      of fixed functional appliance treatment. Results documented in fixed functional appliance may&#xD;
      not be same in removable appliances. Effects of removable functional appliances on the&#xD;
      condyle-glenoid fossa (C-GF) complex have been studied with respect to the Frankel,&#xD;
      Activator, Twin block and Bionator appliances.It should be noted that all of above studies&#xD;
      are limited to the phase of removable functional appliance therapy only in Class II division&#xD;
      1 and no MRI study has attempted to evaluate the changes in the position of the&#xD;
      Condyle-Glenoid Fossa (C-GF) complex treated with removable functional appliance therapy,&#xD;
      followed by fixed orthodontic treatment in Class II division 2 malocclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No studies have been done on bi-phasic treatment of skeletal class II, Angle's class II&#xD;
      division 2 involving removable functional appliances in the first phase followed by fixed&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment in second phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to document the changes brought about in the internal&#xD;
      anatomic relationships of the TMJ complex , positional changes of glenoid fossa with respect&#xD;
      to adjacent cranial structures after completion of fixed orthodontic treatment in adolescent&#xD;
      males initially treated with removable functional appliances for skeletal class II, Angle's&#xD;
      class II division 2 malocclusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a longitudinal clinical trial to evaluate TMJ disc-condyle-fossa relationship using MRI&#xD;
      scan following bi-phasic therapy in skeletal Class II, Angle's class II division 2&#xD;
      malocclusion in adolescent males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will be conducted in the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial&#xD;
      Orthopedics, PGIDS, in association with the Department of Radiology, PGIMS, and Department of&#xD;
      Oral Radiology, PGIDS, Pt B. D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical clearance- The study will be carried out in humans after the institutional approval&#xD;
      obtained from ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source of Data The study sample will consist of the subjects from the Department of&#xD;
      Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, PGIDS , who will be successfully completing the&#xD;
      prefunctional and functional appliance therapy for correction of skeletal class II, Angle's&#xD;
      class II division 2 malocclusion and will be ready for fixed orthodontic treatment for final&#xD;
      finishing and detailing of occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT OF THE PATIENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      A valid, bilingual informed written consent of the patient or parent/guardian will be&#xD;
      obtained from the patient before registering the patient in this clinical study. Patients&#xD;
      will be informed of all the theoretical risks and benefits of the interventions under test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and design of study The study sample will consist of those 14 adolescent males&#xD;
      who had been treated initially with pre functional and functional appliance therapy for&#xD;
      skeletal Class II, Angle's class II division 2 malocclusion and had following MRI scans done&#xD;
      during the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stage- A (pre-treatment),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stage- B (after pre-functional therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stage- C (After completion of Functional Appliance Therapy) These patients will be&#xD;
           further treated with fixed orthodontic treatment for final finishing and detailing and&#xD;
           an MRI will be taken after debonding of fixed orthodontic appliance (stage D). MRI scans&#xD;
           thus obtained will be evaluated for documenting changes in the morphology and anatomic&#xD;
           positions of condylar head, articular disc and glenoid fossa and will be traced for the&#xD;
           various angular and linear metric measurements MRI scans of the TMJ will be obtained&#xD;
           with a 1.5 Tesla Philips Intera Nova Gradient (Netherlands) scanner equipped with Sense&#xD;
           Head 6 channel coil for simultaneous imaging of right and left joints. Sagittal images&#xD;
           will be taken perpendicular to the long axis of the condylar head and the coronal images&#xD;
           will be taken parallel to the long axis of the condylar head. The images will be&#xD;
           recorded in maximum intercuspation after debonding of fixed orthodontic appliance. The&#xD;
           MRI protocol will include PD TSE (Turbo Spin Echo) sequence (TR 1500/ TE 30/ FoV 150x150&#xD;
           mm) T1 spin echo sequences (TR 450⁄TE 15⁄FoV 160x160 mm) and T2 TSE sequence (TR 2424⁄&#xD;
           TE 100⁄FoV 160x160 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIXED MECHANOTHERAPY TREATMENT PHASE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be having cases in class I/ superclass I molar relation and lateral open bite&#xD;
      may be present in premolar regions after the completion of functional phase. The final fixed&#xD;
      orthodontic phase will be taken up for the final finishing and detailing of the occlusion&#xD;
      after the retentive phase of functional appliance therapy is completed. It involves banding&#xD;
      and bonding of both upper and lower arches with MBT 0.022&quot; appliance. Progressive wire&#xD;
      sequences to be used are 0.014&quot; NiTi, 0.016&quot; NiTi, 0.018&quot; NiTi, 0.017&quot; x 0.025&quot; NiTi, 0.019&quot;x&#xD;
      0.025&quot; NiTi, , 0.019&quot;x 0.025&quot; S.S., 0.014&quot; S.S. Once stainless steel archwires are in place,&#xD;
      class II elastics may be prescribed to the patient to prevent relapse of class I molar&#xD;
      relation achieved. Cases are to be finished in class I molar intercuspation with normal&#xD;
      overjet and overbite. Appliance will be debonded and final MRI (stage D) will taken for all&#xD;
      the patients. Hawley's retainer with anterior bite plane will serve for retention of achieved&#xD;
      results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of MRI stages This will be done with the help of various angular and linear&#xD;
      measurements like the eminence angle, the sagittal disc position measured in relation to two&#xD;
      reference lines: the posterior condylar line (PC line) and the Frankfurt Horizontal plane (FH&#xD;
      Plane), the coronal disc position , Sagittal condylar concentricity 5) The glenoid fossa&#xD;
      angle, Condyle and glenoid fossa displacements and Superior joint space&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The final data recorded will be processed by standard statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
