  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well venetoclax and decitabine work in treating participants&#xD;
      with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment, or with&#xD;
      high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome that has come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      venetoclax and decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of venetoclax in combination with 10-day&#xD;
      decitabine in patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML); elderly (&gt; 60&#xD;
      year old) patients with newly diagnosed AML not eligible for intensive chemotherapy; patients&#xD;
      with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with bone marrow blasts between 10% and 20%,&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory to prior hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy, or chronic&#xD;
      myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with bone marrow blasts &gt;= 10% regardless of prior therapy;&#xD;
      AML patients with prior history of MDS or CMML who received therapy for the MDS or CMML and&#xD;
      progressed to AML, and younger patients with newly diagnosed AML with poor risk complex&#xD;
      karyotype and/or TP53 deletions/mutations and patients with blastic plasmacytoid dentritic&#xD;
      cell neoplasm (BPDCN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the duration of response, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) of patients with refractory/relapsed AML treated with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the number of patients who achieve a hematologic improvement (HI) in&#xD;
      platelets, hemoglobin, or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and the number of patients who&#xD;
      achieve &gt; 50% reduction in blasts on therapy with venetoclax/10-day decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety of venetoclax in combination with 10-day decitabine in patients&#xD;
      with refractory/relapsed AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the number of patients who transition towards stem cell transplantation upon&#xD;
      achieving response with the combination venetoclax/10-day decitabine regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the incidence of infectious complications per cycle with venetoclax in&#xD;
      combination with 10-day decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate possible relationships between baseline protein and gene expression&#xD;
      signatures/mutation profile and BH3 profiling in predicting clinical response to the&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of venetoclax in combination with&#xD;
      decitabine and antifungals in plasma samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-10 and may also&#xD;
      receive decitabine on days 1-5 after achieving complete remission/complete remission with&#xD;
      incomplete count recovery during consolidation/maintenance. Participants also receive&#xD;
      venetoclax orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 of cycle 1 and on days 1-21 of subsequent cycles.&#xD;
      Treatment repeat every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 to 6 months for up&#xD;
      to 5 years.&#xD;
