      Epidemiological studies suggest that daily intake of fruits and vegetables high in&#xD;
      polyphenols or the addition of olive oil containing many polyphenols is associated with a&#xD;
      reduced risk of chronic diseases including cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodegenerative, and&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo experiments demonstrated that the administration of a diet associated with daily&#xD;
      intake of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) reduces histological lesions and symptomatology in&#xD;
      rats with a dextran sulfate sodium (DDS) induced colitis. A diet supplemented with&#xD;
      hydroxytyrosol (a component of olive oil) showed a reduction of the inflammatory process at&#xD;
      the inflamed colon of the rats.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology, which&#xD;
      usually occurs in young adults (II-IV decade of life).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological data have shown a north-south gradient of both incidence and prevalence of UC&#xD;
      in European countries, with a higher prevalence in northern European countries than in the&#xD;
      Mediterranean area. However, recent data show a reduction in these differences in the last&#xD;
      two decades. The reasons of this reduction are unknown, but it is possible that these&#xD;
      differences are related to a change in dietary habits in southern European countries where a&#xD;
      diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables (the so-called &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot;) is gradually&#xD;
      being replaced by a typical diet of the industrialized countries of northern Europe,&#xD;
      characterized by high consumption of frozen or pre-packaged foods of the food industry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These changes in the diet regime have also replaced the type of oil contained in foods,&#xD;
      ranging from olive oil (typical of the Mediterranean diet) to fats of animal origin or&#xD;
      vegetable oils not coming from the olives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olive oil is universally recognized as the symbol of the Mediterranean diet and its&#xD;
      beneficial properties have been extensively studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, there are scientific evidence showing an effect of virgin olive oil on the&#xD;
      lipid metabolism, on chronic inflammation, on blood pressure, and the regulation and&#xD;
      detoxification of free radicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, beneficial effects would in part be related to polyphenols, potent natural&#xD;
      antioxidants contained in olive oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monocultivar Coratina extra virgin olive oil (MC-EVOO) is an Apulian olive oil that, while&#xD;
      possessing an extraordinary health effect superior to other cultivars, is not very used&#xD;
      because of its distinctive characteristics of bitter and spicy. The bitter and the spicy of&#xD;
      the extra virgin olive oil obtained from Coratina monocultivar are not defects in the oil but&#xD;
      are the expression of a very high concentration of polyphenols (up to 800-1000 mg / kg of&#xD;
      oil) compared to other varieties which, as well as providing extraordinary health benefits to&#xD;
      the consumer, extend the expiration date of the oil itself, preserving it from oxidative&#xD;
      action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MC-EVOO is a typical of the Apulia Region and it is characterized by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. high content of polyphenols&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. natural 100% product, with no residues of chemical solvents and other toxic and harmful&#xD;
           contaminants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No studies have been published so far that have demonstrated a potential toxic effects of&#xD;
      polyphenols. Instead, EVOO-C supplementation could potentially have positive effects on lipid&#xD;
      metabolism and body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies suggest that daily intake of fruits and vegetables high in&#xD;
      polyphenols or the addition of olive oil containing many polyphenols is associated with a&#xD;
      reduced risk of chronic diseases including cardiovascular, inflammatory, metabolic,&#xD;
      neurodegenerative, and some neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also the results of in vitro study showed these properties but these results have to be&#xD;
      carefully evaluated because in vivo the polyphenols, after being absorbed into the intestine&#xD;
      and conjugated in the liver, arrive in the blood in methylated, sulphated and glycogenated&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These molecules are completely different from the structural point of view of native&#xD;
      molecules. Moreover, their presence is in the concentration of nano or micro molecules. These&#xD;
      molecules have different biological properties from native ones and are distributed&#xD;
      differently in different tissues and cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in the in-vitro studies native polyphenol molecules have been used at high&#xD;
      concentrations, or above physiological (over 100 micromoles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first reason why a clinical trial case study was planned. Polyphenols also&#xD;
      modulate cell membranes, enzymes, transcription factors and receptors. This is the second&#xD;
      reason why nutrigenomics will be studied during the course of the clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of polyphenols on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the inflammatory&#xD;
      processes that are present in the ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo experiments demonstrated that the administration of a diet associated with daily&#xD;
      intake of EVOO reduces histological lesions and symptomatology in rats with a DDS induced&#xD;
      colitis. A diet supplemented with hydroxytyrosol (a component of olive oil) showed a&#xD;
      reduction of the inflammatory process at the inflamed colon of the rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data show that EVOO supplementation in a diet can improve the course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental studies in humans are limited. The first study published over 25 years ago&#xD;
      concluded that administering a supplement of fish oil to the diet produced a modest reduction&#xD;
      in corticosteroid in the active phases of the disease, but not a benefit in maintenance&#xD;
      therapy over olive oil. This work presents important limitations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the content of polyphenols in the oils used is unknown&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the remission time between the two oils was not statistically significant&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. there are no data on inflammation of the colon before and after treatment Recently, an&#xD;
           in vitro study performed on intestinal mucosa obtained from 14 active UC patients showed&#xD;
           that samples treated with oleuropein had a reduced expression of two inflammatory&#xD;
           factors, COX-2 and IL-17, suggesting that olive oil containing oleuropein can improve&#xD;
           inflammatory status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether MC- EVOO supplementation in moderate to severe UC&#xD;
      patients needing a steroid cycle may increase the clinical response rate to medical therapy.&#xD;
