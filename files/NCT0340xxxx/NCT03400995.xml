  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, single-dose, non-randomised, open label study. The primary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to assess the mass balance recovery and provide biosamples for&#xD;
      metabolite profiling and structural identification after a single oral dose of [14C]-AK0529&#xD;
      in healthy male subjects. 7 subjects will be recruited to receive a single oral&#xD;
      administration of a solution containing 300 mg AK0529. The total duration of the study will&#xD;
      be approximately 6 weeks.&#xD;
