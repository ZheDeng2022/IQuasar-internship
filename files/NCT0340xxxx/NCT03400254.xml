      hydroxychloroquine in early-stage breast cancer patients with residual disease and evidence&#xD;
      of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) on bone marrow aspirate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;

    <description>All patients will receive HCQ at a dose of 600 mg orally twice daily. This dose is the same in both phase Ib and phase II portions of the protocol. Capsules of HCQ are available in 200 mg strength, thus patients will initially start with 3 capsules twice daily for a total of 6 capsules per day. HCQ will be administered in divided doses (BID). When taking HCQ twice daily, the two daily doses should be taken 12 hours apart as close to 9am and 9pm as possible. Patients receiving antacids, sucralfate, cholestyramine, and/or bicarbonate should have the HCQ drug dose administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after these medications. Hydroxychloroquine will be obtained from the UPENN Investigational Drug Service (IDS).</description>

    <description>Gedatolisib will be administered intravenously on a weekly dosing schedule at 150 mg IV.&#xD;
Within 3 days prior to GED dosing the patient must have an ANC &gt;1.0 x 109/L and platelet count &gt; 75 x 109/L. If hematologic toxicity persists, treatment should be delayed by one week and the complete blood cell count with differential and platelet count repeated. Treatment may be delayed for up to 4 consecutive weeks (28 days). If after 28 days of delay all hematologic toxicity has still not resolved to normal and non-hematologic toxicity has not resolved to &lt;grade 1 then any further treatment with GED should be stopped.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Bone marrow aspirate after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery demonstrates&#xD;
        detectable DTCs (via IHC) as performed by central laboratory assessment at Univerity of&#xD;
        Pennsylvania.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: The criterion will be assessed AFTER confirmation of the eligibility criteria below.&#xD;
        Patients must be pre-registered for screening of DTCs as outlined in Section 5.1 History of&#xD;
        stage I-III histologically-confirmed primary invasive breast cancer with no evidence of&#xD;
        recurrent local or distant disease. NOTE: Patients with bilateral breast cancer are&#xD;
        eligible, so long as both cancers are treated with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any receptor status at diagnosis (by ASCO/CAP guidelines) is eligible; however, the&#xD;
        following criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with ER+/Her2 negative tumors must have demonstrated pathologic residual&#xD;
             invasive disease within either the breast (with residual tumor measuring â‰¥ 2.5 cm) or&#xD;
             regional lymph nodes at the time of definitive surgery following neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Her2+ disease (regardless of ER status) or triple negative&#xD;
             (ER-/PR-/Her2-) disease are eligible if there is any amount of residual disease&#xD;
             present in the breast or regional lymph nodes at the time of definitive surgery&#xD;
             following neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be within 24 months of undergoing definitive breast surgery&#xD;
             post-neoadjuvant therapy. All margins of resection must be free of disease at the time&#xD;
             of final surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have completed adjuvant treatment, including post-surgery chemotherapy&#xD;
             (if clinically indicated), radiation (if clinically indicated) and/or Her2-directed&#xD;
             adjuvant therapy (if Her2+). Prior treatment-related toxicity must be resolved to â‰¤&#xD;
             Grade 1 with the exception of alopecia and peripheral neuropathy, prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment..&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current/Concurrent Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients will be eligible to enroll after receiving a minimum of 3 months of adjuvant&#xD;
             endocrine therapy, to allow stabilization of side effects. Premenopausal patients on&#xD;
             concurrent ovarian suppression are eligible. Patients on tamoxifen are ineligible due&#xD;
             to the potential drug-drug interaction with hydroxychloroquine. Patients on any other&#xD;
             adjuvant endocrine therapy, including any investigational therapy, are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent receipt of bone modifying agents (bisphosphonates or rank-ligand&#xD;
             inhibitors) is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No concurrent enrollment on another investigational therapy clinical trial.&#xD;

             Formula is acceptable in lieu of a measured value.&#xD;
&#xD;
