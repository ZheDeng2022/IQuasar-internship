  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (ESG) is an endoscopic minimally invasive weight loss&#xD;
      procedure where a commercially available, FDA approved, full-thickness endoscopic suturing&#xD;
      device (Overstitch; Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, TX) is used to reduce the stomach volume by&#xD;
      80% through the creation of a restrictive endoscopic sleeve. This is accomplished by a series&#xD;
      of endolumenally placed full-thickness sutures through the gastric wall, extending from the&#xD;
      antrum to the gastroesophageal junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 200 participants at 9 locations in the United States will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ESG procedure has been performed clinically since 2013 in the United States. The&#xD;
      investigators are completing this study to compare how effective the ESG is for achieving&#xD;
      long-term weight loss when compared to lifestyle modification only, as well as to evaluate&#xD;
      the long-term safety and durability of the procedure and its impact on quality of life.&#xD;
      Results of this research may help support having this procedure covered by health insurance&#xD;
      plans for future patients.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to the control group (lifestyle intervention only) in Year 1 will undergo a standard moderate intensity life-style intervention during the first 12 months of participation. Control group participants who were compliant with at least 75% of visits in Year 1, have not achieved ≥25% EWL or have a BMI &gt;30 measured at the week 52 visit, and have no new psychosocial contraindications as deemed by the treatment team to the procedure will cross over to receive the Overstitch ESG in Year 2, in addition to the standard moderate intensity lifestyle intervention program for 12 months.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the treatment group will proceed to have the Overstitch ESG at the start of Year 1 and will undergo a standard moderate intensity life-style intervention during the first 12 months of participation. All patients undergoing ESG will go on a 6 weeks transitional diet.ESG patients will undergo a standard moderate intensity life-style intervention administered over 15 12 visits in the first year after ESG. ESG patients who have not achieved &gt;25% EWL at the end of Year 1 will undergo a repeat upper endoscopy at 52 to 60 weeks to assess the durability of the plications. Patients will continue follow-up with a modified lifestyle intervention program administered over 6 visits in the second year</description>
