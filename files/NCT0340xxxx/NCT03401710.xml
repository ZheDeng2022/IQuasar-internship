    <textblock>
      The use of erythropoietin to treat anemia in acute kidney injury (AKI) is controversial. No&#xD;
      previous clinical trial has assessed the possible reduction of transfusions when&#xD;
      erythropoietin is started very early in a setting of in-hospital acute kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised multicenter pragmatic clinical trial will compare the need for transfusion in&#xD;
      acute kidney injury between two groups: group 1 will receive erythopoietin 4000 UI every&#xD;
      other day and group 2 the usual treatment.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the release of the recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuEPO) at the beginning of the&#xD;
      90s, transfusions are less needed to treat anemia in chronic kidney disease patients. This&#xD;
      has been a major revolution in the management of renal anemia in chronic kidney disease and&#xD;
      led to a tremendous decrease in hepatitis B and C transmissions in dialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However the use of rHuEPO to treat anemia in acute kidney injury (AKI) is controversial. AKI&#xD;
      is a common disease with a worldwide incidence estimated at 21% and a trend to be higher in&#xD;
      the critical care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) work group combined the RIFLE and AKIN&#xD;
      classifications of AKI. Therefore, AKI has been defined as an increase in serum creatinine&#xD;
      (SCr) ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 h or an increase in SCr to ≥1.5 times baseline&#xD;
      within the last 7 days or a urine volume of &lt;0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As it was already shown, the majority of patients admitted with AKI have anemia (91% in Hales&#xD;
      et al study) and the anemia seems to be related to the degree of oliguria and uremia level.&#xD;
      Erythropoietin is secreted at the tubulo-interstitial level and it has been shown that a&#xD;
      chronic injury would lead to a decrease in erythropoietin secretion. Some studies have shown&#xD;
      that erythropoietin level increases the first 48 hours of acute kidney injury then decreases&#xD;
      progressively. Transfusions are needed when critically ill patients stay at the hospital for&#xD;
      a long period of time. And transfusions during acute kidney injury may lead to sensitization&#xD;
      and cause limitation for future transplantation in patients who reach end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease. Therefore prevention of transfusions in acute kidney injury patients is highly&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A search of the literature for &quot;human recombinant erythropoietin&quot; and &quot;acute renal failure&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;acute kidney disease&quot; or &quot;acute kidney injury&quot; did not reveal any clinical trial or&#xD;
      observational study targeting this issue. Some studies assessed the role of rHuEPO to prevent&#xD;
      acute kidney injury in cardiac surgery patients and contrast-induced nephropathy with&#xD;
      conflicting results. Some experimental studies on rats demonstrated a favorable effect of&#xD;
      rHuEPO and darbepoetin on the ischemic renal injury. A recent metaanalysis of 10 randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials showed no beneficial effect of erythropoietin on preventing AKI or dialysis&#xD;
      or death but the majority of patients received a single dose of rHuEPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of rHuEPO after the occurrence of acute kidney injury is not well studied. One&#xD;
      retrospective study in 2005 showed that rHuEPO administration in acute renal failure patients&#xD;
      did not decrease the transfusion requirements. However it included many limitations such as&#xD;
      the low dose of rHuEPO used, the absence of preset hemoglobin level threshold for blood&#xD;
      transfusions. A recent clinical trial in children with hemolytic uremic syndrome showed a&#xD;
      decrease in transfusion in patients receiving EPO. Therefore a clinical trial taking into&#xD;
      account all of these factors would be more conclusive regarding the exact role of&#xD;
      erythropoietin in acute kidney injury patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial objectives The primary objective of this trial is to compare the number of red blood&#xD;
      cell transfusions in patients with acute kidney injury and anemia whether receiving or not&#xD;
      rHuEPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are a) to compare the renal survival between the two groups, b) to&#xD;
      compare the patient survival between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, pragmatic clinical trial.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of two arms and then group one will receive the rHuEPO and&#xD;
      group two the usual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the superiority of rHuEPO use in acute kidney injury with anemia&#xD;
      against no use of rHuEPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Data collection, management, and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection methods Data collection will be carried out using excel program. Data for&#xD;
      presumed cause of acute kidney injury, comorbidities, medications and laboratory results are&#xD;
      collected from the patients' medical records. The following variables will be studied: age,&#xD;
      gender, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, smoking in the last year, hypertension,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, previous cardiovascular disease, previous inflammatory disease, previous&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), previous serum creatinine (Scr) and Scr on&#xD;
      admission (with corresponding eGFR using the CKD-EPI equation), phosphate, calcium, albumin,&#xD;
      bicarbonate, hemoglobin, ferritin, TSAT, vitamin B12, uric acid and CPK. Data on previous&#xD;
      medications will be collected: iron substitutes, multivitamins, non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs, antihypertensive medications such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs,&#xD;
      antiplatelet agents, urate lowering therapy, antibiotics and corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions Acute kidney injury is defined based on the RIFLE, AKIN and KDIGO criteria.&#xD;
      Anemia is defined in general as Hb &lt;13 g/dl in male patients and &lt;12 g/dl in females. Anemia&#xD;
      in this trial will be defined as Hb&lt;11 g/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease is defined as a history of myocardial infarction or obstructive&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, treated medically or interventionally. Diabetes and hypertension are&#xD;
      defined as taking antidiabetic treatment or antihypertensive treatment respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Continuous variables will be presented as mean ± standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD). Differences between the study groups will be tested using χ2 tests (for categorical&#xD;
      variables). Bivariate correlation analysis will be performed using the Pearson's correlation&#xD;
      coefficient. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the cumulative survival. Cox&#xD;
      regression will be used to determine the effect of erythropoietin on renal survival and total&#xD;
      mortality. Statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS. A P-value of ≤0.05 is considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring Follow-up with laboratory measurements and medication dosage Hemoglobin and&#xD;
      creatinine will be measured with the standard laboratory techniques every day. C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP) will be measured at least twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications administered during the hospitalization will be collected as the total dose of&#xD;
      the duration of stay, particularly noradrenaline, dopamine, furosemide, antibiotics,&#xD;
      anticoagulants, vitamins, enteral or parenteral nutrition, proton-pump inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfusions: quantity of units of packed red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up Data including daily systolic and diastolic blood pressure, average&#xD;
      hospital length of stay (LOS), oligo-anuria at any stage of the AKI, need for dialysis and&#xD;
      number of days till serum creatinine starts to decrease will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be also reported such as any thrombotic event.&#xD;
