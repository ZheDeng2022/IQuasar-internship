  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of older people with cognitive decline is increasing since the aging&#xD;
      population is growing substantially worldwide. Cognitive impairment places older adults at&#xD;
      high risk for functional disability. Previous researches have provided strong evidence on the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of physical exercise on maintaining cognitive functions in older adults.&#xD;
      Tai Chi is considered as a low to moderate intensity exercise, which is performed in a slow&#xD;
      and rhythmic movement. It is a popular and safe exercise suitable for older people who have&#xD;
      weaker muscle strength. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of Tai Chi on&#xD;
      cognition and instrumental activities of daily living (I-ADLs), and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQOL) in older Chinese adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis of the study stated: There is significant improvement in the general&#xD;
      cognitive performance, functional capabilities of instrumental ADLs,the physical component&#xD;
      and mental component of HRQOL between the group of community-dwelling older people with MCI&#xD;
      who have participated and the control group who have not participated in the Tai Chi program.&#xD;

      1. Study design &amp; sample recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This was a quasi-experimental study which adopted the multi-site non-randomized control&#xD;
           group pre- and post-test design. By adopting the multi-site design, better&#xD;
           representation of the population could be obtained. This intervention study involved two&#xD;
           groups of participant, the experimental and control groups, whereas no randomization&#xD;
           would be taken place.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study was carried out in District Elderly Community Centers (DECCs) in Hong Kong.&#xD;
           The DECC has been implemented since 2001 under the support from the Social Warfare&#xD;
           Department (SWD) to provide community support services at district level to enable older&#xD;
           people to remain in the community and to lead a healthy, respectful and dignified&#xD;
           life.The service users are community-dwelling older citizens aged 60 or above living in&#xD;
           the locality. Invitation letters were sent to various DECCs for joining the study.&#xD;
           Finally, there were four elderly centers willing to participate in the study. The&#xD;
           participants were recruited from the four DECCs using convenience sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To avoid the possible diffusion effect that might interfere the research result, all&#xD;
           eligible participants in a community center were allocated to either experimental group&#xD;
           or control group, who were treated with single intervention, so there would be no&#xD;
           discussion among participants who have received different treatment regimes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The present study had employed a control group to enhance methodological rigor and&#xD;
           included a pre-test to assess the equivalence between two groups, so the problem on&#xD;
           selection biases could be alleviated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sample size estimation A medium effect size of 0.5 was set for the study, based on&#xD;
           previous research on the effect of Tai Chi on cognitive function. Based on the use of a&#xD;
           sample size calculator (https://www2.ccrb.cuhk.edu.hk/stat/Other.htm), a sample of 64&#xD;
           per group was expected to provide 80% power to detect a medium effect size of 0.5, at a&#xD;
           significance level of 0.05. Allowing for an attrition rate of 20% in the Tai Chi groups,&#xD;
           80 participants were recruited for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intervention The intervention group received a 16-week Tai Chi program, of 32 sessions&#xD;
           (two sessions per week) each one hour long.The capacity was around 20 people per class.&#xD;
           A certified Tai Chi master taught the Yang-style simple form of Tai Chi to the&#xD;
           participants allocated to the experimental group.There were four sets of movements&#xD;
           included in the simplified form; this required less time for the older practitioners,&#xD;
           who usually had less exercise endurance, to complete the whole set of movements.&#xD;
           Moreover, it was an appropriate form of Tai Chi for older people with MCI because it&#xD;
           involved only a few postures, hence it was easier for them to learn and remember. The&#xD;
           Tai Chi classes were conducted in the open hall of the community center or a public&#xD;
           playground with sufficient space, a flat floor and good lighting.To promote safety,&#xD;
           measures include appropriate footwear, appropriate warm-up and cool-down, correct&#xD;
           exercise technique and gradual increases in exercise dose will be emphasized in Tai Chi&#xD;
           class. Incident report will be done to record and analyses causes for any adverse effect&#xD;
           on Tai Chi training.To ensure adherence, the participants were required to sign&#xD;
           attendance records. Telephone follow-up was arranged to provide emotional support and&#xD;
           reinforce compliance if they were absent from two consecutive lessons. As well, the&#xD;
           participants were advised to do daily practice at home to foster better mastery of the&#xD;
           Tai Chi movements and build up a regular exercise habit. A guide book was issued to each&#xD;
           participant, providing guidance to reinforce correct postures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For participants in the control group, they were considered as usual care group which&#xD;
           could attend for different kinds of recreational activities provided by the community&#xD;
           center. However, they were advised not to practice Tai Chi and not to join any&#xD;
           structured physical training program during the study period to avoid possible aerobic&#xD;
           capacity changes with exercise practices causing interferon on experimental outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data collection The outcome variables of the study comprised of general cognitive&#xD;
           status, instrumental ADLs, and HRQOL of older participants. The outcome assessments were&#xD;
           conducted at baseline, and at 4-month (at the end of study) for all participants.The&#xD;
           Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE) was used for global&#xD;
           cognitive assessment. The Hong Kong Chinese version of Lawton's Instrumental Activities&#xD;
           of Daily Living (IADL-CV) was used to assess the participants' IADLs levels and the&#xD;
           Chinese version of the Short Form-12 Health Survey-Standard 1 (SF-12) was employed to&#xD;
           assess the participants' perceived health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data analysis The IBM SPSS Version 24.0 (IBM Crop. Armonk, N.Y.) was used for data entry&#xD;
           and analysis. All statistical tests involved were 2-tailed and the level of significance&#xD;
           was set at 5%. Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, frequency,&#xD;
           and percentage, were used to summarize and present the sample characteristics and&#xD;
           outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and independent t- tests were used, as appropriate, to&#xD;
           compare the characteristics of intervention and control group at the baseline. If there&#xD;
           were significant differences between two groups of these characteristics, they were&#xD;
           adjusted in the subsequent outcome analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) was applied for comparing each of the repeated&#xD;
           measures study outcomes (i.e. CMMSE score, IADL-CV score, physical and mental components&#xD;
           of SF-12 as well as subscales of SF-12) between the two groups with adjustment for those&#xD;
           demographic characteristics showing statistical incomparability between groups. Two&#xD;
           dummy variables, Group and Time, were included in each GEE model to represent the&#xD;
           baseline group difference (Intervention - Control) and the time effect on the control&#xD;
           group (Post 16 weeks - Baseline), respectively. Furthermore, the interaction term, Group&#xD;
           by Time (Group*Time) was also included to assess the differential change in each outcome&#xD;
           between the two groups. GEE model could account for intra-correlated repeated measures&#xD;
           outcome and produce unbiased effect estimated under the data missingness mechanism of&#xD;
           missing completely at random (MCAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Ethical consideration Approval for conducting the study was obtained from the Joint&#xD;
           CUHK-NTEC Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and&#xD;
           the selected community elderly centers.The participants were required to sign a consent&#xD;
           form. Information and the purpose of the study were explained. They could withdraw from&#xD;
           the study at any time of their own will.&#xD;
