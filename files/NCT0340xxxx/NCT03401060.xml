      The study is looking at the efficacy of subcutaneously administrated denosumab 60 mg every 6&#xD;
      months versus placebo after 3 years, by analyze of lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) in&#xD;
      systemic mastocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that use of denosumab subcutaneously in patients with osteoporosis&#xD;
      related to systemic mastocytosis is effective and safe to improve bone mineral density and&#xD;
      prevent new bone events, based on targeted specific RANKL secretion by mast cells and short&#xD;
      half-life of denosumab.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Systemic mastocytosis (SM) represents a heterogenous group of disease characterized by&#xD;
      abnormal proliferation of mast cells caused by activating mutations in c-Kit receptor; a&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase family receptor present in mast cell that control cell proliferation.&#xD;
      Prevalence of SM is estimated to 1/20 000 person. According to the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) criteria (Johnson et al, 2009), SM can be separated into two different groups :&#xD;
      indolent SM and aggressive SM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aggressive SM are defined by a poor prognostic disease either because of an important mast&#xD;
      cell tumor mass as sarcoma mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia, or due to an association with&#xD;
      an other myeloid hemopathy as myelodysplasic/myeloproliferative syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indolent SM are the most common cases with a very good prognostic similar to general&#xD;
      population. Symptoms related to mast cell proliferation in indolent SM are very various&#xD;
      (Theoharides et al., 2015) and could be divided into 2 entities : those related to mast cell&#xD;
      proliferation in tissue as the urticaria pigmentosa and those related to the mast cell&#xD;
      degranulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many clinical relevant mediators released by mast cells after activation that could&#xD;
      have putative effects on different systems as cardiovascular, cutaneous, neurologic,&#xD;
      digestive, systemic, respiratory and musculoskeletal (Frenzel et al., 2013). Tryptase,&#xD;
      histamine, prostaglandin, interleukine-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α are the most&#xD;
      common and ubiquitous mediators released by mast cells but there are also some specific&#xD;
      mediator targeting an organ as RANKL ; expression of RANKL by mast cells directly control&#xD;
      regulation of osteoclast activity and is involved in osteoporosis associated to SM&#xD;
      (Rabenhorst et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In systemic mastocytoses, bone lesions are found in about half of patients. A third have&#xD;
      osteoporosis defined as a lumbar spine or hip bone T score of -2,5 Standard Deviation (SD) or&#xD;
      less. In most cases, osteoporosis was complicated at least by one vertebral fracture with&#xD;
      pain and functional disorders (Barete et al, 2010). The median time to fragility fracture&#xD;
      after mastocytoses diagnosis is up to 5 years, even in very young population usually&#xD;
      considering as low risk of fracture in non mastocytoses associated osteoporosis (Van de Veer&#xD;
      et al., 2014)&#xD;
&#xD;
      By default, these patients are generally treated with bisphosphonate per os or intravenously&#xD;
      with some efficiency on bone mineral density gain and bone turnover marker decrease (Rossini&#xD;
      et al, 2014). However, no study with bisphosphonate in SM has showed durable prevention of&#xD;
      new bone events and there are no randomized studies that proved their efficacy in systemic&#xD;
      mastocytosis. Moreover, these drugs are not well tolerated in SM wether per os due to&#xD;
      worsening of digestive symptoms by mast cells activation, or intravenously with an important&#xD;
      number of acute phase characterized by some systemic symptoms as fever ; really experiences&#xD;
      with intravenous biphosphonate but very increased in SM. Additional, the use of a&#xD;
      bisphosphonate ask the question of the residual long-term effect of this drug that may be&#xD;
      several years or even decades with a significant risk of atypical fracture secondary to a&#xD;
      adynamic bone remodeling (Edwards et al. , 2013) and the long-term presence of crystals of&#xD;
      bisphosphonate in the skeleton, particularly worrying in women of childbearing age. In&#xD;
      postmenopausal osteoporosis, importance of residual long-term effect is weighted with&#xD;
      advanced median age of patient. The fact that mostly patients with a systemic mastocytosis&#xD;
      are young people led to restrict the use of bisphosphonate due to those effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among different treatment available in post menopausal osteoporosis, the use of an anti-RANKL&#xD;
      antibody, denosumab, in SM associated osteoporosis could be interesting. First, denosumab has&#xD;
      already shown significant efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women&#xD;
      (Cummings et al , 2009). Second, this treatment is proposed every 6 months by a subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection with very few side effects and half-life drug is shorter than biphosphonate with&#xD;
      probably low residual long-time effect. Third, as mast cells expressed mainly RANKL with a&#xD;
      direct role on bone turnover in SM. The use of a specific drug seems to be obvious and&#xD;
      attractive.&#xD;
