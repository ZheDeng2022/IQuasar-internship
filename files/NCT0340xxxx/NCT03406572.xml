  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic respiratory insufficiency and COPD are the third leading cause of death worldwide.&#xD;
      Patients decompensate at various stages of their disease and exhibit acute-on-chronic&#xD;
      respiratory failure (ACRF), a frequent cause of ICU hospitalization for hypercapnic acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure (ARF). Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the first line ventilatory&#xD;
      treatment for hypercapnic ARF. It is applied intermittently, separated by periods of&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing (SB) with standard oxygen (O2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard O2 has drawbacks that limit the benefit of intermittent NIV in hypercapnic ARF:&#xD;
      limited gas flow which is well below the patient's inspiratory flow rate, limited capacity&#xD;
      and efficiency of oxygenation with non-controlled FiO2 (risk of excessive oxygen and induced&#xD;
      hypercapnia), and cold and dry gas leading to discomfort and under-humidification of the&#xD;
      airways and tracheobronchial secretions. Benefits in terms of work of breathing and CO2&#xD;
      removal resulting from PEEP and pressure support applied during NIV periods could be rapidly&#xD;
      lost during standard O2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, use of high-flow heated and humidified nasal oxygen therapy (HFHO) has gained&#xD;
      enthusiasm among intensivists to manage ARF. HFHO delivers high flows (up to 60L/min, that&#xD;
      generate moderate PEEP) of heated and humidified oxygen at a controlled and adjustable FiO2&#xD;
      (21 to 100%) that rapidly improve respiratory distress symptoms, oxygenation, respiratory&#xD;
      comfort and outcome of patients with hypoxemic ARF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These unique features of HFHO could overcome some of the drawbacks of standard O2 during SB&#xD;
      periods in hypercapnic ARF. Indeed, PEEP effect, washout of nasopharyngeal dead-space&#xD;
      limiting CO2 re-breathing and inspired gas conditioning preserving adequate mucosal function&#xD;
      and secretion removal, could potentially contribute to decrease airways resistance, intrinsic&#xD;
      PEEP and work of breathing, while improving patient comfort. Investigators aim to determine&#xD;
      if the use of HFHO, as compared to standard O2, increases the number of ventilator-free days&#xD;
      (VFDs) and alive at day 28 in patients with hypercapnic ARF admitted in an ICU, an&#xD;
      intermediate care, or a respiratory care unit, and requiring NIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In both groups, treatment will start with a first NIV session of 2 hours, with arterial blood&#xD;
      gas measurement between one hour and two hours after initiating the NIV session. The NIV will&#xD;
      be extended for those patients with a pH &lt; 7.30. In both groups, patients will be assessed&#xD;
      for their tolerance of NIV and their ability to switch to spontaneous breathing every hour&#xD;
      +/- 30 min, except during sleep (10 pm-8 am); they will be assessed for their tolerance of&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing and for the need of resumption of NIV every 2 hours+/- 30 min and every&#xD;
      4 +/- 1 hours thereafter. To ensure the consistency of indications of NIV and invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation (IMV) across centers and reduce potential bias, NIV and IMV will be&#xD;
      initiated and stopped in the same way in the two groups, using predefined criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion (day 0): informed consent, randomisation (HFHO group/standard O2 group), NIV&#xD;
           initiation (for 2 hours), clinical and paraclinical exam including ABG, data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up (day 1 to day 28) : NIV, clinical exam, ABG, data collection&#xD;
