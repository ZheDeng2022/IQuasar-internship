  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is one single group of participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who&#xD;
      have not been cured by other treatments. It is the first time the drug has been used in&#xD;
      humans, and will be in two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the parts are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Escalation: To investigate the safety and tolerability and to determine the maximum&#xD;
           tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of DS-1062a&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Expansion: To investigate the safety and tolerability of DS-1062a in additional&#xD;
           solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is expected to last approximately 6 years from the time the first participant is&#xD;
      enrolled to the time the last subject is off the study. Study sites are located in both the&#xD;
      United States and Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of treatment cycles is not fixed in this study. Participants who continue to&#xD;
      benefit from the study treatment may continue, unless:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  they withdraw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  their disease gets worse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  they experience unacceptable side effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dosage strength will change during the study but all participants will receive the same&#xD;
      study drug. So the study is not a true 2-arm study, it is a 2-part study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts, participants with pathologically documented unresectable advanced NSCLC and&#xD;
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have been refractory to or relapsed from standard&#xD;
      treatment or for which no standard treatment is available, will be enrolled. In Dose&#xD;
      Expansion, additional indications (hormone receptor [HR]-positive human epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative breast cancer, small cell lung cancer [SCLC], endometrial&#xD;
      cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, HER2-negative gastric/gastroesophageal junction [GEJ]&#xD;
      cancer, esophageal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [HNSCC], transitional cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the urothelium, colorectal cancer [CRC], platinum-resistant ovarian cancer,&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and castration-resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      [CRPC]) may be evaluated, if the study treatment demonstrates acceptable safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and efficacy in NSCLC participants. After the primary analysis, the main (registered) study&#xD;
      will be considered complete, but data will be collected from participants who continue&#xD;
      receiving study drug.&#xD;
