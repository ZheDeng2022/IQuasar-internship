      To derive the maximum tolerated dose of hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy&#xD;
      (SBRT) using dose painting by numbers with immunomodulating systemic therapy in patients that&#xD;
      are reirradiated for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment in inoperable locally or regionally recurrent head and neck cancer has&#xD;
      long been palliative systemic therapy using the so-called EXTREME-scheme: a combination of&#xD;
      cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and cetuximab. This therapy remains without realistic chances of&#xD;
      cure. More recently, immunotherapy using nivolumab has demonstrated to result in long-term&#xD;
      disease control of 1-2 year in cisplatin-refractory recurrent or metastatic head and neck&#xD;
      cancer, however only in a small portion of patients (13%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractionated high-dose local or regional re-irradiation is mostly given in a 6-7 weeks&#xD;
      scheme. Using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), high radiotherapy doses can be given in&#xD;
      a short time span. Severe late adverse events have been reported using SBRT but seem less&#xD;
      frequent than in patients re-treated with conventional schedules. A possible solution to be&#xD;
      able to administer higher doses is combining SBRT with dose painting, thus giving these high&#xD;
      doses on small subvolumes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addition of concomitant therapy to reirradiation may further improve outcomes due to&#xD;
      radiosensitization and direct cytotoxicity. Therefore the investigator aims to combine high&#xD;
      doses with concomitant therapy in the proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunomodulatory effect caused by radiation has been demonstrated both in animal models&#xD;
      and clinical trials and leads to an enhanced local control as well as to eradication of&#xD;
      distant metastasis. This so-called abscopal effect is reached through a systemic immune&#xD;
      response evoked by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by the dying&#xD;
      tumor-cells, also called immunogenic cell death (ICD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesizes that an abscopal effect could be present for patients&#xD;
      presenting locoregional recurrent disease with asymptomatic distant metastases, thereby&#xD;
      offering at least symptom control at the primary site while palliative systemic treatment&#xD;
      could be postponed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed protocol focuses on patients with bad prognosis, as determined by a short&#xD;
      timespan between primary therapy and recurrence (defined as 6-24 months after the end of the&#xD;
      primary radiotherapy). It would bring the practical advantage of only 2-3 patient visits for&#xD;
      the radiotherapy instead of ± 30-35 visits over 6-7 weeks. This shorter treatment schedule is&#xD;
      expected to result in a direct gain in quality-of-life due to locoregional symptom control.&#xD;
      It can also be expected that rescue systemic therapy will be postponed to a later stage of&#xD;
      disease development, thereby prolonging overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination with systemic agents that are involved in immunogenic cell death bear the&#xD;
      potential to result in a higher number of patients with longer periods of disease control and&#xD;
      survival. The current standard of care, i.e. the combined systemic treatment with cisplatin -&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil - cetuximab, or nivolumab in case of former cisplatin use, can be used as a&#xD;
      rescue regimen in case of therapy failure. In that sense, better overall survival from time&#xD;
      of diagnosis of the index locoregional recurrent disease is expected.&#xD;

The standard &quot;3+3&quot; design will be used for the this trial. To obtain more precise toxicity rate of the MTD we will double the number of patients at the first dose prescription that gives totally 6 patients. The 3 remaining dose levels will include 3 patients each. Thus, fifteen (6+3+3+3) patients will be included in this radiotherapy dose finding study investigating the MTD.&#xD;
The number of patients will be doubled in case of 2 DLTs at the dose prescription I and 1 DLT at dose prescriptions II-IV with DLT in a maximum of 10 out of 30 patients.&#xD;
