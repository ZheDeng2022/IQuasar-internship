    <textblock>
      Brachial plexus block is a common regional anesthesia technique which is performed by&#xD;
      anesthesiologists to anesthetize the arm for surgery. In this study, we are investigating the&#xD;
      relationship between the nerve conduction (induced by brachial plexus block) and the&#xD;
      patients' symptoms before and after the brachial plexus block. We will attach a nerve&#xD;
      conduction device (SSEP device) to monitor the patients' arm conduction and we will assess&#xD;
      the patients' symptoms simultaneously.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Perioperative peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is an under-recognized and under-investigated&#xD;
      complication of general anesthesia and continues to impact postoperative recovery resulting&#xD;
      in patient disability malpractice claims.(1-5) In the American Society of Anesthesiologists&#xD;
      (ASA) Closed Claims Analysis (published in 1999), PNI was the second most common cause of&#xD;
      claims other than death. (6-7) This claim pattern has remained essentially unchanged over the&#xD;
      past 3 decades and the average settlement was $123,000 US Dollar/claim (unpublished data from&#xD;
      ASA closed claims analysis). The overall incidence of PNI varies across different surgical&#xD;
      procedures, and it is significantly affected by the underlying patient comorbidities and&#xD;
      pre-existing peripheral neuropathy. Despite considerable implications of PNI to both the&#xD;
      patients and clinicians, little progress has been made in the past three decades in&#xD;
      developing a reliable intraoperative monitoring technique for its early detection and&#xD;
      prevention. SSEP monitoring has long been used in neurology as a means to diagnose peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy and has been used for the early detection of intraoperative PNI caused by improper&#xD;
      patient positioning. A few retrospective studies have found that reversal of intraoperative&#xD;
      SSEP signal changes (e.g. correct the patient's arm position in the event of a positioning&#xD;
      related peripheral nerve compromise) prevented postoperative neuropathy, suggesting SSEP&#xD;
      could be used to detect intraoperative PNI and that prompt intervention could reverse&#xD;
      neurological injury (8-10). However, to date, there has not been a study that clearly defines&#xD;
      how the magnitudes of SSEP changes relate to the severity of peripheral nerve dysfunction.&#xD;
      Due to this lack of information, the current thresholds that are used for diagnosing PNI in a&#xD;
      variety of surgical procedures are largely based on the results of SSEP monitoring in spinal&#xD;
      cord injury. The traditional diagnostic criteria (used in spinal cord injury) might not be&#xD;
      applicable for PNI. Fundamentally, there is also a lack of a clinical study that defines&#xD;
      significant and non-significant changes for PNI. Most current available evidence regarding&#xD;
      SSEP in PNI is retrospective and mainly derived from patients being monitored for spinal cord&#xD;
      or cerebral injury during neurosurgical procedures. The lack of well-validated diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria is one of the key issues in preventing the use of SSEP for monitoring peripheral&#xD;
      nerves during surgery. As such, further studies are required to characterize the relationship&#xD;
      between SSEP changes and peripheral nerve dysfunction and re-define the threshold (or cut-off&#xD;
      values) for significant SSEP change for PNI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective cohort study to evaluate the relationship between the peripheral nerve&#xD;
      dysfunction, and SSEP signal changes in patients who will receive a brachial plexus block for&#xD;
      their surgical procedure. Brachial plexus block is a regional anesthesia technique routinely&#xD;
      performed by anesthesiologists where the nerves in the arm are blocked with local anesthetics&#xD;
      to prohibit movement and sensation. In LHSC, the average brachial plexus block performed is&#xD;
      around 10-15 patients/day for various upper limb surgeries. In this study, the patients with&#xD;
      brachial plexus block will be used as a model of brachial plexus injury to assess the&#xD;
      relationship between intraoperative brachial plexus injury and the SSEP changes. Brachial&#xD;
      plexus block in awake patients is an attractive model to study brachial plexus injury,&#xD;
      because it provides transient and progressive de-afferentation state of brachial plexus&#xD;
      dysfunction (mimicking brachial plexus injury), allows for real-time assessment of the&#xD;
      relationship between clinical symptoms and SSEP changes (awake patients), and overcomes&#xD;
      obvious practical limitations of investigating intraoperative PNI (small sample size of&#xD;
      patients with intraoperative brachial plexus injury). In this study, 50 consecutive patients&#xD;
      who required a brachial plexus block for their surgery, will be recruited. This study will be&#xD;
      performed in the &quot;Block Room&quot; of either London Health Science Centre or St Joesph Hospital,&#xD;
      London, Ontario. After obtaining informed consent, an independent assessor (hand specialist)&#xD;
      will perform a baseline assessment of the sensory and motor function of the upper limb. The&#xD;
      sensory function will be quantified by a two-point discrimination test in each dermatome. The&#xD;
      motor function will be quantified by the motor score in each myotome. The patients will be&#xD;
      attached to the automated SSEP monitor to obtain baseline upper limb SSEP signals. Median,&#xD;
      ulnar and radial nerves will be monitored. After satisfactory baseline SSEP recordings have&#xD;
      been obtained, a brachial plexus block will be performed in the usual fashion to achieve&#xD;
      complete sensory and motor blockage (approx. 30 min). This provides a unique experimental&#xD;
      condition to assess the relationship between the brachial plexus dysfunction and the SSEP&#xD;
      signal changes. An independent assessor (hand specialist) will re-assess the patients'&#xD;
      sensory and motor function every 5 minutes (up to 30 minutes during the onset of the block).&#xD;
      SSEP recording will be concomitantly obtained. A total of 300 data pairs (6 data pairs for&#xD;
      each patient) will be obtained for analysis. In this study, the Evoked Potential Assessment&#xD;
      Device (EPAD®, SafeOp Surgical, Hunt Valley, MD) SSEP machine will be used. It is a novel,&#xD;
      simplified, automated SSEP monitoring device (FDA approved), designed to detect&#xD;
      intraoperative PNI. The key features of EPAD® are that only the surface adhesive electrodes&#xD;
      (i.e. no subdermal needle electrodes) will be used, as well as there is newly artifact&#xD;
      rejection and optimization algorithm that permit SSEP recording in awake patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to performing the brachial plexus block in the &quot;Block room&quot;, a complete neurological&#xD;
      examination will be performed including motor score and 2-point discrimination test. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be recruited after obtained informed consent. The baseline SSEP of the&#xD;
      participants will be recorded using the EPAD@ device. After the participants received the&#xD;
      brachial plexus block (as part of their standard of care), the participants will be&#xD;
      monitoring the progressive changes of SSEP signals while the effect of brachial plexus block&#xD;
      gradually onset (usually takes around 30 minutes). An independent assessor (hand specialist&#xD;
      blinded to the SSEP results) will concomitantly re-assess the patients' sensory and motor&#xD;
      function every 5 minutes (up to 30 minutes during the onset of the block).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be on describing the relationship between the severity of the&#xD;
      neurological deficits (impaired sensory and/or motor function) and SSEP changes (amplitude&#xD;
      and/or latency changes). Secondarily, an optimal cut-off limit using Youden index and/or&#xD;
      logistic regression-derived likelihood ratio functions will be determined. A&#xD;
      Receiver-operating-curve for the new cut-off limits will be assessed. REDCapTM will be used&#xD;
      for electronic data collection and STATA (version 14) will be used for statistical analysis&#xD;
      in all the studies. These new cut-off limits in comparison with conventional criteria in our&#xD;
      subsequent clinical studies will be compared.&#xD;
