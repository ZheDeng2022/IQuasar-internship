      Adverse influences starting in utero may predestine an individual's long- term risk for&#xD;
      developing cardiometabolic diseases. The Keeping Ideal CVH (cardiovascular health) Family&#xD;
      Intervention Trial (KIDFIT) will test whether preschool-age children, born to&#xD;
      overweight/obese (OW/OB (mothers who did or did not experience a diet and lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention to reduce GWG: 1) demonstrate more favorable adiposity (body fat %), body mass&#xD;
      index percentiles (BMI%), diet quality (DASH diet score), physical activity, and other CVH&#xD;
      metrics at baseline according to antenatal intervention status; and 2) respond to an early&#xD;
      childhood intervention targeting diet and lifestyle behaviors with improvement in these same&#xD;
      adiposity and CVH metrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize children randomized to the KIDFIT diet and lifestyle intervention group at age&#xD;
      3-5 years, regardless of initial maternal antenatal group assignment, will demonstrate more&#xD;
      favorable adiposity changes assessed by anthropometry (body fat %/sum of skinfolds) and a&#xD;
      lower cumulative incidence of obesity after the 12-month intervention, as compared with the&#xD;
      control group. Additionally, after 12 months of the KIDFIT Intervention, children will have&#xD;
      more favorable blood pressure and blood lipids, better diet quality (as measured by the&#xD;
      DASH-style diet score), increased physical activity levels, and more optimal sleep duration,&#xD;
      without adverse effects on height, compared to the control group&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is planned among 140 of the MOMFIT offspring, aged 3-5&#xD;
      years old. The KIDFIT Study follows final data collection in the MOMFIT RCT. Moms were&#xD;
      randomized to either the MAMA DASH Diet and lifestyle intervention or the &quot;Web-Watcher&quot;&#xD;
      enhanced usual care group that received periodic newsletters highlighting publicly available&#xD;
      websites and reputable links related to healthy pregnancy. The first MOMFIT baby was born in&#xD;
      September 2013 and the last was born in July 2016; the KIDFIT cohort will include children&#xD;
      who are ages 3-5 years at the time of randomization. Post-partum, the MAMA DASH Intervention&#xD;
      Group received ongoing encouragement for maternal adherence to the DASH Diet and&#xD;
      breastfeeding of the child for as long as possible, preferably at least six months. General&#xD;
      diet information regarding post-weaning was provided briefly to further encourage maternal&#xD;
      adherence to the diet. KIDFIT will randomize children stratified by the original MOMFIT&#xD;
      groups to either the DASH Diet and Lifestyle intervention (called KIDFIT-Healthy) or enhanced&#xD;
      (websites/apps) Usual Care called KIDFIT-Safe. Children randomized to the intervention group&#xD;
      will have a 12 month diet and lifestyle intervention that will implement the DASH kids diet,&#xD;
      encourage physical activity, limit screen time, and encourage 10 to 13 hours of sleep.&#xD;
      Mother-Child Dyads randomized to the usual care group will be sent monthly guides addressing&#xD;
      environmentally safe home settings to raise children and given related resources for healthy&#xD;
      family lifestyle habits for their family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The KIDFIT clinical intervention will develop, implement and test a lifestyle intervention to&#xD;
      determine whether (1) children ages 3-5 years, born to overweight/obese (OW/OB) mothers who&#xD;
      adhered to an antenatal diet and lifestyle intervention, demonstrate improvements in weight&#xD;
      gain trajectories, diet pattern quality, physical activity levels and other ideal&#xD;
      cardiovascular health (iCVH) measures compared to children whose OW/OB mothers underwent&#xD;
      usual care; (2) lifestyle intervention at ages 3-5 years is associated with improvements in&#xD;
      those same measures independent of or additive to maternal intervention; and (3) epigenetic&#xD;
      mechanisms and molecular pathways underlying these associations can be differentiated.KIDFIT&#xD;
      results will help determine whether antenatal diet and lifestyle interventions and/or early&#xD;
      life child-focused diet and lifestyle interventions offer the potential for prevention of&#xD;
      obesity, thereby maintaining iCVH earlier and longer.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Because this cohort includes former participants of the MOMFIT study,&#xD;
        there are certain pre-existing criteria regarding the health, age, and antenatal BMI (25-40&#xD;
        kg/m2) among the mothers of the KIDFIT children. In addition, eligibility for this study&#xD;
        requires willingness of the mother/child dyad:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  to be randomized&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  to attend study visits and participate in intervention sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  to monitor the child's diet, physical activity, and sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  planning to move away within 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  child has a medical condition (e.g. fed by gastric tube, wheelchair user) that limits&#xD;
             ability or willingness to adhere to diet and activity recommendations (parents will be&#xD;
             encouraged to discuss with their pediatrician if there is any question)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  child is already under the care of a nutritionist and mother and/or nutritionist&#xD;
             unwilling to collaborate with KIDFIT Dietitian-Interventionist to optimize diet&#xD;
