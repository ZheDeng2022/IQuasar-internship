  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed initial trial is a Phase I, open label study to evaluate the safety and explore&#xD;
      efficacy of MG005 in combination with sorafenib in patients with solid tumor. The eligible&#xD;
      patients will receive 200 mg of sorafenib with 3 pre-defined dose levels of GW5074, escalated&#xD;
      from 750 mg to 1500 mg (daily dose), to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities (DLT) (if any) at Phase I stage.&#xD;

    <description>Phase I:&#xD;
Eligible patients will receive different dosages of GW5074 in 1 of the 3 dose cohorts plus 200 mg of sorafenib. Dose cohorts will be escalated sequentially from Cohort 1 at 750 mg QD GW5074 plus 200 mg QD sorafenib to Cohort 2 at 1500 mg QD GW5074 plus 200 mg QD sorafenib, and Cohort 3 at 750 mg BID GW5074 plus 200 mg QD sorafenib. Owing to the fact that there is no previous human experience for GW5074, Cohort 1 will include a monotherapy stage with 750 mg QD GW5074 prior to administration of the GW5074 and sorafenib combination to initially assess the safety of GW5074 monotherapy.</description>
