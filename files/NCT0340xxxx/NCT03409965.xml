  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-site, non-randomized study evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Infini and LaseMD Systems for combination treatment in wrinkles,&#xD;
      texture, and pigmentation of the face and/or neck.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled subjects will receive three (3) face and/or neck treatments provided 30 days apart.&#xD;
      During each treatment subjects will receive both Infini and LaseMD treatments. Treatments&#xD;
      will be provided according to a protocol-specific treatment protocol in which an Infini&#xD;
      treatment will be provided first, followed by a LaseMD treatment. A telephone contact will be&#xD;
      completed at 3 days following each treatment to assess for adverse events. One follow-up&#xD;
      visit will be conducted at 90 days following the last study treatment. Outcome measures&#xD;
      include clinician grading and subject satisfaction post-treatment. Pre-treatment study&#xD;
      photographs and D90 study photographs will be obtained.&#xD;

    <description>An assessment of paired pre- and post-treatment photographs will be conducted by blinded assessors. Each blinded assessor will be given an identical set of baseline (pre-treatment) and Day 90 follow-up photos to be assessed. Each photo's visit interval, i.e., pre-treatment and follow-up, will NOT be marked. Each blinded assessor will conduct their assessment independently, comparing the Left and Right photos for improvement in the face and/or neck using the following definition:&#xD;
Change: An improvement that is:&#xD;
Striking, substantial and immediately noticeable, or&#xD;
Readily apparent but modest in nature&#xD;
Slight and subtle in nature, may require close examination&#xD;
The assessor chooses the photo they believe to be the post-treatment photo, i.e., Left photo or Right photo.</description>

    <description>Overall aesthetic improvement based on completion of the Clinician Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, a scale that rates global aesthetic improvement from the pretreatment appearance using the following definitions:&#xD;
= Improved: Improvement in appearance from initial condition&#xD;
= No Change: The appearance is essentially the same as the original condition&#xD;
= Worse: The appearance is worse than the original condition The scale will be administered based on a live assessment of the subject while referring to the subject's pre-treatment photographs, and based on a comparison of the subject's pre-treatment photographs to the Day 90 follow-up photographs.</description>

= Improved: Improvement in appearance from initial condition&#xD;
= No Change: The appearance is essentially the same as the original condition&#xD;
= Worse: The appearance is worse than the original condition Subjects will complete the scale based on a live assessment while referring to a hand mirror and their pre-treatment photographs, and based on a comparison of their pre-treatment photographs to their Day 90 follow-up photographs.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days following study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be evaluated based on subjects' completion of a patient satisfaction questionnaire while referring to a hand mirror and their pre-treatment photographs and their Day 90 follow-up photographs. Subjects will be asked to document Yes/No as to whether they notice any improvement in how their treated skin areas look; specify any changes they see in the treated areas, e.g., skin texture improvement, skin tone improvement, skin pigmentation improvement, etc.; characterize their level of satisfaction with study treatment based on 5 levels of satisfaction: Very satisfied, Satisfied, Slightly Satisfied, Neither Satisfied or Dissatisfied, Dissatisfied; document Yes/No if they would recommend the treatment to friends and family members.</description>

    <description>During study treatments, subjects' pain levels will be monitored using a validated Numeric Rating Scale (0-10), with 0 being 'No Pain' and 10 being the 'Worst Possible Pain'.</description>
