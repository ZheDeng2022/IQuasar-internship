      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy and total marrow and lymphoid irradiation before allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplant helps stop the growth of leukemia cells. It may also stop the&#xD;
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells&#xD;
      from a donor are infused into the patient they may achieve brand new hematopoietic recovery.&#xD;
      Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's&#xD;
      normal cells, resulting in graft versus-host disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This study is to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of total marrow and lymphoid&#xD;
      irradiation conditioning when given together with combination chemotherapy and allogeneic&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant in treating patients with high-risk acute leukemia.&#xD;

      Patient receives preparative therapy including cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation&#xD;
      (TBI) of 10 Gy or total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) of 12-20 Gy, and starts&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy using cyclosporine or tacrolimus, methotrexate-based prophylaxes,&#xD;
      followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and granulocyte colony-stimulating&#xD;
      factor administration.&#xD;
