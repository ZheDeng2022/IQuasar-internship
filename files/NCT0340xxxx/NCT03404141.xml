      Prenatal stress is associated with negative outcomes such as postpartum depression,&#xD;

      pregnancy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To assess whether the group of pregnant women have lower levels of stress after&#xD;
      attending the psychological therapy than the group attending parent craft classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive-behavioural therapy to reduce stress will be held in 10 sessions (1 per week)&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First session: General information about pregnancy. Pregnant women will describe what can&#xD;
      they do to reduce stress levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second session: Breathing techniques and talk about how last week went. Third session: Muscle&#xD;
      relaxation and guided imagination techniques Fourth session: Cognitive restructuring. Being&#xD;
      able to detect thoughts and feelings Fifth session: Detect cognitive distortions Sixth&#xD;
      session: Cognitive restructuring Seventh session: Time management Eighth session: Problems&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS provides information on the perception of general stress during the preceding month. It consists on 14 items scores on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = once in a while, 3 = often, 4 = very often). Scores range from 0-56 (higher scores represent higher levels of stress)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (PDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 12-item instrument scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (none at all) to 4 (extremely) to assess specific worries and concerns pregnant women experience regarding medical problems, physical symptoms, body changes, labor, childbirth, relationships, and the baby's health. Scores range from 0-48 (higher scores represent higher levels of pregnancy specific-stress)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Symptoms Checklist 90 Revised (SCL-90-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 90-item scale scored using a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (extremely). This instrument is used to assess 9 dimensions: Somatization, Obsession-compulsion, Interpersonal sensitivity, Depression, Anxiety, Hostility, Phobic anxiety, Paranoid ideation, and Psychoticism. The scale also has 7 extra items distributed among 3 global indexes of distress: the GSI, which measures overall psychological distress; the PSDI, which is used to measure the intensity of symptoms; and Positive Symptom Total, used to measure the number of self-reported symptoms. Using the author´s instructions, the scores are transformed to percentiles (0-100). Percentiles ≥ 70 represent clinical symptoms in any of the subscale of this instrument.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 25 items evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-4: not true at all (0), rarely true (1), sometimes true (2), often true (3), and true nearly all of the time (4) - these ratings result in a number between 0-100, and higher scores indicate higher resilience.</description>
