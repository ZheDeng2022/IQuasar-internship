  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is often based on 24-hour&#xD;
      catheter-based pH studies. The Bravo™ wireless pH monitoring revolutionised the study of&#xD;
      GORD, allowing patients an improved comfort and ability to perform activities of daily&#xD;
      living. The backflow of gastric acid (acid exposure) in the oesophagus is monitored by a tiny&#xD;
      pH sensor located in a capsule which is pinned temporarily to the wall of the oesophagus at&#xD;
      the time of endoscopy. Normal measurements (also called parameters) for acid exposure are&#xD;
      established for 48-hour studies. However, our studies have shown that extending the duration&#xD;
      of recording to 96 hours further improved the diagnostic yield for GORD in patients with&#xD;
      negative 24-hour catheter-based tests. While pathologic acid exposure and symptom-reflux&#xD;
      association in catheter-based pH studies anticipate a successful outcome after anti-reflux&#xD;
      surgery, the clinical relevance of increasing the duration of recording is lacking. This&#xD;
      study aims to investigate the relationship between the result of participants Bravo test and&#xD;
      their symptoms on their usual medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single centre, prospective, observational study enrolling males and non-pregnant&#xD;
      females over the age of 18 years with gastro-oesophageal symptoms in accordance with Montreal&#xD;
      criteria and who have clinical indications for Bravo™. The study is based on questionnaires.&#xD;
      All clinical interventions, including 96-hour Bravo™ pH monitoring, temporary cessation of&#xD;
      medication and outpatient clinic follow-up is offered as routine medical care, regardless of&#xD;
      their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted over the phone ten days before the procedure by a member of the&#xD;
      research team involved in their clinical care and asked whether they would be interested in&#xD;
      joining the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a &quot;baseline&quot; 7-day recall Reflux Symptom Questionnaire (RESQ-7)&#xD;
      before having Bravo™ for 96 hours. Participants will have a telephone follow-up at 4 weeks&#xD;
      and 8 weeks to assess their symptoms based on the RESQ-7 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate the recruitment of 100 subjects over 14 months. The final endpoints will be&#xD;
      achieved 6 months after the last patient has been interviewed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective, observational study on patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms&#xD;
      referred for wireless 96-hour pH (potential of hydrogen) monitoring for clinical indications.&#xD;
      The principal aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the result of&#xD;
      participants' Bravo test and their symptoms on their usual medication. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      are a comparison of reflux disease questionnaire scores at 4 weeks and 8 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      with PPIs and overall change in scores from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a pilot study involving reflux symptoms questionnaires which will provide information&#xD;
      on whether this approach is feasible in a larger scale study. All clinical interventions,&#xD;
      including 96-hour Bravo™ pH monitoring, temporary cessation of medication and outpatient&#xD;
      clinic follow-up are offered as routine medical care, regardless of their participation in&#xD;
      the study. The investigators anticipate the recruitment of 100 subjects over 14 months in a&#xD;
      single tertiary centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients referred for wireless 96-hour pH monitoring as part of their usual clinical care&#xD;
      will be considered. Participants will be identified in advance from the scheduled Bravo&#xD;
      lists. Eligible patients will be contacted over the phone ten days before the procedure by a&#xD;
      member of the research team involved in their clinical care and asked whether they would be&#xD;
      interested in joining the study. If patients agree, candidates information about the study by&#xD;
      post.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend a routine Bravo™ list in Endoscopy Unit. On arrival, participants will&#xD;
      have the opportunity to ask questions about the study and discuss risks and benefits in&#xD;
      detail. If all questions are answered satisfactorily, satisfy the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and patients are happy, candidates will be enrolled in the study. It will be stated&#xD;
      that the participant is free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without&#xD;
      prejudice to usual care, and with no obligation to give the reason for withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once recruited the following assessments and interventions will take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will be instructed to complete a &quot;baseline&quot; 7-day recall Reflux Symptom&#xD;
           Questionnaire (RESQ-7). This is a paper-based, 13-item symptom-based questionnaire for&#xD;
           heartburn (5 items), regurgitation (4 items), cough, dysphagia, hoarseness, and burping&#xD;
           (1 item). Each item is rated on a 6-point Likert scale. RESQ-7 was developed and&#xD;
           validated for adult patients with a partial response to PPI treatment and takes approx.&#xD;
           2-4 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will have a telephone follow-up at 4 weeks to assess their symptoms based on&#xD;
           the same RESQ-7 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants will have a second telephone follow-up at 8 weeks to re-assess their&#xD;
           symptoms based on the RESQ-7 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data recorded will be recorded on CRF and include patients' demographic data, past&#xD;
           medical history, medications, endoscopy and histology reports (if any), the standard&#xD;
           components of oesophageal pH monitoring - acid exposure, number and duration of reflux&#xD;
           episodes over 96 hours, reflux symptoms scores and RESQ-7 symptoms questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical fellow will coordinate the recruitment process and conduct the interviews. The&#xD;
      study is based on questionnaires. All clinical interventions, including 96-hour Bravo™ pH&#xD;
      monitoring, temporary cessation of medication and outpatient clinic follow-up are offered as&#xD;
      routine medical care, regardless of their participation in the study. Therefore, no adverse&#xD;
      events (AE) related to the study are expected.&#xD;
