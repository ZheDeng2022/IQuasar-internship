  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is rarely curable after metastasis, and the therapeutic options are limited.&#xD;
      Interestingly, the host immune response is strongly predictive for the effect of chemotherapy&#xD;
      in subgroups of patients with breast cancer. The aim is to release the brake on the immune&#xD;
      response by use of ipilimumab, which blocks CTLA-4 and may deplete regulatory T cells,&#xD;
      combined with nivolumab (anti PD1). Importantly, it is possible that non-responders to&#xD;
      nivolumab/ipilimumab (nivo/ipi) can be turned responders by use of immunogenic chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is compelling evidence from animal studies, supported by data from humans, that some&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents are immunogenic. Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide have been shown to&#xD;
      be particularly powerful inducers of immunogenic cell death. Both agents fulfil 5/5 criteria&#xD;
      established for assessing the immunogenicity of different chemotherapeutic drugs. There is&#xD;
      also strong evidence from humans, particularly in breast cancer, indicating that the clinical&#xD;
      effect of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide depends on the host immune response. Further,&#xD;
      these agents have been shown to induce a Type I interferon immune response in breast cancer.&#xD;
      Taken together, there is a strong rationale for synergy between doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade. The trial combines nivolumab and ipilimumab with established 1st&#xD;
      choice chemotherapy in patients with metastatic hormone reseptor positive breast cancer.&#xD;
      Nivolumab/ipilimumab (nivo/ipi) may i) potentiate the patient´s spontaneous anti-tumor immune&#xD;
      response ii) synergize with chemotherapeutic agents that induce immunological cell death&#xD;

             be required&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Female subjects of childbearing potential should agree to remain abstinent (refrain&#xD;
             from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure&#xD;
             rate of &lt; 1% per year, during the treatment period and for at least 5 months after the&#xD;

             has been clinically stable for &gt; 8 weeks prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known CNS disease, except for asymptomatic CNS metastases, provided all of the&#xD;
             following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Measurable disease outside the CNS&#xD;

             on a stable regimen at study entry. Symptomatic lesions (e.g., bone metastases or&#xD;
             metastases causing nerve impingement) amenable to palliative radiotherapy should be&#xD;
             treated prior to randomization. Asymptomatic metastatic lesions whose further growth&#xD;
             would likely cause functional deficits or intractable pain (e.g., epidural metastasis&#xD;
             that is not presently associated with spinal cord compression) should be considered&#xD;
             for loco-regional therapy if appropriate prior to randomization&#xD;

             disease (Class II or greater), myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to&#xD;
             randomization, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina Patients with a known left&#xD;
             ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% will be excluded. Patients with known&#xD;
             coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure not meeting the above criteria, or&#xD;
             LVEF &lt; 50% must be on a stable medical regimen that is optimized in the opinion of the&#xD;
             treating physician, in consultation with a cardiologist if appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Severe infection within 21 days prior to randomization, requiring hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Received oral or IV antibiotics within 1 week prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. Patients&#xD;
             receiving routine antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g., to prevent chronic obstructive&#xD;

             need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study other than for&#xD;
             diagnosis. Placement of central venous access catheter(s) is not considered a major&#xD;
             surgical procedure and is therefore permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. A history of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to&#xD;
             chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. A history of autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2&#xD;
             years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxin, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment. Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus&#xD;
             or vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., no psoriatic arthritis) are&#xD;

                  requiring PUVA [psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation], methotrexate, retinoids,&#xD;
                  biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, high potency or oral steroids)&#xD;
&#xD;

             chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV RNA&#xD;

&#xD;
         24. Received treatment with systemic corticosteroids or other systemic immunosuppressive&#xD;
             medications (including but not limited to prednisone, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
             azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] agents)&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to randomization, or anticipated requirement for systemic&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients who have received acute, low-dose, systemic immunosuppressant&#xD;
                  medications (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled&#xD;
                  in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients with a history of allergic reaction to IV contrast requiring steroid&#xD;
                  pre-treatment should have baseline and subsequent tumor assessments performed&#xD;
                  using MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The use of inhaled corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
                  mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic&#xD;
                  hypotension, and low-dose supplemental corticosteroids for adrenocortical&#xD;
                  insufficiency are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Received anti-cancer therapy (medical agents or radiation) within 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             study Cycle 1, Day 1. Palliative radiotherapy for bone lesions is allowed up to 7 days&#xD;
             before start of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. A history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation&#xD;
             and the requirements of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy, or is&#xD;
             expected to receive such a vaccine while on therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines&#xD;
             and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Any reason why, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient should not participate&#xD;
