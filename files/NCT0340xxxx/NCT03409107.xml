        <description>Blood samples were collected at given time points from participants for hemoglobin measurements. Evaluation period hemoglobin value was defined as the mean of all available post-randomization hemoglobin values (on and off-treatment) during the evaluation period (Week 24 to Week 28 inclusive). For the primary analysis, the missing post-Baseline hemoglobin values were imputed using pre-specified multiple imputations. Change from Baseline was defined as the average of post-randomization values during the evaluation period minus Baseline value. Baseline value was the latest non-missing pre-dose assessment on or before the randomization date. Analysis was performed using the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with terms for treatment, Baseline hemoglobin, and region.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Short Form-36 (SF-36) Questionnaire Vitality Domain Score by Traditional Scoring at Week 28</title>
        <description>The SF-36 acute version 2 is a 36-item generic quality of life instrument designed to measure a participant's level of performance in the 8 health domains: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical (role limitations caused by physical problems), Social Functioning, Bodily Pain, Mental Health, Role-Emotional (role limitations caused by emotional problems), Vitality, and General Perception of Health.Each domain is scored from 0 (poorer health) to 100 (better health). Vitality domain score ranges from 0-100; higher score indicates a better health state &amp; better functioning. Change from Baseline was calculated as Post-Dose Visit Value at Week 28 minus Baseline. For primary analysis, the missing on-treatment Week 28 SF-36 Vitality domain scores were imputed using pre-specified multiple imputations. Baseline value was latest non-missing pre-dose assessment on or before randomization date. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA model with terms for treatment, Baseline score, and region.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 acute version 2 is a 36-item generic quality of life instrument designed to measure a participant's level of performance in the following eight health domains: physical functioning, role-physical (role limitations caused by physical problems), social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, role-emotional (role limitations caused by emotional problems), vitality, and general perception of health. Each domain is scored from 0 (poorer health) to 100 (better health). Physical functioning domain score ranges from 0-100; higher score indicates a better health state and better functioning. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Baseline value was the latest non-missing pre-dose assessment on or before the randomization date.</description>

It contains 2 concepts-work productivity impairment measured via absenteeism (time missed from work), presenteeism (impairment at work) and regular daily activity impairment. WPAI questions (Q) were: 1) currently employed, 2) work time missed due to problem, 3) impairment while working due to problem, 4)overall work impairment due to problem, 5) activity impairment due to problem. Percent work time missed due to problem was a subscale and calculated as: Q2/(Q2+Q4) for those who were currently employed. Subscale score was expressed as an impairment percentage (range: 0-100%) where higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline. Baseline value was the latest non-missing pre-dose assessment on or before the randomization date.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in WPAI-ANS-CPV: Mean Hours Missed From Work in the Past 7 Days</title>
        <description>WPAI-ANS-CPV is anemia specific questionnaire designed as self-reported quantitative assessment of social functioning related to work and regular daily activities. It contains 2 concepts-work productivity impairment measured via absenteeism (time missed from work), presenteeism (impairment at work) and regular daily activity impairment. WPAI Qs were: 1) currently employed, 2) work time missed due to problem, 3) impairment while working due to problem, 4) overall work impairment due to problem, 5) activity impairment due to problem. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline. Baseline value was the latest non-missing pre-dose assessment on or before the randomization date.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in WPAI: Percent Overall Work Impairment</title>
          <description>WPAI-ANS-CPV is anemia specific questionnaire designed as self-reported quantitative assessment of social functioning related to work and regular daily activities. It contains 2 concepts-work productivity impairment measured via absenteeism (time missed from work), presenteeism (impairment at work) and regular daily activity impairment. WPAI Qs were: 1) currently employed, 2) work time missed due to problem, 3) impairment while working due to problem, 4) overall work impairment due to problem, 5) activity impairment due to problem. Percent overall work impairment due to problem was a subscale and calculated as: Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-Q2/(Q2+Q4))√ó(Q5/10)] for those who were currently employed. Subscale score was expressed as an impairment percentage (range: 0-100%) where higher numbers indicate greater impairment. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline. Baseline value was the latest non-missing pre-dose assessment on or before randomization date.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a self-assessment questionnaire, consisting of 5 items covering 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension is measured by a 5-point Likert scale (1: no problems, 2: slight problems, 3: moderate problems, 4: severe problems, and 5: extreme problems). The responses for the five dimension together form a five-figure description of health state. Each of these five-figure health states have attached valuation (utility score), expressed as single index on a scale from 0-1, where 1 is full health and 0 is worst health. The higher the score the better the health status. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline. Baseline value was the latest non-missing pre-dose assessment on or before the randomization date.</description>
