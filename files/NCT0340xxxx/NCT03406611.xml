  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Homocystinuria caused by Cystathionine Beta-Synthase (CBS) Deficiency is a rare&#xD;
      autosomal-recessive metabolic condition characterized by an excess of homocysteine (Hcy) in&#xD;
      the plasma, tissues and urine. It is due to reduced or absent activity of the CBS enzyme, and&#xD;
      is also known as classical homocystinuria. The symptoms associated with homocystinuria are&#xD;
      variable in severity and time of onset across patients. Some affected individuals may have&#xD;
      mild signs of the disorder; others may have multi-systemic involvement including potentially&#xD;
      life-threatening complications. Homocystinuria can affect many different organ systems of the&#xD;
      body; the four most commonly involved are the eyes, central nervous system, skeleton, and the&#xD;
      vascular system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current approaches to treatment of homocystinuria patients include a highly restrictive&#xD;
      diet and use of dietary supplements. Lifetime compliance with this diet is poor.&#xD;
      Pegtibatinase (TVT-058) represents a novel therapeutic approach that incorporates the use of&#xD;
      a modified version of the native, human CBS (hCBS) enzyme. The goal of treatment is to&#xD;
      introduce the CBS enzyme into circulation, resulting in reduced Hcy levels, increased&#xD;
      cystathionine levels and normalized cysteine (Cys) levels.&#xD;
