  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, studies published on multidimensional rehabilitation programs are addressed to&#xD;
      patients with different types of cancer and, frequently, these studies only include a limited&#xD;
      number of patients with blood neoplasms. So, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      multidimensional rehabilitation programs in this particular category of patients. A&#xD;
      systematic review of the effectiveness of aerobic exercise alone, not associated with&#xD;
      therapeutic education, has recently been conducted in adult individuals with hematological&#xD;
      malignancies (reference 25386666). The review highlighted the effectiveness of physical&#xD;
      activity on the quality of life of the target population. However, the medium and long term&#xD;
      effects that physical exercise have on other clinically relevant endpoints, such as fatigue,&#xD;
      psychological distress, and physical performance level, remain to be clarified. Thus, it is&#xD;
      important to investigate the effectiveness of multidimensional interventions that integrate&#xD;
      physical activity to therapeutic education targeted at the specific needs of individuals with&#xD;
      blood neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate, in blood cancer patients, the feasibility of a&#xD;
      therapeutic education program associated with physical activity, and to verify its effect by&#xD;
      a long-term follow-up.&#xD;

      This is a randomized controlled pilot study • Control Group will be offered usual care (UC),&#xD;
      which includes two sessions of therapeutic education delivered in small groups. In these&#xD;
      educational sessions, patients are provided with useful information on communication&#xD;
      strategies, problem solving strategies, recognition and management of symptoms and the&#xD;
      management of any aids/orthoses provided in everyday life, etc. In the meetings, it will be&#xD;
      emphasized the importance of maintaining an active lifestyle as much as possible by&#xD;
      encouraging involvement in physical activity even during the cancer treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written information material that summarizes the concepts addressed during group meetings&#xD;
      will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Intervention group will be offered therapeutic education as described for the control&#xD;
      group, plus 6 individual sessions of therapeutic education and physical activity (ETAF). The&#xD;
      6 individual session will be held by a physiotherapist dedicated to the study, on a weekly /&#xD;
      bi-weekly basis, according to the objectives set and the needs of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these sessions, the topics already discussed in group will be deepened, personalizing them&#xD;
      according to the patient's characteristics. Furthermore, personalized physical activity is&#xD;
      planned, taking into account the context of execution, the clinical condition and the&#xD;
      patient's preferences. Patients will be trained to build an action plan aimed at self-plan&#xD;
      physical activities and a diary will be provided to monitor the physical activity carried out&#xD;
      autonomously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written information material that summarizes the concepts addressed during group and&#xD;
      individual sessions will be provided.&#xD;
