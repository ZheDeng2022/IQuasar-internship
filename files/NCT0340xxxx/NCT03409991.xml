  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to develop and test a career guidance intervention called Opening&#xD;
      Doors (OD) expected to assist individuals with psychiatric disabilities acquire knowledge,&#xD;
      skills, and attitudes needed to pursue and advance in their careers. This project is a&#xD;
      three-stage mixed methods study to 1) refine and pilot-test the Opening Doors career guidance&#xD;
      intervention, 2) conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of the&#xD;
      intervention with a waitlist control group, and 3) conduct a qualitative and process&#xD;
      sub-study of the critical ingredients of the OD intervention from the perspective of&#xD;
      participants. This study takes place at the Boston University Center for Psychiatric&#xD;
      Rehabilitation (CPR). It is hypothesized that when compared to control group participants,&#xD;
      individuals receiving Opening Doors will report 1) higher levels of vocational and&#xD;
      pre-vocational activities, 2) greater career adaptability, fewer dysfunctional and more&#xD;
      functional career thoughts, 3) greater work hope when compared to the waitlist control group&#xD;
      participants, 4) greater vocational goal attainment, and 5) improved symptoms and&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;

      This project is designed as a three-stage mixed methods study to test the efficacy of a&#xD;
      career guidance intervention called Opening Doors to improve the employability and employment&#xD;
      trajectory of individuals with psychiatric disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 involved a pilot-test of the Opening Doors (OD) career guidance intervention to&#xD;
      conduct a feasibility test. In Stage 2 the investigators are conducting a randomized control&#xD;
      trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of the intervention. Stage 3, which is a qualitative and&#xD;
      process sub-study to understand the value of the OD intervention from the perspective of&#xD;
      participants, is being conducted simultaneously with Stage 2 The Opening Doors Intervention:&#xD;
      The Opening Doors intervention is a new career guidance intervention for individuals with&#xD;
      psychiatric disabilities that uses traditional career guidance resources, progressive&#xD;
      employment principles and mainstream Internet-based resources, delivered in the context of&#xD;
      providing tailored supports for participants' with mental illness. Opening Doors is designed&#xD;
      as an approximately 12- week group and individual career guidance intervention. The&#xD;
      curriculum is delivered by trained career counselors in small groups over about 20 sessions&#xD;
      of 90 minutes each with the addition of up to 8 weekly 1 hour individual sessions. Opening&#xD;
      Doors also has optional on-going drop-in hours available for participants of the program&#xD;
      (current and past) to improve their job application potential on an on-going basis. Opening&#xD;
      Doors includes considerable peer involvement i.e. the consultation and inclusion of&#xD;
      individuals with lived experience of psychiatric disabilities in the development and delivery&#xD;
      of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The Opening Doors intervention has been pilot-tested using a simple pretest-posttest&#xD;
      design in order to assess feasibility of the intervention and research procedures. The&#xD;
      investigators are currently using a randomized clinical trial design (RCT) to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Opening Doors intervention. Up to 108 participants are expected to&#xD;
      participate in the intervention. Baseline assessments are completed and random assignment to&#xD;
      experimental or control conditions are performed, stratifying for gender and minority status&#xD;
      using a computer generated randomization plan. Assessments are conducted at baseline, 3, 6, 9&#xD;
      and 12 months post-baseline for both experimental and control groups. Control participants&#xD;
      are placed on a waitlist and offered participation at a later date i.e. 12 months after the&#xD;
      baseline assessment. The investigators use qualitative methods for a sub-study and process&#xD;
      evaluation. Twelve participants (2 per wave) who have completed at least 12 sessions of the&#xD;
      OD will be invited to participate in one-hour qualitative interviews to obtain their&#xD;
      perspectives on the intervention. Each participant participates in a one hour single-session&#xD;
      audio-taped interview by research staff. Data from the qualitative interviews is collected&#xD;
      using an interview guide and participants are probed for perceived benefits of the&#xD;
      intervention and hypothesized helpful mechanisms of OD. The investigators also query the&#xD;
      staff about their perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to delivering OD. Additional&#xD;
      process information described above in &quot;process data&quot; is collected on all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Depending on the level of measurement, analysis of variance, t-tests, or&#xD;
      chi-square tests were conducted to determine baseline equivalency between Experimental and&#xD;
      Control groups. All hypotheses were tested using mixed modeling analyses, adjusting for&#xD;
      baseline values and examining effects for time, group, and the group-by-time interactions. We&#xD;
      found no differences between the experimental and control groups using an ITT approach or&#xD;
      adjusting for intervention intensity. We conducted responder analyses to further explore what&#xD;
      worked and for whom.&#xD;

    <description>24-item 7-point Likert-type scale that measures the construct of work hope, and includes: Work Goals, Agency, and Pathways.

    <measure>Goal Attainment Scale (GAS, Kiresuk, et al, 1968)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Goal Attainment Scale provides a structured approach to determining goal achievement regardless of the type or uniqueness of goal (Kiresuk &amp; Sherman, 1968). Recent reviews of GAS confirms that it can be useful in measuring rehabilitation goals, is reliable and sensitive to change (Marson, et al., 2009; Hurn, et al., 2006, Turner-Stokes, 2009)</description>

    <measure>Career Adapt-Abilities Scale (CAAS; Savickas &amp; Porfeli, 2012)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Career Adapt-Abilities Scale (CAAS; Savickas &amp; Porfeli, 2012) measures an individual's psychosocial readiness and resources for coping with current and imminent vocational development tasks, occupational transitions, and work traumas using four scales which measure concern, control, curiosity, and confidence. Internal consistency estimates for the subscale and total scores ranged from good to excellent i.e. .82 to .88. Concurrent validity evidence was found to be strong between the subscales of CAAS and the Vocational Identity Status Assessment (VISA; Porfeli, Lee, Vondracek, &amp; Weigold, 2011)</description>

    <description>The CTI consists of 48 Likert-scale items rated on a 4-point agree scale representing typical dysfunctional/negative career thoughts including Decision-Making Confusion, Commitment Anxiety, and External Conflict. The CTI developers report alpha coefficients for the total score ranging from .93 to .97; and for the subscales ranged from .74 to .94. The authors also provide support for the CTI's construct validity, convergent validity, and criterion validity.</description>
