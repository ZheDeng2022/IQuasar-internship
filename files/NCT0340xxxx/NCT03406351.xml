  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Societies become increasingly urban - more than half the world's population now lives in&#xD;
      cities. Urbanization elevates anthropogenic (man-made) exposure to air pollutants. A clear&#xD;
      association exists between exposure to air pollutants and exacerbations (worsening) of&#xD;
      pre-existing asthma, incidence of nighttime asthma, difficulties with asthma control and&#xD;
      increased disease risk. In 2012, the Public Health Management Corporation's Community Health&#xD;
      Data Base estimated that 19.4% of adults in Philadelphia had asthma compared to a national&#xD;
      prevalence of 7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma has a clear temporal signal. A majority of asthma patients, up to 75%, reports&#xD;
      nighttime awakenings due to worsened cough, wheeze and dyspnea. This time-of-day-dependent&#xD;
      exacerbation of symptoms, coined nocturnal asthma, is associated with poorer disease control,&#xD;
      more frequent medication, and higher asthma-related morbidity and mortality. Consequently,&#xD;
      several pathophysiological mechanisms proposed for nocturnal asthma relate to circadian clock&#xD;
      biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function oscillates over the course of 24 hours, peaking around noon and reaching its&#xD;
      nadir during early morning hours. Concentrations of air pollutants show oscillating patterns&#xD;
      in urban settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical research study, the investigators start to address how spatiotemporal&#xD;
      fluctuations in air pollutants relate to asthma. Mechanistically, the investigators wish to&#xD;
      address the hypothesis that microRNAs (miRs) act as interface between asthma phenotypes,&#xD;
      circadian clocks and environmental exposure.&#xD;
