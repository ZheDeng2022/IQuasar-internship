      The purpose of this study is to provide expanded access to gilteritinib (ASP2215) for&#xD;
      patients with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-mutated relapsed or refractory acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) or with FLT3-mutated AML in composite complete remission (CRc: [complete&#xD;
      remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), complete&#xD;
      remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp)]) with minimal residual disease (MRD)&#xD;
      without access to comparable or alternative therapy.&#xD;

      This treatment protocol is being conducted while phase 3 gilteritinib (ASP2215) studies are&#xD;
      ongoing in FLT3-mutated AML patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be administered treatment over 28-day cycles. Patients will complete visits on&#xD;
      cycle 1 days 1, 4, 8, 15; cycle 2 days 1, 15; day 1 of cycles 3 through 6; and day 1 of every&#xD;
      2 cycles thereafter until discontinued from the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An end of treatment visit will be performed within 7 days after last dose of medicinal&#xD;
      product (gilteritinib [ASP2215]), or prior to initiation of another anticancer therapy,&#xD;
      whichever occurs earlier, followed by a 30-day follow-up.&#xD;
