  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, community-based efficacy trial of different doses, forms,&#xD;
      and frequencies of zinc supplementation for the prevention of diarrhea and promotion of&#xD;
      linear growth among children 9-11 months of age in Dhaka, Bangladesh.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Zinc is essential to support growth in young children especially for tissues undergoing rapid&#xD;
      cellular differentiation and turnover, such as those in the immune system and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. Therapeutic zinc supplementation has been initiated in low-income&#xD;
      countries as part of diarrhea treatment programs to support these needs for young children&#xD;
      but, the effects of preventive supplemental zinc as a tablet or as a multiple micronutrient&#xD;
      powder (MNP) on child growth and diarrheal disease are mixed and pose programmatic&#xD;
      uncertainties. Thus, a randomized, double-blind community-based efficacy trial of five&#xD;
      different doses, forms, and frequencies of preventive zinc supplementation vs. a placebo was&#xD;
      designed for a study in children aged 9-11 months in an urban community in Dhaka, Bangladesh.&#xD;
      The primary outcomes of this 24-week study are incidence of diarrheal disease and linear&#xD;
      growth. Study workers will conduct in-home morbidity checks twice weekly; anthropometry will&#xD;
      be measured at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Serum zinc and other related biomarkers will&#xD;
      be measured in a subsample along with an estimate of the exchangeable zinc pool size using&#xD;
      stable isotope techniques in a subgroup. Therapeutic zinc will be provided as part of&#xD;
      diarrhea treatment, in accordance with Bangladesh's national policy. Therefore, the proposed&#xD;
      study will determine the additional benefit of a preventive zinc supplementation&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
