  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is characterized by episodic attacks in which there are sharp&#xD;
      declines in physical function. Although neurorehabilitation is the most promising clinical&#xD;
      strategy for motor recovery in patients with MS, treatment responsiveness and outcomes are&#xD;
      mixed. This is perhaps because each individual with MS has a different capacity to improve&#xD;
      with rehabilitation, and this capacity may be based on a variety of baseline factors, such as&#xD;
      disease duration, motivation, cognitive status and integrity of underlying brain structures.&#xD;
      A better understanding of what &quot;key ingredients&quot; facilitate relearning of motor skills during&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation is critically needed. Much of the focus of rehabilitation is on&#xD;
      relearning motor skills. The initial stage of learning a motor skills often requires explicit&#xD;
      concentration on the details of the movement. As one becomes more proficient in the motor&#xD;
      skill, it becomes less attention-demanding and more automatic. Those who can perform motor&#xD;
      skills more automatically will be better able to manage the additional demands of a secondary&#xD;
      task; thus, capacity for dual-task performance can be used as an index of automaticity.&#xD;
      Individuals with MS experience demyelination that impacts brain areas critical for motor&#xD;
      learning. However, the specific clinical and pathological variables that facilitate capacity&#xD;
      for motor learning in people with MS have not been identified. Identification of such&#xD;
      variables could be leveraged to determine a patient's capacity to benefit from&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation at the outset and potentially to maximize motor learning during&#xD;
      rehabilitation for people with MS. Thus, there is an urgent need to determine the key&#xD;
      ingredients most strongly associated with successful relearning of motor skills in MS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term goal is to develop individualized rehabilitation for persons with MS. Our&#xD;
      overall objective in this application is to identify clinical and pathological variables&#xD;
      associated with successful relearning of motor skills. Our central hypothesis, based on&#xD;
      preliminary data, is that the ability to learn to make new movements automatically occurs&#xD;
      over a dynamic range and is a function of available cognitive processing speed and the&#xD;
      integrity of corticospinal tract and superior cerebellar peduncles. We will test these&#xD;
      hypotheses by recruiting 146 individuals with relapsing-remitting MS to participate in a&#xD;
      mechanistic trial not designed to be a therapeutic intervention. Participants will complete&#xD;
      baseline testing (including neuroimaging, cognitive testing and dual-task performance)&#xD;
      followed by 4 consecutive days of training on a challenging balance task. After a 2-day&#xD;
      washout period, participants will return for post-testing (including dual-task performance on&#xD;
      a dual-balance and working memory task). The rationale for the proposed research is that&#xD;
      identification of key ingredients associated with the capacity for motor skill acquisition&#xD;
      would allow for more targeted rehabilitation programming, thereby improving patient outcomes&#xD;
      and reducing health care expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the proposed research, we expect to understand more about the capacity&#xD;
      for individuals with MS to improve with motor skill training, and some of the key ingredients&#xD;
      that help predict successful shift toward task automaticity, one critical component of&#xD;
      successful neurorehabilitation. The results of this proposal will facilitate the development&#xD;
      of predictors of motor recovery, needed to improve rehabilitation outcomes for individuals&#xD;
      with MS and other neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;
