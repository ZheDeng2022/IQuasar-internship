  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma is the most common adult brain tumour with approximately 2000 new cases each&#xD;
      year in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal treatment consists of surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy but despite&#xD;
      this survival is poor with only 10% of patients alive at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard imaging (MRI and CT) may not detect the full extent of tumours before treatment and&#xD;
      it can be difficult to assess how the tumour is responding to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate more advanced imaging techniques to see if they are better at&#xD;
      mapping the whole tumour and assessing response to treatment. Two different imaging&#xD;
      techniques will be assessed: Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography (PET-CT) uses&#xD;
      a mildly radioactive compound injected into the patient which is taken up into brain tumour&#xD;
      cells and shows up as a bright spot on scans. Brain tumours affect blood supply and how much&#xD;
      fluid is in the brain tissue as well as how freely fluid can move around. Advanced MR imaging&#xD;
      known as multiparametric MRI will be used to look at these additional features. This extra&#xD;
      information may help improve planning of radiotherapy and assessing how tumours respond to&#xD;
      treatment. Twelve adult patients with glioblastoma undergoing radical treatment will be&#xD;
      recruited over a 12 month period. Each patient will have standard MR imaging before&#xD;
      radiotherapy (after surgery) and 4-6 weeks following completion of radiotherapy. They will&#xD;
      also have advanced MRI and PET/CT before, during and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim will be to study if this is feasible and could potentially improve radiotherapy&#xD;
      planning and response assessment. Imaging will be interpreted by both imaging and brain&#xD;
      tumour treatment experts.&#xD;
