    <measure>Occurrence of First Hospitalisation or Hospital Outpatient Clinic Visit for Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter (AF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years and 11 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cases of AF were ascertained by at least one (=first occurrence) International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code for primary hospital inpatient discharge diagnosis or as a diagnosis code in a hospital outpatient specialist visit in the Danish National Patient Registry while being new users of olodaterol or of any Long-Acting Beta2-Agonist (LABA) other than olodaterol.&#xD;
The exposure window considered only the first episode of continuous use, defined as the time comprising consecutive dispensing's separated by up to 14 days. Termination dates of the follow up: date of outcome of interest, disenrollment from the database, 14 days after estimated discontinuation of the last dispensing for index LABA, the date the patient switched to another LABA, dispensing of a second LABA, death, end of study period (= 31 January 2019).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 4 years and 11 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cases of VT were ascertained by at least one (=first occurrence) ICD-10 code for primary hospital inpatient discharge diagnosis in the Danish National Patient Registry while being exposed to olodaterol and other LABA monotherapy or in free or fixed-dose combination with long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA).&#xD;
The exposure window considered only the first episode of continuous use, defined as the time comprising consecutive dispensing's separated by up to 14 days. Termination dates of the follow up: date of outcome of interest, disenrollment from the database, 14 days after estimated discontinuation of the last dispensing for index LABA, the date the patient switched to another LABA, dispensing of a second LABA, death, end of study period (= 31 January 2019).</description>

    <description>Cases of AMI were ascertained by at least one (=first occurrence) ICD-10 code for primary hospital inpatient discharge diagnosis in the Danish National Patient Registry while being new users of olodaterol or of any Long-Acting Beta2-Agonist (LABA) other than olodaterol.&#xD;
The exposure window considered only the first episode of continuous use, defined as the time comprising consecutive dispensing's separated by up to 14 days.

    <measure>Occurrence of First Hospitalisation for Serious Acute Coronary Heart Disease (SACHD), Including Angina and Other Acute Ischaemic Heart Disease Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years and 11 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Cases of SACHD were ascertained by at least one (=first occurrence) ICD-10 code for primary hospital inpatient discharge diagnosis in the Danish National Patient Registry while being new users of olodaterol or of any Long-Acting Beta2-Agonist (LABA) other than olodaterol.&#xD;

    <measure>All-cause Mortality.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years and 11 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Death ascertained from Danish Civil Registration System (fact and date of death, but not cause of death) while being new users of olodaterol or any Long-Acting Beta2-Agonist (LABA) other than olodaterol.&#xD;
Exposure window: first episode of continuous use (= time comprising consecutive dispensing's separated by up to 14 days). Termination dates of the follow up: date of outcome of interest, disenrollment from database, 14 days after estimated discontinuation of last dispensing for index LABA, date patient switched to another LABA, dispensing of a second LABA, death, end of study period (= 31 January 2019).&#xD;
To assess possible impact of imbalanced baseline characteristics, all-cause mortality was further assessed in two post-hoc analyses with restricted populations that would be more similar at baseline, post-hoc population 1 and post-hoc population 2.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This cohort study, used data from the Danish National Patient Registry (diagnoses), Danish Prescription Database (dispensings), and Danish Register of Causes of Death (cause of death information) to examine the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exposed to olodaterol compared to other long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) between 01 March 2014 and 31 January 2019.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Only subjects that met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were included. The matched cohort study design and propensity score methodology were used to establish two comparable treatment cohorts, the Olodaterol cohort and the other LABA cohort.</pre_assignment_details>
