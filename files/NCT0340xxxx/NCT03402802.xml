      The study will monitor how often persons use eye drops that are prescribed after glaucoma&#xD;
      surgery and will compare the adherence with drop use to the success rate of the surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trabeculectomy is the most common operation performed for all forms of glaucoma. The&#xD;
      procedure depends upon appropriately modulated healing of the conjunctiva and sclera, a major&#xD;
      component of which is delivery of frequent topical corticosteroid eye drops (prednisolone&#xD;
      acetate 1%) by the patient, initially every 2 hours when awake for 1-2 weeks, then in&#xD;
      tapering frequency over the 6 weeks after surgery. While the initial success of&#xD;
      trabeculectomy at one year varies from 55-80% depending upon the criteria chosen to measure&#xD;
      outcome, improvements in success would benefit hundreds of thousands of patients in the USA&#xD;
      yearly. There is reasonable evidence that steroid drops benefit success, but there is&#xD;
      essentially no data on how successfully patients remember to take the drops. In previous&#xD;
      research, investigators have shown that glaucoma patients take only half to two-thirds of&#xD;
      prescribed drops. An electronic monitoring device is now available that can fit the eye drop&#xD;
      bottle used in steroid drops, accurately measuring the time and date of each drop taken. The&#xD;
      investigators can further assess the accuracy with which each patient can deliver a drop from&#xD;
      the bottle being monitored in a clinic session directly onto the eye's surface by observing&#xD;
      their performance. The proposal's hypothesis is that the one year success rate of the&#xD;
      procedure will be related to the adherence to steroid drop taking by patients. The outcome&#xD;
      will have two important benefits. First, if adherence is less than ideal (which is very&#xD;
      likely), then those with greater adherence will have more successful surgery, confirming that&#xD;
      steroid treatment is effective. This has only been measured once, 30 years ago, at a time&#xD;
      when trabeculectomy was being performed quite differently. If steroid treatment is not&#xD;
      related to success, a change in preferred practice patterns is in order. If steroid treatment&#xD;
      is related to success and adherence is variable, the investigation will have proven means to&#xD;
      increase adherence through reminder systems, which have shown in past randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial to be effective.&#xD;
