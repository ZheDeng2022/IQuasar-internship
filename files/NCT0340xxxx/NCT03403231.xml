      This study will evaluate a VA MyHealtheVet Secure Messaging intervention that uses different&#xD;
      intervention messaging strategies designed to increase engagement in behaviors to prevent&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 144 eligible Veterans into a 12-week MyHealtheVet Secure&#xD;
      Messaging intervention. Eligible Veterans include those who are currently using MyHealtheVet&#xD;
      secure messaging, meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, and have received an HbA1c test within&#xD;
      the last 6 months that meets the ADA/CDC classification for prediabetes. Study participants&#xD;
      will be surveyed about their engagement in behaviors to prevent TDM2 and mediators of this&#xD;
      engagement. After completing a baseline survey, participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive different novel presentations of information about ways to prevent T2DM through both&#xD;
      Secure Messaging and US Mail. The investigators will test the 5 presentations that each: (1)&#xD;
      represent an innovative approach from behavioral economics or health psychology with great&#xD;
      promise to increase engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM among patients with prediabetes;&#xD;
      and (2) have not been tested in this setting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is tremendous national enthusiasm for translating and disseminating efficacious&#xD;
      strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Yet, little attention has been devoted&#xD;
      to how the investigators can better leverage the processes through which patients receive&#xD;
      information about prevention of T2DM to better engage them in such prevention. Further,&#xD;
      despite efforts to disseminate structured programs, many patients at high risk for developing&#xD;
      T2DM may still be unable or unwilling to access them. In these cases, increasing patient&#xD;
      engagement in individually directed lifestyle change or pharmacotherapy is critical.&#xD;
      Strategies developed in the fields of behavioral economics and health psychology hold&#xD;
      significant promise for improving Veteran engagement in each of these approaches. To date,&#xD;
      however, these strategies have rarely been translated into real-world settings where they&#xD;
      could benefit Veterans. This novel work will address this critical gap and could transform&#xD;
      communication with Veterans about prevention in ways that will improve their health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following 5 strategies will be implemented in the weekly messages that study participants&#xD;
      will receive: (1) tailoring to aspirations in life; (2) implementation intentions; (3)&#xD;
      preference checklists; (4) urgency framing; (5) social norms. The investigators will&#xD;
      implement these strategies alone and in combination in a 16-arm factorial design experiment.&#xD;

    <measure>Knowledge of Strategies to Prevent T2DM</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use survey data to evaluate changes in knowledge of strategies to prevent Type 2 Diabetes between baseline and 3-month assessment. Respondents were given 3 open-ended questions to report things they could do to prevent diabetes. Each respective response to the 3 questions were coded and scored according to whether they indicated engagement in the following activities: weight loss, physical activity, use of metformin, or enrollment into a diabetes prevention program. Each question denoted with a positive response were coded with 1 whereas those that did not were coded as a 0. The three questions were summed into a final score ranging from 0 (no report of engagement in the aforementioned healthy activities) with the worst outcome to 3 (a report of 3 of the 4 aforementioned healthy activities) with the best outcome. The final scores were generated based on the mean difference between baseline and 3-month scores.</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use survey data to evaluate changes in physical activity after the 3-month post intervention assessment. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF) was used to measure physical activity change. Respondents were asked to report how many hours and minutes within the past week they completed of vigorous physical activity, moderate physical activity, and brisk walking. The total sum of minutes for these three questions were subsequently coded into a yes/no binary variable for whether respondents met a recommended 150 minutes of overall physical activity within 7 days of being assessed. The values provided reflect a proportion of respondents that met or exceeded the 150 minute threshold of overall physical activity based on the newly generated variable that combined total minutes of vigorous physical activity, moderate physical activity, and brisk walking.</description>

        <title>Perception for Risk for T2DM</title>
        <description>The investigators will use survey data to evaluate mean changes in perception of risk for T2DM from baseline to 3 months. The Adriaanse T2DM Risk Perception Scale, which was included in the survey, measured self-assessed risk perception from 0 denoting no choice of developing T2DM to 100 denoting absolute confidence in developing T2DM</description>

        <title>Knowledge of Strategies to Prevent T2DM</title>
        <description>The investigators will use survey data to evaluate changes in knowledge of strategies to prevent Type 2 Diabetes between baseline and 3-month assessment. Respondents were given 3 open-ended questions to report things they could do to prevent diabetes. Each respective response to the 3 questions were coded and scored according to whether they indicated engagement in the following activities: weight loss, physical activity, use of metformin, or enrollment into a diabetes prevention program. Each question denoted with a positive response were coded with 1 whereas those that did not were coded as a 0. The three questions were summed into a final score ranging from 0 (no report of engagement in the aforementioned healthy activities) with the worst outcome to 3 (a report of 3 of the 4 aforementioned healthy activities) with the best outcome. The final scores were generated based on the mean difference between baseline and 3-month scores.</description>

        <title>Physical Activity</title>
        <description>The investigators will use survey data to evaluate changes in physical activity after the 3-month post intervention assessment. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF) was used to measure physical activity change. Respondents were asked to report how many hours and minutes within the past week they completed of vigorous physical activity, moderate physical activity, and brisk walking. The total sum of minutes for these three questions were subsequently coded into a yes/no binary variable for whether respondents met a recommended 150 minutes of overall physical activity within 7 days of being assessed. The values provided reflect a proportion of respondents that met or exceeded the 150 minute threshold of overall physical activity based on the newly generated variable that combined total minutes of vigorous physical activity, moderate physical activity, and brisk walking.</description>

          <title>Physical Activity</title>
          <description>The investigators will use survey data to evaluate changes in physical activity after the 3-month post intervention assessment. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF) was used to measure physical activity change. Respondents were asked to report how many hours and minutes within the past week they completed of vigorous physical activity, moderate physical activity, and brisk walking. The total sum of minutes for these three questions were subsequently coded into a yes/no binary variable for whether respondents met a recommended 150 minutes of overall physical activity within 7 days of being assessed. The values provided reflect a proportion of respondents that met or exceeded the 150 minute threshold of overall physical activity based on the newly generated variable that combined total minutes of vigorous physical activity, moderate physical activity, and brisk walking.</description>
          <population>The population consisted of prediabetic Veterans ages 75 and younger, had access to VA MyHealtheVet Secure Messaging, and met inclusion and exclusion criteria at the time of enrollment.</population>
