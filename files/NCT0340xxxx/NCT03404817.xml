  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of EMB-001 (a combination of two FDA-approved drugs, metyrapone and oxazepam)&#xD;
      in healthy adults.This is a Phase 1, single dose, 3-period, 3-sequence, crossover study in 9&#xD;
      healthy male and female (not of childbearing potential) volunteers. The study will evaluate&#xD;
      the bioavailability and food effect of a new formulation of EMB-001 relative to the original&#xD;
      formulation of EMB 001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, a total of 9 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to each&#xD;
      of 3 treatment sequences&#xD;
