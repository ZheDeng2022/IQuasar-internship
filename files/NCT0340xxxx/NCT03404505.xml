  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to examine the feasibility and impact of the Infant Achievements&#xD;
      caregiver coaching treatment on caregiver child-engagement strategies used during play with&#xD;
      their infant. The investigators will examine effects on infants' social and communication&#xD;
      behavior. This randomized controlled trial will compare caregivers and infants in the Infant&#xD;
      Achievements (IA) coaching group to caregivers and infants in the Caregiver Education (CE)&#xD;
      no-coaching group. A total of 64 eligible participants (16 children plus their caregiver per&#xD;
      group) will participate in the study.&#xD;

      This study is being done to examine the feasibility and impact of the Infant Achievements&#xD;
      caregiver coaching treatment on caregiver child-engagement strategies used during play with&#xD;
      their infant. The investigators will examine effects on infants' social and communication&#xD;
      behavior. This randomized controlled trial will compare caregivers and infants in the Infant&#xD;
      Achievements (IA) coaching group to caregivers and infants in the Caregiver Education (CE)&#xD;
      no-coaching group. A total of 64 eligible participants (16 children plus their caregiver per&#xD;
      group) will participate in the study. Parents in the IA group will be coached, at home twice&#xD;
      a week, to implement the intervention by trained research staff. Parents in the CE group will&#xD;
      be taught about child development and well-being in their home, weekly, with a weekly&#xD;
      follow-up phone call by trained research staff. In both groups: Videotaped caregiver-child&#xD;
      interaction data will be gathered in the home. Baseline, post-treatment and follow-up&#xD;
      measures will also be collected at the investigators' child development research center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families with children between the ages of 8 and 12 months with developmental concerns may be&#xD;
      eligible to participate. Developmental concerns are defined as infrequent production of&#xD;
      specific communication or social behaviors, or in immature or qualitatively atypical forms.&#xD;
      These concerns will be documented via the Autism Observation Scale for Infants, Communication&#xD;
      and Symbolic Behavior Scale (CSBS) Infant-Toddler Checklist, and/or Mullen Scales of Early&#xD;
      Learning. Recruitment will occur from the Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI), community&#xD;
      agencies, and community events. Recruitment flyers will be distributed within those programs.&#xD;
      In addition, a social media blurb will be placed on the KKI and other relevant groups'&#xD;
      Facebook pages, KKI Center for Autism and Related Disorders newsletter, KKI websites, and may&#xD;
      be sent to relevant local newsletters/magazines for families of young children.&#xD;
