  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The INTEGA study assesses therapy Options for advanced or metastatic esophagogastric&#xD;
      Adenocarcinoma in patients overexpressing human epidermal receptor type 2 (HER2 positive&#xD;
      patients). Current treatment options in this situation include chemotherapy based palliative&#xD;
      treatment in combination withTrastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that immunotherapy with Nivolumab or Ipilimumab after previous&#xD;
      chemotherapy can also improve survival in esophagogastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study assesses the efficacy of two experimental first line treatment strategies: A)&#xD;
      Chemo-free immunotherapy with Trastuzumab, Nivolumab and Ipilimumab and B) addition of&#xD;
      Nivolumab to the standard regimen (FOLFOX chemotherapy and Trastuzumab).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the world, and the third leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death in both sexes worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical resection is currently the only curative treatment option for gastric cancer;&#xD;
      however, ~50% of patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis and chemotherapy&#xD;
      is the mainstay of palliation in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, significantly improved survival in patients&#xD;
      with overexpression of HER2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In regard of the very limited therapeutic landscape of HER2 positive EGA, compared to breast&#xD;
      cancer, further treatment options to relevantly improve the outcome is warranted. The&#xD;
      integration of check-point inhibitors (e.g. Nivolumab, Ipilimumab) into the first line&#xD;
      setting either within a chemotherapy-free combination arm or within an intensified standard&#xD;
      arm of FOLFOX and trastuzumab with nivolumab may be able to improve the current limited&#xD;
      survival of median 14 months.&#xD;

The QLQ-C30 is composed of multi-item scales and single-item measures, including five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items.&#xD;
All of the scales and single-item measures have a score range from 0 to 100. A high score shows a high response level. A high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems</description>

The single-item subscales include questions related to four gastric cancer-specific symptoms: dry mouth, body image, hair loss, and problems with taste. Items are assessed on a 4-level numerical scale with 1= &quot;not at all&quot;, 2= &quot;a little&quot;, 3= &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4= &quot;very much&quot;. Scores are linearly converted and summated into a scaled score from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a worse QOL.</description>

             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localized&#xD;
             prostate cancer treated surgically with curative intent, ductal carcinoma in situ&#xD;

             and idarubicin &gt; 90 mg/m2, other (e.g., liposomal doxorubicin or other anthracycline&#xD;
             greater than the equivalent of 360 mg/m2 of doxorubicin). If more than one&#xD;
             anthracycline has been used, then the cumulative dose must not exceed the equivalent&#xD;
             of 360 mg/m2 of doxorubicin&#xD;

             risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation, study&#xD;
             drug administration, or would impair the ability of the subject to receive study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Significant acute or chronic infections including, among others:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Patients who are unable to consent because they do not understand the nature,&#xD;
             significance and implications of the clinical trial and therefore cannot form a&#xD;
