    <textblock>
      This study is a retrieval of database information regarding survivorship of the Comprehensive&#xD;
      Shoulder System family of products. The primary objective of the retrieval is to collect data&#xD;
      that will contribute to the post market surveillance requirements for this product and will&#xD;
      provide feedback to design engineers, support marketing efforts and publications, and answer&#xD;
      potential questions form reimbursement agencies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Comprehensive Shoulder System has been cleared by the FDA via premarket notifications. No&#xD;
      experimental or investigational surgical techniques or devices will be used in this study.&#xD;
      All devices and products will be used in accordance with their instructions for use and/or&#xD;
      approved labeling. The aim of the Comprehensive Shoulder System is to improve shoulder&#xD;
      function and reduce pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One site will be used for this database retrieval. The number of patients involved will&#xD;
      depend upon the size of the Comprehensive database available at Acromion, LLC.&#xD;
