      This study is a prospective, single blinded, randomized, pilot study to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety profile of oral versus subcutaneous route of administration of&#xD;
      methotrexate in management of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. The recruited&#xD;
      participants with moderate to severe psoriasis will be randomized into treatment arms.&#xD;
      Randomization will be done using computer generated random number table. The participants in&#xD;
      the first treatment arm will receive 0.3 mg/kg ( upto a maximum of 25 mg/week ) of weekly&#xD;
      oral methotrexate for 12 weeks or achievement of PASI 90 whichever is earlier while the&#xD;
      participants in second treatment arm will receive subcutaneous methotrexate at 0.3 mg/kg/week&#xD;
      for the same duration. The participants will be followed at regular intervals and monitored&#xD;
      adequately for hematological, hepatotoxic and other adverse effects both clinically and&#xD;
      through laboratory investigations according to methotrexate consensus guidelines during the&#xD;
      treatment period. PASI, percentage of body surface area (BSA) involvement and DLQI will be&#xD;
      assessed at each follow up visit and at the end of 12 weeks. The treatment will be tapered at&#xD;
      the rate of 5 mg/2 weeks and stopped after 12 weeks or achievement of PASI 90 whichever is&#xD;
      earlier.. Follow ups will be done at every 2 weeks until treatment completion (12 weeks) and&#xD;
      at every 4 weeks till 24 weeks after completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures will be achievement of PASI 90 (90 % reduction in psoriasis area&#xD;
      severity score (PASI) compared to baseline).The secondary outcomes will be improvement in&#xD;
      DLQI (dermatology life quality index), relapse rate and adverse events if any.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methotrexate is one of the oldest and most commonly used systemic drugs for the treatment of&#xD;
      psoriasis.[1] Even with the advent of other treatment modalities like systemic retinoids and&#xD;
      biologics, methotrexate remains a popular modality for treatment of psoriasis owing to its&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, ease of administration and greater experience among practitioners&#xD;
      regarding its use.[2] Despite long-term experience in the use of methotrexate in psoriasis,&#xD;
      robust evidence and consensus regarding the ideal dosing schedule and route of administration&#xD;
      is still lacking.[3] Oral route of methotrexate has been found to have unpredictable and&#xD;
      non-linear bioavailability especially at doses greater than 15 mg/kg.[4] Subcutaneous route&#xD;
      of methotrexate on the other hand is associated with better and more linear bioavailability&#xD;
      at higher doses.4 Methotrexate by subcutaneous route has also been known to better&#xD;
      tolerability and lesser gastrointestinal side effects as compared to oral route. [5] Recently&#xD;
      conducted METOP study, which was a randomized controlled study comparing subcutaneous route&#xD;
      of methotrexate administration and placebo in control of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis&#xD;
      concluded that subcutaneous methotrexate is an efficient and safe modality of treatment of&#xD;
      psoriasis. The study also suggested that the pace and longevity of response by subcutaneous&#xD;
      route of methotrexate administration may be better than seen with oral route.[6] A recent&#xD;
      retrospective study also concluded that subcutaneous route of methotrexate is an effective&#xD;
      modality of treatment in patients of psoriasis who have failed oral methotrexate.[7] This&#xD;
      study will be the first randomized controlled trial comparing oral versus subcutaneous route&#xD;
      of administration of methotrexate in its efficacy in clearance of psoriasis and side effect&#xD;
      profile. The study will help in clarification of dilemma of clinicians regarding the ideal&#xD;
      route of administration of methotrexate in psoriasis. It will also further strengthen the&#xD;
      evidence regarding the adverse effects and tolerability of subcutaneous route of methotrexate&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study : To compare the effectiveness and safety profile of oral versus&#xD;
      subcutaneous route of administration of methotrexate in patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be an intention to treat single blinded randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      participants will be patients with moderate to severe psoriasis fulfilling the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria . They will be randomly allocated to the two treatment arms in the&#xD;
      beginning of the study. Participants in one treatment arm will receive methotrexate by oral&#xD;
      route while participants in second treatment arm will receive methotrexate by subcutaneous&#xD;
      route. Baseline PASI, percentage of body surface area involvement(BSA) and DLQI will be&#xD;
      calculated for each patient at the start of study. Any systemic treatment will be stopped for&#xD;
      a duration of at least 5 times their half lives before the start of methotrexate in each&#xD;
      patient. The participants in first treatment arm will receive 0.3 mg/kg (upto a maximum of 25&#xD;
      mg/week ) of weekly oral methotrexate for 12 weeks or achievement of PASI 90 whichever is&#xD;
      earlier while the patients in second treatment arm will receive subcutaneous methotrexate at&#xD;
      0.3 mg/kg/week for the same duration. The participants will be followed at regular intervals&#xD;
      and monitored adequately for hematological, hepatotoxic and other adverse effects both&#xD;
      clinically and through laboratory investigations according to methotrexate consensus&#xD;
      guidelines during the treatment period. PASI, Body surface area (BSA) involvement and DLQI&#xD;
      will be assessed at each follow up visit and at the end of 12 weeks. The treatment will be&#xD;
      tapered at the rate of 5 mg/2 weeks and stopped after 12 weeks or achievement of PASI 90&#xD;
      whichever is earlier. The participants will be followed up for a period of 24 weeks after&#xD;
      stopping methotrexate to observe the relapse free period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of the adverse effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for documented side effects of methotrexate at each follow up&#xD;
      visit through history, clinical examination and laboratory investigations. The severity of&#xD;
      adverse effects will be documented and decision regarding continuation and discontinuation of&#xD;
      treatment will be taken as per the participant's will and guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the effectiveness of oral versus subcutaneous route of administration of&#xD;
           methotrexate in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the safety profile of oral versus subcutaneous methotrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison between patients of both treatment arms with respect to time for achieving&#xD;
           PASI 90 or PASI 100&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison between patients of both treatment arms in percentage of patients who achieve&#xD;
           PASI 90 by the end of week 12 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison of improvement in DLQI between patients of both treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Comparison of the relapse free period after stopping treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Patient recruitment: February 2018 to February 2019, Patient treatment and&#xD;
      follow up: March 2018 to August 2018, Compilation of data: September 2019, Statistical&#xD;
      analysis and Manuscript: October 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 participants will be recruited in the study with 50 participants in each&#xD;
      treatment arm. Independent -sample t-test will be used to compare group means in percentage&#xD;
      decrease in PASI and percentage of patients developing adverse effects. Chi-square test will&#xD;
      be used for qualitative variables. P value less than 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from each participant prior to recruitment in both the&#xD;
      phases of study. Participants will be explained regarding both the arms of the study. The&#xD;
      participants will have the right to withdraw without having to give reasons for doing so.&#xD;
      Their refusal to participate in the study will not influence their future follow up with the&#xD;
      institution in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methotrexate is the most commonly used systemic drug both in its oral and subcutaneous forms&#xD;
      in the psoriasis clinic of investigator's institution and overall experience has suggested&#xD;
      that it is an effective and safe drug. Monitoring of participants will be done by standard&#xD;
      methotrexate consensus guidelines and treatment will be stopped if serious or intolerable&#xD;
      adverse effects develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have also gathered sufficient experience regarding the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of subcutaneous route of methotrexate, especially in patients who have compliance issues or&#xD;
      who have failed oral route or developed intolerable gastrointestinal adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first randomized controlled trial comparing oral versus subcutaneous&#xD;
      route of administration of methotrexate in its efficacy in clearance of psoriasis and side&#xD;
      effect profile. This study will help in clarification of dilemma of clinicians regarding the&#xD;
      ideal route of administration of methotrexate in psoriasis with respect to effectiveness and&#xD;
      tolerability. Subcutaneous route of methotrexate administration if found having better&#xD;
      effectiveness and tolerability, can be tried first in patients who are failing or not&#xD;
      tolerating oral methotrexate before switching to other modalities like retinoids and&#xD;
      biologics. Subcutaneous methotrexate being cheaper than biologics and retinoids will also&#xD;
      decrease the financial burden on psoriasis patients. Cost-effectiveness of subcutaneous&#xD;
      methotrexate will be a major advantage for developing countries like India where most of the&#xD;
      patients cannot afford retinoids or biologics. The ease of administration, availability and&#xD;
      accessibility of subcutaneous methotrexate is also better than modalities like biologics and&#xD;
      phototherapy in developing countries , especially in remote areas.&#xD;
