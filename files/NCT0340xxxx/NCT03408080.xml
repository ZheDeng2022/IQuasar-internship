  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      24 adults, between the ages of 18 and 75 years, with cerebellar ataxia will be enrolled in a&#xD;
      12 week trial of BHV-4157 for treatment of ataxia. BHV-4157 is a pro-drug of riluzole (which&#xD;
      is currently FDA-approved for ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). There will be 5 visits to UCLA&#xD;
      required--Screening when general and neurological examination, blood and urine testing, ECG,&#xD;
      and questionnaires will be administered; Baseline when general and neurological examination&#xD;
      and questionnaires will be administered and study drug dispensed; Week 4 and Week 12 when&#xD;
      general and neurological examination, blood and urine testing, ECG, and questionnaires will&#xD;
      be administered; 2 weeks after finishing study drug when general examination and blood&#xD;
      testing will be completed. There is an option for a 36 week extension of the study drug&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

    <measure>Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The total score on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA)&#xD;
The SARA is a tool for assessing ataxia. It has eight categories with an accumulative score ranging from 0 (no ataxia) to 40 (most severe ataxia). When completing the outcome measure each category is assessed and scored accordingly. Scores for the eight items range as follows:&#xD;
Gait (0-8 points), Stance (0-6 points), Sitting (0-4 points) Speech disturbance (0-6 points) Finger chase (0-4 points) Nose-finger test (0-4 points) Fast alternating hand movement (0-4 points) Heel-shin slide (0-4 points) Once each of the 8 categories have been assessed, the total is calculated to determine the severity of ataxia.&#xD;
For motor activities of the four extremities (items 5-8), assessments are performed bilaterally, and the mean values are used to obtain the total score.&#xD;
A higher score would indicate a worsening in ataxia. A lowered score may indicate the ataxia is improving.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale is a prospective, patient self-reported or clinician administered rating scale that contains 16 questions to track both treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behaviors.&#xD;
At screening:&#xD;
Anyone with a score of 3 or 4 on question 2 or 13 should be exluded. Anyone with a score of 2 or higher on questions: 1a,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,or 14 should be excluded.&#xD;
During the study:&#xD;
Professional assistance should be sought out if a subject's score is 3 or 4 on question 2 or 13 as well as id a score is 2 or higher on questions: 1a,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,or 14.&#xD;
Clinical judgment should be used in all situations to determine whether or not a subject is suicidal.&#xD;
A normal score would be a score of 0. A worsened score would indicate that there are suicidal thoughts present and professional assistance should be sought.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory is a patient reported or clinician administered rating scale that is used to measure the severity of a subject's depression&#xD;
It is a 21-question multiple choice inventory. The assessment is scored as follows:&#xD;
0-13: minimal depression 14-19: mild depression 20-28: moderate depression 29-63: severe depression.&#xD;
A lower value is considered in the normal range, and an increase in the value would be considered a worse outcome. A decrease in the total value would be considered a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Anxiety Inventory is a patient reported or clinician administered rating scale that is used to measure the severity of a subject's anxiety.&#xD;
It is a 21-question multiple choice inventory. The assessment is scored as follows:&#xD;
0-9: normal to minimal anxiety 10-18: mild to moderate anxiety 19-29: moderate to severe anxiety 30-63: severe anxiety&#xD;
A lower value is considered in the normal range, and an increase in the value would be considered a worse outcome. A decrease in the total value would be considered a better outcome.</description>

             IRB/IEC) must provide a written signed informed consent form/forms (IRB/EC specific)&#xD;
             prior to the initiation of any protocol required procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age and Sex a. Male and female outpatient subjects between the ages of 18 - 75,&#xD;
             inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Target Populations&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Subjects with (1) a known or suspected diagnosis of a specific hereditary ataxia:&#xD;
             SCA3/dizziness-predominant or SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, already taking Riluzole for more&#xD;
             than 8 weeks; (2) non-genetic pure cerebellar ataxia; (3) MSA-C: i. SCA subjects&#xD;
             should have confirmed genotypic diagnosis from a CLIA-certified lab or a family member&#xD;
             that has had such testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. Alternatively, subjects must be willing to undergo genetic testing from a&#xD;
             CLIA-certified lab if testing has not been previously done on the study subject and a&#xD;
             copy of results is not available for verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
             b. Ability to ambulate 8 meters without assistance (canes and other devices allowed);&#xD;
             c. Determined by the investigator to be medically stable at Baseline as assessed by&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, laboratory test results available in medical&#xD;
             record, and electrocardiogram testing available in medical record. Subjects must be&#xD;
             physically able and expected to complete the trial as designed; d. Minimum of 6 years&#xD;
             of education; e. Subjects must have adequate hearing, vision, and language skills to&#xD;
             perform interviews as specified in the protocol; f. Subjects must be able to&#xD;
             understand and agree to comply with the prescribed dosage regimens and procedures;&#xD;
             report for regularly scheduled office visits; and reliably communicate with study&#xD;
             personnel about adverse events and concomitant medications; g. Women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (WOCBP) and men must be using an acceptable method of contraception to avoid&#xD;
             pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 30 day after the last dose of&#xD;
             investigational product in such a manner that risk of pregnancy is minimized. The&#xD;
             requisite drug interaction studies to determine the interaction of BHV-4157 with oral&#xD;
             contraceptives have not been performed to date. It is therefore not possible to&#xD;
             determine the efficacy of oral contraceptives as an effective method of contraception&#xD;
             for WOCBP who participation this study. Oral estrogen and progestin hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives as a sole method of contraception are therefore prohibited. It is&#xD;
             required that all WOCBP use two methods of contraception for the duration of the study&#xD;
             (i.e. beginning at first treatment to 30 days after the last dose of study drug).The&#xD;
             two methods should include one barrier method (ex. condom with spermicidal gel,&#xD;
             intrauterine devices, cervical cap etc.) and one other method. The other method could&#xD;
             include oral contraceptives or another barrier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
             h. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening and a negative urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. SCA subjects (SCA3/dizziness predominant; SCA1, 2, 3, 6 on Riluzole for more than 8&#xD;
             weeks) will not be limited to Inclusion Criteria of Screening SARA score ≥8 or Score&#xD;
             of ≥ 2 on gait subsection of the SARA.&#xD;
&#xD;
             j. Non-genetic pure cerebellar and MSA-C subjects will be limited to Inclusion&#xD;
             Criteria of Screening SARA score ≥8 or Score of ≥ 2 on gait subsection of the SARA.&#xD;

             their course of treatment more than 2 years prior to baseline, are not currently&#xD;
             receiving treatment and have been in remission may be enrolled only if, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, there is no expectation for recurrence or further cancer&#xD;
             treatment during the study period. Antihormonal therapy (e.g., tamoxifen) is allowed&#xD;
