  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing a novel penicillin&#xD;
      allergy questionnaire in the PED to identify a low-risk group of patients who will complete&#xD;
      an oral challenge in the PED to test for an IgE-mediated allergic reaction. This project&#xD;
      began as a single site feasibility study, however it has now transitioned to include 2 other&#xD;
      collaborative sites for enrollment. We have entered into a single IRB with 1 of the&#xD;
      collaborative sites. The other site has elected to do their own IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objective is to examine whether health care outcomes and prescription-related&#xD;
      costs are comparable between children who are de-labeled as penicillin allergic after an oral&#xD;
      challenge compared to a standard of care group who are not challenged in the PED.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children aged 2-16 with a parent/guardian (hereafter termed parent) reported history&#xD;
             of allergy to a penicillin antibiotic in which the reported allergic reaction occurred&#xD;
             at least six months prior to the current PED visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only children well enough to be discharged to home at the conclusion of the PED visit&#xD;
             are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children will be excluded if they have a history of developmental delay or inability&#xD;
             to communicate the effects of an allergic reaction (non-verbal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any contraindication to allergy testing will also result in exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (i.e. history of a severe allergic reaction to skin tests,,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  anaphylaxis in the past six weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  known pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  child has a history of a condition that requires a beta blocker medicine for cardiac&#xD;
             conditions, high blood pressure, migraine headaches, or eye drops for glaucoma (e.g.&#xD;
             propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol and Timoptic®, or Betoptic® eye drops).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who present to the PED with a rash, vomiting or current asthma symptoms&#xD;
             including coughing, wheezing or breathing problems will also be excluded to ensure&#xD;
             these do not mask reactions to an oral challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients deemed too acutely ill for participation (triage level 1 or 2 or as&#xD;
             determined by the ED patient care team) will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During this pilot study, we will exclude non-English speaking families. However, in&#xD;
             subsequent studies we will include the non-English speaking population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who are wards of the state, in foster care or police custody or detention&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with any basal condition (trauma, infection, minor accidents, etc..) will be&#xD;
             able to participate in the study provided they and their family are willing and do not&#xD;
             meet the above-mentioned exclusion criteria.&#xD;
