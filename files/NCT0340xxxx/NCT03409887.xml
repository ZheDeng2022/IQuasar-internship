      Based on various in-vitro studies intraorifice barrier has been suggested as an effective&#xD;
      mean to provide seal against coronal microleakage. This study intends to clinically&#xD;
      investigate efficacy of intraorifice barrier in healing of apical periodontitis.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronal leakage is considered significant factor for failure of endodontic treatment. In an&#xD;
      array of retrospective studies significant number of cases were reported of apical&#xD;
      periodontitis in teeth with unsatisfactory coronal seal as compared to the ones with&#xD;
      clinically/radiographically acceptable coronal restoration. Gutta-percha and sealer alone&#xD;
      used routinely as root canal obturating material is found to be ineffective to guard against&#xD;
      microleakage. Even clinically acceptable root filling allow penetration of bacteria and their&#xD;
      products in as less as three days and contribute to eventual treatment failure. This breach&#xD;
      of seal in coronal segment of obturated root canal may significantly jeopardize endodontic&#xD;
      treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Roghanizad suggested placement of intraorifice barrier to augment coronal seal in&#xD;
      endodontically treated teeth. In his study teeth with intraorifice barriers leaked&#xD;
      significantly less than the control group where no such barrier was placed. Since then&#xD;
      numerous studies have established supremacy of intraorifice barrier and sealing of floor of&#xD;
      pulp chamber in preventing coronal microleakage than the one without it. Various materials&#xD;
      have been tested as intraorifice barrier. Some studies have reported no difference amongst&#xD;
      materials.while other found better performance of MTA over composite and GIC ; GIC over&#xD;
      Polycarboxylate cement and Flowable composite.and resilon also composite was found superior&#xD;
      over MTA and Cavit and Cavit and IRM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various methodology has been employed to study coronal microleakage viz dye penetration ;&#xD;
      bacterial penetration ; fluid filtration and glucose molecule penetration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraorifice barrier apart from enhancing probability of success of endodontic treatment may&#xD;
      also augment periodontal therapy as intra pulpal infection is known to contribute in&#xD;
      worsening of periodontal health by promoting marginal bone loss and pocket formation.&#xD;
      Importance of base has also been stressed by Hommez et al who in retrospective study found&#xD;
      higher incidence of apical periodontitis in cases where base was absent even though&#xD;
      endodontic treatment was adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted in the department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Post&#xD;
      Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak. Study subjects were obtained from the pool of&#xD;
      OPD patients in the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, PGIDS, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to treatment a thorough clinical and radiological examination was carried out. A&#xD;
      thorough history was taken from each patient. Prior informed consent was taken after&#xD;
      explaining the procedure, risk and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mature mandibular permanent molar with diagnosis of apical periodontitis (as confirmed&#xD;
      clinically &amp; by periapical radiograph) were chosen for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All periapical radiographs were exposed by using constant kVP, mA and exposure time (70 KVP,&#xD;
      8 mA, 0.8 sec.) After initial periodontal therapy, administration of local anesthesia, rubber&#xD;
      dam isolation of the involved tooth was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caries excavation was done and access cavity was prepared using carbide burs in high speed&#xD;
      handpiece with copious irrigation. Debridement of the pulp chamber was done and all canal&#xD;
      orifices were identified. Negotiation of canals was done. Working length was determined using&#xD;
      root ZX apex locator and were verified radiographically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After creating glide path with #15 k-file, Revo-S (Micro Mega, Besancon, France) instruments&#xD;
      were used in sequence suggested by manufacturer with a rotational speed of 350 rpm in gentle&#xD;
      in-out motion. The torque was adjusted to 2.5 Ncm, and a crown-down approach was selected.&#xD;
      Once, the instrument had negotiated to the end of the canal and had rotated freely, it was&#xD;
      removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irrigation was carried out using 5 mL of a 5.25% NaOCl solution between files. After&#xD;
      preparation, the root canals were irrigated with 5 mL 17% EDTA for 3 minutes to remove smear&#xD;
      layer, followed by 5 mL 5.25% NaOCl. The final irrigation was done with 5 mL distilled water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The root canals were dried using paper points and filled with laterally condensed&#xD;
      gutta-percha (Meta Biomed Co Ltd, Korea) and Roth R-801 sealer (Roth International Drug Co.,&#xD;
      Chicago, Ill) mixed according to manufacturers' instruction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gutta-percha was cut with a heated instrument and vertically condensed right at the orifice&#xD;
      opening of the canals. The teeth were randomly divided into 3 experimental groups as follows&#xD;
      :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group I: intraorifice barrier of glass-ionomer cement (KetacTM Molar, 3M ESPE) placed&#xD;
           3mm in the canal from root canal orifice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group II: base of 2mm of glass-ionomer cement (KetacTM Molar, 3M ESPE) placed on the&#xD;
           floor of the pulp chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group III: control group with neither intraorifice barrier placed nor base applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group I: The gutta-percha was removed 3mm from the coronal portion of the canal with hot&#xD;
      plugger. Excess root canal sealer was removed with sterilized alcohol-wet cotton pellets.&#xD;
      Glass Ionomer Cement was applied inside canal and condensed as well as 2mm thick uniform base&#xD;
      on the floor of the pulp chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group II 2mm thick base of Glass Ionomer Cement was applied uniformly on the floor of the&#xD;
      pulp chamber with plastic instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final composite restoration was placed in all groups according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions. Periodontal therapy in the form of scaling and root planning was done on the&#xD;
      day endodontic treatment was completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up clinical and radiographic examination was carried out at 3, 6, 9 &amp; 12 month period.&#xD;
