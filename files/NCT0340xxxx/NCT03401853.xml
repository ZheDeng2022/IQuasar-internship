    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well rituximab, pembrolizumab, and obinutuzumab work in&#xD;
      treating patients with follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B cell lymphoma that has come&#xD;
      back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Monoclonal antibodies, such&#xD;
      as pembrolizumab, rituximab, and obinutuzumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Patients also receive rituximab or obinutuzumab IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and on day&#xD;
      1 of cycle 2. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXTENDED THERAPY: Patients with at least a partial response receive pembrolizumab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years (35 cycles) in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive obinutuzumab Iv on day 1&#xD;
      of cycles 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, and 25 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days.&#xD;
