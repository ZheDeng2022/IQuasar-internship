  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and preliminary antitumor activity of MGD009 administered in combination&#xD;
      with MGA012 in patients with B7-H3- expressing tumors.&#xD;

      This study is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation, and cohort expansion study designed to&#xD;
      characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and preliminary&#xD;
      antitumor activity of the combination of MGD009 and MGA012, each of which is administered by&#xD;
      IV infusion.The study consists of a Dose Escalation Phase to determine the Maximum Tolerated&#xD;
      Dose (MTD) or Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) (if no MTD is defined) of the combination,&#xD;
      followed by a Cohort Expansion Phase to further define the safety and initial antitumor&#xD;
      activity of the combination with the doses established in the Dose Escalation Phase. Patients&#xD;
      with B7-H3-expressing unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors of any&#xD;
      histology will be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Phase. Following the establishment of an&#xD;
      MTD, additional patients with specific tumor types will enroll in the Cohort Expansion Phase.&#xD;

             whom no approved therapy with demonstrated clinical benefit is available. For all&#xD;
             tumor types, the requirement for previous systemic therapy may be waived if a patient&#xD;
             was intolerant of or refused standard first-line therapy&#xD;

             checkpoint inhibitor resolved to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline (prior to the checkpoint&#xD;
             inhibitor) to be eligible for enrollment. Patients who experienced previous&#xD;
             hypothyroidism toxicity on a checkpoint inhibitor are eligible to enter study&#xD;
             regardless of Grade resolution as long as the patient is well controlled on thyroid&#xD;

             treated, must be asymptomatic, and must not have any of the following at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. No concurrent treatment for the CNS disease (e.g. surgery, radiation,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with any history of known or suspected autoimmune disease with the specific&#xD;
             exceptions of vitiligo, resolved childhood atopic dermatitis, psoriasis not requiring&#xD;
             systemic treatment (within the past 2 years), and patients with a history of Grave's&#xD;
             disease that are now euthyroid clinically and by laboratory testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any, investigational therapy within the 4 weeks prior to the initiation&#xD;
             of study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any systemic chemotherapy within 3 weeks&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection requiring parenteral&#xD;

             have completed treatment no less than one week prior to the initiation of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus or history of&#xD;
             acquired immune deficiency syndrome&#xD;
