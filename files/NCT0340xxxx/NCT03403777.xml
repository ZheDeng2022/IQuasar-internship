      This is a proof-of-concept study to define efficacy of AVELUMAB in patients with multiple&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory germ cell tumors (GCTs). Data suggest that PD-L1 is overexpressed in&#xD;
      TGCTs, and PD-L1 expression is significantly higher in GCTs in comparison to normal&#xD;
      testicular tissue.Patients with low PD-L1 expression had significantly better&#xD;
      progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.40, 95% CI (0.16 - 1.01, p = 0.008) and&#xD;
      overall survival (HR = 0.43, 95% CI (0.15 - 1.23, p = 0.040) compared to patients with high&#xD;
      PD-L1 expression. These data suggest that PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could be a novel therapeutic&#xD;
      target in TGCTs and that there is strong rationale to inhibit PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in GCTs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Germ-cell tumours (GCTs) are extraordinarily chemosensitive and resemble the clinical and&#xD;
      biological characteristics of a model for the cure of cancer. Nonetheless, a small proportion&#xD;
      of patients do not have a durable complete remission (CR) with initial chemotherapy. Only&#xD;
      20-40% of them will be cured with the use of platinum-containing standard-dose or high-dose&#xD;
      salvage chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Patients who fail to&#xD;
      be cured after second-line salvage therapy have an extremely poor prognosis and long term&#xD;
      survival had been documented in &lt;5%. Paclitaxel plus ifosfamide and cisplatin is considered&#xD;
      as a standard salvage chemotherapy in relapsed good prognosis GCTs, however, up to 40% of&#xD;
      favourable prognosis patients failed to achieve durable response to this combination, and&#xD;
      therefore new treatment strategies are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data suggest that PD-L1 is overexpressed in TGCTs, including 73% seminomas and 64%&#xD;
      non-seminomatous tumors, but none of normal testicular tissue specimens exhibited PD-L1&#xD;
      expression. In previous study that included 140 patients, PD-L1 was significantly higher in&#xD;
      GCTs in comparison to normal testicular tissue (mean QS = 5.29 vs. 0.32, p &lt; 0.0001).&#xD;
      Choriocarcinomas exhibit the highest level of PD-L1 with decreasing positivity in embryonal&#xD;
      carcinoma, teratoma, yolk sac tumor and seminoma. PD-L1 expression was associated with poor&#xD;
      prognostic features including ≥ 3 metastatic sites, increased serum tumor markers and/or&#xD;
      non-pulmonary visceral metastases. Patients with low PD-L1 expression had significantly&#xD;
      better progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.40, 95% CI (0.16 - 1.01, p = 0.008)&#xD;
      and overall survival (HR = 0.43, 95% CI (0.15 - 1.23, p = 0.040) compared to patients with&#xD;
      high PD-L1 expression (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data suggest that PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could be a novel therapeutic target in TGCTs and&#xD;
      that there is strong rationale to inhibit PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in GCTs and phase II study is&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;
