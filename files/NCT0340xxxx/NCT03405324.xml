    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy has played an important role in improving patient outcomes in oncology and is a&#xD;
      cornerstone of therapy for most patients with cancer. Of the adverse effects, none is more&#xD;
      feared than chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nausea and vomiting can adversely affect patients' quality of life and make it difficult for&#xD;
      them to perform their activities of daily living. Uncontrolled CINV can give rise to medical&#xD;
      complications, including poor nutrition, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and physical&#xD;
      and mental deterioration.The introduction and development of antiemetic drugs have&#xD;
      significantly improved the ability of clinicians to control CINV. The mainstays of antiemetic&#xD;
      therapy include serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists (RAs) and neurokinin 1 (NK-1) RAs.&#xD;
      Researchers and patients are seeking additional methods of controlling CINV, such as non-drug&#xD;
      therapies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a relatively simple technique&#xD;
      requiring only a few parts.&#xD;
