  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin pigmentation (melanin) absorbs ultra violet type B (UVB) radiation found in sunlight and&#xD;
      is believed to be responsible for darker-skinned persons' generally low 25(OH)D status. This&#xD;
      phenomenon is found in immigrants living in Northern countries and their 25(OH)D responses to&#xD;
      UVB-irradiation seem low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that objectively measured skin pigmentation and/or pigment genes influence&#xD;
      UVB-induced 25(OH)D increase significantly in combination with other influential parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of objectively measured constitutive and facultative skin pigmentation on&#xD;
      UVB-induced 25(OH)D increase over time was investigated together with other possible&#xD;
      influential parameters. These other influential parameters include sex, age, weight, height,&#xD;
      BMI, number of fatty fish meals per week, Fitzpatrick Skin Type and 25(OH)D start level. The&#xD;
      genetic parameters include 33 Vitamin D receptor and pigment SNPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-centre, open and non-blinded clinical trial. No randomisation was used, as&#xD;
      the participants were allocated into two groups based on their Fitzpatrick Skin type and&#xD;
      ethnic origin. The light-skinned group included participants with Fitzpatrick Skin type II-IV&#xD;
      and were of Northern origin (Denmark, the Faroe Islands and the UK). The darker-skinned&#xD;
      included Fitzpatrick Skin Types V-VI originating from countries located at latitudes below 50&#xD;
      degrees N. Thus, it could be ensured that the participants represented a wide range of skin&#xD;
      pigmentation. The light-skinned (N = 22) and the darker-skinned subjects (N = 18) were&#xD;
      exposed to identical UVB doses on identical body areas over nine weeks with weekly&#xD;
      measurements of 25(OH)D. The UVB-induced 25(OH)D synthesis was investigated in&#xD;
      summer-pigmented skin with melanin throughout the epidermis and during winter when ambient&#xD;
      UVB exposure is negligible. Demographic data (gender, age, weight, height, Fitzpatrick Skin&#xD;
      Type, measured constitutive and facultative skin pigmentation (PPF)) was collected/measured&#xD;
      and registered in prior to study start. The number of daily consumed fatty fish meals was&#xD;
      recorded in a questionnaire. Serum 25(OH)D was analysed weekly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background. Melanin molecules (pigment) in skin, absorb UVB and presumably reduce the&#xD;
      photo-conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol. Epidemiological studies have reported poor vitamin&#xD;
      D status in relatively darker-skinned immigrants residing in countries located at high&#xD;
      latitudes. It is therefore commonly believed that skin pigmentation is a major influencer of&#xD;
      vitamin D status. However, controlled UVB intervention studies have yielded conflicting&#xD;
      results regarding the influence of skin pigmentation on UVB induced vitamin D increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis. The investigators hypothesized that objectively measured skin pigmentation&#xD;
      (assessed as Pigment Protection Factor) and/or pigment genes influence UVB-induced&#xD;
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) increase significantly in combination with other influential&#xD;
      parameters. These other influential parameters include sex, age, weight, height, BMI, number&#xD;
      of fatty fish meals per week, Fitzpatrick Skin Type and 25(OH)D start level. The genetic&#xD;
      parameters include 33 Vitamin D receptor- and pigment-SNPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. This is a single-centre, open and non-blinded clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. The study was planned so that all included participants would receive identical&#xD;
      UVB doses gradually increasing over nine weeks from November to January. The total UVB dose&#xD;
      during the nine weeks was planned to be 26 kilo Joules/m2 (56 standard erythema doses).&#xD;
      Irradiation time would be determined and regulated by measuring UV intensity with a&#xD;
      Sola-Hazard spectroradiometer at study start, after five weeks and at the end of the exposure&#xD;
      period. To avoid erythema, the standard erythema dose must be below the lowest measured UVB&#xD;
      tolerance in the participants included. Based on previous experience of measurement on&#xD;
      light-skinned individual, the UVB treatment dose was set to a maximum of 1.4 kilo Joules/m2&#xD;
      (3 standard erythema doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin pigmentation. The content of melanin in epidermal biopsies is significantly correlated&#xD;
      to measurement of pigment protection factor (PPF). This measurement of PPF can be performed&#xD;
      non-invasively with a skin reflectance meter (UV-Optimize Scientific, Chromo-light, Denmark).&#xD;
      In the following, PPF is therefore used as a measure of skin pigmentation and referred to as&#xD;
      such. The measuring range of PPF is 1 to 25, meaning that a UVB dose between 1 standard&#xD;
      erythema dose and 25 standard erythema doses is needed to elicit a just perceptible erythema.&#xD;
      The constitutive PPF was measured on the buttocks, a body area not normally exposed to UVB.&#xD;
      The facultative PPF was assessed as a mean of measurements on the chest, midriff, back of&#xD;
      shoulder, and the medial and lateral sides of the arm. These are body areas influenced by&#xD;
      prior lifelong solar exposure. Both constitutive PPF and facultative PPF were measured at&#xD;
      study start, after 4Â½ weeks, and at study end. Mean values at these time-points for each&#xD;
      parameter were used for further investigation. Furthermore, subjects self-reported their skin&#xD;
      photo-type according to Fitzpatrick's criteria was assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood analysis. Serum 25(OH)D was analyzed on a liquid chromatography tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometer (LC-MS/MS), which is the current most accurate method for this analysis. This&#xD;
      method has been cross checked against another clinical laboratory and proven reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical variability. To minimize analysis variance, at least triplet analyses (technical&#xD;
      replicates) were performed of PPF measurement and 25(OH)D analysis. All 25(OH)D samples from&#xD;
      the same subject were analyzed in one batch. An internal standard solution with 25(OH)D was&#xD;
      used in each run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total relative standard deviation (SD) varied between 4.9% at 20 nmol/l and 14.1% at 222&#xD;
      nmol/l reflecting experimental variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological variability. By including 10 measuring time points for serum 25(OH)D per&#xD;
      participant, the intra-individual variability was reduced. Serum 25(OH)D is known to variate&#xD;
      with season and solar exposure. This study was therefore conducted during winter half-year,&#xD;
      when ambient UVB radiation and solar-exposed body areas are negligible at this time of the&#xD;
      year (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic parameters. SNP genotyping. A total of 33 SNPs were investigated. SNPs located in the&#xD;
      Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene. The influence of the vitamin D receptor gene was investigated&#xD;
      by genotyping the two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), rs1544410 (BsmI) and rs2228570&#xD;
      (FokI), located in the gene (ENSG00000111424, Chromosome 12q13) as previously described.&#xD;
      These two SNPs were selected due to their association with bone diseases as well as many&#xD;
      other diseases, thereby indicating that polymorphisms in those regions of VDR were important&#xD;
      for the functioning of VDR. These two SNPs were investigated together with the other&#xD;
      investigated demographic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SNPs located in genes with influence on pigment. Thirty-one SNPs were selected according to&#xD;
      potential influence on pigment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SNPs were genotyped. SNPs with genotype subgroups containing less than five subjects were&#xD;
      merged with other allele-sharing subgroups. Heterozygote subgroups with less than five&#xD;
      subjects was merged with an allele-sharing subgroup displaying insignificant (P &gt; 0.05)&#xD;
      difference in influence on the 25(OH)D increase rate. SNPs with no allele dose effect or&#xD;
      dominant allele effect on 25(OH)D were excluded. For SNPs with dominant allele effect,&#xD;
      subgroups with no significant differences in influence on 25(OH)D increase rate were merged&#xD;
      according to allele sharing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of participants. Participants were included and allocated into a light-skinned&#xD;
      group and a darker-skinned group based on Fitzpatrick Skin Type (self-reported skin&#xD;
      photo-type) and ethnic origin. The light-skinned included Fitzpatrick Skin Types I-IV&#xD;
      originating from Northern countries (Denmark, the Faroe Islands and the UK). The&#xD;
      darker-skinned included Fitzpatrick Skin Types V-VI originating from countries located at&#xD;
      latitudes below 50 degrees N. Thus, it could be ensured that the participants represented a&#xD;
      wide range of skin pigmentation. All participants must reside in Denmark. Furthermore, an&#xD;
      equal sex distribution was attempted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. No randomization was used, as the participants were allocated into two groups&#xD;
      based on other criteria at inclusion. Both groups received identical intervention and&#xD;
      blinding was therefore not used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Size of study. SD was 14.1 nmol/l for high-end 25(OH)D samples. On the basis of a previous&#xD;
      study lasting two weeks (10), the expected detectable difference was 15 nmol/l. The sample&#xD;
      size corresponding to number of subjects required to complete the study was 16 subjects in&#xD;
      each group, given a significance level of 5% and 80 % power to detect a difference of 15&#xD;
      nmol/l. Due to the relatively long study period, a minimum of 21 subjects were included in&#xD;
      each group allowing five drop-outs. Three subjects dropped out from the darker-skinned group,&#xD;
      and none from the light-skinned group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. All participants were assigned with a unique study number prior to study&#xD;
      start. Demographic data (gender, age, weight, height, Fitzpatrick Skin Type, measured&#xD;
      constitutive and facultative skin pigmentation (PPF)) was collected/measured and registered&#xD;
      in prior to study start. The number of daily consumed fatty fish meals was recorded in a&#xD;
      questionnaire. All forms were marked with the participants unique study number. 25(OH)D&#xD;
      samples were analyzed after study end. The participant study number linked to participant&#xD;
      contact details were held in a separate sheet kept securely and in line with the regulation&#xD;
      of the Danish Data Protection Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background diet and change in diet during intervention. The number of daily consumed fatty&#xD;
      fish meals was recorded in a questionnaire during the study period as this parameter&#xD;
      potentially can influence the primary outcome measure, 25(OH)D increase over time. The&#xD;
      questionnaire was examined for errors weekly and to ensure compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background health status and lifestyle, and changes in health status and lifestyle during&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health status of the participants and start of new medication was monitored weekly&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events. As the intervention included UVB radiation, all participants were assessed&#xD;
      for and requested to report skin erythema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance. To optimize compliance in this long-term study, the participants were requested&#xD;
      to schedule weekly intervention dates and complete all planned intervention throughout the&#xD;
      study period. Furthermore, it was required that all participants had weekly blood samples and&#xD;
      measurement of skin pigmentation three times during the study period. Also it was required&#xD;
      that a diet questionnaire was completed and checked for errors on a weekly basis. All&#xD;
      participants were informed thoroughly of the study requirements prior to inclusion. The&#xD;
      acceptable level of compliance was defined at a completion of the entire intervention&#xD;
      planned, assessment of all objective measurements and completion of all questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics of participants by group will be presented to&#xD;
      characterize the participants included in the study. Individual data were tested with the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess whether the data were normally distributed. Normally&#xD;
      distributed data will be tested by 2-tailed t test. Otherwise non-parametric tests will be&#xD;
      used such as 2-tailed Mann-Whitney's test or Kruskal-Wallis test. Comparison of 25(OH)D&#xD;
      levels at different time points will be performed using paired t test (2-tailed). Categorical&#xD;
      data will be tested with Fisher's exact test or Pearson's Chi-square test (2-tailed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the light-skinned group and the darker-skinned group may differ, these two groups will&#xD;
      initially be investigated separately to examine whether there is basis to merge these two&#xD;
      groups for common analysis. Therefore, the increase in 25(OH)D over time will be investigated&#xD;
      separately in the light-skinned group and the darker-skinned group the following models:&#xD;
      linear, inverse, quadratic, cubic, power, sigmoid and exponential. The derivate function was&#xD;
      defined as the average daily change in 25(OH)D between two sample time-points (Î25(OH)D per&#xD;
      day). Selection of the best suitable model will be performed based on the accordance between&#xD;
      the investigations of the 25(OH)D increase over time (individual- and group-based) and the&#xD;
      derivate function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inter-individual variations in the combined group in a linear transformation of the&#xD;
      increase of 25(OH)D over time will be explored by comparing general linear models (GLMs)&#xD;
      with: (1) common increase rate (25(OH)D increase per day and slope) and common 25(OH)D start&#xD;
      level (intercept), (2) common increase rates and individual intercepts (measured 25(OH)D&#xD;
      start levels) and (3) individual increase rates (i.e. an individual constant) and measured&#xD;
      25(OH)D start levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of parameters (secondary outcome measures) on the variation of the 25(OH)D&#xD;
      increase rate will be examined separately. As the influence of separate significant&#xD;
      parameters may not be independent, separate significant parameters will subsequently be&#xD;
      investigated by a stepwise backward elimination of a combined GLM according to P-value (25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be statistically analyzed using SPSS 24.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, U.S.A.).&#xD;
      P &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant. No interim analysis will be performed.&#xD;
