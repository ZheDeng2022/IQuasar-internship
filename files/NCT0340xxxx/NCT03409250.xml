      This investigator initiated pilot study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      SD-OCT-guided intravitreal ranibizumab treatment in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to&#xD;
      myopia. Newly diagnosed and active CNVs due to myopia are treated with one intravitreal&#xD;
      injection of Ranibizumab 0.5mg (Lucentis) at baseline. During the follow up period of 12&#xD;
      months monthly ophthalmological examinations including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)&#xD;
      and high resolution spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) assessments are&#xD;
      performed. Detection of persisting or new signs of CNV activity at OCT triggers ranibizumab&#xD;

      Study purpose: This investigator iniiated pilot study is designed to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of SD-OCT-guided intravitreal ranibizumab treatment in choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization (CNV) due to myopia. Newly diagnosed and active CNVs due to myopia are&#xD;
      treated with one intravitreal injection of Ranibizumab 0.5mg (Lucentis) at baseline. During&#xD;
      the follow up period of 12 months monthly ophthalmological examinations including best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and high resolution spectral-domain optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (SD-OCT) assessments are performed. Detection of persisting or new signs of CNV&#xD;
      activity at OCT triggers ranibizumab re-treatment considering that any ranibizumab injections&#xD;
      can maximally be applied as often as monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To investigate the efficacy and safety of SD-OCT-guided intravitreal ranibizumab&#xD;
      treatment in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that a SD-OCT-guided intravitreal ranibizumab&#xD;
      treatment in CNV due to myopia may prevent vision loss as evaluated as change in BCVA from&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the changes in BCVA at 6 and 12 months compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the number of treatments needed at 6 and 12 months and the time course of&#xD;
           re-treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the time course of re-activation of CNV as evaluated by High Resolution OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the incidence of fluorescein leakage as well as the mean and percent change&#xD;
           in total area of CNV, total area of leakage from CNV, and total lesion area at 6 and 12&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to monthly dosing of ranibizumab in CNV&#xD;
           due to myopia by determining the rates of adverse events and serious adverse events at&#xD;
           month 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: This outpatient study population will consist of a representative group of male&#xD;
      and female patients ≥ 18 years of age. The study population will include patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed and active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to myopia. 20 Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in one study center (Vista Klinik, Binningen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational and reference therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include the following study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) 0.5 mg for intravitreal injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a prospective, 1-arm, monocenter, investigator initiated study designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SD-OCT-guided intravitreal ranibizumab treatment in&#xD;
      choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to myopia. Newly diagnosed and active CNVs due to&#xD;
      myopia are treated with one intravitreal injection of ranibizumab 0.5mg at baseline. During&#xD;
      the follow up period of 12 months monthly ophthalmological examinations including best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and high resolution spectral domain optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (SD-OCT) assessments are performed. Detection of persisting or new signs of CNV&#xD;
      activity at OCT, as defined by intraretinal cysts or subretinal fluid, triggers ranibizumab&#xD;
      re-treatment considering that any ranibizumab injections can maximally be applied as often as&#xD;
      monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, a month is defined as 28 days. During the 12-month study period, a maximum of&#xD;
      12 ranibizumab injections may be administered.&#xD;
