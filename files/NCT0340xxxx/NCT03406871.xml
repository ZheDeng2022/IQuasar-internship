  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present trial consists of a dose-escalation cohort to verify the tolerability of&#xD;
      nivolumab and regorafenib when used in combination for patients with solid tumors, and to&#xD;
      examine the clinical recommended dose(RD). The trial also consists of an expansion cohort to&#xD;
      examine the safety and efficacy when the clinical RD is administered for several advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose-escalation cohort, three patients with solid tumors will be administered 3.0&#xD;
      mg/kg of nivolumab once every 2 weeks and regorafenib daily for 21days, with a 1-week washout&#xD;
      period at dose of 80 mg (level 1), 120 mg (level 2), or 160 mg (level 3). As a general rule,&#xD;
      one cycle will last 28 days (day 1-29); however, in the event of treatment prolongation, the&#xD;
      cycle period will be extended. The Dose Limiting Toxicity(DLT) evaluation period will be 28&#xD;
      days. Furthermore, for each level, three additional subjects will be added depending on the&#xD;
      state of DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the expansion cohort, the target subject sample will consist of approximately 30 patients&#xD;
      who will be administered 3.0 mg/kg of nivolumab once every 2 weeks, and the clinical RD of&#xD;
      regorafenib will be determined in the dose-escalation cohort.&#xD;
