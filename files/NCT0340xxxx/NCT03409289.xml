      This will be a prospective observational study of adult primary cardiac arrest patients&#xD;
      presenting to Shands Emergency Department following ROSC or actively in cardiac arrest with&#xD;
      subsequent ROSC after treatment in the emergency department. The study will be a single&#xD;
      center pilot study to evaluate the role of the extended RUSH exam in patients following&#xD;
      cardiac arrest in order to potentially diagnose the cause of their arrest. No control group&#xD;
      will be included in this study due to ethical concerns of withholding a potentially&#xD;
      life-saving diagnostic test. Patients will be treated with ACLS per standard of care and&#xD;
      resuscitation measures given. Within two hours of return of spontaneous circulation, the RUSH&#xD;
      exam will be performed by ultrasound-trained emergency department physicians with images&#xD;
      saved into the Qpath system, our already existing database where all emergency ultrasound&#xD;
      exams - education and diagnostic - are stored currently. The physician who performed the exam&#xD;
      will fill out a checklist with their interpretation and findings based on the elements&#xD;
      included in the exam. The data collected will be stored in a RedCap database. Identifying&#xD;
      data will be removed from the images and reviewed by two experienced ultrasonographers who&#xD;
      will give separate interpretations, and inter-observer reliability will be examined. We will&#xD;
      then correlate the interpretation with that of the physicians performing the exam. The&#xD;
      elements of the RUSH exam that will be performed include focused evaluation of the heart,&#xD;
      inferior vena cava, abdomen and aorta with the addition of evaluation for DVT and ocular&#xD;
      ultrasound. The evaluation for DVT will be an abbreviated exam with one view of each of the&#xD;
      bilateral femoral veins and popliteal veins. Techniques for performing the exam are based on&#xD;
      the 2012 RUSH guidelines [2]. The data will undergo statistical analysis to determine if the&#xD;
      data supported the initial hypotheses. Subjects will be contacted 30 days following the&#xD;
      initial study for telephone follow-up and a CPC assessment for neurologic recovery will also&#xD;
      be performed at that time.&#xD;
