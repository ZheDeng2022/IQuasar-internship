  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the well-known factors that contribute to the development of obesity, childbearing has&#xD;
      been reported as an important influential factor. Physical activity is strongly recommended&#xD;
      as one of the main tools to reduce any excessive weight gain during pregnancy and also to&#xD;
      reduce weight retention in the postpartum period. During the postpartum period, exercise&#xD;
      training coupled with a well-balanced nutritional plan, offers an effective intervention to&#xD;
      help mothers lose weight safely. International guidelines for physical activity after&#xD;
      pregnancy include strengthening routines. Worth noting, most of the above cited studies&#xD;
      focused on the benefits of aerobic activities. Strength training interventions are virtually&#xD;
      unexplored in postpartum women despite its potential benefits. Compared to the pregnancy&#xD;
      period, postpartum barriers to physical activity seem to focus less on health-related&#xD;
      barriers. In postpartum, time limitations for childcare become a more common barrier. For&#xD;
      this reason, a postpartum exercise program that incorporates the babies in a specific&#xD;
      exercise session has a better chance to succeed. The aim of this project is to determine the&#xD;
      benefits of strength training in a group class setting in postpartum healthy women with their&#xD;
      babies. Whereas mother's participation in regular physical activity may encourage regular&#xD;
      physical activity habits in her offspring, a second aim of this project is to also quantify&#xD;
      the infant's physical activity. The main measured outcomes are: maternal muscular strength;&#xD;
      body composition; aerobic capacity; exercise self efficacy; depressive symptoms; physical&#xD;
      activity level and food habits and baby's physical activity level.&#xD;

      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is a strength training group class (with babies) in postpartum women associated with (I)&#xD;
      strength and lean body mass improvement, (II) improvement aerobic capacity, (III) more&#xD;
      spontaneous physical activity, (IV) better self efficacy and (V) better mood?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baby:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does maternal lifestyle affect the baby's (0-12 months) physical activity level?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that women who complete the 10 week exercise program will have improved&#xD;
      strength from pre-intervention to post intervention. It is also hypothesized that women who&#xD;
      are adherent to the exercise program will have more active babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants train 60 min per session for 10 weeks on non consecutive days (Tues and Thurs).&#xD;
      All training sessions will be supervised by a qualified exercise instructor (graduate in&#xD;
      kinesiology) to ensure proper technique and to minimize the risk of injury. Each training&#xD;
      session will include a warm up phase of 5 minutes of dynamic and static stretching and a cool&#xD;
      down phase consisting of 5 minutes of static stretching. The strength training protocol is&#xD;
      based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines. Whole-body exercises and&#xD;
      different equipment such as weights, elastic bands and balls will be used. Babies will also&#xD;
      be included in the exercise routine. Participants will perform 1-3 sets per exercise, 8-12&#xD;
      repetitions per set and a 90-s rest interval between sets. The principle of progressive&#xD;
      overload will follow a linear increase as described in ACSM position stand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be tested at time points t0 , t1 ( after 5 weeks) and t2 (after 10&#xD;
      weeks; at the and of the study) on: i) strength and body composition; ii) aerobic capacity;&#xD;
      iii) objective and subjective physical activity level; vi) exercise self efficacy; v)&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and vi) dietary habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Strength/Body composition assessment At each time point, strength will be assessed for the&#xD;
      upper body (push-ups), lower body (squats), and trunk (abdominal curl-up test). The&#xD;
      participants will perform push-ups (as many as possible using a fixed pattern of 40 beats per&#xD;
      minute - time and number will be recorded up to a maximum of 1 minute). This will be repeated&#xD;
      for the number of lower body squat position performed (as many squats as possible using a&#xD;
      fixed pattern of 40 beats per minute -time and number will be recorded up to a maximum of 1&#xD;
      minute); these methods have been chosen to reduce the likelihood of any adverse events. The&#xD;
      participant will also complete the ACSM-recommended partial curl-up test to assess abdominal&#xD;
      strength and endurance. Briefly, as many abdominal curl-ups as possible has to be performed&#xD;
      until the participant either stops, or cannot stay in rhythm with a fixed cadence (40&#xD;
      beats/min) up to 1 minute as per ACSM guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition assessment will include body mass, height, BMI and body fat (sum of five&#xD;
      skinfolds: triceps, biceps, subscapular, suprailiac, thigh) measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Aerobic capacity Briefly, participants perform a 5- min. bout of exercise, stepping up&#xD;
      and down from a standard step (height 30 cm) following a specific cadence. During the step&#xD;
      test, heart rate (HR) is measured continuously using a heart-rate monitor. Then, VO2max is&#xD;
      estimated based on HR and a target exercise intensity (estimated VO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Physical activity assessment At each time point, participants will to complete two self-&#xD;
      reported questionnaires regarding physical activity level, the International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ; and the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q+).The&#xD;
      IPAQ asks participants to recall their levels of physical activity within five domains&#xD;
      (leisure, work, transportation, household, recreation) and three intensity categories over a&#xD;
      7-day recall period. The PAR-Q+ determines if it is safe to start an exercise program.&#xD;
      Additionally, at t0, t1 and t2 each participant will complete an individual physical activity&#xD;
      diary for 7 days. Moreover, during this period participants will continuously wear a&#xD;
      pedometer .&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Exercise self efficacy Exercise self-efficacy will be measured at each time point (t0,t1&#xD;
      and t2). This survey includes five separate items targeting self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Depressive symptoms Levels of postpartum mood will be assessed through the Edinburgh&#xD;
      Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Eating Habits Mother's eating habits will be measured through the Short-Form Frequency&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SFFFQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Breastfeeding habits will be measured through a Breastfeeding and Infant Feeding&#xD;
      Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baby At each time point, a Rothbart Infant Behavior Questionnaire- Revised (IBQ-R) will be&#xD;
      completed by the participants to measure temperament and gross motor activity in infants&#xD;
      between the ages of 3 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place at the Canadian Centre for Activity and Aging gymnasium on Tuesday&#xD;
      and Thursday afternoons (time to be determined). Women who contact us will be asked when&#xD;
      their baby was born. Those women whose babies are less than 20 weeks of age will be placed in&#xD;
      Group A and those women whose babies are older than 20 weeks will be placed in Group B. These&#xD;
      groups were divided by baby age because early postpartum women and babies are a different&#xD;
      group than those women with babies 6 months and older.&#xD;

    <measure>Gross motor activity using the Rothbart Infant Behavior Questionnaire- Revised (IBQ-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Women will complete only the activity component of the Rothbart Infant Behavior Questionnaire- Revised (IBQ-R) that contains 15 items to assess infant gross motor activity at baseline, after 5 weeks and at 10 weeks at the end of the intervention. Each question is answered using a 7 point scale (indicating activity over the last 7 days). The scare ranges from 1 - &quot;never&quot;, 2 - &quot;very rarely&quot;, 3 - &quot;&lt; half the time&quot;, 4 - &quot;about half the time&quot;, 5 - &quot;&gt; half the time&quot;, 6 - &quot;almost always&quot;, 7 - &quot;always&quot;. The score for the 15 questions is totaled. The higher the score, the more active the infant in gross motor activity. A perfect score is 105 and at each time point the total activity scores will be compared.</description>
