  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and deadliest primary malignant neoplasm of&#xD;
      the central nervous system in adults. Despite an aggressive multimodality treatment approach&#xD;
      including surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, overall survival remains poor.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab has recently been approved in the United States for the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and&#xD;
      neck squamous cell carcinoma, locally advanced urothelial carcinoma, classical Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma, unresectable or metastatic melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being performed to determine whether the triple combination of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      when added to TTFields (Optune®) and adjuvant temozolomide increases progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) in patients with newly diagnosed GBM as compared to historical control data.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with newly-diagnosed GBM who undergo maximal safe resection (biopsy alone is&#xD;
      eligible) followed by standard chemoradiation will be eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four weeks after completing chemoradiation, patients will undergo baseline standard of care&#xD;
      MRI. Four to six weeks after finishing chemoradiation, patients will start monthly cycles of&#xD;
      adjuvant TMZ. A minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 cycles of adjuvant TMZ will be given.&#xD;
      Treatment with Optune will start at approximately the same time as the first cycle of&#xD;
      adjuvant TMZ and continue until second disease progression or a maximum of 2 years. Within&#xD;
      one week after starting Cycle 2 of adjuvant TMZ and Optune therapy, patients will begin&#xD;
      open-label treatment with pembrolizumab every 3 weeks until first disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicities or 2 years, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first progression, patients will be allowed to continue with Optune therapy combined with&#xD;
      any other therapy, which may include pembrolizumab, per standard of care at the discretion of&#xD;
      the treating physician. Surgical resection or biopsy of first recurrent tumor for&#xD;
      confirmation of recurrence is allowed within the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be seen before Cycle 1 of TMZ, before cycle 2 of TMZ, before starting the&#xD;
      second dose of pembrolizumab, and every 3 weeks before each subsequent pembrolizumab dose at&#xD;
      an outpatient clinic until they complete all 12 cycles of adjuvant TMZ or discontinue TMZ due&#xD;
      to toxicity or first progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical follow-up will continue for 30 days after treatment termination. After this visit,&#xD;
      mortality will be assessed based on telephone interviews with the patients or the patients'&#xD;
      caregivers every 3 months.&#xD;
