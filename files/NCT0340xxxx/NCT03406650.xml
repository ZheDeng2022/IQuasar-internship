  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to demonstrate that the addition of neoadjuvant and adjuvant&#xD;
      immunotherapy with durvalumab, to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (with&#xD;
      cisplatin/gemcitabine) and surgery in urothelial carcinoma could improve event-free survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite optimal surgical management the prognosis for localized muscle invasive urothelial&#xD;
      cancer (MIUC) is unfavorable with 5-year overall survival of around 45%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to international guidelines the use of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy is&#xD;
      considered standard of care in all patients with localized MIUC with planned curative local&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited and there is a clear medical need&#xD;
      for improvement for this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durvalumab has been tested in a phase I/II open-label study including patients with&#xD;
      metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results demonstrated an overall response rate (RR) of 31% in 42 response-evaluable&#xD;
      patients. The side effect profile was favorable with most common grade 1/2 AE representing&#xD;
      fatigue (13%), diarrhea (10%) and decreased appetite (8%). Three patients (4.9%) had&#xD;
      treatment related grade 3 AE's, no grade 4/5 events were noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy with modern immune-checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibition has been demonstrated to be feasible with demonstration of favorable&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of these data it appears a logical step to apply these novel agents in the curative&#xD;
      setting of neoadjuvant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefit of combining chemotherapy with durvalumab and to continue durvaluamb&#xD;
      postoperatively might be twofold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to increase the response rate in the pre-operative setting and subsequently to increase&#xD;
           the rate of pathologic complete remission (pT0) and to reduce risk of local recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evoke durable systemic anti-cancer responses and subsequently to increase disease&#xD;
           free- and overall survival and furthermore to induce antitumor immune response.&#xD;
