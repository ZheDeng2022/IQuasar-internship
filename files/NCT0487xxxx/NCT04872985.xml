  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of&#xD;
      Pyrotinib in combination with Doxorubicin/Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide followed by&#xD;
      Docetaxel/nab-Paclitaxel as neoadjuvant therapy for women with hormone receptor positive&#xD;
      HER2-negative stage II to III breast cancer. Patients randomized to the study arm/control arm&#xD;
      will receive standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in combination with pyrotinib/placebo,&#xD;
      respectively. The primary endpoint of the study is the total pathological complete response&#xD;
      (pCR) rate. Secondary endpoints include the pCR rate in breast only, objective response&#xD;
      rate(ORR), event-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity. We will also explore&#xD;
      potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pyrotinib is an oral, irreversible pan-ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with&#xD;
      activity against epidermal growth factor receptor HER1(EGFR), HER2 and HER4. Improvement of&#xD;
      the chemotherapy efficacy and good tolerability have been shown by several stage II and III&#xD;
      clinical trials in both the neoadjuvant and metastasis setting in HER2-positive breast&#xD;
      cancers. Yet, the anti-tumor effect of Pyrotinib by targeting HER4 has not been determined.&#xD;
      Preclinical studies show that HER4 is relatively highly expressed in hormone receptor&#xD;
      positive and HER2-negative(HR+/HER2-) breast cancers. In MCF7 cell lines, Pyrotinib&#xD;
      effectively repressed phosphorylation of MAPK and Akt signal transduction pathways to inhibit&#xD;
      tumor cell proliferation. In HR+/HER2- tumor xenografts, Pyrotinib has been observed to&#xD;
      inhibit tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner(unpublished data). Taken together, the data&#xD;
      support the rationale that Pyrotinib may be efficacious in HER4 high expressed HR+/HER2-&#xD;
      breast cancer and in combination with chemotherapy may lead to a better pCR rate in the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a two-arm design with a 1:1 allocation ratio (equal numbers of patients&#xD;
      randomized to Arms 1, 2,). The sample size will be up to 140 patients with about 70 evaluable&#xD;
      patients in each arm. Accrual is expected to occur over 24 months. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of the two neoadjuvant therapy regimens: Patients in Arm 1 will be assigned&#xD;
      to receive 400 mg Pyrotinib orally once per day with four cycles of epirubicin (100 mg/m2)&#xD;
      (or doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection 30mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2)&#xD;
      intravenously, once every 3 weeks, followed by four cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m2)&#xD;
      intravenously, once every 3 weeks(or 12 cycles of weekly nab-paclitaxel 120 mg/m2) . Dosage&#xD;
      reduction of pyrotinib is permitted from 400 mg to 320 mg or 240 mg if Pyrotinib-related AEs&#xD;
      are experienced. In Arm 2 (control), Pyrotinib will be replaced by 400mg placebo provided by&#xD;
      the same pharmacy company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all arms, clinical response will be evaluated by breast MRI. The primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      assessed with the paraffin embedded pathological specimens collected from surgery. Submission&#xD;
      of tumor samples for the correlative science studies will be optional for all patients. For&#xD;
      patients who agree, pathological sections of core biopsy specimen before treatment (after the&#xD;
      patient has signed the consent form and has been screened for eligibility) and pathological&#xD;
      sections of surgery residual disease specimen after the completion of the treatment are&#xD;
      collected. In addition, a blood sample collected after randomization (before the start of&#xD;
      study therapy and after the completion of the neoadjuvant therapy) will also be required for&#xD;
      the correlative studies.&#xD;
