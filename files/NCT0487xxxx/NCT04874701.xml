  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an ongoing major public health problem in most countries of the world for which&#xD;
      the agrifood industry still remains criticized because of the abundant offer of high&#xD;
      sugar-lipid-energy dense foods, particularly in the fast-food sector. The resulting societal&#xD;
      pressure on the food industry probably explains in part the efforts that have been deployed&#xD;
      to seek natural active ingredients and to develop functional foods favorably influencing&#xD;
      energy balance. Capsaicin is a food non-nutrient constituent that was shown to decrease&#xD;
      appetite sensations and subsequent energy intake. The measurement of heart rate variability&#xD;
      revealed an association between the increase in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and&#xD;
      the satiating effects induced by capsaicin. This is concordant with the observation that&#xD;
      pre-prandial intake of capsaicin, be it in capsules or diluted in tomato juice, increased&#xD;
      satiety and reduced energy intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the long effects of Capsimax on appetite&#xD;
      sensations and energy expenditure under conditions of moderate energy restriction and to&#xD;
      evaluate the long-term effects of Capsimax on energy intake and expenditure under conditions&#xD;
      of moderate energy restriction.&#xD;

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a validated questionnaire which evaluates sleep quality and disturbance over a 1-month time interval.

    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a commonly used measure of trait and state anxiety. It can be used in clinical settings to diagnose anxiety and to distinguish it from depressive syndromes. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression.</description>
