  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is to find out the best dose and side effects of tegavivint in treating&#xD;
      patients with leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or does not response to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Tegavivint may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Giving tegavivint in combination with decitabine may help control the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of&#xD;
      tegavivint in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (Phase I&#xD;
      dose escalation) II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLT) of tegavivint combined with decitabine in patients with relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (Combination cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety profile of tegavivint as characterized by adverse event (AE) type,&#xD;
      severity, timing and relationship to study drug, as well as laboratory abnormalities in the&#xD;
      first and subsequent treatment cycles. (Phase I dose escalation) II. To explore the efficacy&#xD;
      (complete remission [CR], complete remission without blood count recovery [CRi], or partial&#xD;
      remission [PR], of tegavivint as a single-agent in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R)&#xD;
      AML. (Phase I dose escalation) III. To assess overall survival (OS), and disease-free&#xD;
      survival (DFS) in patients with R/R AML treated with tegavivint. (Phase I dose escalation)&#xD;
      IV. To assess the duration of disease control defined as first date of disease control&#xD;
      identified (either CR/CRi, PR or SD) until the date of progression. (Phase I dose escalation)&#xD;
      V. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance in patients with R/R AML treated with&#xD;
      tegavivint. (Phase I dose escalation) VI. To assess the safety profile of tegavivint in&#xD;
      combination with decitabine as characterized by adverse event (AE) type, severity, timing and&#xD;
      relationship to study drug, as well as laboratory abnormalities in the first and subsequent&#xD;
      treatment cycles. (Combination cohort) VII. To explore the efficacy (complete response [CR],&#xD;
      complete response without blood count recovery [CRi], or partial response [PR], of tegavivint&#xD;
      in combination with decitabine in patients with R/R AML. (Combination cohort) VIII. To assess&#xD;
      overall survival (OS), and disease free survival (DFS) in patients with R/R AML treated with&#xD;
      tegavivint + decitabine. (Combination cohort) IX. To assess the duration of disease control&#xD;
      defined as first date of disease control identified (either CR/ CRi, PR or SD) until the date&#xD;
      of progression. (Combination cohort) X. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance in&#xD;
      patients with R/R AML treated with tegavivint + decitabine. (Combination cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART I: Patients receive tegavivint intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART II: Patients receive tegavivint IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and decitabine&#xD;
      IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known cardiac ejection fraction of &gt; or = 45% within the past 3 months&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient must have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and signed&#xD;
             informed consent. A signed informed consent by the patient or his legally authorized&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the agent used in this study has&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is a potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             the chemotherapy agents, breastfeeding should also be avoided&#xD;
