  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apomorphine is the only anti-parkinsonian agent compatible with levodopa in improving&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms. Besides, it has positive effects on some of the&#xD;
      nonmotor symptoms of the disease, such as urinary disturbances and sleep. Apomorphine is&#xD;
      usually well tolerated as it produces limited side effects. Knowledge about the effects of&#xD;
      apomorphine on pain in PD is scarce. Evidence on this topic has only been reported in case&#xD;
      reports or small studies but represents a potentially important use of the drug. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that apomorphine may be a rational, safe, and useful treatment for subjects with&#xD;
      pain in PD, including different subtypes. Within this framework, the present study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of acute apomorphine vs. placebo administration on different PD pain&#xD;
      types.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>We will perform a small pilot double-blind, randomized cross-over study evaluating the safety and efficacy of apomorphine injections vs. placebo injections on pain in PD. Subjects, caregivers, and investigators will be blinded to the assignment.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Upon entry to the study, all subjects will be assigned to a subject number. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either apomorphine injections or placebo on VISIT 2 in a double-blind manner according to a randomization schedule using computerized randomization tables prepared by a blinded clinical nurse. Participants will then cross over to the other treatment group to receive apomorphine or placebo injections on VISIT 3. The specific type of randomization used will be block randomization to ensure equal sample sizes of the apomorphine and placebo groups</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 1 and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measures changes of symptom severity, treatment response and the efficacy of treatments. Part 1 (non-motor experiences of daily living), Part 2 (motor experiences of daily living), Part 3 (motor examination) and Part 4 (motor complications). The maximum score for all the parts is 272. Higher scores are indicative of worse outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Likert Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 1 and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measure of global pain change perceived by the patients. The most simple Likert Visual Analogue Scale is a straight horizontal line of fixed length, usually 100 mm. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be measured (symptom, pain, health) orientated from the left (worst) to the right (best). There are no numerical values on this scale however, a positioning towards the left of the scale indicates a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 1 and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in scores on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. CGI is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients).CGI scores range from 1 (very much improved) through to 7 (very much worse). Treatment response ratings should take account of both therapeutic efficacy and treatment-related adverse events and range from 0 (marked improvement and no side-effects) and 4 (unchanged or worse and side-effects outweigh the therapeutic effects). Each component of the CGI is rated separately; the instrument does not yield a global score.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive the treatment while they are in an OFF period, without the effect of any antiparkinsonian medication. For this study, the initial dose of apomorphine or placebo will be 2 mg. We selected an initial standardized dose based on the pharmacological characteristics of apomorphine. Assessments will be completed 30 and 60 minutes after the initial dose. At 60 minutes from the first dose, a 3 mg dose will be administered, and again, assessments will be completed after 30 and 60 minutes. The total given dosage will be 5 mg. Blood pressure and pulse will be checked every 20 minutes after injections.&#xD;
