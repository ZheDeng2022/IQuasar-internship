    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates the impact of cefazolin before surgery on the microbiome in&#xD;
      patients with stage I-II melanoma. Antibiotics, such as cefazolin, given at the time of&#xD;
      surgery may cause a significant change in the microbes (like bacteria and viruses) found in&#xD;
      the stomach and intestines. This trial may help researchers learn if any changes in microbes&#xD;
      affect the body's ability to respond to surgery and cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate whether the use of pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics administered&#xD;
      during surgical resection substantially alters the patient's gut microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the dynamics of the immune response to surgical intervention in the&#xD;
      absence and presence of pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics, focusing on the immune&#xD;
      profile of the peripheral blood leukocytes as well as the balance of circulating pro- and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokines and metabolomic profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess surgical site infection (SSI) in the absence and presence of pre-operative&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics at time of surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive cefazolin intravenously (IV) and then undergo standard of care&#xD;
      surgical resection within 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients undergo standard of care surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 days, 2 weeks, and 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in microbiome alpha diversity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 2 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The diversity, structure, and composition of the fecal microbiome will be determined by 16S(v4) rRNA gene sequencing. 16S profiles will be used to compute alpha diversity, beta diversity, and the relative abundance of fecal bacteria. The composition of fecal bacteria in adult humans is mainly dominated by members of the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla while members of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia are observed in lower abundance. To calculate richness (alpha-diversity), we will count each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) or amplicon sequence variant (ASV) identified. Richness count is expected to range between 10-500 per sample.</description>
