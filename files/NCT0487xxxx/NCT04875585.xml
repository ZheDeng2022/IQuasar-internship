      The primary aim of this single arm, phase II study is to determine the efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination therapy Pembrolizumab/Lenvatinib regarding the rate of major pathological&#xD;
      response (MPR-Rate). The investigators expect to improve the MPR-Rate of 20% in&#xD;
      Anti-PD1/-PD-L1 monotherapy (observed in recent trials) to a MPR-Rate of 40% with the&#xD;
      combination therapy Pembrolizumab/Lenvatinib.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In Tyrol lung cancer is the fourth most incident cancer in women and the second most in men&#xD;
      (1). Mortality related to lung cancer is highest in both sex groups, which supports the huge&#xD;
      unmet medical need for improved lung cancer therapies in the near future (2). In very recent&#xD;
      years, many novel therapies have entered the clinical scene, particular for treatment of&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and many of those drugs target the tumor microenvironment&#xD;
      (TME) (3-6). Both, anti-angiogenic-treatment (AAT) and immunotherapy target the TME and have&#xD;
      been successfully established as standard therapeutic options in NSCLC (6-9). Recent&#xD;
      preclinical studies strongly suggest that AAT and immune-checkpoint-inhibitors act&#xD;
      synergistically and first clinical studies also proved an acceptable safety profile (6, 10,&#xD;
      11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, response and therapeutic efficacy of these approaches is still limited to certain&#xD;
      subgroups of patients and therefore the search for biomarker(s) predicting response and/or&#xD;
      toxicity for improved patient selection is of utmost importance. This knowledge would&#xD;
      definitely allow a more rational and efficient clinical use of these compounds. Neoadjuvant&#xD;
      &quot;window of opportunity&quot; trials may offer an important way of answering relevant translational&#xD;
      research questions related to optimized (biomarker-driven) patient selection, as they allow&#xD;
      sequential tissue sampling during diagnostic work-up and subsequently (after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy) upon surgical tumor resection. Most studies investigating immunotherapy&#xD;
      combinational approaches mainly focused on the characterization of the immune cell&#xD;
      compartment, while the influence on the vascular network as well as on their mutual&#xD;
      regulation, particularly in case both compartments are targeted in parallel, has not&#xD;
      sufficiently been addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard neoadjuvant therapy is a mainstay of combinational chemotherapy with high toxicity&#xD;
      and complication rates (12, 13). Several recent early clinical trials have shown promising&#xD;
      pathologic response rates and good tolerability with neoadjuvant immune-checkpoint antibody&#xD;
      therapy (14-16). Recently, neoadjuvant immune-checkpoint antibody monotherapy (ICA) with the&#xD;
      PD-1 blocking monoclonal antibody Nivolumab showed high pathological response rates and good&#xD;
      tolerability (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant treatment with immune-checkpoint-inhibitors has been shown to be effective and safe&#xD;
      in the treatment of early stage melanoma (17, 18). In NSCLC prospective randomized trials&#xD;
      with the aim of recapitulating these beneficial effects are ongoing. A high medical need in&#xD;
      the adjuvant therapy setting is to select the optimal candidates for therapy and&#xD;
      liquid-biopsies drawn during adjuvant treatment offer important opportunities for patients&#xD;
      selection: (i) the kinetics of cell-free tumor-DNA (ct-DNA) can be used to monitor remission&#xD;
      status and potentially early sense later overt clinical relapse (19-22); (ii) longitudinal&#xD;
      assessment of patient-specific tumor alterations may predict therapy recurrence (iii)&#xD;
      together with measurements of immune cell populations ct-DNA kinetics might gain insights&#xD;
      into the dynamics within the TME during a prolonged period of checkpoint-blockade. Combining&#xD;
      these informations might lead to a better understanding of potentially beneficial&#xD;
      neo-/adjuvant treatment effects finally leading to relapse-prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present phase II investigator-initiated trial (IIT) investigates the efficacy of the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant combination therapy of the PD-1 inhibitor Pembrolizumab with the antiangiogenic&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor Lenvatinib (primary endpoint: major pathological response) and how this&#xD;
      therapy shapes the TME. Furthermore, the disease kinetics and the effects on cellular and&#xD;
      soluble immune-biomarkers will be monitored during an additional adjuvant treatment-phase&#xD;
      with Pembrolizumab via liquid-biopsies, multi-dimensional flow cytometry and cytokine&#xD;
      quantification. In total 33 patients with early stage NSCLC will be included in this trial.&#xD;
      The scientific program provides a comprehensive mapping of the TME prior to and after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant intervention using various single cell analysis platforms to depict the&#xD;
      composition of the TME. Consecutively collected plasma and blood probes will be analysed and&#xD;
      correlated with routine response assessment, TME patterns and the clinical endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the present phase II study aims for identification of potential biomarkers and&#xD;
      biomarker combinations relevant for combination therapy of immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      agents in early stage NSCLC.&#xD;
