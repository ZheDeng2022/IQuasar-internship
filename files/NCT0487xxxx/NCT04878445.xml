  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot/laboratory study comparing lung tissue from control participants with&#xD;
      tissue from COPD participants with a chronic bronchitis or emphysema phenotypes. Tissue will&#xD;
      be characterised mechanically and biochemically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung cells, including DASCp63/Krt5 with a possible role in disease pathology, will be&#xD;
      isolated, expanded in vitro, characterised, and banked. Biomaterials will be selected and&#xD;
      tested with regards to mechanical and physical properties and selected for use in the&#xD;
      production of TELEs with properties matched to healthy and diseased lung tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting TELEs will be tested in an ex vivo tissue culture model to determine the extent&#xD;
      of their integration with lung.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently ranked as the third leading cause&#xD;
      of death with an annual associated global healthcare cost of Â£1.3 trillion (1). It is the&#xD;
      second most common cause of emergency hospital admissions with high morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      COPD results in a progressive loss of lung function, leading to respiratory failure. This&#xD;
      loss of lung function is associated with repetitive cycles of inflammation and parenchymal&#xD;
      scarring leading to the development of emphysema. This is a consequence of the breakdown of&#xD;
      the delicate parenchymal structures and lung remodelling, with accumulation of fibrous tissue&#xD;
      and loss of the alveolar-capillary functional units that are essential for effective gas&#xD;
      exchange. Macroscopically the lungs become stiffer and unable to support the patient through&#xD;
      the physiological inhalation/exhalation breathing cycles (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of emphysema also results in the loss of lung elastic recoil as pockets of air&#xD;
      form in place of damaged bronchioles and alveoli reducing the available volume for the next&#xD;
      inhalation. The collapse of the airways during exhalation leads to increased lung volumes&#xD;
      causing hyperinflation and gas trapping. Patients become progressively symptomatic with&#xD;
      increasing breathlessness, reduced exercise tolerance and poor quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacological treatment options for emphysema are limited; current therapy aims to&#xD;
      improve airflow limitation, reduce airway inflammation and reduce exacerbations, but does not&#xD;
      reverse lung damage (3). Lung transplantation and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) is&#xD;
      available for a selected minority of patients with severe emphysema. The recent introduction&#xD;
      of non-invasive endoscopic mechanical treatment with Valves reduces severely damaged lung&#xD;
      volume and re-directs air to the healthier tissue while Coils improves elastic lung recoil&#xD;
      (4, 5). These interventions however do not improve survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous work performed within our laboratories has determined that hydrogel/elastin-based&#xD;
      constructs can achieve mechanical values consistent with those of the alveolar wall when&#xD;
      seeded with lung fibroblasts (1). This raises the intriguing question of whether&#xD;
      tissue-engineered constructs (TEC) could be used to restore mechanical integrity of the&#xD;
      emphysematous lung, via air pocket displacement and local integration, and ultimately by&#xD;
      regeneration of local lung architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coupled to the work described above a recent observation went some way to detailing the&#xD;
      mechanism behind the previously misunderstood, but physiologically critical, capacity for&#xD;
      lung tissue to regenerate following on from acute disease such as pneumonia or acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (6). The key appears to lie with a population of distal airway&#xD;
      stem cells who co-express Trp63 (p63) and Keratin 5 (Krt5). These DASCp63/Krt5 cells appear&#xD;
      to migrate to sites of injury in the lung where they have demonstrated differentiation&#xD;
      capacity including lineages such as type I and II pneumocytes and bronchiolar secretory&#xD;
      cells. It is crucial to our understanding of chronic lung disorders, and design of future&#xD;
      cell-based therapies, whether these cells remain present and dormant in diseased lung tissue&#xD;
      or lost through as yet unknown mechanisms.&#xD;
