  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major impact of COVID-19 has been that the severity of respiratory symptoms require&#xD;
      intensive hospital treatment. There is significant mortality and many of the survivors have a&#xD;
      delayed recovery requiring intensive prolonged rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 is a multi-systemic disease in which different mechanisms within the body are&#xD;
      affected; including the 'Gut microbiome'. 'Gut microbiome' refers to the bacteria living in&#xD;
      intestines. While some bacteria is harmful, many are extremely beneficial and necessary for a&#xD;
      healthy body. Many patients have gastrointestinal symptoms and there is a major change in the&#xD;
      gut micro flora (microbiome), which may have an adverse effect on the respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
      The probiotic, Sivomix, was given to hospitalized COVID-19 patients was associated with a&#xD;
      more rapid recovery in gastrointestinal symptoms on day 3 and 7, and an eight fold reduction&#xD;
      in the requirement for mechanical ventilation in an open trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized clinical trial, with a recruitment target of 60 patients admitted with&#xD;
      COVID-19 symptoms to the general medical wards. Patients will be randomized to receive the&#xD;
      probiotic, Symprove, or placebo in addition to their standard of care treatment. Patients&#xD;
      will need take either probiotic/placebo daily for 3 months. All follow-up will be whilst they&#xD;
      are an inpatient or as a telephone follow-up; they will not need to attend at the hospital to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a biological sub-study incorporated into the protocol, but participation is&#xD;
      optional. If patients consent to this, they will also need to provide blood, faecal and&#xD;
      saliva samples at baseline, Day 7 and final visit (3 months after randomisation). Patients&#xD;
      who consent to providing biological samples will need to visit the hospital at Day 7 and&#xD;
      final visit.&#xD;
