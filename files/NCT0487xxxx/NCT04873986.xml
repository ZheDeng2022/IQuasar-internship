      A new Scoliosis Tele-Screening Test (STS-Test) was developed by a study group of the&#xD;
      &quot;Scoliosis Research and Treatment Association Turkey&quot;. It will be sent to the families of&#xD;
      schoolchildren by e-mail in Turkey. Participants with moderate and high risk for scoliosis&#xD;
      according to the result of this test will be invited to the physical examination by the&#xD;
      scoliosis specialists, if it is not possible, they will be evaluated via tele-medicine.&#xD;
      Participants with moderate and high risks will be invited to the physical examination to the&#xD;
      centers designated as research centers. Families who could not reach these centers will be&#xD;
      asked to take pictures of their children according to the given instruction. They will be&#xD;
      asked to send this photo to the researchers by e-mail. The researchers will be evaluated the&#xD;
      TRACE and Adams' test from the photo and sent their opinions to the parents via e-mail. If&#xD;
      this virtual analysis made by the expert suggests a suspicion of scoliosis, it will be&#xD;
      recommended to see a specialist as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the validity and reliability of this novel scoliosis&#xD;
      tele-screening test. A secondary aim is to investigate the coherence of this new test between&#xD;
      scoliosis physician and parent when applied to the same child. Specificity, sensitivity,&#xD;
      negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and test accuracy will be calculated&#xD;
      for the Scoliosis Tele-Screening Test. Correlation between STS-Test and Trace, Adams' test,&#xD;
      and physician diagnosis will be analyzed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a three-dimensional spinal and trunk deformity. Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis&#xD;
      prevalence is 3,1% in females and 1,5% in males in Turkey. Most of the cases are&#xD;
      asymptomatic, therefore screening programs are very crucial for early diagnosis especially&#xD;
      for cases in risky ages. Early diagnosis provides the early treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aesthetic evaluation of the trunk is one of the important components of Idiopathic Scoliosis&#xD;
      and aesthetic appearance which is the main complaint of the patients and family is the&#xD;
      primary aim of the conservative and operative treatment. There are some tools that evaluates&#xD;
      postural asymmetries like Trunk Aesthetic Clinical Evaluation which evaluates the shoulder,&#xD;
      scapula, waist, and hemithorax and known as a reliable instrument for everyday clinical&#xD;
      evaluation and to monitor aesthetic changes achieved with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A scoliosis screening test has been developed in which families with restricted access to the&#xD;
      hospital and healthcare professionals due to the Covid-19 pandemic, can evaluate their&#xD;
      children in terms of scoliosis risk without applying to any health institution. A study group&#xD;
      of subject experts was formed within the &quot;Scoliosis Research and Treatment Association&#xD;
      Turkey&quot;. This new tele-screening test could be easily applied by parents at a home in&#xD;
      different times, give information about the results to the implementer just after the&#xD;
      evaluation. Researchers discussed how to evaluate the spine for scoliosis in a virtual&#xD;
      environment and were created a visual screening test. In the scoring of the STS-Test, the&#xD;
      images related to the body asymmetry of patients with scoliosis with different deformities&#xD;
      characteristics in the common database of these experts were analyzed and scoring was created&#xD;
      by expert opinion and consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoliosis risk was determined by considering the visual body asymmetries in the shoulder,&#xD;
      thorax, waist, and pelvis, in addition, Adams' test. For the girls, female gender and time&#xD;
      since menarche as a risk factor were included in the total score. In STS-Test scoring, the&#xD;
      positive Adams' test is 4 points for both genders; the presence of family history related to&#xD;
      scoliosis is 1 point; female gender was as 1 point; no menarche, or time less than 1-year&#xD;
      since menarche for girls, was determined as 1 point. In the scoring of the other items, the&#xD;
      anterior shoulder levels and height difference in the pelvis were scored as 2 points; if&#xD;
      there was asymmetry in the images of the items including shoulder level difference from the&#xD;
      posterior, scapula asymmetry, pelvic shifting to one side and height difference in the&#xD;
      pelvis, they were scored as 1 point, and if symmetrical or not able to make a decision, it&#xD;
      was scored as 0 points. Scoliosis Tele-Screening Test consists of a total of 23 Likert-type&#xD;
      questions; 5 questions about the sociodemographic characteristics of the parents, 3 questions&#xD;
      on the knowledge/awareness level regarding scoliosis, 3 questions on the risk factors related&#xD;
      to scoliosis development, 7 questions about the cosmetic deformities that scoliosis may&#xD;
      cause/can reveal, and 5 questions the satisfaction of the parent/evaluator. The total score&#xD;
      for risk groups is based on 7 questions about the cosmetic deformities caused by scoliosis&#xD;
      and 3 questions regarding the risk factors associated with scoliosis development. The total&#xD;
      score is obtained by summing up the scores from 10 questions of these two sections. The total&#xD;
      score is categorized as low, medium, and high risk, and the risk groups differ for males and&#xD;
      females. 0-4 points are low, 5-11 points are medium, and 12-15 points are considered a&#xD;
      high-risk group for girls in the total score. 0-3 points are low, 4-8 points are medium, and&#xD;
      9-13 points are considered high risk group for males in the total score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final version of the test was shared on the website of the Scoliosis Research and&#xD;
      Treatment Association Turkey and social networks. After the parent/evaluator completed the&#xD;
      test, an e-mail containing information about the test, scoliosis risk score, and&#xD;
      recommendations was sent with an automatic reply. Participants with moderate and high risks&#xD;
      will be invited to the physical examination to the centers designated as research centers.&#xD;
      Families who could not reach these centers will be asked to take pictures of their children&#xD;
      according to the given instruction. They will be asked to send this photo to the researchers&#xD;
      by e-mail. The researchers will be evaluated the TRACE and Adams' test from the photo and&#xD;
      sent their opinions to the parents via e-mail. If this virtual analysis made by the expert&#xD;
      suggests a suspicion of scoliosis, it will be recommended to see a specialist as soon as&#xD;
      possible. The patients who could apply to the center will be examined by the physician,&#xD;
      evaluated cosmetically according to TRACE, and Adams' test will be performed. Suspicion of&#xD;
      scoliosis will be confirmed by spine radiography. Patients with a Cobb angle ≥10° in any&#xD;
      segment of the spine will be considered to have scoliosis. The location, direction, and angle&#xD;
      of scoliosis will be recorded from the spine radiographs.&#xD;

    <description>The agreement between the risk analyzes obtained with the STS-Test performed by the parents and the face-to-face spine assessment by a doctor will be determined. Pearson correlation coefficient will be used to investigate the correlations between parents(via the STS-Test score) and physician assessment. Correlation between parameters will be interpreted as follows: r=0-0.19 a very weak correlation, r=0.20-0.39 weak correlation, r=0.40-0.59 moderate correlation, r=0.60-0.79 strong correlation and r=0.80-1 very strong correlation.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Trunk Aesthetic Clinical Evaluation (TRACE) is a clinical tool developed for the evaluation of trunk asymmetries of patients with scoliosis by physicians or therapists. TRACE is a scale that evaluates asymmetry in shoulders, scapula, waist and hemithorax in 4 items and gives a global score that can reflect the clinical change over time. It is scored between 0-2 points for shoulder asymmetry, hemithorax asymmetry, scapula asymmetry, and 0-4 points for waist asymmetry. The total score is obtained by adding 1 point to the total scores of the 4 items, and scoring varies between 1 and 12 points. High scores are associated with increased body asymmetry.</description>
