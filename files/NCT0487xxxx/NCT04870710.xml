  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The visual system has increasingly been recognized as an important site of injury in patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia and other psychoses. Visual system alterations manifest as visual&#xD;
      perceptual aberrations, deficits in visual processing, and visual hallucinations. These&#xD;
      visual symptoms are associated with worse symptoms, poorer outcome and resistance to&#xD;
      treatment. A recent study using brain lesion mapping of visual hallucinations and identified&#xD;
      a causal location in the part of the brain that processes visual information (visual cortex).&#xD;
      The association between visual cortex activation and visual hallucinations suggests that this&#xD;
      region could be targeted using noninvasive brain stimulation. Two case studies have found&#xD;
      that brain stimulation to the visual cortex improved visual hallucinations in treatment&#xD;
      resistant patients with psychosis. While promising it is unclear whether these symptom&#xD;
      reductions resulted from activity changes in the visual cortex or not. Here we aim to answer&#xD;
      the question whether noninvasive brain stimulation when optimally targeted to the visual&#xD;
      cortex can improve brain activity, visual processing and visual hallucinations. The knowledge&#xD;
      gained from this study will contribute to the field of vision by providing a marker for&#xD;
      clinical response and by personalizing treatment for patients with psychosis suffering from&#xD;
      visual symptoms. This grant will allow us to set the foundation for a larger more targeted&#xD;
      study utilizing noninvasive brain stimulation to improve visual symptoms in patients with&#xD;
      psychosis.&#xD;

      The visual system has increasingly been recognized as an important site of pathology in&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia and other psychoses. Visual system impairments manifest as visual&#xD;
      perceptual aberrations, deficits in visual processing tasks, and visual hallucinations (VH).&#xD;
      In psychosis spectrum disorders, increased visual aberrations are strongly correlated with&#xD;
      worse hallucinations and delusions. It is also recognized that poorer performance on visual&#xD;
      spatial working memory, visual integration, and velocity discrimination tasks are associated&#xD;
      with greater negative symptoms (a major contributor to disability). VH are common in&#xD;
      psychotic disorders (30-70% prevalence) and can be refractory to existing treatments. VH have&#xD;
      been understudied in psychosis with much of the literature focusing on auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations. Despite the neuroscientific and clinical significance of VH, the brain&#xD;
      regions responsible are less clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional neuroimaging studies have identified neural correlates of VH across multiple brain&#xD;
      regions (lingual, fusiform, cuneus, lateral geniculate nucleus, and occipital cortex) and&#xD;
      support hypotheses that increased visual cortex activity and sensory cortex over-stimulation&#xD;
      generate VH. However, whether these neuroimaging findings represented a cause, consequence or&#xD;
      incidental correlate of VH was unclear until recently. Using a newly validated technique&#xD;
      termed lesion network mapping, researchers demonstrated that focal brain lesions having a&#xD;
      causal role in the development of VH can occur in different brain locations, both inside and&#xD;
      outside sensory pathways, and that these lesions are functionally connected to the lateral&#xD;
      geniculate nucleus, a major relay center for the visual pathway. They also found that 98% of&#xD;
      the subcortical and cortical lesions were connected to the exact same location in the&#xD;
      extrastriate visual cortex. Therefore, the association between extrastriate visual cortex&#xD;
      activation and VH would suggest this region may be optimal for modulation via brain&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One method by which cortical excitability can be altered is through the use of transcranial&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (tES), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique. High definition tES&#xD;
      (HD-tES) is a refined version of tES with improved spatial precision of cortical stimulation.&#xD;
      This involves the application of a weak electrical current (1-2 mA) delivered to the brain&#xD;
      via scalp electrodes. The effects of tES modulate cortical excitability where anodal&#xD;
      stimulation tends to increase (i.e. the resting potential becomes less negative) and cathodal&#xD;
      stimulation tends to decrease the underlying membrane potential (i.e. the resting potential&#xD;
      becomes more negative) (14,15). Studies have shown that tES can modulate visual cortical&#xD;
      function in a polarity-dependent manner, where anodal stimulation can increase and cathodal&#xD;
      stimulation can decrease the amplitude of the N70 component from the visual-evoked potential.&#xD;
      While tES is a promising adjunctive treatment of auditory hallucinations and negative&#xD;
      symptoms in schizophrenia, less is known about its role in treating VH. To date, two cases&#xD;
      have been described where cathodal tES (i.e., outward current flow) over the occipital area&#xD;
      was applied to patients experiencing treatment refractory VH, and this resulted in&#xD;
      symptomatic improvement. Taken together, the recent lesion network mapping identifying the&#xD;
      extrastriate visual cortex as a major source of VH in schizophrenia combined with these two&#xD;
      single-patient case studies suggest that it may be possible to alleviate VH by designing a&#xD;
      tES protocol that targets the extrastriate visual cortex bilaterally. Technological advances&#xD;
      in noninvasive neuromodulation and electrical field modeling further allow us to create a tES&#xD;
      protocol specifically guided by the results of lesion network mapping studies (i.e., using&#xD;
      the exact Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates) with high spatial resolution (i.e.,&#xD;
      using HD-tES).&#xD;
