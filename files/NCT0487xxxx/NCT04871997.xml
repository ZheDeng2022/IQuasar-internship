      A real-world study: Efficacy and safety of Anlotinib for advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer：This study aims to observe and explore the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in&#xD;
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the real world, and to summarize the&#xD;
      treatment experience of a broad population.This study is a non-interventional, prospective,&#xD;
      observational, real-world case study and all registered data are collected from real clinical&#xD;
      practice cases. Adult patients diagnosed as advanced non-small cell lung cancer and treated&#xD;
      with anlotinib were included. At least one tumor lesion has not been subjected to local&#xD;
      treatment such as irradiation in the past, and can be accurately measured, the longest&#xD;
      diameter is ≥10 mm.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and the secondary&#xD;
      endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate&#xD;
      (DCR) and safety.If the last patient reaches the main evaluation index or has intolerable&#xD;
      toxic reaction, the observation will be finished, and the first one will prevail.Through&#xD;
      Electronic Data Capture System (EDC) system, electronic case report form (eCRF) is used to&#xD;
      replace paper-based case report form to collect and manage clinical trial data.&#xD;
