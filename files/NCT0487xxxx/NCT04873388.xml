  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the recent literature is building a remarkable background to answer the many&#xD;
      unknowns related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is absolutely necessary to finalize every&#xD;
      clinical effort to collect data that may be useful, in a short time, to improve our knowledge&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous biomarkers have been evaluated in the recent literature as&#xD;
      being altered in patients with severe forms of COVID-19. Particularly, in the critical care&#xD;
      area, the research of early predictors of mortality is essential for high-flow management of&#xD;
      patients requiring invasive assisted ventilation and requiring invasive and non-invasive&#xD;
      assisted ventilation, hemodynamic support, sometimes extracorporeal support (Extracorporeal&#xD;
      Membrane Oxygenation, ECMO). The coordinated study of different biomarkers, in particular, if&#xD;
      combined with each other, possibly even to constitute a possible score, could guide the&#xD;
      correct allocation of patients between hospital departments and the appropriate management in&#xD;
      intensive care units. appropriate management in intensive care units, as well as providing an&#xD;
      early prognostic indication. prognostic indication. The combination of these biomarkers with&#xD;
      routine clinical and laboratory data may further provide valuable information about their use&#xD;
      in acute care and as progressive acute and as progressive monitoring over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the data of interest on the clinical trend, the evaluation of the respiratory&#xD;
      support modalities, from the administration of oxygen therapy (by nasal cannulae or Venturi&#xD;
      mask, or by high flow system - High Flow Nasal Cannula, HFNC), to CPAP support or by&#xD;
      non-invasive or invasive ventilation, appears of particular importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study will be conducted in sub-intensive as well as intensive care&#xD;
      units, in order to evaluate different types of patients, and their possible evolution over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison between the populations belonging to different areas of intensity of care will&#xD;
      be able to describe the different populations. Data analysis will allow an evaluation of&#xD;
      possible risk factors and prognostic determinants of the severity of the disease and its&#xD;
      infectious complications.&#xD;
