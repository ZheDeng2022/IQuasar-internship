    <textblock>
      This research proposal is a pilot double-blind randomized control trial evaluating the impact&#xD;
      on diagnostic accuracy of a Clinical UltraSound (CUS) teaching for gallbladder assessment&#xD;
      using exclusively healthy volunteers for practical sessions. Classically, a number of 25 to&#xD;
      50 CUS of the gallbladder is reported to achieve competency. Many CUS curricula or guidelines&#xD;
      recommend reporting pathological cases, either a certain amount, either generically, in their&#xD;
      core-ultrasound competency requirements. Using healthy volunteers is rarely meant to verify&#xD;
      the hypothesis that practical sessions based on exclusively normal patterns combined with&#xD;
      presentation of pathological ultrasound loops or images during theoretical sessions, could&#xD;
      further allow reaching diagnostic accuracy requirements in clinical practice. In the present&#xD;
      study, participants will be medical students in their 5th year, naïve to CUS use.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly be distributed between a control group undergoing a standard&#xD;
      practical teaching on models presenting uncomplicated gallstones or normal gallbladder (no&#xD;
      gallstones), and an intervention group undergoing a practical teaching exclusively on models&#xD;
      presenting a normal gallbladder. Participants will be &quot;blinded&quot; to study endpoints as well as&#xD;
      to group allocation. After three days of practical teaching on day 0-10-30, students will be&#xD;
      evaluated on day 60 by 2 external investigators blinded to students group allocation.&#xD;
      Diagnostic accuracy for gallstones will be measured using sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed blinded to students' name using IBM SPSS statistics&#xD;
      26.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). As is classical, the statistical tests will be rejected&#xD;
      whenever the observed p-value is smaller than 0.05. Corrections for multiple testing will be&#xD;
      used. A comparable diagnostic accuracy between groups could further support the use of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers during practical teaching and ease clinical ultrasound curricula. Such a&#xD;
      finding wouldn't however carry away the need for enhancing competencies during clinical&#xD;
      practice or the need for continuing medical education, as for any medical procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Critical care and emergency medicine are both specialties covering all types of&#xD;
      pathologies concerning multiple etiologies and systems. Clinical UltraSound (CUS) curricula&#xD;
      concerning those specialties are accordingly covering a wide range of ultrasound improved&#xD;
      clinical examination. Recently, a questionnaire sent to American medical schools, reporting&#xD;
      84% response rate, enlightened that 55% of the clinical ultrasound course directors are&#xD;
      emergency physicians. This supports the great implication of emergency medicine in CUS&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM) Point of Care UltraSound&#xD;
      (PoCUS) published an evidence-based consensus document for CUS curriculum based on national&#xD;
      and international guidelines. Previously, the Council of Emergency Medicine Residency&#xD;
      Director-Academy of Emergency Ultrasound (CORD-AEUS) consensus established guidelines to&#xD;
      organize CUS training and assess resident competencies. To actual knowledge, although CUS&#xD;
      training programs around the globe support the use of specific training to achieve CUS&#xD;
      introduction in the emergency departments endorsing its use, there are still significant&#xD;
      variations among proposed curricula. The training requirements are mostly described for&#xD;
      core-ultrasound. Generally, core-ultrasound curricula encompass the skill acquisition of&#xD;
      extended-Focused Assessment Sonography for Trauma (e-FAST), Aortic Aneurysm Assessment (AAA),&#xD;
      basic cardiac and lung ultrasound and basic procedural ultrasound. Some include biliary and&#xD;
      urinary tract assessment whereas others consider biliary and urinary tract assessment part of&#xD;
      advanced CUS teaching. Most other specialties however focus their ultrasound teaching on the&#xD;
      field of interest. For instance, urologists learn how to perform an ultrasound assessment of&#xD;
      the urinary tract or the prostate whereas gastroenterologists focus their ultrasound ability&#xD;
      on bowel and biliary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, based on emergency medicine requirements, the CUS training consist of an initial&#xD;
      introduction followed by gaining experience throughout image acquisition, image&#xD;
      interpretation and clinical integration and finally achieving competency. Different&#xD;
      approaches and methods of teaching are available and often a combination of those is&#xD;
      recommended in available curricula description. Many recommend reporting pathological CUS&#xD;
      cases among ultrasound images compeeled in a logbook, either a certain amount (20% to 50%),&#xD;
      either generically, in their core-ultrasound competency requirements. Although its benefit&#xD;
      for emergency medicine clinical practice is substantial and evidence based, the introduction&#xD;
      of CUS in emergency physicians' practice is evidently time consuming possibly due to&#xD;
      theoretical and practical sessions requirements and assessments as well as bedside&#xD;
      supervision. Several curricula recently included CUS to emergency medicine requirements&#xD;
      program and more broadly to medical students' courses. This brings to a large number the need&#xD;
      for CUS bedside teaching combined with other sources of competence achievement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an emergency clinical setting, the use of CUS for hepatobiliary assessment is mostly&#xD;
      centered on inflammation and obstruction. Cholecystitis is known to be, from 95% to 99% of&#xD;
      cases secondary to gallstones. Gallstones are accessible to CUS and, included in the clinical&#xD;
      context, can strengthen the suspicion of cholecystitis. In a systematic review performed in&#xD;
      2011, the pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity were 89.8% (95% confidence&#xD;
      interval (CI) 86.4% to 92.5%) and 88.0% (95% CI 83.7% to 91.4%), respectively for gallstones&#xD;
      detection using EUS. This is consistent with this finding being valuable for clinical&#xD;
      practice. Although some studies supported the number to achieve agreement with expert for&#xD;
      gallbladder assessment to be 25 to 50, a prospective study including 1837 patients from 1999&#xD;
      to 2006, reported the learning curve of emergency physicians for the evaluation of&#xD;
      gallbladder is poorly influenced by the number of bedside examinations. Those considerations&#xD;
      suggest other sources of competency achievement should be evaluated rather than the number of&#xD;
      examinations itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classically, initial CUS introduction uses short lectures combined with demonstration,&#xD;
      &quot;hands-on&quot; skill teaching, simulation sessions, discussions, web-based learning and practical&#xD;
      scanning on volunteers, models and patients. Occasionally, pathological models are difficult&#xD;
      to find and bedside teaching, apart from clinical shift, is exclusively possible on&#xD;
      volunteers presenting a normal pattern. This enlightens the need for studies evaluating the&#xD;
      CUS training pathway using exclusively healthy volunteers compared to the use of pathological&#xD;
      findings during practical sessions. This is strengthen by the introduction of CUS courses&#xD;
      among medical schools. Indeed, unlike residents or physicians, medical students don't have as&#xD;
      much possibility to access practical CUS training on patients presenting pathological&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study is meant to give insights about the CUS skills acquisition to accurately&#xD;
      diagnose gallstones using exclusively training on healthy volunteers after a standardized web&#xD;
      based theoretical teaching about pathological and non-pathological gallbladder CUS. This&#xD;
      could support the use of only healthy volunteers during practical sessions. The teaching of&#xD;
      pathological images recognition could exclusively be done throughout theoretical sessions.&#xD;
      Although this would neither avoid the need for enhancing competencies bedside, neither avoid&#xD;
      continuous logging activity and regular CUS continuing medical education, this could&#xD;
      secondary help CUS teaching by reducing the need for bedside supervision during clinical&#xD;
      shifts. Indeed, to knowledge, bedside supervision is difficult to achieve in some emergency&#xD;
      departments and CUS fellows have trouble to properly fill out a &quot; logbook &quot;. Organizing CUS&#xD;
      teaching around normal pattern recognition associated to a theoretical course presenting&#xD;
      pathological findings could lead to change CUS fellows' assessment. Those could be evaluated&#xD;
      theoretically using pathological ultrasound images or loops and could be evaluated&#xD;
      practically on healthy volunteers. This would avoid compelling a &quot; logbook &quot; which can arise&#xD;
      some ethical discussion about patient consent and use of images even if the latter are&#xD;
      classically anonymized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to scope literature review, no randomized control study has been published&#xD;
      establishing the skills acquisition for gallstones findings. This study being a pilot one, it&#xD;
      will allow to precise the feasibility of a proper randomized control trial and to evaluate&#xD;
      sample size. This study could also be the starting point of randomized control trials&#xD;
      concerning the teaching of other pathological findings such as free fluid, aortic aneurism,&#xD;
      cardiac assessment, hydronephrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Main objectives to evaluate if CUS skills to diagnose gallstones can be acquired by 5th&#xD;
      year medical students naïve to CUS use exclusively throughout practical sessions on healthy&#xD;
      volunteers after a standardized theoretical teaching using a web-based passive video&#xD;
      learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Trial design is a pilot double-blind randomized control trial. 20 participants are&#xD;
      randomly assigned to CG or IG using pre-defined blocks of 10 participants per group.&#xD;
      Consolidation of knowledge and skills' acquisition for gallbladder evaluation using CUS take&#xD;
      place during 3 teaching sessions (day 0-10-30) given by CUS instructors on volunteers.&#xD;
      Evaluation of diagnostic accuracy (day 60) is performed at the end of the 2 months teaching&#xD;
      period by two blinded examiners. The teaching is performed according to an expanding time&#xD;
      interval as supported by a recent review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study members&#xD;
&#xD;
      --&gt; Instructors Instructors are selected from the population of experts in CUS of the&#xD;
      gallbladder in Belgium ; they are invited to participate via e-mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each instructor receives a financial compensation for participating to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instructors are not blinded to participants' allocation. Instructors sign a &quot;non-disclosure&#xD;
      agreement&quot; meaning they cannot give information to a third party during the entire duration&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      --&gt; Volunteers Healthy volunteers are invited to participate by e-mail. Volunteers are&#xD;
      selected using a web-based questionnaire asking for characteristics (age, sex, BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers presenting a pathological gallbladder status (gallstones, sludge), are invited to&#xD;
      participate throughout the consultation of surgery of the &quot;Cliniques Universitaires&#xD;
      Saint-Luc&quot;, before an elective surgery is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers are paired for age (+/- 5 years) and BMI (+/- 1) between groups to avoid selection&#xD;
      bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers are eligible if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between 18 and 70 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed consent for participation and &quot;non-disclosure agreement&quot; 1 obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Underwent a formal ultrasound previous to the study day in order to confirm gallbladder&#xD;
           status (gallstones or sludge yes/no), performed by a CUS expert independent from the&#xD;
           study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not have persistent abdominal pain or cholecystitis symptoms Volunteers are committed&#xD;
           to &quot;non-disclosure agreement&quot; about their gallbladder status during their participation&#xD;
           to the study, except in case of medical consultation for personal matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Examiners Two examiners, blinded to participant allocation, evaluate practical&#xD;
                skills of participants for gallbladder assessment using CUS on day 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examiners are international experts in CUS coming from United Kingdom.&#xD;
