  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ASCAPE (Artificial intelligence Supporting CAncer Patients across Europe) is a collaborative&#xD;
      research project involving 15 partners from 7 countries, including academic medical centers,&#xD;
      SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), research centers and universities, aiming to&#xD;
      leverage the recent advances in Big Data and AI (Artificial Intelligence) to support cancer&#xD;
      patients' Quality of Life (QoL) and health status. Specifically, ASCAPE aims to provide&#xD;
      personalized- and AI-based predictions for QoL issues in breast- and prostate cancer patients&#xD;
      as well as suggest potential interventions to their physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and&#xD;
      innovation programme under grant agreement No 875351.&#xD;
