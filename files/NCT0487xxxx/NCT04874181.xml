      Use of SIlverfit 3d to aid in rehab of stroke patients focusing on their shoulder and knee&#xD;
      strength&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Either 1 of 3 physiotherapists will recruit the patient from NICU if the GCS is 14 - 15.&#xD;
      Silverfit 3D will then be used for 20 minutes each day to train the knee and arm strength&#xD;
      until the patient's discharge from ICU. Baseline muscle strength will be measured and graded&#xD;
      by the physiotherapist using Medical Research Council grading then followed up by the same&#xD;
      physiotherapist on discharge from ICU and on discharge from hospital.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be interviewed on admission by the physiotherapist to find out his/her baseline activities of daily living/strength and limb power. Physiotherapists will assess the patient again on day of discharge to find out how much the patient is able to return to his/her baseline post stroke. This is a descriptive outcome measure as it is only measured by 1 physiotherapist who has seen the patient on admission and then on discharge from hospital.</description>
