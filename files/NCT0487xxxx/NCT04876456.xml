    <textblock>
      The purpose of the CTO-IUSCCC-0752 study is to investigate the use of Cabozantinib for&#xD;
      patients with incurable, refractory germ cell tumors. Patients will be treated until evidence&#xD;
      of disease progression, non-compliance with study protocol, unacceptable major toxicity, at&#xD;
      subject's own request for withdrawal, or if the study closes for any reason.&#xD;
