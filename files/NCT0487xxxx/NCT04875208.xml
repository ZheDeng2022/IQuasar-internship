  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to investigate mediators and moderators at multiple&#xD;
      ecological (individual, family/peer and school/neighborhood levels) and time-scale (micro-&#xD;
      and macro-time) levels in the link between discrimination-related stressors and mental health&#xD;
      among 340 Mexican-origin youth.&#xD;

      The project's long-term goal is to improve the mental health of Mexican-origin youth by&#xD;
      reducing the deleterious effects of racism, &quot;othering,&quot; and negative neighborhood&#xD;
      interactions. Community based collaboration will be used to recruit a sample of 340&#xD;
      Mexican-origin adolescents, mothers, and fathers in Indiana. The inclusion of fathers will be&#xD;
      a valuable contribution to the literature, given the dearth of studies on Latinx&#xD;
      fathers/stepfathers. A combination of annual surveys administered over three waves to parents&#xD;
      and youth (&quot;macro-time&quot;) and a 21-day daily diary (&quot;micro-time&quot;) administered in wave 1 to&#xD;
      youth is employed to assess important questions about how mediating and moderating processes&#xD;
      unfold over time. Specific aims of the project include determination of within-person&#xD;
      discrimination-related stressors that impact youth's mental health outcomes and the&#xD;
      mechanisms of action at both micro- and macro- time levels; identification of protective&#xD;
      factors that could help coping with discrimination related stressors and conditions under&#xD;
      which they work; and elucidating youth, parent, and neighborhood risk factors that moderate&#xD;
      the link between discrimination-related stressors and mental health outcomes in youth. This&#xD;
      research is highly translational in that it will facilitate the development of more&#xD;
      effective, culturally sensitive prevention and intervention strategies for Latinx youth and&#xD;
      their families.&#xD;
