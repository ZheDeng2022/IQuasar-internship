  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 2a, prospective, randomized, double-blind, intra-subject, placebo-controlled, proof of&#xD;
      concept study. Approximately twenty subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment&#xD;
      arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: 2.0 mg/cm OLX10010 biweekly (every two weeks) Arm B: 5.0 mg/cm OLX10010 biweekly&#xD;
      (every two weeks) Each treatment arm will have approximately 10 subjects. Each subject will&#xD;
      receive both active (OLX10010) and control (placebo) treatment post-hypertrophic scar surgery&#xD;
      biweekly (every two weeks) for a total of six doses. Dosing will occur post-surgery on Weeks&#xD;
      2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Post-treatment follow-up visits will occur at Weeks 18 and 24, and a&#xD;
      long-term follow-up visit will occur at Month 12. The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment&#xD;
      Scale (both physician and patient scales), Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale, Vancouver Scar&#xD;
      Scale, and a photograph-based visual analog scale by blinded experts will be completed prior&#xD;
      to scar revision surgery, at Weeks 2, 8, 12, 18, and 24, and at Month 12. The overall opinion&#xD;
      responses on the physician and patient scales of the POSAS at Week 24 will be used for&#xD;
      coprimary endpoint analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total length of the linear hypertrophic scar line will be divided equally for treatment&#xD;
      with OLX10010 and placebo, injected intradermally per centimeter (cm). The OLX10010 end and&#xD;
      placebo end of the scar line will be separated by a 2 cm or greater distance depending on the&#xD;
      scar length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Week 24 visit, all data collected will be cleaned and all data management&#xD;
      activities will be completed. After the database is frozen/locked, the coprimary endpoint&#xD;
      efficacy analysis will be completed. If at least one of the treatment arms are shown to be&#xD;
      appropriate to reduce recurrence of hypertrophic scars, all analyses will be performed. If&#xD;
      the efficacy analysis of Arms A and B indicate the study doses are not as effective as&#xD;
      expected, the sponsor may decide to add a third arm (Arm C) to explore the weekly dosing&#xD;
      regimen. See detailed summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in all study arms will continue in the study until their Month 12 visit. After all&#xD;
      subjects complete that visit, data are collected, and data management activities are&#xD;
      completed, Month 12 data will be analyzed.&#xD;

      receive both active (OLX10010) and control (placebo) treatment post-hypertrophic scar surgery&#xD;
      weekly for a total of 11 doses. Dosing will occur post-surgery on Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,&#xD;
      9, 10, 11, and 12. Post-treatment follow-up visits will occur on Weeks 18 and 24, and a&#xD;
      long-term follow-up visit will occur at Month 12. The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment&#xD;
      Scale (both physician and patient scales), Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale, Vancouver Scar&#xD;
      Scale, and a photograph-based visual analog scale by two blinded independent assessors will&#xD;
      be completed prior to scar revision surgery, at Weeks 2, 8, 12, 18, and 24, and at Month 12.&#xD;
      The overall opinion responses on the physician and patient scales of the POSAS at Week 24&#xD;
      will be used for coprimary endpoint analysis. After all subjects in Arm C complete Week 24,&#xD;
      all data are collected, and all data management activities are completed, a new database&#xD;
      freeze/lock will be performed. Arm C data will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in all study arms will continue in the study until their Month 12 visit. After all&#xD;
      subjects complete that visit, data are collected, and data management activities are&#xD;
      completed, Month 12 data will be analyzed.&#xD;
