  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to demonstrate if there is no increase in the risk of Sars-Cov-2 salivary&#xD;
      carriage 7 days after a concert in the group participating in the event compared to a non&#xD;
      participating group who stayed at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a systematic screening of Sars-Cov-2 within the 3 days before the&#xD;
      event allows to control the risk of transmission and prevent cluster of transmission during&#xD;
      the concert.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before inclusion, the participants will be able to pre-register to the event via a website.&#xD;
      They will get an appointment for an inclusion visit at the Accor Arena (Paris Bercy, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 3 days (from D-3 to D-1), participants with a registration will come to the Accor&#xD;
      Arena to have a rapid Sars-Cov-2 antigen test (results in 15 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the test is positive, the participant will be contacted and managed by the medical team in&#xD;
      charge of the national strategy for positives cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with a negative test will be included and randomized :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two kits with tube for collecting saliva samples (for D0 and D7) will be given to each&#xD;
           participant at this visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People randomized in the experimental group will receive their concert ticket at a later&#xD;
           date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At Day 0, people randomized in the experimental group, will come to the Accor Arena with&#xD;
           their ticket to participate in the concert. At the entrance, they should give their D0&#xD;
           saliva sampling kit. The people randomized in the control group will stay at home and&#xD;
           will send their D0 saliva sample by post mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At Day 7 (±1 day) all the participants must return their D7 saliva sampling kit via post&#xD;
           mail&#xD;
