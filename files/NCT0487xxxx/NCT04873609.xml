  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the disproportionately high risk of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the&#xD;
      baby boomer cohort, population-based screening has been demonstrated cost effective. Compared&#xD;
      to point-of-care testing, however, bulk health messages with coupled lab requisitions&#xD;
      delivered directly to patients meeting screening criteria via patient portals could improve&#xD;
      HCV screening at minimal cost.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Preventative&#xD;
      Services Taskforce (USPSTF) recommend a one-time hepatitis C infection (HCV) screen in&#xD;
      individuals born 1945-65 (baby boomer birth cohort) and in others with risk factors for&#xD;
      infection. National adherence to this Grade B recommendation-carrying the same strength of&#xD;
      evidence as mammography, and screening for depression, alcohol abuse, and type 2 diabetes-is&#xD;
      estimated to be 13.8%. Efforts to increase screening and linkage to HCV care, and also to&#xD;
      understand barriers to screening and linkage are therefore warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such intervention, direct-to-patient messages via electronic medical record (EMR), has&#xD;
      been demonstrated to improve adherence in influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, colon&#xD;
      cancer screening, immunosuppression after transplantation, among others, but has not been&#xD;
      studied as a strategy to improve HCV screening rates within health systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our institution, Stanford Health Care, comprises 86 distinct clinical sites with&#xD;
      approximately 1.25 million outpatient visits per year. All clinical sites are linked with an&#xD;
      EMR (Epic Systems Corp.) and patients are encouraged to opt-in to receive and send&#xD;
      health-related messages through a secure internet and smartphone portal, MyHealth.&#xD;
      Approximately 60% of patients at our institution are enrolled in MyHealth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MyHealth additionally allows bulk-messaging of patients meeting specific characteristics,&#xD;
      e.g. patients due for influenza vaccination. Bulk messages can be coupled with laboratory or&#xD;
      radiology requisitions. Messages are delivered through the online portal, text message,&#xD;
      e-mail, and/or smartphone application notification, depending on patient preference.&#xD;
      Laboratory and radiology results are routed automatically to patients' primary care&#xD;
      physicians for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized study comparing the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      direct-to-patient electronic health message on HCV screening coupled with a lab requisition,&#xD;
      versus HCV screening initiated by primary care clinicians as part of routine clinical care&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
