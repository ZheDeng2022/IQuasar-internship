  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the comorbidities of obesity is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). L-citrulline&#xD;
      is a non-protein amino acid that has shown positive effects on the degree of fat retention&#xD;
      and metabolic profile in NAFLD. The objective is to assess the effect of oral L-citrulline&#xD;
      supplementation on liver function and nonalcoholic fatty liver in adolescents with obesity. A&#xD;
      clinical study will be carried out in 40 adolescents (15-19 years) with obesity, they will be&#xD;
      divided into a control group that will receive a placebo and an experimental group that will&#xD;
      receive 6 g of l-citrulline per day for eight weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that l-citrulline supplementation decreases liver enzymes and the degree&#xD;
      of hepatic steatosis in adolescents with obesity. The aim of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      effect of oral L-citrulline supplementation on liver function and nonalcoholic fatty liver in&#xD;
      adolescents with obesity. A prospective randomized, double-blind clinical study will be&#xD;
      carried out in 40 adolescents (15-19 years) with obesity, they will be divided into a control&#xD;
      group that will receive a placebo (carboxymethyl cellulose) and an experimental group that&#xD;
      will receive 6 g of pure l-citrulline per day per eight weeks. At the beginning and end of&#xD;
      the intervention, anthropometric, biochemical and metabolic data will be evaluated, as well&#xD;
      as tests of function and degree of hepatic steatosis.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention consists of the oral administration of placebo or l-citrulline as follows:&#xD;
Group Placebo: Carboxymethyl cellulose will be used for the placebo group. Four capsules will be taken in the morning before the first meal and four capsules at night before going to sleep for eight weeks.&#xD;
Group Citrulline: a dose of 6 g of citrulline will be used per day, distributed as 3 g (4 capsules) in the morning before the first meal and 3 g (4 capsules) in the evening before sleep, for eight weeks. Each capsule contains 750 mg of pure citrulline.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The selection of which group each adolescent will belong to will be made by randomization by simple lottery by a researcher from the Department of Medical Sciences of the University of Guanajuato who is not involved in the treatment and follow-up of the participants and will be designated to a Placebo group and to the Citrulline group. The participants and the researcher will not know which group each adolescent belongs to.</masking_description>

    <description>The degree of hepatic steatosis will be evaluated by abdominal ultrasound. It will be diagnosed as:&#xD;
Mild, when an increase in echogenicity and hepatomegaly are observed.&#xD;
Moderate, when sound attenuation is added.&#xD;
Severe, when the wall of the portal vessels and the diaphragm are not visible.</description>
