  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TCRT-ESO-A2 is an autologous cell therapy comprised of a subject's T cells stimulated ex vivo&#xD;
      and transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding an affinity enhanced TCR targeting&#xD;
      tumor-associated antigen NY-ESO-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the safety, tolerability, activity, and pharmacokinetics/&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of TCRT-ESO-A2 infusion. A maximum tolerated dose study of TCRT-ESO-A2 in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced malignancies expressing NY-ESO-1 is considered to be an acceptable&#xD;
      risk. Once safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data are available, the&#xD;
      activity of TCRT-ESO-A2 in NY-ESO-1-positive tumors may be explored further.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open-label, multi-site, &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation, study to evaluate the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose, safety and tolerability, of TCRT-ESO-A2 suspension for IV infusion.&#xD;
      Approximately 24 HLA-A*0201-positive subjects with head and neck cancer, hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, synovial sarcoma, and triple-negative breast cancer&#xD;
      expressing NY-ESO-1 who have received at least first-line therapy for their cancer, or which&#xD;
      there is no accepted therapy will be enrolled. Tumor tissue samples will be evaluated and&#xD;
      scored using the NY-ESO-1 IHC assay developed specifically to support this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following screening and enrollment (approximately Days -63 to -36) subjects will undergo&#xD;
      leukapheresis for T cell collection at approximately Day -35 (Figure 3). Harvested cells will&#xD;
      be fractionated, genetically engineered, and expanded ex vivo to produce autologous&#xD;
      TCRT-ESO-A2 TCR-T. Following TCRT-ESO-A2 product release, subjects will receive a 3-day,&#xD;
      non-myeloablative lymphodepletion regimen of fludarabine/cyclophosphamide from approximately&#xD;
      Days -5 to -3 (recommend Wednesday to Friday) to prime the subject for immune re-population.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive their TCRT-ESO-A2 cell product on Day 1 (recommend Monday) as an IV&#xD;
      infusion over approximately 30 minutes. Within 30 minutes after completion of TCRT-ESO-A2&#xD;
      infusion, low dose subcutaneous aldesleukin (rhIL-2) will be administered at 500,000 IU BID&#xD;
      daily for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be divided into three dose groups of three subjects each, with doses&#xD;
      calculated as the number of TCR Vβ8-positive cells (total TCRT-ESO-A2 dose), with an&#xD;
      allowable variance in cell count of ±30%. Escalation to higher doses will be based on the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of the previous cohort evaluated. If dose-limiting toxicity is&#xD;
      observed in one subject at a dose level, up to an additional three dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity-evaluable subjects will be enrolled at that dose level. Subjects will be evaluated&#xD;
      for dose limiting toxicity up to 28 days post-TCRT-ESO-A2 infusion. Prior to increasing the&#xD;
      dose, a cohort management meeting will be held after the final enrolled subject has been&#xD;
      followed for up to 28 days. The decision to increase to the next dose level will be a joint&#xD;
      decision of the clinical site Investigators and Sponsor. At each cohort, there will be at&#xD;
      least 7 days between infusion of each subject in the cohort. Enrollment into a dose level&#xD;
      will be suspended if two of no more than six subjects at a dose level experience&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three dose groups of subjects will be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: 0.3 × 1010 TCRT-ESO-A2 cells* Cohort 2: 1.0 × 1010 TCRT-ESO-A2 cells* Cohort 3: 3.0&#xD;
      × 1010 TCRT-ESO-A2 cells*&#xD;
&#xD;
      * ±30% Subjects will be monitored daily during in-patient hospitalization for 5 days post&#xD;
      dose. Subjects will then visit an out-patient clinic weekly during the Dose Limiting Toxicity&#xD;
      Evaluation Period of 4 weeks and followed at approximately Days 60, 90, and every 3 months&#xD;
      until confirmation of disease progression. Disease monitoring will be conducted by Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging or Computed Tomography scan (as appropriate for disease), during screening&#xD;
      (if recent scans are not available), during lead-in approximately 7 days prior to TCRT-ESO-A2&#xD;
      infusion, at approximately Days 28, 60, 90, and every 3 months until confirmation of disease&#xD;
      progression. If subjects remain clinically stable, confirmation of progression may be&#xD;
      assessed 4- to 8-weeks later. Positron emission tomography scanning may be used as&#xD;
      appropriate as an adjunct. Tumor biopsies will be taken from non-target lesions, if&#xD;
      accessible, at baseline, approximately Days 28, 90, 180, and upon progression.&#xD;
      Ascites/pleural fluid may be collected in addition to biopsies for correlative research&#xD;
      studies if the subject requires paracentesis or pleuracentesis. At progression, long term&#xD;
      follow-up will commence. During long term follow-up, subjects will be followed twice yearly&#xD;
      for up to 5 years post-infusion and then annually for up to 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing of tumor and liquid biopsies may be adjusted as may the timing of other procedures or&#xD;
      safety studies. In addition, up to 150 additional mL of blood may be collected over a&#xD;
      three-month period without amendment of the protocol. Additional safety measures may be&#xD;
      included, and tests may be done at any time if clinically indicated. In addition, if&#xD;
      objective responses are observed in tumors after the safety of each cohort has been&#xD;
      evaluated, up to 12 additional subjects with that tumor type (up to 2 tumor types) may be&#xD;
      enrolled to further explore the tumor response rate in that tumor type.&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Women of non-child bearing potential due to surgical sterilization (at least 6 weeks&#xD;
             following surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy or tubal&#xD;
             ligation) confirmed by medical history or menopause (i.e., no menstrual bleeding for&#xD;
             more than 12 months in a woman aged ≥45 years), OR women of childbearing potential who&#xD;
             test negative for pregnancy at Screening based on serum pregnancy test must be using a&#xD;
             highly effective method of contraception from the time of Screening until the&#xD;
             persistence of TCRT-ESO-A2 is no longer detected by qPCR or up to 15 years. Note:&#xD;
             Highly effective methods of contraception that result in a low failure rate (i.e., &lt;1%&#xD;
             per year) when used consistently and correctly include combined (estrogen and&#xD;
             progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation&#xD;
             (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal), progestogen-only hormonal contraception&#xD;
             associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, or implantable),&#xD;
             intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion,&#xD;
             vasectomized partner, or sexual abstinence. True abstinence, when in line with the&#xD;
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject, is considered a highly effective method&#xD;
             only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period&#xD;
             of study participation and until the persistence of TCRT-ESO-A2 is no longer detected&#xD;
             by qPCR. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
             duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.&#xD;
             Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, and post-ovulation&#xD;
             method) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
