  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective of this study is to compare mean 2-year subsidence of the ACTIS&#xD;
      femoral stem using model-based RSA against published migration patterns for hip stems of a&#xD;
      similar design. Secondary objectives include comparison of migration per surgical approach,&#xD;
      quantifying changes in functional and health status of subjects following surgery, and assess&#xD;
      occurrences of complications and adverse events.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, sequential enrollment trial of patients undergoing primary total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty. Patients will be recruited at three Canadian Centres to receive the ACTIS&#xD;
      femoral hip stem via 3 different surgical approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model-based RSA will identify migration of the implant with respect to the femoral bone&#xD;
      during the first 2 post-operative years. Patient health and functional outcomes will be&#xD;
      recorded at pre- and post-operative intervals to quantify improvement as a result of the&#xD;
      surgery and trajectory of recovery. Adverse events and clinical complications in each study&#xD;
      group will be captured and compared. Select surgical, hospital and rehabilitation data will&#xD;
      be collected to measure health economic outcomes relating to the surgery.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Compare mean 2-year subsidence using model-based RSA (radiostereometric analysis) (mm). The images taken at each time point will be compared with the baseline to assess the change in implant position.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of migration per surgical approach</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison between the 3 approaches (postero-lateral, direct lateral, and direct anterior); measured migration (mm). The images taken at each time point will be compared with the baseline to assess implant migration. Therefore the outcome is change in implant position measured using RSA.</description>

    <measure>Oxford Hip Score (OHS)</measure>

    <description>Evaluate and compare the change from preoperative to 2 years between the study groups timepoints in functional outcomes assessments, patient reported outcome. Each item is scored from 0 to 4, and the items are summated, with lower total scores indicating poorer performance.</description>

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, 6 Weeks, 3 Months, 6 Months, 1 Year and 2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate and compare the change from preoperative to 2 years between the study groups and timepoints. The scores in each section (pain, stiffness and function limitation) are totaled; 5 items for pain (score range 0-20), 2 for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68). Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

    <description>Evaluate and compare the change from preoperative to 2 years between the study groups timepoints in functional outcomes assessments, patient reported outcome. A health state score is obtained based on the responses from 1-5 in each subscale, from which a single index value is calculated representing patients' overall health state. The overall health state range from 0 to 1.0.</description>
