    <intervention_model_description>This is a partially-blinded randomized controlled trial that investigates if NMF-biomarker status has an effect on the effectiveness of systemic treatment with CsA in children with moderate-to-severe AD. It also investigates whether stratification on the NMF biomarker results in an improvement of efficiency in the use of systemic treatment with CsA in the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are registered for patients of all ages, and are together with emollients, the pillars in the basic treatment of atopic dermatitis. In this study, patients in both the intervention groups and control group are treated with daily emollients and a TCS of moderate to high potency if needed. Rescue medication with TCS of higher potency may be prescribed if basic therapy is inadequate in controlling AD symptoms.</description>

    <description>Systemic cyclosporine A (CsA) is an immunosuppressive therapy and is a registered treatment for AD in adults. According to national guidelines, CsA is the first choice for systemic treatment in children with moderate-to-severe AD.&#xD;
For CsA a starting dose of 4-5mg/kg/day is administered orally and then tapered down to 2-3mg/kg/day depending on clinical effect. Two doses will be taken at two fixed times per day. Treatment with systemic CsA will be continued for a total of 6 months.</description>

DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. rm: Active Comparator: Systemic dupilumab Dupilumab (DUPIXENT) is administered as a solution by subdermal injection according to national guidelines, based on age and body weight.</description>
