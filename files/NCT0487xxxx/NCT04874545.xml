  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative hearing loss is a rarely reported phenomenon. However, it occurs more&#xD;
      frequently than most anaesthesiologists suspect. Perioperative hearing impairment is often&#xD;
      subclinical and may go unnoticed unless audiometry is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can be conductive or sensorineural, unilateral or bilateral, and transient or permanent.&#xD;
      Hearing loss has been reported following virtually every type of anaesthetic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hearing mechanism may be less susceptible to acoustic trauma during general anaaesthesia.&#xD;
      But other mechanisms are capable of causing both conductive and sensorineural hearing losses&#xD;
      (SNHL) in the perioperative period. The aetiologies include mechanical, traumatic,&#xD;
      noise-induced, changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, embolism, pharmacologic, and&#xD;
      other miscellaneous causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress may influence central vestibular function in health and disease either directly&#xD;
      through the actions of glucocorticoids (cortisol and corticosterone) on ion channels and&#xD;
      neurotransmission in the brain, or indirectly through the effects of stress-related&#xD;
      neuroactive substances (e.g., histamine, neurosteroids) on these structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The auditory brainstem response (ABR) provides a good estimate of the shape of the behavioral&#xD;
      audiogram [and is thus an extremely useful tool for studying hearing sensitivity as well as&#xD;
      the functionality of the auditory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An awareness of the potential for and the causes of hearing loss during anesthesia may permit&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist to prevent or minimize the risk of significant hearing deficit. The&#xD;
      suggestion that this risk be discussed in the preoperative period with patients who are at&#xD;
      high risk for perioperative hearing loss may be good medical-legal advice. Better&#xD;
      understanding of the incidence, causes, and prognoses for perioperative hearing loss is&#xD;
      essential for the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much Concern has been raised about the effects of anaesthetic drugs on cognition.&#xD;
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction may manifest as impairment in attention, memory, language&#xD;
      or executive functions following surgery, and can persist for weeks, months, or more with&#xD;
      varying severity. Such post-operative cognitive dysfunction can be quite mild and only&#xD;
      diagnosed through psychometric assessment using specific neuropsychological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF THE STUDY The aim of this work is to study the possible deleterious effect of propfol&#xD;
      versus sevoflurane on auditory and cognitive function.&#xD;

      Type and site of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out at Beni-Suef university hospital, after approval by the&#xD;
      department of Anaesthesiology, the local ethics and research committee and other involved&#xD;
      departments, faculty of medicine, Beni-Suef University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Date of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed starting from 1st of January 2021&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and population: This is a prospective randomized study that will be carried out&#xD;
      on patients subjected to general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned into one of two equal groups Randomization will be carried&#xD;
      out using a closed opaque envelope technique with the anesthetist will pick up a sealed&#xD;
      envelope which contains a paper with the name of the group to which the patient will be&#xD;
      randomized is written. Whichever the group written on the paper, the patient will be&#xD;
      scheduled to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A routine preoperative check-up will be performed. Routine hematological and biochemical&#xD;
           testing, along with electrocardiograms will be performed for patients. The procedure&#xD;
           will be explained to the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On arrival to the operating theatre, 18 G intravenous cannula will be inserted and IV&#xD;
           crystalloid fluids will be infused, the monitor will be attached to the patients to take&#xD;
           preoperative readings of heart rate, non-invasive arterial blood pressure, SpO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be randomly divided to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction of anesthesia will be done by injecting fentanyl 2 μg/kg, propofol1.5-2.5&#xD;
           mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg for muscle relaxation. Laryngoscopy and endotracheal&#xD;
           intubation will be performed using oral cuffed tube lubricated with lidocaine jelly 2 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance of anaesthesia will be done using Propofol total intravenous anesthesia&#xD;
           (TIVA) 6-12 mg/ kg/h by syringe pump, 100 % O2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction of anesthesia will be done by injecting fentanyl 2 μg/kg, propofol1.5-2.5&#xD;
           mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg for muscle relaxation. Laryngoscopy and endotracheal&#xD;
           intubation will be performed using oral cuffed tube lubricated with lidocaine jelly 2 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance of anaesthesia will be done using sevoflorane1.5-2%, 100 % O2. The&#xD;
           concentrations of propofol and sevoflorane will be adjusted according to patient's vital&#xD;
           sign&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilation in both groups will be controlled artificially to maintain an end-tidal partial&#xD;
      pressure of carbon dioxide of 33-35 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, neuromuscular blockade will be reversed with IV neostigmine 0.04mg/kg&#xD;
      and atropine 0.02 mg/kg, the trachea will be extubated when the patient respond to commands,&#xD;
      all patients will be transferred to PACU, where they receive oxygen via face mask 3-4 L/min&#xD;
      and will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be evaluated and recorded by senior anesthesiologist unaware of&#xD;
      the study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data: age and sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Operation type.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Duration of anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hemodynamics of the patients: Mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate, SPO2, End&#xD;
           tidal CO2: will be continuously monitored and recorded every 15 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included patients will be subjected to the following (preoperative and 1 week&#xD;
      postoperative):&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Cognitive assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive functions for the patients will be assessed using the following psychometric tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Paired Associate Learning test (PALT) (9):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Aim: to assess auditory verbal memory. The test uses the concept of semantic cueing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Administration and scoring: In this test, the examiner says ten associated pairs in&#xD;
                front of the candidate. These pairs contain 6 compatible semantically related pairs&#xD;
                and 4 incompatible semantically unrelated pairs. After one minute, the candidate is&#xD;
                given the first word of the pairs and is asked to recall the second word. The test&#xD;
                is repeated three times. Each correct compatible pair takes a score 0.5, while each&#xD;
                correct incompatible pair takes a score 1. The total score ranges from 0 to 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) ( 10):&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Aim: Paced Auditory Serial Addition test is used for assessment of attention and&#xD;
           auditory working memory&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Administration and scoring: In this test, a series of 61 single digit numbers are&#xD;
           spoken on an audiotape (or CD) at a rate of one every 3 seconds. The subject is asked to&#xD;
           add each number to the one immediately preceding it and not to give a running total. The&#xD;
           subject has to report the sum orally. Total score is the sum of correct responses and it&#xD;
           ranges from 0 to 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Audiological assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Audiological evaluation: tonal audiometry in the frequency range 0.25 - 8 kHz. Using&#xD;
           orbiter 922 in a sound treated room with a TDH 39 earphones. Speech audiometry including&#xD;
           speech reception threshold (SRT) using arabic spondee words, (11) and word&#xD;
           discrimination score (WDS), using, arabic phonetically balanced (PB) words. (11)&#xD;
           Immittancemetry: will be done using AD 629 Interacoustic, calibrated according to the&#xD;
           ISO standard, using single-component, single-frequency tympanometry with a probe tone of&#xD;
           226 Hz. Testing of the acoustic reflex threshold, for ipsilateral and contralateral&#xD;
           elicited reflexes, using pure tones at 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs): will be performed using (Interacoustic&#xD;
           Eclipse ''EP25''). The reference electrodes will be placed on the right(A2) and left&#xD;
           (Al) mastoids, the active is on the scalp at the vertex (Fz position of the 10-20&#xD;
           International System of EEG electrode placement) and the ground electrode is on the&#xD;
           lower mid-frontal area (Fpz position). Ag/AgCl electrodes filled with conductive paste&#xD;
           will be fixed to skin that will be abraded with a skin prepping gel. Electrode&#xD;
           impedances will be less than 5 kΩ, and inter-electrode impedances will be less than 2&#xD;
           kΩ. The subject should be in relaxed state. Click is presented through TDH39 headphones.&#xD;
           Click will be presented at a rate of 21.1 stimuli per second in rarefaction polarity at&#xD;
           intensity of 80 dBHL. Averaged potentials to 1200 clicks will be obtained. Two&#xD;
           recordings will be obtained to ensure the replicability of the waveforms. The latencies&#xD;
           of waves I, III, V and interpeak latencies I-V, I- III, III-V (IPLs) will be studied&#xD;
           with BAEPs.&#xD;
