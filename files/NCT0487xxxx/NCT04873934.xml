      The purpose of this study is to study the effectiveness of implementation of a systematic&#xD;
      LDL-C management pathway including treatment with inclisiran in participants who have&#xD;
      experienced a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and have an increased LDL-cholesterol (≥70&#xD;
      mg/dL) despite being treated with a statin drug,&#xD;

             ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant cardiac arrhythmia within 3 months prior to randomization that is not&#xD;
             controlled by medication or via ablation at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe concomitant non-cardiovascular disease that carries the risk of reducing life&#xD;
             expectancy to less than 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with other investigational products or devices within 30 days or five&#xD;
             half˗lives of the screening visit, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;

             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous or current treatment (within 90 days of screening) with monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
             directed towards PCSK9.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurrent ACS event within 2 weeks prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coronary angiography and revascularization procedure (percutaneous coronary&#xD;
             intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery) performed within&#xD;
             2 weeks prior to the randomization visit or planned after randomization.&#xD;
