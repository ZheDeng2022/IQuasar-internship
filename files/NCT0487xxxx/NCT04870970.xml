  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of various tobacco products (including&#xD;
      but not limited to combustible cigarettes, medicinal nicotine, electronic cigarettes, and&#xD;
      smokeless tobacco) on cutaneous wound healing. There will also be a non- smoking control&#xD;
      group. This study will be designed as a pilot study. The majority of individuals will be&#xD;
      recruited from ongoing studies at the University of Minnesota - Tobacco Research Programs.&#xD;

      Participants will be recruited from ongoing studies will some recruitment of tobacco users&#xD;
      and non-smoking controls outside of ongoing studies. In this prospective, cohort study of&#xD;
      various tobacco users and non-smokers, a punch biopsy model of wound healing will be used to&#xD;
      determine the effects of various tobacco products on inflammatory response and oxidative&#xD;
      stress response to wounding:&#xD;

    <description>Cutaneous temperature is measured using in infrared thermographic camera (FLIR T460 Infrared Thermal Imaging Camera, FLIR Systems, Inc., Wilsonville, OR). Images will be analyzed using a camera-specific software (FLIR Tools) that interrogates cutaneous temperature points of the image. The units are software-determined, arbitrary units that are standardized within the FLIR imaging system but do not correspond to standard units of measure.</description>
