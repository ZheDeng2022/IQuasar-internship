      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have an increased risk of developing plexiform&#xD;
      neurofibromas (PNs). PNs are tumors that form in the tissue. They can form anywhere in the&#xD;
      body. They can become visible and cause deformations. Researchers want to see if selumetinib&#xD;
      changes how PNs look in people with NF1. They also want to test a rating system for the&#xD;
      visibility of these tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if treatment with selumetinib can improve the appearance of visible PNs in people with&#xD;
      NF1, as determined by people who are/are not familiar with NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with NF1 who have one or more visible PNs and have been enrolled in study 11C0161 or&#xD;
      08C0079. Clinicians and non-clinicians with and without experience in NF1 are also needed to&#xD;
      serve as raters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are people with NF1 who had photos taken on study 11C0161 or 08C0079. Raters are&#xD;
      people who will evaluate the PNs in the photos. They will rate the tumors on a scale from 1&#xD;
      to 10, from less to most visible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants medical records will be reviewed. Their photos will be shown to 28 raters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raters will fill out a survey about their demographics, place of work, and if they are&#xD;
      familiar with NF1. They will view sample photos to learn how PNs look and how to rate PNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raters will view photos of PNs taken before and after selumetinib treatment. They will also&#xD;
      view photos of PNs that were not treated. They will rate PNs for up to 40 participants. They&#xD;
      will have 1-2 sessions. Each session will last 1 hour....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50% of subjects with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) will develop histologically benign&#xD;
      plexiform neurofibromas (PN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common morbidities associated with PN is a disfigurement that has the&#xD;
      potential to pose formidable obstacles to the medical and psychosocial well-being of subjects&#xD;
      with NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2 trial of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib for inoperable PN (NCT01362803) have shown&#xD;
      volumetric shrinkage of PN in approximately 74% of subjects with at least one PN morbidity,&#xD;
      with most of the responsive tumors decreasing in size by 20-50% volume from baseline. Both&#xD;
      trials have completed enrollment and primary study objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this selumetinib trial, standardized photography of visible PN was performed over time to&#xD;
      assess for changes in disfigurement over time. This trial did not include criteria to measure&#xD;
      changes in disfigurement and no validated criteria for measurement of PN-related&#xD;
      disfigurement exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We developed a scale to rate the extent of a disfigurement from NF1 PN and will apply this&#xD;
      scale to photographs obtained on the phase II selumetinib trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if selumetinib treatment is associated with improvement in PN-related&#xD;
      disfigurement, as determined by raters reviewing photographs before treatment and just prior&#xD;
      to cycle 13 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four groups of adult raters to rate disfigurement who are not directly involved in the&#xD;
      conduct of the selumetinib treatment study (NCT01362803) and can read and write in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographs of consenting individuals with PN, who may or may not have received selumetinib&#xD;
      will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raters will be presented pre and post treatment photographs of persons who received&#xD;
      selumetinib as well as control photographs of persons not receiving selumetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each rater is presented with the same set of photographs though placement and order may&#xD;
      differ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each rater will look at photographs of each individual with PN for at least 10 seconds, then&#xD;
      with photos still visible, raters will verbally answer a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rater will be asked questions at the end of the study to assess the feasibility of the&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each cohort of raters, for each subject s slide set evaluated at a time point, the mean of&#xD;
      the raters scores for each subject will be formed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each person with PN that received selumetinib, the paired difference between baseline and&#xD;
      pre-cycle 13 of these mean scores will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the full set of approximately 35 paired scores, the difference will be assessed for&#xD;
      statistical importance by means of a paired t-test, or a Wilcoxon signed rank test.&#xD;
