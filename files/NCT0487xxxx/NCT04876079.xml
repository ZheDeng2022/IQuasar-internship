  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to guidelines, when a mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia occurs (capillary blood glucose&#xD;
      &lt; 4.0 mmol/L), 15-20g of rapidly absorbed carbohydrates should be ingested. Patients should&#xD;
      re-test and re-ingest 15-20g carbohydrates every 15 minutes until they recover from&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. These recommendations were principally based on two studies conducted in the&#xD;
      80s before the introduction of intensive insulin therapy. In practice, only 32-50% of&#xD;
      patients follow the current guidelines. In addition, recent studies suggest that under&#xD;
      current intensive insulin therapies, an initial correction with 15g of oral glucose may be&#xD;
      insufficient to rapidly correct mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia. With the development and&#xD;
      increasing usage of newer glucose monitoring technologies, the community is witnessing a&#xD;
      shift in hypoglycemia management, from a reactive to a proactive approach (e.g., prevent&#xD;
      imminent episodes rather than treating established episodes).&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be admitted at the research center at 7:00 after an overnight fast. A venous catheter will be inserted into an arm vein for blood sampling purposes. A subcutaneous insulin bolus will be administered to bring plasma glucose to the glycemic threshold. Oral carbohydrates (16g) will be given when plasma glucose levels are at the target threshold. Sixty minutes after carbohydrates consumption, a standardized meal will be provided and participants will be discharged 90 minutes after the meal.</description>
