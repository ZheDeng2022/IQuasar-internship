  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute heart failure current management turns out to be a relative failure considering its&#xD;
      elevated economical and human costs and the poor results obtained in terms of disease&#xD;
      outcome. Indeed this disease remains associated with a high rate of early re-hospitalizations&#xD;
      and low adherence to therapeutic recommended settings and doses. Moreover, extra&#xD;
      cardiological follow-up such as in social, geriatric or vaccination fields remain low&#xD;
      compared to real needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current recommendations incite health professionals to better define care pathways and to&#xD;
      rationalize resources. Guidelines toward creation of hospitalization alternatives or&#xD;
      limitation of time spent in hospital are given. In the same time, lack of cardiologic care&#xD;
      management within heart failure patient care pathway is associated to poor prognosis and&#xD;
      medical desertification as well as resource concentration on important health centers&#xD;
      exacerbate this phenomenon. Innovative projects are then needed to improve patient care&#xD;
      pathways, to open up areas without specialized health professionals and to rationalize care&#xD;
      management by encouraging communication and skill exchange between hospitals and private&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIL-EAS ic projet aims to compare a conventional care pathway in hospital with a follow up&#xD;
      defined according to High Authority of Health recommendations to an organized care pathway&#xD;
      favoring a short hospitalization (maximum of 4 working days) with early transition, when&#xD;
      possible, to a medical and paramedical home care management with an approximately 10 day long&#xD;
      combined follow up between hospital and private practices. This second care pathway should&#xD;
      help to optimize therapeutics in home living conditions.&#xD;

      Patients included in the study will be followed up for 6 months with one phone contact one&#xD;
      month after hospital discharge, a second one two months later and one consultation 6 months&#xD;

    <measure>FIL-EAS ic care pathway safety non inferiority</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety non inferiority will be assessed by comparing the proportion of patients deceased or with unplanned re-hospitalizations for heart failure within the 6 months following randomization between FIL-EAS ic care pathway and conventional hospitalization.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FIL-EAS ic care pathway safety superiority</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety superiority will be assessed by comparing the proportion of patients deceased or with unplanned re-hospitalizations for heart failure within the 6 months following randomization between FIL-EAS ic care pathway and conventional hospitalization.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life assessed by EQ-5D questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Scores obtained after EQ-5D questionnaire completion will be collected during inclusion and research end visit. Evolution between these two scores will be compared between FIL-EAS ic care pathway and conventional hospitalization. EQ-5D questionnaire assess through 5 questions patient mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels : no problems, slight, moderate, severe and finally extreme problems. The patient is asked to tick the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The questionnaire records also patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale going from 0 to 100. 0 corresponds to 'The worst health you can imagine' and 100 to 'The best health you can imagine'.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction assessed by QSH-37 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At the moment of patient initial discharge, up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scores obtained after QSH-37 questionnaire completion will be collected during the visit performed at the end of initial hospitalization and compared between FIL-EAS ic care pathway and conventional hospitalization. The QSH-37 is composed of 37 questions about care management throughout patient hospitalization from the admission until patient's discharge and concerns following elements : relation with professionals (doctors, nurses, housekeepers), response delays, cleanliness, food and room equipment. For each item, possible answers go from &quot;better than desired&quot; to &quot;extremely less than desired&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative number of days spent in hospital</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative number of days spent in hospital within the 6 months following randomization will be compared between FIL-EAS ic care pathway and conventional hospitalization. In this calculation will be taken into account hospitalizations for acute care, hospitalizations for serious illnesses during their acute phases, mental health activities and non-ambulatory follow-up care and rehabilitation unit stays.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact on medical recommendation compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of prescription with percentage of recommended dose of heart failure treatments will be collected and compared between the two groups at initial hospitalization discharge and 6 months after. Rate of influenza, pneumococcal and Covid-19 vaccination, percentage of home therapeutic education use, percentage of ambulatory cardiovascular re-education use and rate of acute renal insufficiency occurrence during initial hospitalization will also be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Geriatric evolution throughout care pathway</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Scores obtained at 5 questionnaires will be collected during inclusion visit and research end visit. The evolution of these scores between these two time points will be compared between FIL-EAS ic care pathway and conventional hospitalization. These 5 questionnaires are : ADL (Activities of Daily Leaving), IADL(Instrumental Activities of Daily Leaving)-LAWTON, MNA (Mini Nutritional Assessment), mini GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale) and Dubois 5 words test. The two first asses the ability to perform daily activities. The third one aims at detecting malnutrition cases and is composed of 18 questions. Mini GDS, composed of 4 questions, detects depression cases and finally Dubois 5 words test is a tool evaluating patient cognitive functions. Besides these questionnaires, percentage of geriatric consultation occurrence throughout study participation will be compared between the two care pathways.</description>
