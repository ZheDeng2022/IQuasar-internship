  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 4 study in which&#xD;
      eligible patients with RADIOLOGICALLY ISOLATED SYNDROME (RIS) (as defined by meeting 2017&#xD;
      McDonald criteria for DIS) will be randomized 1:1 to receive ocrelizumab treatment or placebo&#xD;
      (standard of care).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the treatment effect of ocrelizumab compared with&#xD;
      placebo on clinical and radiological outcomes in patients with RIS (i.e., asymptomatic CNS&#xD;
      lesions fulfilling the 2017 McDonald criteria for DIS), as well as neuroimaging, serologic,&#xD;
      immunologic and other exploratory biomarkers of MS disease biology in order to improve the&#xD;
      understanding of B cell biology in early disease pathophysiology, characterize the emergence&#xD;
      of CNS autoimmunity, and the mechanism of action of ocrelizumab in this population.&#xD;
