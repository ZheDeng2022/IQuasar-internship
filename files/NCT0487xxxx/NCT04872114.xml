  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of targeted renal sympathetic denervation using SyMapCath&#xD;
      I™ in patients on hemodialysis with pharmacotherapy and uncontrolled hypertension for at&#xD;
      least 6 months, then after standardized antihypertensive drug therapy (at least two drugs)&#xD;
      for at least 28 days, office systolic blood pressure (BP) is still ≥ 150mmHg, ≤180mmHg.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, open-label, self controlled case series trial, in which&#xD;
      patients on maintenance hemodialysis are diagnosed with essential hypertension with at least&#xD;
      six months of disease history and pharmacotherapy however their blood pressure still cannot&#xD;
      be controlled. The patients will be informed, consent and get into a screening process.&#xD;
      During the screening period patients will receive a standardized antihypertensive drug&#xD;
      treatment for at least 28 days and office BP is still ≥ 150mmHg, ≤180mmHg, and meet the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. These patients will conduct renal artery angiography&#xD;
      followed by renal sympathetic nerve denvervation (30 patients). Patients with office BP which&#xD;
      is not achieved ideal level (&lt;140 mmHg) will titrate doses of classes of antihypertensive&#xD;
      drugs according to a predefined standardized medication regimen until their office BP &lt;140&#xD;
      mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed at 7 days after the procedure or at discharge from hospital, 1&#xD;
      month, 3 months and 6 months. Blood samples will be collected for drug tests to determine&#xD;
      drug compliance of a patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collecting/management/statistical analysis and laboratory tests will be performed by&#xD;
      independent, qualified organizations. Independent DSMB/CEC are formed and responsible for&#xD;
      assessments of protocol deviations and natures of SAEs.&#xD;
