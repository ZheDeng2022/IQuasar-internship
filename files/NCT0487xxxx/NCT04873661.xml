  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer often suffer from a symptom cluster, including pain, fatigue, sleep&#xD;
      difficulties, emotional distress and cognitive impairments. In oncology settings, there is a&#xD;
      growing interest in &quot;mind-body&quot; intervention, to relieve them in a non-pharmacological way.&#xD;
      Hypnosis and meditation are two modified state of consciousness shown to positively this&#xD;
      symptom cluster. Cognitive trance is also a modified state of consciousness, but is induced&#xD;
      by body movements and/or vocalizations. Subjective reports of experts in cognitive trance&#xD;
      showed a modification of self, emotion regulation, pain perception, attention and&#xD;
      concentration. However, we still need to develop studies to better characterise this&#xD;
      particular state of consciousness and its clinical applications. Our randomized-controlled&#xD;
      trial aims at comparing both interventions in terms of (1) benefits on cancer patients'&#xD;
      quality of life (pain, fatigue, sleep, distress, cognitive impairments), (2)&#xD;
      phenomenological/subjective experiences and neurophysiological correlates, and (3) mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in patients' responsiveness, based on the biopsychosocial model of hypnosis.&#xD;

    <description>In the hypnosis-based intervention, patients (in groups of approximately 10 participants) will participate in 8 weekly sessions (2 hours each) during which they will benefit from guided hypnosis exercises, and learn how to implement self-hypnosis. They will also receive a CD with hypnosis exercises for home practice. At-home practice is encouraged between sessions.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The cognitive trance-based intervention will consist of a two-day workshop in groups of approximately 10 participants, where they will learn how to induce the cognitive trance, with the use of different sound-loops that can induce trance in untrained people in a safe way. After two weeks of home practice, participants will redo a two-day consolidation training. At-home practice is encouraged between sessions.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The meditation-based intervention will consist of 8 weekly sessions (2h45 each) in groups of approximately 10 participants, as well as half a day of intensive practice between the fifth and the sixth session. Participants will learn how to implement self-compassion meditation, through practical exercises proposed during the sessions. At-home practice is encouraged between sessions.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will not receive any intervention during the whole duration of the study. They will be assessed at the same times and in the same ways than the 3 experimental groups. After the study, they will have the opportunity to participe in one of the 3 interventions if they want to.</description>
