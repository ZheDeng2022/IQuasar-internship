  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-centre, single-arm, open-label, interventional study with a non-marketed&#xD;
      medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to assess the efficacy of the keepMED PAP device on&#xD;
      modification of respiratory characteristics in patients with OSA at one therapy night in a&#xD;
      sleep lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondarily, the safety of the use of the device in this setting is assessed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes a baseline visit, a habituation night, and a therapy night. Both nights&#xD;
      will be undertaken in the sleep lab under identical conditions and will include the keepMED&#xD;
      PAP therapy activated in parallel to polysomnography (PSG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline diagnostic PSG, performed within one month prior to enrollment to the study, will be&#xD;
      used to assess the device efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis to re-estimate the sample size will be performed after availability of&#xD;
      data of 50% enrolled and treated study patients. The sample size will be re-estimated based&#xD;
      on the observed changes of AHI in the interim analysis.&#xD;

    <description>The keepMED PAP device is an automatic, wearable positive airway pressure device indicated for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. A therapeutic pressure is delivered to the patient upper airway through a nasal interface. It is similar to other marketed positive airway pressure devices with respect to its fundamental use of positive airway pressure for the treatment of sleep apnea as well as with regard to its functional components and accessories (e.g., a PAP unit, a mask/nasal interface, an air filter, tubing, etc.).</description>
