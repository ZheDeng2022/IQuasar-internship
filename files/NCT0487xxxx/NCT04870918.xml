  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Heart failure (HF) is considered an epidemic with high morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      that imposes limitations on affected individuals, decreases the quality of life, restricts&#xD;
      social life and makes it difficult to carry out daily activities including work. Almost 50%&#xD;
      of diagnosed patients are readmitted in less than 90 days after discharge. Therefore,&#xD;
      rehospitalization is considered as a predictive cause of the increased risk of intrahospital&#xD;
      death in patients hospitalized with HF due to underlying disease. Related to chronic&#xD;
      diseases, self-care is essential in maintaining physical and psychological well-being because&#xD;
      it corroborates the success of the treatment. The patient's observational and resolving&#xD;
      capacity is necessary in view of the appearance of signs and symptoms that would be postponed&#xD;
      or alienated and would end up in hospital. Objective: To verify whether an intervention&#xD;
      focused on self-care reduces the number of readmissions, improves quality of life and&#xD;
      provides greater post-traumatic growth in patients with HF. Method: Randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial, parallel by intention to treat, with blinding for evaluation of outcomes. Adult&#xD;
      patients who were admitted to a Hospital in the Serra Gaúcha and who were identified as&#xD;
      having HF by the attending physician will be included. Upon discharge, patients will leave&#xD;
      the hospital with a date and time to return to the HF Ambulatory. In the first consultation,&#xD;
      patients will be invited to participate in the study and will answer a nursing screening&#xD;
      instrument and the following instruments: WHOQOL-BREF and ICPT (respectively, quality of life&#xD;
      and post-traumatic growth). In order of date and time when signing the informed consent form,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized in 1: 1. From the second consultation, the intervention group&#xD;
      will be followed up for guidance on the disease and treatment, totaling 12 sessions in 6&#xD;
      months. The control group will go through medical consultations as instructed by the doctor&#xD;
      and will not receive intervention for health education by the nurse. After the end of the&#xD;
      treatment, the patients will be followed in order to verify the occurrence of new&#xD;
      hospitalizations in 6 months and in 1 year. At the end of 1 year the instruments will be&#xD;
      replicated. Results: It is expected to enable the patient to remain free of the symptoms of&#xD;
      the disease, following the prescribed treatment and being able to recognize any changes that&#xD;
      signal an aggravation of the disease. It is hoped that the intervention in health education&#xD;
      can decrease the rate of rehospitalization of patients, improve the quality of life and&#xD;
      provide greater post-traumatic growth in patients with HF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients (≥ or equal to 18 years old), who were admitted to any ward or intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) for the cardiology team, and who have been identified as having HF will be&#xD;
      included. Octogenarians and / or with communication barriers will be excluded (due to the&#xD;
      difficulty of self-management of signs and symptoms, not in line with the objective to be&#xD;
      studied) and still not accept to participate in the study. Upon discharge, patients with HF&#xD;
      will leave the hospital with a date and time to return to the HF outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the first medical consultation, patients will complete a screening instrument&#xD;
      (Appendix A) that contains information about: age; sex; breed; origin (city); inpatient for&#xD;
      the cardiology team; length of hospital stay; cause of hospitalization; laboratory values&#xD;
      (urea and creatinine); echocardiographic data up to 1 year before admission: left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (LVEF); associated comorbidities, medications for continuous use, daily&#xD;
      practices related to physical exercise, sodium intake, smoking, body weight, classification&#xD;
      according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA), and a brief report on its understanding&#xD;
      of the disease (HF) and its strategic control of warning signs and symptoms; After filling in&#xD;
      these data, patients will be invited to participate in the study. Those who accept it,&#xD;
      signing the IC (Annex B), will answer the following instruments: WHOQOL-BREF and ICPT. In&#xD;
      order of date and time when signing the informed consent form, patients will be randomized in&#xD;
      1: 1, with odd numbers designated for treatment A (intervention for self-care) and even&#xD;
      numbers designated for treatment B conventional treatment 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the second consultation, patients will be treated differently:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: The control group will undergo medical consultations as instructed by the&#xD;
      attending physician and will not receive intervention for health education by the nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, health education will be carried out by the nurse, explaining the importance of daily&#xD;
      body weight control, inspecting the ankles for swelling, preventing respiratory diseases (flu&#xD;
      vaccine), eating low-salt foods, control of the amount of liquid ingested, the need to follow&#xD;
      the schedule and the correct dose of the prescribed drugs. In the third consultation, the&#xD;
      patient will be evaluated regarding follow-up with the correct diet, intake of controlled&#xD;
      fluids, consistency with the use of medications (explaining the purpose of each). Check with&#xD;
      the patient his ability to remain free of the symptoms of the disease, the follow-up of the&#xD;
      treatment, if he recognizes any change that signals an aggravation of the disease (explaining&#xD;
      about the dangerous signs and symptoms that must be observed by the patient). From the fourth&#xD;
      consultation, an explanatory brochure will be delivered which denotes the signs and symptoms&#xD;
      that should be observed and when to seek outpatient service in order to avoid an aggravation&#xD;
      of the disease by postponing an apparent symptom. Guidance will be given in relation to&#xD;
      quality of life, changes in lifestyle, investigating the patient's support network and&#xD;
      internal changes in relation to their view of life and spirituality from the diagnosis of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consultations will be individual, weekly (Wednesdays), the others, therefore, will be&#xD;
      biweekly, extending to the 30/30 days the following, individually in order to observe the&#xD;
      difficulties and doubts of each patient. Counting the meetings in a total of 12 in the first&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the treatment, the patients will be followed in order to verify the&#xD;
      occurrence of new hospitalizations in 6 months and in 1 year. At the end of 12 months, the&#xD;
      instruments will be replicated.WHOQOL_BREF: The WHOQOL-BREF consists of 26 questions whose&#xD;
      answers follow a Likert scale (from 1 to 5, the higher the score the better the quality of&#xD;
      life). Questions 1 and 2 deal with general quality of life. Apart from these two questions (1&#xD;
      and 2), the instrument has 24 more questions which make up 4 domains which are: PHYSICAL,&#xD;
      PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS and ENVIRONMENT25. (Annex C) Post-Traumatic Growth&#xD;
      Inventory (ICPT): Post-traumatic growth consists of the idea that when experiencing an&#xD;
      adverse situation, such as becoming ill or worsening health conditions, the person can&#xD;
      positively change the way they see and relate with the world. (ICPT) is a self-report scale&#xD;
      that evaluates 5 domains, being: Relationship with others (7 items, ex: &quot;I have a clearer&#xD;
      idea that I can count on people in times of difficulty&quot;); New possibilities (5 items, ex: &quot;I&#xD;
      developed new interests&quot;); Personal Change (4 items, ex: &quot;I know I can handle difficulties&#xD;
      better&quot;), Spiritual Change (2 items, ex: &quot;I have a better understanding of spiritual issues&quot;)&#xD;
      and Greater appreciation of life (3 items, ex: &quot; I get to enjoy each day better &quot;). The&#xD;
      responses follow a Likert scale (from 0 to 5, from &quot;I did not experience this change ...&quot; to&#xD;
      &quot;I completely experienced this change as a result of the event&quot; 26) (Annex D)&#xD;
