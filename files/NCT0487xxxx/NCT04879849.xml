  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, people with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple-negative breast cancer&#xD;
      (TNBC) and squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) will be treated with TAK-676&#xD;
      and pembrolizumab following radiotherapy. The main aims of this study are to check if people&#xD;
      are getting side effects from these combined treatments and how much TAK-676 people with&#xD;
      these cancers can receive without getting side effects from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive radiotherapy, then at least 40 hours later will receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab followed by TAK-676 slowly through a vein (infusion). Participants will receive&#xD;
      an infusion of pembrolizumab at the same dose every 3 weeks. Different small groups of&#xD;
      participants will receive lower to higher doses of TAK-676 on specific days of a 21-day&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-676. This study will evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and preliminary antitumor activity of TAK-676 with pembrolizumab following&#xD;
      radiation therapy in the treatment of advanced NSCLC, TNBC, or SCCHN that has progressed on&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) and will estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and determine&#xD;
      the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 46 participants. Participants will be assigned to dose&#xD;
      escalating cohorts based on Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design. The starting dose of&#xD;
      TAK-676 will be 0.2 mg and the subsequent dosing will be initiated based on the available&#xD;
      safety and tolerability data from the previous cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. There will be many clinic&#xD;
      visits. The number of visits will depend on the number of cycles of treatment. Participants&#xD;
      will attend an end of treatment (EOT) visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of study&#xD;
      drug or before the start of subsequent systemic anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
      They might continue to have check-ups every 12 weeks if they left the study for a reason&#xD;
      apart from their cancer getting worse.&#xD;
