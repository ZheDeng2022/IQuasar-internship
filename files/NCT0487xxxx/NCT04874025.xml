  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormone therapy is the primary treatment option for patients with HR+ HER2- breast cancer.&#xD;
      Despite its activity, hormone therapy is associated with initial, or more frequently&#xD;
      acquired, resistance after exposure to one or more treatment lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of palbociclib with hormone therapy significantly increases progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) compared with hormone therapy in first and second treatment line of HR+ HER2-&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results lead to palbociclib approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in&#xD;
      February 2015, and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval in November 2016 for first-line&#xD;
      treatment of patients with metastatic HR+/HER2-breast cancer in combination with an aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor, and for patients who had previously received hormone therapy in combination with&#xD;
      fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Spain, palbociclib was launched last November 1st, 2017. During this period, approximately&#xD;
      3500 patients have received treatment with Palbociclib, and approximately a half of them in&#xD;
      first-line treatment in combination with hormone therapy. The collection of efficacy and&#xD;
      toxicity data in the first-line usage in the clinical practice setting is of clinical&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
