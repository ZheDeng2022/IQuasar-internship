  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the neural mechanisms that support real world&#xD;
      spatial navigation in humans using deep brain recordings and stimulation during virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR), augmented reality, and real world memory tasks. We will determine the cognitive&#xD;
      (i.e., memory) and behavioral (i.e., body, head, eye position and movement) factors that&#xD;
      modulate deep brain activity and the consequent effects of memory-enhancing deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Throughout study completion, an average of 2-4 days per year</time_frame>
    <description>Spatial memory will be measured using virtual, augmented and real-world spatial navigation tasks where participants will be asked to navigate a previously learned rout as well as if they recognize objects (i.e. landmarks) that appeared along the route (photos of seen landmarks vs unseen landmarks).</description>

    <measure>Memory performance change</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout study completion, an average of 2-4 days per year</time_frame>
    <description>Memory performance will be measured using excess path length, latency, and accuracy rate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oscillatory activity change</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout study completion, an average of 2-4 days per year</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in theta, gamma, and theta-gamma coupling will be measured both in relation to changes in memory performance on trials with and without deep brain stimulation as well as in relation to body, head, and eye position in a virtual, augmented, or real-world environment.</description>
