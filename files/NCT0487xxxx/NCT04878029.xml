  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial seeks to find out the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects&#xD;
      of cabozantinib in combination with enfortumab vedotin in treating urothelial cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes (locally advanced) or other parts of the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Enfortumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, enfortumab, linked to a&#xD;
      toxic agent called vedotin. Enfortumab attaches to nectin-4 tumor cells in a targeted way and&#xD;
      delivers vedotin to kill them. Cabozantinib in combination with enfortumab vedotin may be&#xD;
      safe and effective in treating locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of cabozantinib s-malate (cabozantinib)&#xD;
      and enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle based on safety and&#xD;
      tolerability. (Phase I dose escalation) II. To evaluate the ongoing safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of cabozantinib and enfortumab vedotin in a dose expansion cohort. (Phase Ib dose expansion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of the combination of cabozantinib and&#xD;
      enfortumab vedotin by assessing the objective response rate (ORR) using Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Progression-free survival (PFS). III. Overall survival (OS). IV. Disease control rate by&#xD;
      RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of cabozantinib during treatment with&#xD;
      enfortumab vedotin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of the combination on selected biomarkers in the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment, systemic circulation and gut microbiome and their relationship with&#xD;
      efficacy of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate quality of life, frailty and sarcopenia before, during and at the time of&#xD;
      treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study of cabozantinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and enfortumab vedotin&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

          -  Major surgery (e.g., laparoscopic nephrectomy, GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain&#xD;
             metastasis) within 2 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Minor surgeries&#xD;
             within 10 days before first dose of study treatment. Subjects must have complete wound&#xD;
             healing from major surgery or minor surgery before first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
             Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt; 500 ms per&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) within 14 days before first dose of study treatment. Note: If&#xD;
             a single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 ms, two additional ECGs at&#xD;
             intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30 min after the initial&#xD;
             ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used to&#xD;
             determine eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow tablets&#xD;

             formulations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other active malignancy at time of first dose of study treatment or diagnosis of&#xD;
             another malignancy within 3 years prior to first dose of study treatment that requires&#xD;
             active treatment, except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured,&#xD;
             such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or prostate,&#xD;
             cervix, or breast&#xD;
