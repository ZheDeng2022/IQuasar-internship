  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the effect of belantamab mafodotin and lenalidomide on&#xD;
      minimal residual disease negative rates in patients with multiple myeloma with minimal&#xD;
      residual disease positive after stem cell transplant. Belantamab mafodotin is a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody, called belantamab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called mafodotin. Belantamab is a&#xD;
      form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface&#xD;
      of cancer cells, known as B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) receptors, and delivers mafodotin&#xD;
      to kill them. Lenalidomide may help block the formation of growths that may become cancer,&#xD;
      and is used as a standard of care treatment for multiple myeloma. Giving belantamab mafodotin&#xD;
      and lenalidomide may help to maintain minimal residual disease negativity in patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate at the end (after 12 months) of&#xD;
      consolidation with belantamab mafodotin in combination with lenalidomide post autologous stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess sustained MRD negative rate, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival&#xD;
      (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive belantamab mafodotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 6&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 weeks and the&#xD;
      periodically for up to 5 years.&#xD;
