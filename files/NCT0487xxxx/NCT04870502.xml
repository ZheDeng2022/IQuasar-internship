      Objective: To evaluate potential benefits of adding the active form of Coenzyme Q10&#xD;
      (Ubiquinol) to Clomiphene Citrate compared with Human Menopausal Gonadotropins (hMG) in&#xD;
      Clomiphene Citrate resistant PCOS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 148 PCOS Patients with Clomiphene Citrate resistance were randomized into two groups&#xD;
      (A and B). In group A, controlled ovarian stimulation was done by Clomiphene Citrate 150 mg&#xD;
      daily (from 2nd till 6th day of cycle) together with Ubiquinol starting from 2nd day till day&#xD;
      of hCG triggering in a dose of 100 mg orally once daily. In group B, hMG was given from 2nd&#xD;
      day of the cycle in a dose ranging from 75 to 225 IU. Serial transvaginal ultrasonography was&#xD;
      done starting on cycle day 8 and continued till size of leading follicle reaches 18 mm or&#xD;
      more then ovulation triggering was done. Thereafter, patients were advised for a timed&#xD;
      intercourse (TI) after 36 hours. A blood sample was withdrawn seven days after hCG&#xD;
      triggering, for measurement of serum progesterone. If the Patient presented with a missed&#xD;
      period for one week, a serum sample was sent for β-hCG.&#xD;

      Patients were divided randomly into two groups (A and B), who underwent controlled ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation and timed intercourse, using random table computer software (Open Epi version&#xD;
      3.21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basal transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) was done on day 2 of the cycle before commencing&#xD;
      ovarian stimulation. For patients presenting with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea,&#xD;
      dydrogesterone 10 mg (Duphaston®; Abbott Biologicals B.V.) was prescribed (3 times daily for&#xD;
      10 days) to achieve withdrawal bleeding before starting induction of ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group A, controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) was done by Clomiphene Citrate (Fertab® 50&#xD;
      mg tablets, Zynova. SITCO Pharma.) as 150 mg (3 tablets) daily for 5 days (from 2nd day till&#xD;
      6th day of the cycle) together with Ubiquinol (active form of Coenzyme Q10) starting from 2nd&#xD;
      day till the day of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) triggering in a dose of 100 mg&#xD;
      capsules orally once daily, immediately after meal (Nutraquinol®; Jamjoom Pharma&#xD;
      Nutraceuticals). In group B, Human Menopausal Gonadotropins (hMG) (Merional® 75 I.U. vials,&#xD;
      IBSA.) IM was given from 2nd day of the cycle in a dose ranging from 75 to 225 IU according&#xD;
      to the patient's response. Patients were instructed not to take any non-study drugs during&#xD;
      the whole study period. All patients did not receive any drug for induction of ovulation 3&#xD;
      months prior to participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial transvaginal ultrasonography was done for assessment of follicular growth (number and&#xD;
      diameter of follicles) and endometrial thickness (measured on sagittal view of the uterus by&#xD;
      including the whole endometrium at the point of its maximum thickness), starting on cycle day&#xD;
      8, using vaginal 4.5 MHz endocavity transducer (Esaote Mylab 50 Xvision Ultrasound, Italy),&#xD;
      and was continued with an interval of 1-3 days till the size of the leading follicle reaches&#xD;
      18 mm or more in mean follicular diameter. Then ovulation triggering was done by an&#xD;
      intramuscular single dose of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (Epifasi® 5000 IU vials, EIPICO,&#xD;
      Egypt.) 2 vials (10,000 IU). Thereafter, patients were advised for a timed intercourse (TI)&#xD;
      36 hours after ovulation triggering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements were obtained by a blinded single operator. All data were digitally stored&#xD;
      and were not analyzed till the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, patients were asked to come for follow up, 7 days after hCG triggering, where a&#xD;
      blood sample (2 mL) was withdrawn for measurement of serum progesterone (ng/ml). Collected&#xD;
      samples were centrifuged and then stored at 2-8 °C until enzyme immunoassay was done. If the&#xD;
      Patient presented with a missed period for a week, a serum sample was sent for β-hCG using&#xD;
      immunoassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with positive serum pregnancy test, defined as β-hCG concentration &gt;10 mU/ml, were&#xD;
      examined by abdominal ultrasonography 6 weeks after the first day of their last menstrual&#xD;
      period with 3.5 MHz sector transducer (Esaote Mylab 50 Xvision Ultrasound, Italy) to detect&#xD;
      an intrauterine gestational sac (Clinical pregnancy). Patients who failed to get pregnant&#xD;
      were requested for follow up for 2 more consecutive cycles with the same protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes measured were; number of cases achieving follicular growth to the size&#xD;
      of mature follicle ≥ 18 mm (1-3 follicles) during the three cycles of stimulation, number of&#xD;
      stimulated cycles (till pregnancy occurs or completing the 3 cycles of the study, whichever&#xD;
      is earlier), the endometrial thickness on the day of triggering, and the luteal function as&#xD;
      assessed by mid-luteal serum progesterone measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes were; number of cases with positive serum pregnancy test and the&#xD;
      clinical pregnancy rate among the two groups during the three cycles of treatment.&#xD;
