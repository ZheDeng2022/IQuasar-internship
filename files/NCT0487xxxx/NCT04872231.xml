  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 (healthy adult volunteers), 2-part, double-blind, randomized, placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of escalating&#xD;
      single doses of Voriconazole Inhalation Powder versus placebo (SAD part) and escalating&#xD;
      multiple doses of Voriconazole Inhalation Powder versus placebo (MAD part). SAD part will be&#xD;
      initiated first and includes a sentinel design. MAD part will not utilize a sentinel design&#xD;
      and will be initiated once the lowest doses from SAD part are deemed safe.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1, randomized, 2 part double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and PK profiles of Voriconazole Inhalation Powder (VIP) in a SAD/MAD study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose- ranging single dose study&#xD;
      evaluating four different dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each group, two selected subjects (sentinel subjects) will receive either&#xD;
      Voriconazole Inhalation Powder or a matching placebo. Blood and sputum samples and safety&#xD;
      measurements including Adverse Events (AEs) will be collected over 24 hour period following&#xD;
      the drug administration. The safety results to be evaluated include AEs, concomitant&#xD;
      medications, out of specification clinical laboratory results, vital signs,&#xD;
      Electrocardiograms (ECGs), visual examinations, pulmonary function tests, pulse oximetry&#xD;
      results and any new findings on physical examinations. If the administration is safe as&#xD;
      deemed by Principal Investigator &amp; Medical Monitor, the remaining six subjects will be dosed,&#xD;
      with identical safety and PK procedures performed after minimum of 3 days interval. A minimum&#xD;
      of 3 days will separate each dose escalation, with the remaining dose groups dosed in a&#xD;
      sentinel fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose- ranging multi-dose study&#xD;
      evaluating four different dose levels. Dose level 1 of Part B can begin in parallel once&#xD;
      safety assessments of Part A dose level 2 are complete and indicate safety is present.&#xD;
      Voriconazole Inhalation Powder will be administered twice daily (BID) × 13 doses. Blood&#xD;
      samples for safety and PK will be collected over 12 hours after the first dose and 24 hours&#xD;
      after the last dose. A minimum of 1 week will separate the start of each dose escalation,&#xD;
      with the remaining dose groups.&#xD;
