  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the interplay among nervous-, musculoskeletal-, and&#xD;
      psychological systems and how they impact toe-walking behavior, and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Project 1 is to analyze the feasibility of the developed virtual reality (VR)&#xD;
      environment, in 10 TD and sCP children respectively. It is assess the effects of VR immersion&#xD;
      on predefined static and dynamic stability parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Project 2: After adjustments have been made following Sub-Project 1 regarding the study&#xD;
      procedure, technical factors or the parameters of interest etc., the optimized study&#xD;
      procedure is implemented in Sub-Project 2 (20 to 25 TD will be included).&#xD;

      Sub-Project 3: After adjustments have been made following Sub-Project 1 regarding the study&#xD;
      procedure, technical factors or the parameters of interest etc., the optimized study&#xD;
      procedure is implemented in Sub-Project3 (20 to 25 sCP will be included)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The interplay between the nervous-, musculoskeletal-, and psychological systems and their&#xD;
      impact on resulting walking patterns are poorly understood. Children that toe-walk often show&#xD;
      poorer levels of static and dynamic stability, leading to a lower quality of life compared to&#xD;
      typically develop-ing children (TD). Current research suggests multifactorial adaptations in&#xD;
      central and/or peripheral nervous as well as the musculoskeletal system contribute to and&#xD;
      result from toe-walk-ing. The purpose of this study is to explore the interplay among&#xD;
      nervous-, musculoskeletal-, and psychological systems and how they impact toe-walking&#xD;
      behavior, and vice versa. The effect of psychological factors (via the use of a&#xD;
      custom-designed virtual reality environment) on static vs. dynamic stability, motor control,&#xD;
      coordination (indirect assessment of central nervous system function) as well as reflex&#xD;
      control (Hoffmann-reflex, H-reflex, performance of peripheral nervous system) is&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;

    <description>The child stands barefoot on dual force platforms in two (CP: three) different conditions: barefoot and with shoes (CP: and with orthosis). Each condition is recorded three times each lasting for 30s, and 30s rest between them. Both conditions are recorded with and without wearing a headset. The order of conditions (within each Virtual Reality (&quot;VR)-condition&quot;) is randomized. For each condition, the child rests in a comfortable position for 20s with the heels on the same level and arms hanging at their sides. Between both &quot;VR-conditions&quot;, the child rests for 120 s.</description>

    <description>The child walks at their normal walking speed on a 10-m walkway in two (CP: three) different conditions: barefoot and with shoes (CP: and with orthosis). For each condition, at least six error-free trials are recorded. Errors in data may occur due to hidden or lost markers during walking or software interruptions. Both conditions are recorded with and without wearing a headset. The order of conditions (within each &quot;VR-condition&quot;) is randomized.</description>
