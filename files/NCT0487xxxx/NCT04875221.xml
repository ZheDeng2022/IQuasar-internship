  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will examine the use of real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback in the regulation&#xD;
      of neural networks underlying symptoms experienced by individuals with posttraumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD). Investigators will use rt-fMRI neurofeedback in order to facilitate emotion&#xD;
      regulation during symptom induction, and examine individual differences that influence&#xD;
      regulation capacities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the mechanisms of real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI)&#xD;
      neurofeedback as a method by which to regulate functional brain connections underlying&#xD;
      symptoms/emotions experienced by individuals with PTSD. The aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      further the suitability of state-of-the-art fMRI as a non-invasive therapeutic tool among&#xD;
      individuals burdened by PTSD, in order to inform future clinical trials of neurofeedback&#xD;
      aiming to reduce symptoms of PTSD. This will be achieved by using rt-fMRI and neurofeedback&#xD;
      of brain signals, in order to teach individuals with PTSD to self-regulate the neural&#xD;
      networks that are associated with their symptoms. Investigators will examine the mechanisms&#xD;
      of self-regulating neural networks using real-time neuroimaging and feedback to these brain&#xD;
      signals. Neurofeedback is a form of brain training that allows individuals to improve their&#xD;
      health by learning to control signals from their own body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ a 2 (PTSD group vs. healthy control group) by 2 (arm; experimental vs.&#xD;
      sham-control) design. This study involves an assessment which will include clinical&#xD;
      interviews and a fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scan. The fMRI scan will&#xD;
      involve trauma-word exposure during neurofeedback task runs. During the presentation of the&#xD;
      words in the fMRI scanner, participants in the experimental arm will be able to view a&#xD;
      feedback display that informs them of the strength of connectivity between the target&#xD;
      regions. Participants in the sham-control arm will receive yoked sham neurofeedback signal&#xD;
      (or fake signal), corresponding to a replayed feedback signal from a successful participant&#xD;
      in the experimental group in order to ensure similar motivational states and following&#xD;
      standard methods. In both arms, feedback signals will be relayed back to the participant in&#xD;
      the scanner through visualization software as a thermometer that increases or decreases as&#xD;
      the extent to which the target model dominates.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1hour</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will evaluate changes in fMRI neural connectivity and activation as a function of neurofeedback treatment. Specifically, investigators will evaluate changes in fMRI neural connectivity/activity among brain areas included in the neurofeedback target network (which includes areas within the default mode, salience, and central executive networks).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in emotional experience over neurofeedback training (RSDI scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>The Response to Script Driven Imagery (RSDI) Scale will assess changes in symptoms after each neurofeedback run in the scanner (3 training runs), in line with previous neurofeedback studies. Investigators will evaluate changes in emotional experience during neurofeedback treatment and at 1-week follow-up, using the RSDI scale. The RSDI has a minimum value of 0 and maximum value of 66 (higher scores indicate more severe symptoms/emotional distress).</description>

    <measure>Changes in PTSD symptoms over neurofeedback training (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses symptoms of PTSD. The PCL-5 has a variety of purposes, including monitoring symptom change during and after treatment.&#xD;
Investigators will evaluate changes in PTSD symptoms from baseline, to post-neurofeedback training and at 1-week follow-up using the PCL-5. The minimum score is 0, the maximum is 80 (higher scores indicate increased PTSD severity).</description>
