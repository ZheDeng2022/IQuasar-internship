  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore possible solutions needed for valid and reliable multidimensional&#xD;
      objective assessment tools to use in screening performers for concussions, as well as, for&#xD;
      use postinjury assessment and management of the mild traumatic brain injury, regardless of&#xD;
      time since injury occurrence. These mobile tools would also enable clinicians to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the interventions used post-concussion, prior to fully releasing the&#xD;
      performer back into full performance/active status.&#xD;

      Participants will have study benefits and risks explained to them and after consent has been&#xD;
      obtained each participant will be assigned an Identification number and attend their assigned&#xD;
      testing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing day will consist of completing a seven page clinician-created medical-health&#xD;
      questionnaire to determine that they are free of cardiovascular, metabolic, psychiatric or&#xD;
      neurologic disease, do not have cognitive or substance-abuse problems or are taking any&#xD;
      medications that may impair cognition, balance or functional mobility such as gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also complete the Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire (BISQ, Mount Sinai&#xD;
      School of Medicine, New York, NY) to additionally screen for lifetime history of traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury (TBI) and reduce consequences of undiagnosed mTBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests will then be conducted in three parts. First, to evaluate neuromotor and neurocognitive&#xD;
      abilities, participants will complete a modified balance error test and a modified version of&#xD;
      the dynamic gait index without and with additional cognitive tasks. These tests will be&#xD;
      performed while wearing external sensors recording kinematic data and a (wearable) functional&#xD;
      near-infrared spectroscopy cap system (NIRSport1) unit monitoring brain tissue oxygenation&#xD;
      and perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second test that the above multimodal test will be compared to is the sport concussion&#xD;
      assessment tool (SCAT 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third test conducted and used to compare the multimodal approach to will be the Immediate&#xD;
      post-concussion and cognitive testing (ImPACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allotted a 15-minute break period between each test.&#xD;
