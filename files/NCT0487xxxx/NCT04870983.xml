  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), is one of the most common organ dysfunction during&#xD;
      the acute phase in sepsis and septic shock. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and auditory evoked&#xD;
      potentials (AEPs), which reflect different aspects of brain function, are the most commonly&#xD;
      used neurophysiological indices to detect acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients&#xD;
      including sepsis and septic shock. AEPs show the systemic responsiveness of the central&#xD;
      nervous to auditory stimuli, so they can be considered a direct measure of brain&#xD;
      responsiveness. Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a change-specific component of ERPs, which&#xD;
      elicited by a deviant stimulus occurring in a sequence of repetitive stimuli. This component&#xD;
      is thought to represent the automatic and unconscious detection of acoustic changes which&#xD;
      requires good perceptual discriminative capacity and iconic memory. The peaks of MMN appear&#xD;
      at 100 ~ 250 ms from deviant stimulus onset; with increasing magnitude of stimulus change,&#xD;
      the peak latency of MMN was shortened and the amplitude increased. Since MMN can be elicited&#xD;
      even in the absence of attention, subjects do not need to actively participate. The MMN has&#xD;
      been extensively demonstrated to be used in the prediction of awakening in comatose patients&#xD;
      for various reasons, and also has been reported to predict awakening in deeply sedated&#xD;
      critically ill patients recently. However, it remains unclear whether SAE affects MMN in&#xD;
      amplitude and latency that reflects cognitive processing of the auditory information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with sepsis and septic shock who met the inclusion criteria were screened daily on&#xD;
      the CAM-ICU scale, and those with positive CAM-ICU were diagnosed with SAE.All patients were&#xD;
      tested for event-evoked potentials on Day 1 and Day 3 after inclusion and were followed up to&#xD;
      Day 28 after discharge. The investigators intend to observe the dynamic change of MMN&#xD;
      amplitude and latency between SAE and non-SAE groups. Logic regression analysis was used to&#xD;
      determine whether the change of MMN was a predictor of SAE.&#xD;

      Patient characteristics (including age and sex), date and time of ICU admission, category of&#xD;
      admission (medical, surgical or emergency), main reasons for admission, co-morbidities,&#xD;
      complications and duration of sepsis before admission were collected. The severity of illness&#xD;
      assessed by the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation scoring system (APACHE) II and&#xD;
      sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, bladder temperature, heart rate (HR),&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respiratory rate (RR), the&#xD;
      level of consciousness assessed by the GCS score, mechanical ventilation (MV) or not, the&#xD;
      depth of sedation assessed by RASS, and dose of sedative drugs at 1 and 3 days after&#xD;
      admission were also collected.The EEG signal was recorded on the 1st and 3rd day after&#xD;
      admission using silver-silver chloride disc electrodes placed on the scalp according to the&#xD;
      international 10-20 system. Four electrode locations (left frontal [F3], right frontal [F4],&#xD;
      frontal midpoint [Fz] and central [Cz]) were used. All electrodes were referred to the both&#xD;
      earlobe and the ground electrode on the forehead. The electrode-skin impedances were kept&#xD;
      below 5 kΩ. The EEG signal was amplified and digitized continuously at 279 Hz using EMMA (ERP&#xD;
      measuring machine; developed and custom-made in the Department of reinject Medical Equipment&#xD;
      Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, China) Background EEG was recorded for 10 min during sleep and/or while&#xD;
      the patients lay motionless with their eyes closed in a quiet room. Auditory stimulation was&#xD;
      then set to 'on' so that ERPs could be recorded. The stimulation was applied according to an&#xD;
      oddball paradigm, which consisted of 85% standard (800 Hz) and 15% deviant (560 Hz) stimuli,&#xD;
      with an interstimulus interval of 1 s. The duration of each stimulus was 84 ms, including 7&#xD;
      ms rise and fall times. Altogether 600 stimuli were delivered through earphones to the right&#xD;
      ear for each measurement, corresponding to a recording time of about 10 min. The stimulus&#xD;
      intensity was set at 75 dB. According to the patient's original EEG, the investigators&#xD;
      recorded the main components of the background wave, whether there was periodic discharge and&#xD;
      low voltage.The amplitude and latency of MMN components of the event evoked potential.&#xD;

    <description>SAE was defined as cerebral dysfunction in the presence of sepsis or septic shock and the absence of any of the exclusion criteria. For patients undergoing sedation during the ICU stay, the GCS scores were evaluated before sedation; for patients who have been sedated prior to ICU admission, the assumed GCS scores, i.e., the scores measured before any administration of sedative/relaxant drug were used for analysing; for postoperative patients, the GCS scores measured before surgery was used. The CAM-ICU was assessed daily by the nurse or the physician in charge of the patient during the ICU stay. For patients who were sedated, spontaneous awakening trials were performed daily; the longest evaluate time after withdrawal of sedation was 24 h during the trials. In this evaluation period, patients should be awake to evaluate their consciousness, and they were diagnosed of SAE if the patients were not awake.</description>
