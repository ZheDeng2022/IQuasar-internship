    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to determine the interpretability, workflow role, and effect&#xD;
      on communications of showing report cards containing Machine Learning (ML)-based risk&#xD;
      profiles based on pre- and intra-operative data to postoperative providers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although surgery and anesthesia have become much safer on average, many patients still&#xD;
      experience complications after surgery. Some of these complications are likely to be avoided&#xD;
      or less severe with early detection and treatment. Barnes-Jewish Hospital has recently&#xD;
      started using an Anesthesia Control Tower (ACT), which is a remote group lead by an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist who reviews live data from BJH operating rooms and calls the anesthesia&#xD;
      provider with concerns to improve reaction times and improve use of best-practices&#xD;
      treatments. The ACT also uses machine learning (ML) to calculate patient risks during surgery&#xD;
      as a way of measuring when the patient is doing better or worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team suspects that two mechanisms may allow risk prediction to improve&#xD;
      postoperative care. First, is that it may make some data more actionable to clinicians.&#xD;
      Although intraoperative data is extremely rich with many monitors, drug-response events, and&#xD;
      surgical stress reactions to reveal the physiolgical state of the patient, that data is also&#xD;
      extremely specialized and difficult to access. The study team thinks that many times the&#xD;
      right interpretation of intraoperative data or the right treatment to give isn't clear until&#xD;
      the surgery is nearly finished. The medical team in the recovery room (post-anesthesia care&#xD;
      unit, PACU) and surgical wards is responsible for deciding the treatment strategy, but they&#xD;
      don't have access to the information from the intraoperative monitors and events. Those&#xD;
      providers also lack the familiarity to directly interpret that information and time to review&#xD;
      it in detail. Even preoperative information may be less than fully available because the&#xD;
      patient may still be too sedated or confused from the anesthesia to explain much about their&#xD;
      history. By summarizing these diverse sources of information into a risk profile, machine&#xD;
      learning outputs may directly improve the understanding of postoperative providers or improve&#xD;
      the identification of patients at elevated risk for postoperative adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second mechanism derives from behavior changes which may occur in providers in reaction to&#xD;
      machine-generated risk profiles. The study team has observed many handoffs from the operating&#xD;
      room and PACU include lists of &quot;important&quot; data, but it is common for the handoff-giver to&#xD;
      provide no interpretation (what problem is this information related to) or anticipatory&#xD;
      guidance (having identified a potential or actual problem, what should the handoff receiver&#xD;
      do). The study team has also observed than once a major risk has been clearly identified&#xD;
      along the chain of handoff it tends to be propagated forward with connection to the&#xD;
      underlying data, any changes noticed by the current provider, and the current plan. The study&#xD;
      team suspects that in the subset of patients with substantially elevated predictions on their&#xD;
      risk profile, handoff communication and team coordination for the identified problems may&#xD;
      improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The larger goal is to deploy a &quot;report card&quot; for each patient that summarizes the&#xD;
      preoperative assessment and intraoperative data in a way that is useful for postoperative&#xD;
      providers. In this study these ML reports will be integrated into the clinical workflow and&#xD;
      determine if it does affect handoff behavior. The study team will also evaluate the&#xD;
      information-effect and test the report card for safety by determining if clinicians identify&#xD;
      any major inaccuracies related to the implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a substudy of a randomized trial of ACT-intraoperative contact (TECTONICS IRB#&#xD;
      201903026), and only patients in the contact (treatment) group will be eligible. The screened&#xD;
      patients will be all adults having surgery at BJH with the division of Acute and Critical&#xD;
      Care Surgery. Exclusion criteria are a planned ICU admission. For each included patient, the&#xD;
      ACT clinician will review the report card information, and the postoperative providers will&#xD;
      either be directly contacted or receive an Epic Best Practices Advisory. Our study will be a&#xD;
      before-after quasi-experiment, meaning that after a fixed date, all eligible patients will&#xD;
      receive the intervention, and the outcome measures will be compared to patients before that&#xD;
      date. The outcome measure we will study is handoff effectiveness from the recovery room to&#xD;
      wards. Providers will be surveyed on information value, any inaccurate items, or major&#xD;
      omissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ML report card will not recommend specific treatments, and decisions will remain the&#xD;
      hands of the physician in the PACU or wards. The postoperative provider will also be given&#xD;
      information about the report card and its limitations.&#xD;
