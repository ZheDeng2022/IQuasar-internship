    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm behavioral weight loss intervention for emerging adult women with&#xD;
      in-person assessments at 0 (baseline) and 4 months (post-treatment) in addition to EMA data&#xD;
      collection regarding risk factors known to interfere with program engagement and weight loss&#xD;
      in this high-risk population (e.g., sleep, psychological distress, life events).&#xD;

      This study will implement a 4-month Internet-based behavioral weight loss intervention in&#xD;
      order to collect ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data that will shed light on real-time&#xD;
      barriers to weight management. The intervention is evidence-based and adapted with respect to&#xD;
      content and delivery mode in order to meet the needs of emerging adult women. Consenting and&#xD;
      eligible participants will receive 1 virtual group session led by a trained interventionist&#xD;
      followed by weekly emails directing them to an intervention website housing video and .pdf&#xD;
      content, weekly text messages, emailed tailored feedback regarding their weight loss&#xD;
      behaviors and progress, and a closed Facebook group to facilitate social support. All&#xD;
      participants will be followed for 4 months with hybrid in-person/virtual assessments at 0 and&#xD;
      4 months; in addition, all participants will be asked to respond to EMA prompts throughout&#xD;
      the 4-month intervention period (Week 2, Week 4, Week 7, and Week 13).&#xD;

    <description>This behavioral weight loss intervention will span 16 weeks. The first session (Week 1) will be a virtual &quot;Weight Loss 101&quot; group kick-off followed by 15 weeks of a technology-mediated program consisting of the following: weekly emailed content (videos and readings explaining key skills and strategies to produce weight loss) and weekly emailed tailored feedback (based on self-monitoring data from participants). A trained interventionist (&quot;coach&quot;) will lead the group session, provide weekly tailored feedback, and monitor participant progress.</description>
