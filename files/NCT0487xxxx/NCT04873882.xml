      With the aid of computerized sound analysis, digital acoustic monitoring could provide a more&#xD;
      sensitive, specific, and quantifiable indicator for perioperative respiratory abnormalities&#xD;
      including wheezing. It is probable that the digital stethoscope has utility in the detection,&#xD;
      monitoring, and resolution following treatment of acoustic changes characteristic of&#xD;
      turbulent respiratory gas flow due to wheezing and/or the incomplete resolution of&#xD;
      atelectasis following the re-initiation of ventilation in a collapsed lung.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesiologists still rely on use of a conventional stethoscope to detect abnormal breath&#xD;
      sounds during and after surgery - this process is labor intensive, intermittent, relies on&#xD;
      human experience and thus is highly subjective. In fact, even for the most basic assessments,&#xD;
      e.g. endobronchial intubation, human auscultation is unreliable.1 Digital stethoscopes are&#xD;
      able to both amplify and digitize airway sounds and also provide a mechanism to record and&#xD;
      analyze them for features undetectable by a human. Several small, pilot studies have shown&#xD;
      that acoustic waveforms from the lungs produce characteristic spectral patterns in specific&#xD;
      pulmonary pathophysiologic states. At this time, there are no studies that examine the&#xD;
      acoustic patterns specific to perioperative wheezing or lung re-expansion. With the aid of&#xD;
      computerized sound analysis, digital acoustic monitoring could provide a more sensitive,&#xD;
      specific, and quantifiable indicator for perioperative respiratory abnormalities including&#xD;
      wheezing. It is probable that the digital stethoscope has utility in the detection and&#xD;
      monitoring of acoustic changes characteristic of turbulent respiratory gas flow due to&#xD;
      wheezing and/or the incomplete resolution of atelectasis following the re-initiation of&#xD;
      ventilation in a collapsed lung. In addition, treatment of perioperative wheezing with an&#xD;
      inhaled bronchodilator may lead to resolution of wheezing and this response to treatment may&#xD;
      also be monitored using waveform and spectral characteristics of the acoustic patterns from&#xD;
      the digital stethoscope.&#xD;

Connection of a microphone to the esophageal stethoscope outside of and removed from the patient's body at the location on the figure above &quot;Connection fo monaural earpiece.&quot;&#xD;
Digital breath sound real-time monitoring will be collected as .wav files from the device with no identifiable elements and the data from the device will be downloaded onto a desktop and we will keep and store the data on a secure departmental server.&#xD;
Additional monitoring schedule includes evaluation of breath sounds with a conventional stethoscope every 30 minutes intraoperatively, at the start of one-lung ventilation, at the return to two-lung ventilation and prior to extubation and during any changes on the digital breath sounds recording monitor.</description>
