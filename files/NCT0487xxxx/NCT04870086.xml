  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ESPERES is a national prospective e-cohort study providing a resource for collecting&#xD;
      information on healthcare workers (HCWs) currently working in France. The overall goal of&#xD;
      ESPERES is to develop the infrastructure necessary to create and engage a community of HCWs&#xD;
      who may be eligible for participation in future research studies. ESPERES is set up to answer&#xD;
      research questions, in the field of prevention for HCWs, prevention for their own health,&#xD;
      that of their relatives, their colleagues, and users of the hospital. These research&#xD;
      questions will be carried out in the context of specific subsequent studies. The first study&#xD;
      that will be carried out is related to prevention against COVID-19, in particular vaccination&#xD;
      against COVID-19 and more broadly on the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

      The study population will be made up of HCWs. For the purposes of this study, a &quot;healthcare&#xD;
      worker&quot; is defined as an individual who currently works in a setting where individuals&#xD;
      receive healthcare (i.e. individuals do not have to work directly with patients, but may have&#xD;
      any role within a setting where individuals receive healthcare, such as administrative&#xD;
      office, housekeeping, food service, etc.). ESPERES will be offered to all the HCWs of the&#xD;
      Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) establishments and to other public or private&#xD;
      health establishments (lucrative or not) in the Ile-De-France region and to establishments in&#xD;
      other French regions, in order to diversify the contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant is self-included and collects his own data via a web interface. This cohort&#xD;
      is open, meaning that eligible people can be included until the end of the study (no limited&#xD;
      inclusion period). This cohort will start in 2021 and is scheduled for an initial duration of&#xD;
      24 months but may be extended as part of amendments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be regularly asked to answer online questionnaires lasting at most 20&#xD;
      minutes. The frequency of these questionnaires will not exceed one questionnaire every 2&#xD;
      weeks (and will generally be more spaced out). During their follow-up in the cohort,&#xD;
      participants may be asked, depending on their characteristics, to participate in studies&#xD;
      nested in the cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data from ESPERES will be gathered in a health data repository. The statistical analyses&#xD;
      planned in the research protocol and those responding to specific subsequent studies nested&#xD;
      in ESPERES and validated by the scientific committee, will be performed by the&#xD;
      pharmaco-epidemiology center (CEPHEPI), under the responsibility of Dr Candice ESTELLAT and&#xD;
      Pr Florence TUBACH. The CEPHEPI is backed by the public health department of the hospital&#xD;
      group Pitié-Salpêtrière - Charles Foix, AP-HP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A calculation of the sample size is not justified for this study as it aims to answer several&#xD;
      research questions in a cohort. However, a number about 15,000 participants in ESPERES are&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
