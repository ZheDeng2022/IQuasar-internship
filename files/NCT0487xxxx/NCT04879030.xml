  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that the empirical use of fluoroquinolones together with&#xD;
      beta-lactam antibiotics will change their therapeutic success in patients with acute&#xD;
      exacerbations of COPD compared to that in patients in whom a single beta-lactam treatment was&#xD;
      used. The main goal of this study was to compare the clinical and bacterial success from the&#xD;
      use of a combination of beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone antibiotics with that of a single&#xD;
      beta-lactam treatment, in adult patients with COPD exacerbations.&#xD;

      The study protocols were reviewed and approved by the Hai Phong International Hospital&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board, Vietnam. The study was conducted in accordance with the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on the Harmonization of the&#xD;
      Technical Requirements for the Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use - Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice guidelines. All subjects gave written informed consent before study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants consisted of patients aged over 45 years, diagnosed with COPD stages I-IV as&#xD;
      stated by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 13, with acute&#xD;
      exacerbations (onset of signs under 14 days as defined by Anthonisen et al. 14: type 1&#xD;
      [increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and sputum purulence] or type 2 [involved two or&#xD;
      three symptoms that needed hospitalization]), the incompetence to use medication by mouth,&#xD;
      fever (temperature over 38.5°C), antibiotic usage for longer than 1 day, treatment with&#xD;
      systemic administration of corticosteroids (dosage equivalent to more than 30 mg of&#xD;
      prednisolon over four days), signs of pneumonia on radiographs, history of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation during acute exacerbations of COPD in the past, recently detected or unresolved&#xD;
      pulmonary malignancy, other infectious diseases requiring antibiotic treatment, and kidney&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Intervention This was an open-label, randomized study using two types of&#xD;
      treatments. Participants were divided into two groups using a randomization procedure. Within&#xD;
      24 hours of admission, patients were assigned randomly to two groups, one to receive a course&#xD;
      of single-antibiotic therapy with only beta-lactam antibiotics and the other to get&#xD;
      concomitant antibiotic treatment, defined as the use of two antibiotics, including one&#xD;
      beta-lactam antibiotic and one fluoroquinolone. The beta-lactam antibiotics with activity&#xD;
      against gram-negative bacilli in this study included piperacillin-tazobactam,&#xD;
      ticarcillin-clavulanate, imipenem-cilastin, meropenem, ertapenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone,&#xD;
      cefotaxime, and cefixime. The fluoroquinolone antibiotics included ciprofloxacin,&#xD;
      levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. The other COPD medications were continued. When antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy failed, the attending physician had the right to reevaluate the clinical status and&#xD;
      to replace the antibiotic therapy in the study with a more appropriate treatment. Safety was&#xD;
      recorded daily with the support of a clinical pharmacist to report adverse events. Patient&#xD;
      data is stored in electronic medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and Follow-Up On days 1, 10, and 20, patients were evaluated clinically, and blood&#xD;
      was drawn, collected and the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP, Beckman Coulter Inc.,&#xD;
      Fullerton, CA) measured. Pulmonary function testing was done and expectorated sputum samples&#xD;
      were collected. The symptoms were scored by using the visual analogue scale (VAS) for&#xD;
      shortness of breath, tiredness, cough, and sputum color. The specific scores for each symptom&#xD;
      ranged from 1 to 10 15. Separate and total scores were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was a clinical outcome on day 20, as stated by Chow et al. 16.&#xD;
      Successful treatment was defined as a cure (completely resolved signs and symptoms related to&#xD;
      exacerbations) or improvement (resolved or decreased symptoms and signs without new symptoms&#xD;
      or signs related to infection). Treatment failure was defined as the failure to address&#xD;
      symptoms and signs, worsening of symptoms and signs, the appearance of new symptoms and signs&#xD;
      related to the primary or a new infection, or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints included clinical outcome on day 10 and clinical success on days 10 and&#xD;
      20, based on lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]), serum CRP,&#xD;
      symptoms, and microbiological responses.&#xD;
