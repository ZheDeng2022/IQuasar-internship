  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our times, it is known that approximately 5% of patients seropositive for HTLV-1 may&#xD;
      desengage a frame with several neurological disorders, which is called myelopathy associated&#xD;
      with HTLV-1, characterized for gait, decreased dynamic balance and limitation of walking&#xD;
      independence the use of walkers, crutches as in wheelchairs. This evolution of the disease is&#xD;
      based, above all, on muscle changes, such as inflammation of the muscles, which contributes&#xD;
      to the attenuation of muscle capacity . In addition, muscle changes caused by HTLV-1 also&#xD;
      affect the respiratory muscles, causing a change in respiratory mechanics, which can impair&#xD;
      alveolar ventilation and, therefore, the development of a restorative respiratory disorder,&#xD;
      reducing total lung capacity. Therefore, it is perceived the importance of offering planned&#xD;
      rehabilitation according to the global assessment of the health status of these patients,&#xD;
      considering their influence on activities of daily living.The focus of this study is on the&#xD;
      weekly respiratory muscle training, as assessed by mensuration maximal inspiratory pressure,&#xD;
      showed significant results in improving lung capacity and in this way promoting the&#xD;
      prevention of pulmonary complications. Therefore, the protocol proposed by the present study&#xD;
      includes respiratory muscular training plus resistance exercise, assessing the impact on both&#xD;
      the strength muscular respiratory to as peripheral muscles, through the palmar pressure test&#xD;
      and consequent enhancement of quality life and functionality of these patients. Furthermore,&#xD;
      it will be possible to contribute to the knowledge of society and the scientific community&#xD;
      about this theme, which is still very small in the world literature.&#xD;

Each week, the researcher determines the new values for load (1 to week 25%, 2 to week 35%;. 3 to week 40%;. 4 to week 45%;. 5 to week 50%.).The resistance training protocol will consist of the exercises of the front pull, the extension chair and the vertical bench press, covering large muscle groups in the dorsal region of the quadriceps and chest, respectively. Each year consist of three sets of 10 repetitions with a load equivalent to 60% of a test Repetition Maximum (1RM), which will be changed every week (1 to week 60%, 2 to week 65%;. 3 the . week 70%, 4 to week. 75%, 5 to week 80%).</description>
