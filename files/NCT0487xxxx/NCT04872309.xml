  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with proton and inhaled inert gases has demonstrated a&#xD;
      clinical ability to provide valuable structural and functional information in lung disease.&#xD;
      Advances in lung MRI methods have led to our department handling clinical imaging referrals&#xD;
      from local and national respiratory units. Hyperpolarised Xenon-129 gas MRI is now the&#xD;
      gold-standard MRI modality used in clinical practice for asthma and COPD in Sheffield.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this new study we will use Xenon gas MR imaging and 19F gas MR imaging to obtain&#xD;
      physiological, structural, and functional information about patients with known respiratory&#xD;
      disease, namely asthma and COPD. Up to 20 patients with asthma and up to 20 patients with&#xD;
      COPD will be recruited. Study visits will involve lung function tests and imaging using&#xD;
      proton MRI, hyperpolarised xenon gas MRI, and 19F perfluoropropane MRI. After initial&#xD;
      baseline assessments, patients will be followed up after 3 and 6 years to investigate the&#xD;
      utility of MRI and lung function measurements in tracking disease progression over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic will also be studying the long term effects of this&#xD;
      novel disease. We will use Xenon gas MR imaging and pulmonary vascular 1H MR imaging to&#xD;
      obtain physiological, structural, and functional information about patients with COVID-19,&#xD;
      including hospitalised patients and mild, non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Participants&#xD;
      may be invited for baseline assessments during the symptomatic phase of the disease and/or be&#xD;
      followed up after 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks (in line with clinical follow up for hospitalised&#xD;
      patients) to investigate long term effects of this novel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our novel approach will provide mechanistic insight in to clinical observations such as : (i)&#xD;
      why previously healthy patients can respond so poorly to oxygen/ventilation therapy, (ii) why&#xD;
      patients respond to proning, and (iii) whether this is caused by alveolar-capillary&#xD;
      interstitial changes and /or microvascular clotting in the pulmonary vasculature (leading to&#xD;
      V/Q mismatch), and (iv) whether these acute changes lead to long term interstitial lung&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For asthma and COPD patients, this is a feasibility study to explore the use of gas MRI lung&#xD;
      imaging techniques in tracking disease progression over a 6 year time period. Participants&#xD;
      will have a baseline MRI scanning session and then be asked to come for repeat scans after 3&#xD;
      and 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend for 3 visits, once at baseline, at 3years and 6 years. Each visit is&#xD;
      split over 2 days should occur within one week. This is to ensure eligibility for MRI&#xD;
      scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the eligibility visit the research team discuss study with patient and obtain informed&#xD;
      consent. An MRI Screening Form is used to identify any contra-indications to MRI scanning.&#xD;
      The participant will be asked further questions about their health, current diagnosis and any&#xD;
      current treatments, smoking history, and about any exposure to pollutants either at home or&#xD;
      at work. Women will be asked to take a urine pregnancy test, to ensure pregnant women are&#xD;
      excluded from the study. The study doctor will perform a brief cardio-respiratory examination&#xD;
      to check that it is safe for the patient to undertake the study. At the MRI scanning visit&#xD;
      the participant will have a series of MRI scans, firstly using Xenon gas, then after a short&#xD;
      break a they will have a second set of scans using 19F perfluoropropane gas. The participant&#xD;
      will also undertake some simple lung function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For COVID patients, this is pilot observational study using nationally unique MR imaging&#xD;
      methods to investigate the acute and long-term pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection and the&#xD;
      resulting changes seen in the lung, pulmonary vasculature and heart of patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      over the course of 12months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend for up to 5 visits. These are at baseline (patient may still be&#xD;
      hospitalised, or this may be shortly after discharge) and 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks post&#xD;
      discharge. These visit timelines are designed to match with clinical follow up timelines for&#xD;
      hospitalised patients. After the initial approach and consent patients will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility using the MRI scanning checklist. Patients who are still hospitalised or have&#xD;
      significant ongoing respiratory problems will undertake a test gas inhalation under close&#xD;
      supervision to ensure that this is tolerated prior to MRI scanning. A renal function blood&#xD;
      test will be undertaken if required. For some non-hospitalised patients this will require an&#xD;
      additional visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first MRI scanning visit consent will be taken or re-affirmed if taken prior to this&#xD;
      visit. Medical history and medication check will be taken and women of child bearing age will&#xD;
      undertake a pregancy test. The participant will have a series of MRI scans, firstly using&#xD;
      Xenon gas, then after a short break a they will have a proton MRI which includes using&#xD;
      gadolinium contrast. The participant will also undertake some simple lung function tests,&#xD;
      including spirometry, gas transfer and endoPAT. Lung function tests will only be completed if&#xD;
      the patient is non-infectious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The repeat assessments at 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks will be the same as the first visit,&#xD;
      patients will be contacted prior to their repeat visit to repeat the MRI screening form and&#xD;
      confirm eligibility.&#xD;
