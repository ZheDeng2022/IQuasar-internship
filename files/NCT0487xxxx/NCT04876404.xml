    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess changes in connections within the brain in Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD). We will invite up to 10 people with PD to participate in this study and complete&#xD;
      several brain scans using PET (Positron Emission Tomography) and fMRI (functional Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging) on the Hybrid PET/MRI scanner. We will also invite 10 participants without&#xD;
      PD to complete the same scans for comparison. &quot;Somatotopy&quot; refers to how areas of the brain&#xD;
      are organized according to the body part they affect. The striatum is the brain region that&#xD;
      coordinates complex thinking and movement. Plasticity refers to changes in connections within&#xD;
      the brain, which can happen to make up for changes that are related to PD. In this study we&#xD;
      will use PET and fMRI imaging together to investigate changes in the striatum in people&#xD;
      affected by Parkinson's disease. The hybrid PET/MR scanner allows us to perform simultaneous&#xD;
      PET and MRI measurements to investigate this.&#xD;

      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current investigation aims to study the altered striatal plasticity in early stage PD&#xD;
      versus healthy controls to delineate the functional reorganization of dopaminergic&#xD;
      projections in PD neurodegeneration. Analysis will be initially restricted to early PD, when&#xD;
      compensatory mechanisms are likely compensating for deficits arising from dopamine&#xD;
      deficiency. The use of hybrid PET-MRI imaging will allow for the simultaneous assessment of&#xD;
      patterns of striatal activation and functional connectivity, as well as dopamine release&#xD;
      induced by a variety of cognitive and motor tasks. In the future, depending upon the findings&#xD;
      of this study, we will examine the effects of disease progression on segregation of striatal&#xD;
      function. Altered plasticity is likely to contribute to clinical progression of disease and&#xD;
      to disease and treatment related complications, thus this investigation may help advance the&#xD;
      development of more effective PD treatment measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation is intended as a pilot study. We currently do not have data on which to&#xD;
      base a power analysis for sample size, however based on our previous experience using a&#xD;
      double or triple bolus [11C] raclopride techniques, a sample size of 10 individuals per study&#xD;
      group is adequate to detect between-group differences in dopamine release using a single&#xD;
      bolus technique. Previous investigations we will be referencing in our study have similarly&#xD;
      relied on small sample sizes to obtain their data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are specifically interested in tracking functional changes within the brain in early PD,&#xD;
      as this is when compensatory mechanisms are still compensating for deficits arising from&#xD;
      dopamine deficiency. Thus for the purposes of this investigation we would like to focus on&#xD;
      early PD, with the potential to follow the PD cohort in a longitudinal fashion in future&#xD;
      investigations, to assess progressive loss of segregation over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In healthy subjects, there will be segregation of striatal activation as measured by&#xD;
           cerebral blood flow determined by BOLD fMRI, as well as striatal dopamine release&#xD;
           determined using simultaneous [11C]raclopride PET, according to body site (motor&#xD;
           activation) and task type (motor vs. cognitive vs. reward)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In patients with PD, this segregation will be lost in a progressive fashion, in which&#xD;
           caudal and dorsal striatal activation and dopamine release are lost first, with these&#xD;
           functions shifted to progressively more rostral and ventral regions of the striatum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional study on 20 subjects (10 healthy control, 10 PD), involving 2-3&#xD;
      visits per subject to the Pacific Parkinson's Research Centre in UBC, Vancouver, BC. Each&#xD;
      study participant will undergo 4 separate scans, 2 scans per day.&#xD;
