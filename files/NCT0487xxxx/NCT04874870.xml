  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dupuytren disease is a fibroproliferative condition of the palmar and digital fascia. A&#xD;
      collagen containing cord forms which can lead to fixed flexion contracture of one or more&#xD;
      fingers. While there is no cure, many treatment options are available to manage symptoms. One&#xD;
      of these options is injectable collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH). CCH is a&#xD;
      combination of two highly selective microbial collagenases that can disrupt collagen types I&#xD;
      and III usually found in cords. Current standard of care after receiving a CCH injection is&#xD;
      daily hand exercises and use of a static night brace for four months. However, there is&#xD;
      limited evidence that use of a night splint after CCH injection has any benefit&#xD;
      post-treatment. The goal of our randomized, controlled trial, is to determine the clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness of splinting after CCH injection. Study subjects will be adults 18 years of age&#xD;
      or older with Dupuytren disease and contracture of one or more digits. Treatment includes&#xD;
      collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection for Dupuytren flexion contraction, with&#xD;
      randomization to static night splint or no splint.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with Dupuytren disease that meet inclusion criteria will be consented to&#xD;
      participate. All patients will be randomized to splint or no splint group prior to treatment.&#xD;
      Baseline data will be collected prior to treatment and will include demographics, measurement&#xD;
      of joint flexion contracture(s) with a standard finger goniometer, and QuickDASH scores. All&#xD;
      patients that participate will receive 1 injection of 0.58 mg of CCH into cord. After 24-48&#xD;
      hours, if needed, patient will return to clinic for extension manipulation of treated&#xD;
      finger(s) to help facilitate rupture of cord. Following injection and/or manipulation, all&#xD;
      patients will be instructed to perform a series of finger exercises daily that they will&#xD;
      receive from a hand therapist. In addition, patients assigned to the splint group will be&#xD;
      fitted for a static night splint that they will be instructed to wear nightly for 4 months.&#xD;
      Splint compliance will be recorded by a survey at each follow up visit. Patients will return&#xD;
      to clinic for routine follow up care at 1 month and 4 months during which their degree of&#xD;
      contracture(s) and outcomes will be measured and recorded. The primary outcome measures of&#xD;
      this study are improvement in active extension deficit of each joint and total active&#xD;
      extension of each digit, in degrees. The secondary outcome measures are QuickDASH scores and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction.&#xD;

    <description>Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire score will be used to measure clinical outcomes. The QuickDASH is scored in two components: the disability/symptom section (11 items, scored 1-5) and the optional high performance sport/music or work modules (four items, scored 1-5). From the item scores, scale scores are calculated, ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>
