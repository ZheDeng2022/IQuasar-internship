  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Mbarara University of Science and Technology and partner sites, the investigators will&#xD;
      explore the role of simulation in gender and equity. African societies are largely&#xD;
      patriarchal, and this spills over into professional practice and medical education.&#xD;
      Simulation methodology is at risk of suffering from a patriarchal dominance. The male&#xD;
      dominance has potential to introduce power relationships between men and women learners in a&#xD;
      scenario setting and between physicians and nurses. In the presence of such power&#xD;
      differentials, the less dominant party could develop a &quot;culture of silence,&quot; fail to take&#xD;
      decisions on issues that affect them or their patients, fail to talk about these issues and&#xD;
      take appropriate action.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To address the challenges of gender and equity: 1) the investigators will teach Advocacy&#xD;
      Inquiry (AI) and the ladder of inference (LoI) as conversational strategies for all&#xD;
      simulation faculty members to explore participant frames of action and thought processes, 2)&#xD;
      the investigators will design and expose participants to simulated scenarios with embedded&#xD;
      gender and or inter-professional power differentials, 3) study the effect of AI, the LoI and&#xD;
      debriefed gender and equity scenarios on participant engagement strategies during gender and&#xD;
      inter-professional conflict situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ladder of Influence allows facilitators select some data / observation, add&#xD;
      interpretation, draw conclusions and take action. Though the Ladder of influence is a&#xD;
      powerful approach to exploring situations, its prone to challenges if users jump to&#xD;
      conclusions quickly without being curious about what alternative interpretations of the&#xD;
      observed data / action could be. AI uses the &quot;show&quot;, &quot;think&quot; and &quot;wonder&quot; as a strategy to&#xD;
      slow facilitators from jumping up the LoI to draw conclusions before exploring learner&#xD;
      perspectives. AI and the LoI in combination encourage self-reflection and good judgment. The&#xD;
      investigators will deliberately encourage simulation teams to have both males and females and&#xD;
      inter-professional with opportunities for team leaders to vary with both sex and profession.&#xD;
