      I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Stroke is the third leading cause of death and is a major&#xD;
      reason for disability among survivors (Mayo 2009). 55-75% of patients with stroke have&#xD;
      deficiency in upper extremity (UE) function contributing to the disability (Alon, 2007).&#xD;
      Complete recovery of UE function is only reported in 11.6% of stroke survivors 6 months&#xD;
      following ischemic middle cerebral artery stroke (Kwakkel, 2003). Neuro rehabilitation has&#xD;
      shifted focus to task-specific, repetitive training as we understood the concept of&#xD;
      neuroplasticity (Kleim, 2008 ). Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has been identified&#xD;
      as a treatment modality to enhance upper extremity function in patients during early stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation (Alon, 2007). FES along with task-specific training has demonstrated superior&#xD;
      performance in hand function (Yang et al 2019) Though studies have reported improvement in UE&#xD;
      function, the duration of treatment and timing post stroke also varies tremendously. Since&#xD;
      the majority of the improvement in upper extremity function occurs in 11 weeks since onset&#xD;
      (Nakayama, 1994), it is important to consider the effect of FES during that time in enhancing&#xD;
      UE function. FES can be an expensive modality to use for patients on their own and therefore&#xD;
      the length of stay at inpatient rehabilitation post stroke also is an important factor to&#xD;
      consider. The average reported length of stay during inpatient rehab for patients with stroke&#xD;
      varies from 9 to 22 days (Camicia, 2015). So it is important to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      FES during the patient's inpatient stay for clinicians to choose the most appropriate&#xD;
      intervention during the limited inpatient rehabilitation time. Most of the reported studies&#xD;
      have used FES distally (Alon, 2007; Gharib, 2015) to improve hand function however it is also&#xD;
      important to consider the role of proximal stability to improve UE function for tasks such as&#xD;
      reaching. Though FES of the proximal muscles has been shown to be a superior intervention in&#xD;
      reducing shoulder subluxation, its effect on improving motor function has been inconclusive&#xD;
      (Vafadar et al 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, FES machines are a two-channel unit used to stimulate one muscle group at a&#xD;
      time. The Xcite system is a battery-powered stimulator with up to 12 channels of cyclical&#xD;
      stimulation, allowing for both proximal and distal muscle group stimulation. It is a&#xD;
      task-specific modality to enhance mass practice during neurological re-education. Each&#xD;
      activity has the correctly sequenced stimulation pattern to perform the prescribed activity.&#xD;
      There has been limited research regarding this type of FES in patients with stroke during&#xD;
      early stroke rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. STUDY OBJECTIVE(S); INCLUDING SPECIFIC AIMS AND/OR HYPOTHESES The purpose of this pilot&#xD;
      study is to determine whether two weeks of multi-channel FES along with task-specific&#xD;
      training will improve UE function when compared to traditional rehabilitation or usual care.&#xD;
      The secondary purpose of this study is to find whether two weeks of multi-channel FES along&#xD;
      with task-specific training will improve shoulder range of motion, grip strength, and patient&#xD;
      reported function when compared to traditional rehabilitation or usual care in patients with&#xD;
      unilateral stroke resulting in hemiplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following null hypotheses are established for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There will be no difference in UE function when using multi-channel FES along with&#xD;
           task-specific training compared to traditional rehabilitation or usual care in patients&#xD;
           with first time stroke and hemiplegia during in patient stroke rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be no difference in shoulder range of motion and grip strength when using&#xD;
           multi-channel FES along with task-specific training compared to traditional&#xD;
           rehabilitation or usual care in patients with first time stroke and hemiplegia during in&#xD;
           patient stroke rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There will be no difference in self-reported upper extremity function when using&#xD;
           multi-channel FES along with task-specific training compared to traditional&#xD;
           rehabilitation or usual care in patients with first time stroke and hemiplegia during in&#xD;
           patient stroke rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research design for this experimental study will be a randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      manipulated independent variable in this study will be 1) FES using Xcite with traditional&#xD;
      therapy and 2) traditional therapy. The dependent variables in this study are the following:&#xD;
      Upper extremity function measured by The Action Research Arm Test, The Box and Block Test,&#xD;
      and The Nine-Hole Peg Test; Grip strength measured using a dynamometer; Range of motion at&#xD;
      the shoulder measured using a standard goniometer; and Participants' perception of&#xD;
      improvement in function measured by a modified Patient-Specific Functional Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty first-time unilateral stroke survivors with less than 3 months since onset with upper&#xD;
      extremity hemiplegia/hemiparesis over the age of 18 will be participants in this randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. We estimated our sample size to be 40 for this pilot study based on&#xD;
      significant findings from prior studies (Alon, 2017&amp; Gharib, 2015). Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited through a sample of convenience from Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation Frisco.&#xD;
      Participants who have comorbidities impacting motor function (Parkinson's, congenital&#xD;
      disorders) or contraindications for NMES (seizure disorders, uncontrolled cardiac conditions,&#xD;
      cancer, pacemaker, significant sensory deficits, contractures, pregnancy, unhealed fractures,&#xD;
      or a cerebellar stroke), and who are unable to follow two-step commands will also be excluded&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient rehabilitation therapists will screen the patients for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and if they are an appropriate candidate for the study, they will inform the&#xD;
      participants about the study. If the participant chooses to get more information about the&#xD;
      study, one of the investigators will contact the person and review the study in more detail&#xD;
      and answer any additional questions. Each participant will be given their rights as human&#xD;
      subjects and asked to sign the informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Boards&#xD;
      of Baylor Health Care System. Participants will be randomly assigned to Group A (usual&#xD;
      treatment, plus XCite) or Group B (usual treatments only) by a drawing lot. Randomization&#xD;
      without replacement technique will be used to ensure equal number of participants in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group (Group A) will receive standard motor retraining of the affected upper&#xD;
      extremity in addition to functional electrical stimulation provided by means of Xcite system&#xD;
      4 days per week for 30 minutes for two weeks. Treatment sessions will be 45 minutes in length&#xD;
      including set-up time. The Xcite system is a battery-powered stimulator with up to 12&#xD;
      channels of cyclical stimulation. It is a task-specific modality to enhance mass practice&#xD;
      during neurological re-education. The system includes four libraries with over 40 functional&#xD;
      activities (Restorative Therapies, n.d). During this specific study, the participants will&#xD;
      receive training using the forward grasp and release activity. Electrodes, ranging in size&#xD;
      from 2 x 2 cm to 2 x 3.5 cm, will be placed over the rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, upper&#xD;
      latissimus dorsi, anterior deltoid, posterior deltoid, triceps, extensor digitorum, flexor&#xD;
      digitorum superficialis, and flexor pollicis longus. Electrodes will be attached the Xcite&#xD;
      system and each muscle group will be tested with individualized stimulation per Xcite&#xD;
      protocol to achieve desired muscle contraction. Electrode placement will be adjusted as&#xD;
      needed to achieve maximum available range of motion at all joints. Subjects will participate&#xD;
      in a repetitive forward reaching grasp and release task using multi-channel functional&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (FES) administered using the Xcite device. Researchers trained on use&#xD;
      of the Xcite will be able to administer the treatments during scheduled therapy session. The&#xD;
      control group (Group B) will receive standard motor retraining of the upper extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators will perform the outcome measures within 96 hours before starting the&#xD;
      research protocol, as well as after two weeks of intervention to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the Xcite FES in upper limb deficits. In order to ensure tester reliability, the same two&#xD;
      testers who are trained with the standardized assessment of the outcome measures will be&#xD;
      administering the testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this research study, data will be collected pre- and post-intervention for both groups.&#xD;
      The following outcome measures will be conducted on each research participant by the primary&#xD;
      investigators: Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Box and Block Test (BBT), Nine-Hole Peg Test&#xD;
      (NHPT), grip strength (using a dynamometer), shoulder ROM (using a universal goniometer), and&#xD;
      Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS). All the outcome measures will be administered on&#xD;
      the affected and unaffected upper extremity and recorded for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Action Research Arm Test is a 19-item measure with 4 sub-categories (grasp, grip, pinch,&#xD;
      and gross arm movement) to assess upper limb functioning. The ARAT is scored on a 4-point&#xD;
      original Scale (3-Performs test normally, 2- Completes test, but takes abnormally long or has&#xD;
      great difficulty, 1- Performs test partially, 0- Can perform no part of test). According to&#xD;
      past research, the ARAT has been found to be valid and reliable when assessing overall upper&#xD;
      extremity function in individuals post-stroke and has a standardized protocol to follow when&#xD;
      using this measure (which will be followed for this research study) (Yozbatiran, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Box and Block Test (BBT) is a test to assess unilateral gross motor coordination,&#xD;
      comparing the affected and non-affected extremity. The assessment measures number of blocks a&#xD;
      patient can grasp and transfer over a partition in one minute. A score for BBT is calculated&#xD;
      by counting the number of blocks that were transferred in one-minute trial. The BBT is valid&#xD;
      and reliable for assessing gross motor coordination (Chen, 2009 and Lin, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT) is an assessment of fine motor dexterity, comparing the&#xD;
      affected and non-affect extremity. The test includes use of a stop watch to calculate the&#xD;
      amount of time needed to place and remove 9 pegs in holes on a pegboard. A score is&#xD;
      calculated for the NHPT by the time taken to complete the activity (in seconds). The NHPT is&#xD;
      valid and reliable for assessing fine motor dexterity in individuals post-stroke (Chen, 2009&#xD;
      and Lin, 2010). According to Lin et al, the BBT, NHPT, and ARAT all have adequate to&#xD;
      excellent correlations at pre-and post-treatment and all measures are appropriate to detect&#xD;
      changes over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's grip strength will be measured using a dynamometer, a device used to assess&#xD;
      force production in affected and non-affected extremity. A score for maximal grip is&#xD;
      calculated by taking an average across three trials (in pounds). To allow for a standardized&#xD;
      assessment method, the patient's grip strength will be tested with shoulder in neutral&#xD;
      rotation, shoulder adduction, elbow at 90 degrees of flexion, and forearm in neutral position&#xD;
      (Balogun 1991). When assessing for grip strength, the dynamometer has excellent reliability&#xD;
      and has adequate correlation to upper extremity function (Betrand, 2007 and Boissy, 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper extremity range of motion (shoulder flexion, abduction, scaption, elbow flexion and&#xD;
      extension) will be assessed in supine. Two measurements of each active range of motion will&#xD;
      be recorded and the average of the measurement will be used for data analysis. A universal&#xD;
      goniometer will be used to assess active range of motion and read to attain a numerical value&#xD;
      (in degrees). For assessment of shoulder ROM, the goniometer is a reliable and valid when&#xD;
      used in a standardized method of assessment (Gajdosik, 1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified Patient-Specific Functional Scale is the subjective assessment of a patient's&#xD;
      ability to complete certain activities that are important to the patient. The PSFS is scored&#xD;
      on an 11-point scale used to rate ability to complete task with a score of '0' being &quot;Unable&#xD;
      to perform&quot; and a score of 10 being &quot;Able to perform at prior level.&quot; For our study, the&#xD;
      patient will be asked to rate their current upper extremity function on the PSFS form before&#xD;
      and after the completion of intervention. The PSFS is a reliable and valid subjective measure&#xD;
      in patients with upper extremity deficits to assess functional change over time (Hafford et&#xD;
      al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, the Xcite Research Participant Screening Form will be used to assess if a patient&#xD;
      meets in the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study. This form will be provided to&#xD;
      and filled out by the evaluating physical or occupational therapist upon admission of the&#xD;
      patient into the rehabilitation facility. If appropriate, the investigators will approach the&#xD;
      patient for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: All measurements will be obtained from each participant during two testing&#xD;
      sessions by the two researchers. Prior to administering the study objective measurements, the&#xD;
      participant's age, gender, type and location of stroke, side affected, time since onset,&#xD;
      height, weight, ability to complete cognitive pre-screening, and dominant side will be&#xD;
      recorded for descriptive purposes. On the first measurement day, (within the 24 hrs before&#xD;
      starting the protocol), the following outcome measures will be performed in the following&#xD;
      order: Range of motion (ROM), dynamometer, Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT), Box and Block Test&#xD;
      (BBT), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), and Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS). All&#xD;
      measurements will be assessed on the unaffected side first followed by affected side. The&#xD;
      range of motion measurements will be assessed in a supine position. Shoulder flexion will&#xD;
      assessed first, followed by shoulder abduction, scaption, elbow flexion, and then elbow&#xD;
      extension using a universal goniometer. Grip strength will be measured using a dynamometer&#xD;
      with patient in a supported seated position. Three trials will be taken and an average will&#xD;
      be calculated. The Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT) and Box and Block Test (BBT) will be performed&#xD;
      in a supported seated position with the table raised to 75cm. The patient will be allowed a&#xD;
      practice trial with both upper extremities prior to actual testing. Three trials will be&#xD;
      taken and an average will be calculated. The ARAT will also be perform with the patient in a&#xD;
      seated position with the table at 75cm, with the non-affected extremity assessed followed by&#xD;
      the affected extremity. Lastly, the modified PSFS will be completed with the patient after&#xD;
      the objective measures are assessed. All scores will be recorded on a participant information&#xD;
      sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of two weeks of the intervention, follow up measurements will be completed&#xD;
      by the same investigators&#xD;
