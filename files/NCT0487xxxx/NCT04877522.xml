  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a long term safety study for patients who have completed a Novartis sponsored&#xD;
      asciminib study and are judged by the investigator to benefit from continued treatment&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, global roll-over study designed to assess long term&#xD;
      safety and provide continued treatment to participants who have previously participated in an&#xD;
      asciminib Novartis sponsored study and who, in the opinion of the investigator, would benefit&#xD;
      from continued treatment as in the parent study, or from switching to asciminib (if they were&#xD;
      on bosutinib in the parent study), but are unable to access this treatment outside of the&#xD;
      clinical study.&#xD;
