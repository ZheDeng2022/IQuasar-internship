    <textblock>
      Adhesive capsulitis is a condition that causes limitation of function and movement in the&#xD;
      shoulder joint and affects many activities of daily life. The clinical indicators of adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis; shoulder pain and progressive global stiffness of the glenohumeral joint, night&#xD;
      pains and accompanying sleep disturbances, joint capsule contracture, decrease in synovial&#xD;
      fluid, abnormal changes in scapular position, functional limitation and consequently&#xD;
      decreased quality of life. When we look at the literature, it is seen that traditional&#xD;
      rehabilitation practices aim to improve range of motion and reduce pain caused by capsular&#xD;
      contracture. In this context, classical therapeutic exercises consisting of stretching and&#xD;
      strengthening, joint mobilization methods, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation methods&#xD;
      are applied. However, there are limited number of studies investigating the effects of PNF&#xD;
      techniques on pain, function and activity limitation. Therefore, within the scope of the&#xD;
      research, it is planned to apply a traditional rehabilitation program prepared in accordance&#xD;
      with the guidelines for one group, and PNF approaches for the upper extremity and scapula in&#xD;
      the other group. Thus, it is aimed to examine the effects of the use of upper extremity and&#xD;
      scapula PNF techniques on pain, function, range of motion, proprioception, quality of life,&#xD;
      sleep and patient satisfaction compared to traditional exercises in adhesive capsulitis&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Exercises will be applied 3 days a week for 4 weeks. Each training session&#xD;
      will last 45 minutes. Pain, function, range of motion, proprioception, quality of life and&#xD;
      sleep quality evaluations will be performed at the beginning of the study and at the end of 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive capsulitis is a shoulder pathology characterized by contracture of the glenohumeral&#xD;
      joint capsule and progressive pain with loss of range of motion. The disease picture is&#xD;
      generally examined in 3 phases as painful phase, freezing phase and thaw phase. It is&#xD;
      generally characterized by pain, decreased range of motion, function, activity limitations,&#xD;
      night pain and sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances associated with function, activity&#xD;
      limitations and night pain negatively affect the patients' quality of life. In the&#xD;
      literature, the success rate of conservative treatment is shown as 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative treatment consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and&#xD;
      therapeutic exercises. The purpose of therapeutic exercises in general; to reduce pain,&#xD;
      increase range of motion, decrease activity limitations, increase scapulohumeral rhythm by&#xD;
      correcting impaired shoulder joint biomechanics and improve function. Proprioceptive&#xD;
      neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is an exercise concept that uses proprioceptors to increase&#xD;
      responses of the neuromuscular mechanism, range of motion and muscle activation. PNF&#xD;
      techniques are applied to improve muscle strength, endurance, mobility, stability,&#xD;
      coordination and neuromuscular control and can be easily adapted to daily life activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, it is aimed to increase the glenohumeral joint movements and regulate the&#xD;
      scapulothoracic rhythm in the rehabilitation of adhesive capsulitis. However, the number of&#xD;
      studies in the literature comparing upper extremity and scapular PNF patterns with classical&#xD;
      exercises targeting the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints is limited. For this reason,&#xD;
      the aim of the study is to focus on the structures involved in shoulder movements in adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis rehabilitation as a whole, and to examine the effects of the use of upper&#xD;
      extremity and scapula PNF techniques on pain, function, range of motion, proprioception,&#xD;
      quality of life, sleep and patient satisfaction compared to traditional exercises in patients&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of weeks 4.</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder, Pain and Disability Index were used to evaluate the functional status of the patients. SPADI is a scale that evaluates the pain and difficulty experienced by patients during various activities. It has 2 different subscales, pain and disability. In the pain subscale, pain status is questioned during 5 different daily life activities. In the disability subscale, the difficulty experienced in 8 different activities is measured. The patient was asked to score the level of pain and difficulty between 0-10 and the values were recorded. (0: no pain, 10: worst imaginable pain - 0: no difficulty, 10: extremely difficult, need help) In this study, the change that occurred during the 4-week period from the beginning will be examined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Disability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of weeks 4.</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder Disability Scale will be used to assess the disability status associated with pain in the shoulder. The scale includes 16 questions about daily life activities that increase symptoms. Answers to the questions are given as &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not applicable&quot; depending on whether the activity has been painful in the last 24 hours. The score is calculated by dividing the number of yeses by the sum of the number of yes and the number of no. The obtained score is multiplied by 100 and converted into a percentage value. High score is associated with increased disability. In this study, the change that occurred during the 4-week period from the beginning will be examined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lateral Scapular Slide Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of weeks 4.</time_frame>
    <description>The lateral scapular slide test is a method used for the assessment of dominant and non-dominant side scapular dyskinesia based on the measurement of the distance between the inferior end of the scapula and the spinous process of the vertebra in the same alignment. The difference between the two sides is measured with a tape measure when the arms are at the side of the body and in the resting position, when the hands are at the waist and when the arm is in 90ยบ abduction. Scapular dyskinesia will be considered positive for cases where the distance between the two sides is 1.5 cm or more. In this study, the change that occurred during the 4-week period from the beginning will be examined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of weeks 4.</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a self-report scale that determines sleep quality, type and severity of sleep disorder in the last 1 month. Self-report questions include different factors related to sleep quality and these factors are grouped into 7 components. These components are; It provides information on subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleeping pills and daytime sleep dysfunction. The total PUKI score takes a value between 0-21. Sleep quality of those with a total score of 5 or less is considered as &quot;healthy&quot;, between 6-10 as &quot;bad sleep&quot;, and those with a score above 10 as &quot;sleep disorder&quot;. In this study, the change that occurred during the 4-week period from the beginning will be examined.</description>
