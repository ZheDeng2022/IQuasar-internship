    <measure>Assessment of Time Management Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>from March to June</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 30-item assessment tool that describes how different practical situations related to time management in a person's life are resolved or one's possible views on one's own time management skills. The scale is in 4-likert format and is evaluated as &quot;1: Never, 2: Sometimes, 3: Most of the time, 4: Always&quot; and the scores obtained are scored between 30-120. High scores indicate that time management skills and practices perform better. Eight items are reverse scored (items 7, 9, 10, 12, 18, 23, 26 and 30)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Isolation Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>from March to June</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 6 items that evaluate the loneliness and perceived social isolation of the individual. A minimum score of 0 and a maximum of 24 points are obtained on the scale. 0 points means total social isolation, 24 points means high social relations. A value between 0-10 means complete social isolation, a value between 12-15 means isolation, a value between 16-18 means partial isolation, a value between 19-21 means social relation, and a value between 21-24 means a high social relationship.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Interest Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>from March to June</time_frame>
    <description>It is suitable for all population groups. The areas of interest are divided into 9 categories in each section, where relevant activities are listed and the individual can add their own activity. For each activity, it questions participation in the activity (in the past, ongoing and / or planned in the future) and degree of interest (strong, little, nothing).</description>
