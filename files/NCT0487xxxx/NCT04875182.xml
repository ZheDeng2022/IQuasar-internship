      The relationship between zonulin and interleukin-8 levels and postoperative delirium&#xD;
      development in patients who had femur fracture surgery under regional anesthesia&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are over 65 years of age and scheduled for femur fixation surgery will be&#xD;
      included in the study. Blood samples for zonulin and interleukin-8 levels will be taken at&#xD;
      the day prior to the surgery. All patients will be evaluated by Delirium Rating Scale (DRS)&#xD;
      for delirium development at the postoperative 1., 2. and 3. days. Patients with a DRS score&#xD;
      over 14 points will be included in the Group Delirium. And second blood samples for zonulin&#xD;
      and interleukin-8 levels will be taken at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain scores of the patients will recorded by using a numerical rating scale&#xD;
      (NRS).&#xD;
