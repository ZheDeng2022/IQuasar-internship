  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dual task performances may be impaired with the impairment in motor performance and cognitive&#xD;
      functions due to aging. The aim of the present study is to investigate the gender differences&#xD;
      in dual task performance. A total of 82 community dwelling older adults (41 males and 41&#xD;
      females) aged between 65 and 75 years were included in the study. Motor performance was&#xD;
      evaluated with sit-to-stand test, the timed up and go test, 10 m walking test and cognitive&#xD;
      functions were evaluated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test. Dual task performances were&#xD;
      evaluated as motor-motor and cognitive-motor performance.&#xD;
