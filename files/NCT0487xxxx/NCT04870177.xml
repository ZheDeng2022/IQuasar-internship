             study drug&#xD;

             imaging showed that the neoplasm surrounded major blood vessels or had obvious&#xD;
             necrosis and cavitation, and the investigators believed that participation in the&#xD;
             study might increase risk of bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live virus vaccine within 30 days prior to first administration of&#xD;
             study drug or plan to be administered during the study period&#xD;
