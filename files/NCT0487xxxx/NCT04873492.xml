  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MS is a heterogeneous disease either in its response to treatment or clinical manifestation.&#xD;
      Indeed, the natural history of MS is varying from a benign condition to a devastating and&#xD;
      rapidly incapacitating disease. Clinical heterogeneity could also be cellular and / or&#xD;
      molecular. The aim is to identify from OMIC analyses, at the early stage of the disease,&#xD;
      differentially expressed molecules and / or cell subpopulations derived from CD8 + T&#xD;
      lymphocytes and / or CD4 + T lymphocytes and / or B lymphocytes and monocytes from patients&#xD;
      with aggressive versus non-aggressive, compared to a cohort of healthy controls&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study model consists of two cohorts, the first one or &quot;learning cohort&quot; includes a group of health volunteers and 2 groups of MS patients from who clinical outcome (aggressive vs non-aggressive) is already known based on clinical follow up since first event. Clinical data and blood sample have been already collected and are available from OFSEP (Observatoire français de la Sclérose en plaques). Blood will be analyzed to characterize transcriptomic, epigenomic, genomic immune cells features to discover predictive markers of clinical outcome. The second cohort or &quot;validation cohort&quot; consists of MS patients enrolled after their first event and followed for maximum 2-years until the determination of their clinical outcome. Blood will be collected after their first event and used in FACS to classified the patients based on molecule of interest discover thanks to learning cohort and predict clinical outcome.</intervention_model_description>
