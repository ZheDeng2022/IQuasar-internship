  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In many cases, the manometric examination is not feasible because of the pharyngeal sinusitis&#xD;
      or pharyngeal torsion. In addition, although previous conventional manometry was used to&#xD;
      estimate pharyngeal swallowing, the bolus flow transmission was still not evaluated, which&#xD;
      still depended on the videofluoscopic swallowing studies. High resolution impedance manometry&#xD;
      could help us to measure the bolus flow according to the impedance changes. However, the&#xD;
      comparison between two approach methods of postoperative recovery of swallowing function is&#xD;
      still inconclusive. In this study, we aimed to examine the correlation between&#xD;
      high-resolution manometric and videofluoroscopic (Barium) measurements of the swallowing&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

&#xD;
      For the patients and method decription, consecutive patients who will fulfill the criteria of&#xD;
      elective esophagectomy patients aged &gt;= 20 will be enrolled. After got the inform consent,&#xD;
      these patients receive the swallowing function by barium examination and HRIM.&#xD;
