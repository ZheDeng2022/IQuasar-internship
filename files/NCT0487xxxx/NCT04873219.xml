      A crossover clinical trial investigates two novel CAD/CAM techniques for complete removable&#xD;
      dental prostheses for edentulous patients, milling and rapid prototyping (3D-printing) in a&#xD;
      clinical setting of an undergraduate student clinic. Outcome parameters concern the dentures'&#xD;
      trueness, retention, stability, esthetics and occlusion. Secondary outcome parameters include&#xD;
      willingness to pay and prosthetic maintenance need.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The process of fabricating complete removable dental prostheses (CRDPs) by novel CAD/CAM&#xD;
      manufacturing technique has in the recent years gained immense popularity with clinicians as&#xD;
      well as dental technicians worldwide. CRDPs can be manufactured by a subtractive process&#xD;
      (milling technique) or by an additive process (rapid prototyping or 3D printing). The milling&#xD;
      technique is the frequently employed technique for fabricating CRDPs; it is well documented&#xD;
      in terms of precision, material properties, and a few clinical trials have even demonstrated&#xD;
      good patient and clinician satisfaction. The rapid prototyping (3D printing) method however,&#xD;
      is still in the developing stages for this particular application. Although both methods seem&#xD;
      to yield clinically acceptable results, there are no studies in current literature which&#xD;
      compare the CRDPs manufactured by the two CAD/CAM methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed single-center, double-blind, randomized crossover clinical trial specifically&#xD;
      aims to test the following hypothesis that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • there is no difference between the two types of CRDPs (milled, and rapidly prototyped) in&#xD;
      terms of trueness, denture quality, patient satisfaction, prosthodontic maintenance and&#xD;
      adjustments requirements and incurred costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen pre-doctoral final year dental students and their respective completely edentulous&#xD;
      patients will be recruited in this RCT. A traditional clinical complete denture protocol will&#xD;
      be followed to record the clinical steps. Two sets of CRDPs will be manufactured (CAD/CAM&#xD;
      milling and 3D printing). The CRDPs will be randomized before denture insertion and then&#xD;
      delivered to the patient. Each CRDPs will be worn by the patient for a period of 6 weeks,&#xD;
      before crossing over. Clinical examinations and data collection will be performed at baseline&#xD;
      (T0), at denture insertion stage (T1), and at the end of 6 weeks (T2) for each of the&#xD;
      investigated CRDPs. Assessments will comprise of comparison of trueness of denture intaglio&#xD;
      surfaces against the corresponding master cast, denture quality assessments, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction scores, prosthodontic maintenance needs and willingness-to-pay analysis and cost&#xD;
      minimization analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT will contribute significantly in the development of CAD/CAM treatment concepts for&#xD;
      fabricating complete removable dental prostheses (CRDPs). The study would highlight the&#xD;
      differences, if any, between the two manufacturing methods for CRDPs, in terms of trueness,&#xD;
      quality of the prostheses, clinician and patient satisfaction and also incurred costs.&#xD;
      Clinically, the planned RCT hopes to demonstrate the feasibility of these novel treatment&#xD;
      concepts in frail elderly edentates. A significant reduction in the treatment times,&#xD;
      maintenance visits, and costs along with high patient satisfaction with these newer CRDPs&#xD;
      would be added advantages when treating the elderly edentates.&#xD;
