  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).&#xD;
      Vascular dysfunction is an early and critical event in the development of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Children with T1DM have vascular dysfunction therefore early interventions to&#xD;
      improve vascular health are essential to reduce cardiovascular mortality in T1DM. Metformin&#xD;
      is an insulin sensitising agent which is known to improve vascular health outcomes in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other individuals with insulin resistance. It has been used&#xD;
      safely in children and adolescents with T2DM for over 10 years. This study aims to assess the&#xD;
      effect of metformin on vascular health in children with T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study to study effect of metformin on circulating neuregulin-4 levels as a&#xD;
      marker for subclinical atherosclerosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease characterized by T-cell mediated&#xD;
      destruction of the pancreatic b-cells, resulting in insulin deficiency and elevated blood&#xD;
      glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus in many countries challenges health&#xD;
      systems because the disease is presently incurable with no known method of prevention. Around&#xD;
      490,100 children live with the disease worldwide, with incidence estimated to be increasing&#xD;
      in children under 15 years by 2.8% per year .This trend is particularly worrying because type&#xD;
      1 diabetes increases mortality and morbidity population-wide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular co-morbid diseases include retinopathy, which may cause reduced vision and&#xD;
      blindness, and nephropathy, which may result in renal failure and require dialysis or kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. This is in addition to hypertension, which is linked to peripheral, cardio-&#xD;
      and cerebrovascular disease, the end points of which are limb amputations, cardiac failure,&#xD;
      stroke and sudden death. As vascular complications curtail both life expectancy and quality&#xD;
      of life development at younger ages when people are typically establishing Type 1 diabetes&#xD;

      families is particularly detrimental .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4), a recently identified adipokine, has been found in multiple organs, in&#xD;
      particular brown adipose tissue (BAT), and belongs to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)&#xD;
      family of extracellular ligands. Overexpression of Nrg4 can reduce chronic inflammation&#xD;
      through inhibiting the gene expression of macrophage marker monocyte chemotactic protein 1&#xD;
      (Mcp1) and enhancing the expression of M2 macrophage marker gene Cd163, demonstrating that&#xD;
      Nrg4 may possess anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. Lower Nrg4 levels have&#xD;
      been reported to be associated with the percentage of body fat mass, liver fat content,&#xD;
      obesity, IR, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, serum Nrg4 levels have been reported to be inversely associated with subclinical&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in obese adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies reveal that neuregulin.4 may be closely associated with non-alcoholic fatty&#xD;
      liver disease (NAFLD) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Many lines of evidence indicate that&#xD;
      inflammation is closely associated with atherosclerosis and plays a crucial role in the&#xD;
      development of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biguanides sensitize body cells to insulin, which may cause a reduction of atherogenic lipid&#xD;
      fractions in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
