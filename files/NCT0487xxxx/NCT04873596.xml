      Site of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out in operating theater of obstetrics at Zagazig University&#xD;
      Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal Criteria: The woman has the right to withdraw from the study at any time without&#xD;
      any negative consequence on their medical or surgical treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double -blind randomized clinical trial. All patients will be hospitalized and visited a day&#xD;
      before the surgery, full history with physical examination and routine investigation will be&#xD;
      done, the nature and complications of the study will be explained in detail to the patient&#xD;
      and informed written consent will be obtained from every woman.&#xD;
