    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure (HF) is a public health burden. Studies have shown a link between inflammation,&#xD;
      myocardial dysfunction, and HF. Researchers want to use psoriasis as a disease model of&#xD;
      chronic inflammation to further study the link between inflammation and myocardial&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if chronic inflammation affects the heart and if taking a biological medicine for&#xD;
      chronic inflammation helps improve how the heart works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who have moderate to severe psoriasis, and healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history. They may take a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will have 1 visit. Those with psoriasis will have a second visit 1 year&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give blood samples. They may have a heart function test. They may have a&#xD;
      heart imaging test, and may get a contrast agent. If so, it will be injected into a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have positron emission tomography/computed tomography tests. They will lie&#xD;
      on their back on a padded table with their arms straight overhead. They may get radioactive&#xD;
      drugs through an intravenous (IV) catheter. They will get stress medicines through the IV.&#xD;
      These drugs mimic exercise and increase blood flow through the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The scanner is a large tube.&#xD;
      Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the tube. They will get gadolinium&#xD;
      contrast in a vein to improve the pictures. They may get stress medicines. Coils will be used&#xD;
      to help make the pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation for healthy volunteers will last 1-2 days. Participation for those with&#xD;
      psoriasis will last 14 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) remains a significant public health burden despite expanding and improving&#xD;
      treatment options. Clinical and pre-clinical studies have demonstrated compelling&#xD;
      relationships between inflammation, myocardial dysfunction, HF and adverse clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      In this study to be conducted at the NIH Clinical Center, we propose to utilize psoriasis as&#xD;
      a disease model to study how chronic inflammation effects myocardial perfusion, measured by&#xD;
      myocardial flow reserve (MFR) on positron emission tomography (PET) and cardiac MRI (CMR),&#xD;
      and myocardial function and tissue composition measured by multi-modality cardiovascular&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that chronic inflammation is a driver of perturbances in myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion, function and tissue composition&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that biologic treatment for psoriasis will be associated with&#xD;
      longitudinal improvement in myocardial perfusion, function and tissue composition&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize immune cell subsets and their association with myocardial perfusion, function&#xD;
      and tissue composition in chronic inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore how chronic inflammation may alter myocardial energetics and metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial perfusion, as assessed by myocardial flow reserve (MFR), in subjects with moderate&#xD;
      to severe psoriasis compared to matched healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in MFR in subjects with psoriasis on biologic therapy at 1 year follow-up compared to&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diastolic function (on echocardiogram), myocardial mechanics (on echocardiogram and CMR),&#xD;
      myocardial edema and inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis (on CMR) in subjects with&#xD;
      moderate to severe psoriasis compared to matched healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in diastolic function, myocardial mechanics, myocardial edema and inflammation, and&#xD;
      interstitial fibrosis in subjects with psoriasis on biologic therapy at 1 year follow- up&#xD;

        This is a primary clinical protocol. Affected subjects are defined as patients whose&#xD;
        psoriasis is diagnosed clinically by a referring dermatologist or rheumatologist, some of&#xD;
        which are planning to start biologic therapy for psoriasis. Healthy controls are also&#xD;
        enrolled from the community.&#xD;
