  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the safety of delivering a part (boost) of radiation&#xD;
      treatment before breast surgery in treating patients with breast cancer that has not spread&#xD;
      to other places in the body (non-metastatic). Radiation therapy uses high energy&#xD;
      photons/electrons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Delivering a boost radiation&#xD;
      treatment before surgery when doctors can still visualize the tumor on imaging may help to&#xD;
      better target the tumor and decrease the volume of normal irradiated tissue. By so doing,&#xD;
      doctors may achieve better cosmetic outcomes and possibly better tumor control.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate that the incidence of grade 3 or more wound complications in patients with&#xD;
      non-metastatic node negative breast cancer who are eligible for breast conserving surgery&#xD;
      (BCS) and treated with pre-operative radiation boost at 1 month after end of whole breast&#xD;
      radiation is no worse than the rates in the current standard of care (6-20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate that the physician reported cosmetic outcome at 1 and 3 years after the end&#xD;
      of treatment is better than what has been reported for the current standard of practice for&#xD;
      patients undergoing BCS and hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (WBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure the acute and late radiation related toxicities such as radiation dermatitis,&#xD;
      telangiectasia and fibrosis in this cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the pre-operative boost clinical target volume (CTV) and compare to the&#xD;
      post-op CTV volume that would have been contoured as CTV if the boost was to be delivered&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure the incidence of fair/poor patient reported cosmetic outcome using the Breast&#xD;
      Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale (BCTOS) cosmetic scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To study the cancer biology before and after radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to surgery, patients undergo radiation therapy boost over 4 fractions. Patients then&#xD;
      undergo standard of care surgery 1-3 weeks from the last day of boost. 3 to 5 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery, patients continue standard of care WBI in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24&#xD;
      months&#xD;

    <description>Patient reported cosmesis will be assessed by the patient using the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale (BCTOS).&#xD;
Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale is a questionnaire designed to assess women's subjective evaluation of both the aesthetic and functional outcome after breast cancer treatment. Patients are instructed to rate each item of the BCTOS questionnaire on a four-point scale evaluating the differences between the treated and the untreated breast (1 = no difference to 4 = large difference). Higher scores reflect worse outcomes.</description>
