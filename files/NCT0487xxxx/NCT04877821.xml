  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab plus anlotinib&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in participants who have triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancer (TNBC). After a screening phase of approximately 28 days, each participant will&#xD;
      receive neoadjuvant study treatment (Sintilimab + anlotinib + chemotherapy) based on schedule&#xD;
      for approximately 24 weeks (8 cycles). Each participant will then undergo definitive surgery&#xD;
      4-6 weeks after conclusion of the last cycle of the neoadjuvant study treatment. Following&#xD;
      adjuvant study treatment, each participant will be monitored for safety, survival and disease&#xD;
      recurrence. The primary outcome measure is pathological complete response (pCR) rate using&#xD;
      the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patient enrollment followed a Simon two-stage design.The Simon design required 16 patients for the first stage and called for termination at stage 1 if there were less than seven responders (Pathological complete response, pCR) among 16 patients. Otherwise, if seven or more responders were identified in up to 16 patients, additional 30 patients would be enrolled. Treatment was considered of clinical interest if, at the end of the second stage, there were more than 23 responders among 46 patient. The trial had approximately 80% power to detect a true pCR of ≥60% against the true response rate of 40% with a two-sided type I error rate of 5%.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pathological complete response (pCR) rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 (i.e., no invasive residual in breast or nodes; noninvasive breast residuals allowed) at the time of definitive surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 30-32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>pCR rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Event-free Survival (EFS) as assessed by Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy (breast or other cancers) or death due to any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date of the last follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants who experience an adverse event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 60 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, is also an AE.</description>
