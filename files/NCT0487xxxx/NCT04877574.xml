      This study evaluates the effects of Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI)-guided intraoperative&#xD;
      analgesia on postoperative pain in patients undergoing open gynecologic surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is one of the most common postoperative complications and is significantly&#xD;
      associated with patient's quality of recovery. Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) is known to&#xD;
      analyze the high frequency component of heart rate variability in relation to respiratory&#xD;
      frequency, providing the objective information on the degree of pain. However, most previous&#xD;
      studies conducted by using ANI were observational studies or small-sized randomized&#xD;
      controlled studies. In the present study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      ANI-guided intraoperative analgesia on moderate-to-severe postoperative pain by performing&#xD;
      randomized controlled study.&#xD;

    <measure>the incidence of moderate-to-severe postoperative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>during 1 hour of stay in the postanesthesia care unit</time_frame>
    <description>the incidence of moderate-to-severe postoperative pain is defined as a case in which pain with numeric rating scale (NRS) of 5 or more is reported during stays in the postanesthesia care unit. Pain assessment is performed two times during stays in the postanesthesia care unit.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) score</measure>
    <time_frame>at postoperative 24 hour</time_frame>
    <description>QoR-15 questionnaire is recorded by an investigator. QoR-15 questionnaire has minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 150, and higher score indicates the better quality of recovery.</description>

    <measure>the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting</measure>

    <measure>11-pointed NRS pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>at postoperative 24 hour</time_frame>
    <description>11-pointed NRS pain score is measured at both resting state and movement. 11-pointed NRS pain score has minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 10, and higher score indicates the higher severity of pain.</description>
