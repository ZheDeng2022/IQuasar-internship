    <textblock>
      The tape will be applied on the lumbar area bilateralemten to the spine without creating any&#xD;
      tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible variation in perceived pain in each spinous process is measured with the Wagner&#xD;
      Force Dial-FDK 20 algometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible variation in the range of motion in ankle dorsiflexion is measured with&#xD;
      LegMOtion® Therapeutic and Corrective Exercise Assessment System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A kinesiology tape was used as a placebo tape and the magnetic tape was used in a randomized&#xD;
      experimental way.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A triple-blind cross-sectional observational study is designed where subjects with low back&#xD;
      pain will be selected and blinded to recieve the Magnetic Tape® (tape with magnetic effects&#xD;
      of less than 2 Gauss) or placebo Tape. Likewise, the evaluator who puts the Magnetic Tape®&#xD;
      does not know what material he is using, as it is supplied by another researcher. The&#xD;
      statistician will also be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommendations of the &quot;Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials&quot; (CONSORT) will be&#xD;
      followed. All participants will receive a participant information sheet and sign informed&#xD;
      consent. Patients aged 18 to 65 years with low back pain will be recruited from different&#xD;
      private clinics in the city of Valencia, Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that when Magnetic Tape® comes into contact with electromagnetic fields&#xD;
      such as those generated by living beings, due to the movement of electrical charges (ions),&#xD;
      as defined by Ampere's Law, the domains of the tape are oriented or aligned in parallel with&#xD;
      the external magnetic field creating a magnetic flux with a north pole and a south pole. This&#xD;
      generated field in turn produces a magnetic induction proportional to the variation of the&#xD;
      magnetic flux, as defined by the Faraday Law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This electric potential produces a redistribution of the electric charge (ions) generating a&#xD;
      magnetic field due to the orientation of the tape domains, then exerting a force on the&#xD;
      moving charges within the electrolyte.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological, Lorentz's Law, regulating Magnetic Tape® aberrant electromagnetic fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent and data protection, the groups with low back pain will be&#xD;
      formed that will receive the application of both Magnetic Tape® and the intervention of a&#xD;
      placebo tape. To avoid that the order of the intervention influences the results of the&#xD;
      study, the subjects will be randomized into two different groups, Group A and Group B. Group&#xD;
      A will receive Magnetic tape® and Group B will do the opposite. The next day the other tape&#xD;
      will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be placed in the prone position and the spinous processes of T11 and L5 will&#xD;
      be identified by marking them with a pen. Once L4 is located at the level of the iliac&#xD;
      crests, the therapist will palpate the following spinous processes and will count down to the&#xD;
      level of T11 and L5, and then mark it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive the two interventions on two different days and the tests serve as their own&#xD;
      24-hour separate control. To avoid that the order of the intervention influences the results&#xD;
      of the study, the subjects will be randomized into two different groups, Group A and Group B.&#xD;
      Group A will be applied Magnetic tape® in their first visit and kinesiology tape or&#xD;
      neuromuscular bandage in your next visit. Group B will do the opposite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the research, a familiarization session will be held so that the assessments&#xD;
      are consistent in terms of pain intensities using the VAS scale. To do this, an algometer&#xD;
      will be pressed on the posterior deltoid at 2kg, 4kg and 6kg of pressure and later at 1kg,&#xD;
      2kg and 3kg of pressure, the EVA evaluations must coincide with the intensities of the&#xD;
      pressures. Familiarization sessions will also be held so that the Lunge test are carried out&#xD;
      properly and so that the results have the highest inter-observer reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perceived pain will be evaluated on two different days. The pain assessment in the&#xD;
      spinous processes of the spine will be performed with the Wagner Force Dial-FDK 20 algometer,&#xD;
      pressing at each level of the spine with 1kg, 2kg, 3kg and the maximum tolerable pressure&#xD;
      separated by each measurement in time from 30 seconds to 1 minute. During each press, the&#xD;
      subject will rate perceived pain using the Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) while the subject&#xD;
      is in the prone position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active joint ROM of both ankles is assessed by placing the patient in bipedestation.&#xD;
      LegMOtion® will be used for to make measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither application has to be painful.&#xD;
