                  phosphatase ≤ 5 ×ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN.&#xD;

          -  Transfusion of blood products (including platelets or red blood cells) or&#xD;
             administration of colony-stimulating factors (including granulocyte colony-stimulating&#xD;
             factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or recombinant&#xD;
             erythropoietin) within 7 days before the first administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the following&#xD;
             intervals before the first administration of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  radiation therapy. Subjects must not have had radiation pneumonitis because of a&#xD;
                  treatment. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation to non-central&#xD;
                  nervous system (CNS) disease with medical monitor approval.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Documented known activating or driver mutations (i.e. EGFR mutations/amplification,&#xD;
             BRAF mutations, ALK alterations, etc.) which have not been previously treated with a&#xD;
             standard of care targeted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with screening QTc interval &gt; 470 milliseconds (corrected by Fridericia) are&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, interfere with full&#xD;
             participation in the study, including administration of study drug and attending&#xD;
             required study visits; pose a significant risk to the subject; or interfere with&#xD;
             interpretation of study data.&#xD;
