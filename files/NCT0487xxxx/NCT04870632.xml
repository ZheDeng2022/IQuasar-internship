  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The video-delivered pulmonary rehabilitation(PR) program is more convenience for COPD patient&#xD;
      to carry out home-based PR. Also, the intervention will improve cardiopulmonary functions,&#xD;
      QoL, and physical activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Purpose: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 3rd global cause&#xD;
      of deaths. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is the standard treatment for this disease. However,&#xD;
      the dropout rate remains high (33-50%) because of traffic issues and patients' low mobility.&#xD;
      Therefore, telerehabilitation seems to be a better way to deliver PR. Using videos to deliver&#xD;
      PR is not only easy to manipulate on the cellphone or ipad, but also improve patients'&#xD;
      attention and compliance. Thus, the aim of this study is to assess whether tailor-made PR&#xD;
      video rehabilitation program improves patients' quality of life (QoL), muscle strengths,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary functions, and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial with 6-week follow-up. Participants were&#xD;
      medically stable COPD patients and able to use LINE and YOUTUBE in cellphone. In the process&#xD;
      of recruitment, they were all assessed by time-up-and-go test. The performance of&#xD;
      time-up-and-go test should be lower than 12 seconds to rule out the participants with high&#xD;
      risks of falling. They were randomly assigned to control group or intervention group to&#xD;
      conduct 6-week home-based PR program. Patients in control group received the education&#xD;
      booklet with words and pictures. Patients in intervention group watched YOUTUBE videos to&#xD;
      rehab and recorded the intensity after the exercise by RPE scores. During the intervention, a&#xD;
      physical therapist would have weekly telephone calls or LINE calls for 6 times to monitor and&#xD;
      modify the intensity of exercise. The videos included 5-minute breathing reeducation,&#xD;
      20-minute interval strengthening exercise and 5-minute education animation. All patients were&#xD;
      assessed the performance of spirometry, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), questionnaires&#xD;
      about symptoms, QoL, muscle strengths and distances of 6-minute walk test (6MWT) before&#xD;
      intervention, after intervention and after 6-week follow-up.&#xD;
