      Aims The diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction is made by pressure-flow studies, which is&#xD;
      an invasive method. This study was conducted to evaluate non-invasive, effective, and&#xD;
      low-cost diagnostic methods in male patients with bladder filling and emptying abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study included 219 male patients aged 50 and over, who were admitted between&#xD;
      March 2020 and August 2020. Patients completed the Visual Prostate Symptom Score (VPSS) along&#xD;
      with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP),&#xD;
      prostate volume, bladder volume, and post voiding residual urine (PVR) were measured by&#xD;
      suprapubic ultrasound. Urethral resistance was calculated using the Bladder Outlet&#xD;
      Obstruction Number (BOON), and patients over -20 were considered obstructed.&#xD;

    <description>In this study, it is aimed to determine the use of VPSS instead of IPSS when needed, the importance of IPP in evaluating LUTS, and the correlation of IPP with VPSS and IPSS, based on BOON in the diagnosis of obstruction.&#xD;
The data obtained from the study were evaluated with the SPSS 23.0 program. The normality rankings of the data were made by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Since the data are non-parametric, the Spearman correlation test was performed. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed for calculating the difference of IPSS groups (mild, moderate, severe) according to other parameters. In case of difference, the Mann-Whitney U test was applied to understand which two groups were different. Since the IPP groups (&lt;5mm, 5-10mm, &gt;10mm) conformed to the normal distribution, Post-Hoc (Bonferroni) test was used to determine the differences between the 3 groups. The level of error was taken as 0.05.</description>
