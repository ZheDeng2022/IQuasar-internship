  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 poses a substantial risk to elderly populations; understanding how to get elders&#xD;
      vaccinated against the virus is therefore a policy priority. An experiment with elders in&#xD;
      Tamil Nadu, India will be used to evaluate interventions policymakers might use to raise&#xD;
      vaccination rates amongst the elderly. The particular interventions being tested are: calling&#xD;
      elders to inform them about vaccination; encouragement of a &quot;buddy system,&quot; whereby elders&#xD;
      are accompanied to the vaccination site by another adult who could also get the vaccine; and&#xD;
      seeding vaccination information with &quot;gossips,&quot; individuals who elders identify as being good&#xD;
      at spreading information in the elders' communities. The interventions are phone-based, and&#xD;
      can be implemented quickly and at low cost. This makes them promising strategies the Tamil&#xD;
      Nadu government and other governments could use to vaccinate elderly populations against&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
