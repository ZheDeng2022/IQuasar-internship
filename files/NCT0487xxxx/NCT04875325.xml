    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial, nested within an existing prospective cohort (Dutch Pancreatic&#xD;
      Cancer Project; PACAP) according to the 'trials within cohorts' (TwiCs) design in which the&#xD;
      effect of a standardized surveillance, with serial tumor marker testing and routine imaging,&#xD;
      compared to current non-standardized practice, on overall survival and quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with primary resected PDAC is investigated. The most important secondary endpoint is&#xD;
      quality of life. Other secondary endpoints are clinical and radiological patterns of PDAC&#xD;
      recurrence, the compliance of patients to our standardized follow-up strategy, the impact of&#xD;
      a standardized surveillance on (eligibility for) additional treatment, and the tolerance of&#xD;
      additional treatment. The need for this clinical trial is emphasized by the the emergence of&#xD;
      more potent local and more effective systemic treatments for PDAC recurrence, leading to a&#xD;
      rising interest in early diagnosis by a standardized approach to follow-up with routine&#xD;
      imaging and serial serum tumor marker testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Radical resection combined with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy offers the best chances&#xD;
      for long-term survival for patients with resectable localized pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, even after radical resection, almost all patients will&#xD;
      experience local and/or distant disease recurrence after sufficient follow-up, mostly within&#xD;
      2 years. There is a lack of evidence based effective therapeutic options for the significant&#xD;
      group of patients with local recurrence only, in terms of improved survival and/or quality of&#xD;
      life. In the case of metastatic disease effective chemotherapy has shown to improve survival,&#xD;
      but with a median gain survival of 3-4 months. Taken together, this had led to a hesitant&#xD;
      attitude towards postoperative recurrence-focused follow-up. Therefore, in most European&#xD;
      countries, including the Netherlands, a standardized approach to follow-up after surgery for&#xD;
      PDAC is lacking. Furthermore, current PDAC guidelines regarding follow-up are based on expert&#xD;
      opinion and other low-level evidence. However, the emergence of more potent local and more&#xD;
      effective systemic treatments for PDAC has led to a rising interest in early diagnosis of&#xD;
      PDAC recurrence. To detect PDAC recurrence at an early stage and identify patients with good&#xD;
      performance status who are most likely to benefit from additional (experimental) treatment, a&#xD;
      standardized approach to follow-up with routine imaging and serial serum tumor marker testing&#xD;
      is needed. To determine whether early detection of recurrence can lead to improved survival&#xD;
      and quality of life, further studies are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The main objective is to evaluate the impact of a standardized surveillance, with&#xD;
      serial tumor marker testing and routine imaging, on overall survival and quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with primary resected PDAC, compared to current non-standardized practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized controlled trial, nested within an existing prospective cohort&#xD;
      (Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Project; PACAP) according to the 'trials within cohorts' (TwiCs)&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: PACAP-participants with histologically confirmed radical resection (R0-R1)&#xD;
      of PDAC, who provided informed consent for being randomized in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Standardized surveillance, existing of clinical evaluation, serum cancer&#xD;
      antigen (CA) 19-9 testing, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT-) imaging of chest&#xD;
      and abdomen every 3 months during the first 2 years after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: Non-standardized clinical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: The main study endpoint is overall survival. The most important secondary endpoint&#xD;
      is quality of life. Other secondary endpoints are clinical and radiological patterns of PDAC&#xD;
      recurrence, the compliance of patients to our standardized follow-up strategy, the impact of&#xD;
      a standardized surveillance on (eligibility for) additional treatment, and the tolerance of&#xD;
      additional treatment.&#xD;
