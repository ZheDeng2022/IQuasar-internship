  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the midst of the opioid crisis, the use of non-narcotic pain medication has garnered&#xD;
      increased interest, particularly in the field of orthopaedic surgery, where narcotic&#xD;
      medications are routinely prescribed postoperatively. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDs) have the potential to serve as an adjunct analgesic, but many orthopaedic surgeons&#xD;
      have viewed NSAIDs with hesitancy because of evidence that they can lead to delayed bone&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When evaluating bone healing across different NSAID formulas, ketorolac was found to cause no&#xD;
      delay and lead to better union rates when compared to controls and other NSAIDs,&#xD;
      respectively. Previous studies in the orthopaedic spine and trauma literature have suggested&#xD;
      a detrimental effect of NSAIDs, specifically ketorolac, with regards to bone healing, while&#xD;
      others have reported no delay in healing. A recent study from our institution found no&#xD;
      detrimental effects on the healing of ankle fractures with the use of ketorolac in the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period. Additionally, the use of ketorolac was associated with less&#xD;
      reliance on narcotic pain medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to evaluate the use of ketorolac on&#xD;
      postoperative pain, opioid requirements, patient satisfaction, complication/reoperation&#xD;
      rates, and delayed and/or nonunion rates in patients undergoing fusion of their first&#xD;
      metatarsophalangeal joint (1st MTPJ) for treatment of end-stage arthritis.&#xD;
