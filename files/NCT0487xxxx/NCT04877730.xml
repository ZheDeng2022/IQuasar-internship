      The purpose of this study is to test the meal anticipation module on a closed loop algorithm,&#xD;
      assessing efficacy and safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess glycemic responses to three different approaches to insulin&#xD;
      dosing for carbohydrate ingestion, with different approaches to a closed-loop system in&#xD;
      random order;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. without the meal anticipation module and without carbohydrate announcement (FCL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. with the meal anticipation module and without carbohydrate announcement (FCL+)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. without the meal anticipation module and with carbohydrate announcement (HCL),&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will target completion of up to 18 adults in a randomized cross-over trial,&#xD;
      comparing blood glucose time in range 70-180 mg/dL following meals with and without the meal&#xD;
      anticipation module in use (FCL+ vs FCL), and comparing to a system with carb announcement&#xD;
      instead of a meal anticipation module (HCL). The study will also assess safety when dinner is&#xD;
      consumed later than usual and when a lunch is consumed without having been entrained in the&#xD;
      meal anticipation module. Each participant will complete each of the 3 modules in random&#xD;
      order.&#xD;

             pregnant will be discontinued from the study. Also, participants who during the study&#xD;
             develop and express the intention to become pregnant within the timespan of the study&#xD;
             will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Willingness to suspend use of any personal CGM for the duration of the clinical trial&#xD;
             once the study CGM is in use&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Willingness to use the University of Virginia (UVa) closed-loop system throughout&#xD;
             study admission&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Willingness to use the insulin supplied by the study for the hotel stay, if not&#xD;

             (Novolog)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Willingness not to start any new non-insulin glucose-lowering agent during the course&#xD;
             of the trial (including metformin, GLP-1 agonists, pramlintide, DPP-4 inhibitors,&#xD;
             biguanides, sulfonylureas and naturaceuticals)&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Willingness to reschedule if placed on oral steroids&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Willingness to commit to self-quarantine for at least 5 days before COVID-19 testing&#xD;
             (If participant has received a full course of COVID-19 vaccine and data emerge&#xD;
             suggesting significantly reduced transmissibility among those receiving that vaccine,&#xD;
             this self-quarantine requirement can be waived.)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

             prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Currently being treated for a seizure disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Planned surgery during study duration&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Treatment with any non-insulin glucose-lowering agent (including metformin, GLP-1&#xD;
             agonists, pramlintide, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors, biguanides, sulfonylureas&#xD;
             and naturaceuticals)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A known medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator might interfere&#xD;
             with the completion of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of an automated insulin delivery mechanism that is not downloadable by the subject&#xD;
             or study team&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known contact with a COVID-19 positive individual within 14 days of the hotel/rental&#xD;
             house studies.&#xD;
