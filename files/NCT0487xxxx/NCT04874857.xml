      This study was planned as a randomized controlled and single-blind study consisting of&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative stages in order to evaluate the effect of aromatherapy massage&#xD;
      on cramp frequency, cramp pain severity and quality of life in hemodialysis (HD) patients&#xD;
      with cramps. The study will start with a total of 48 patients, including 16 patients in each&#xD;
      group. The number of patients to be included in the groups will be determined by making an&#xD;
      interim evaluation of the obtained data. In the study, aromatherapy massage was applied to&#xD;
      the intervention group and baby oil massage was applied to the placebo group, while no&#xD;
      application other than routine care would be applied to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research data; Intervention and Placebo Group Situation Assessment Chart, Personal&#xD;
      Information Form, Personal Interview Form, Visual Analog Scala, Quality of Life Index&#xD;
      Dialysis Version-III (Ferrans &amp; Powers) and Control, Intervention and Placebo Group&#xD;
      Monitoring Chart will be collected. Qualitative data obtained in the research will be&#xD;
      evaluated using descriptive analysis and content analysis methods. Statistical Package for&#xD;
      the Social Sciences (SPSS) program and Turcosa program (Turcosa Analytics Ltd Co, Turkey,&#xD;
      www.turcosa.com.tr) are planned to be used in the evaluation of quantitative data. A value of&#xD;
      p &lt;0.05 will be considered as the criterion for statistical significance. In order to conduct&#xD;
      the study, the necessary Academic Committee decision, Ethics Committee approval (date 11&#xD;
      November 2020 and number 13) and institutional permission were obtained. The individuals&#xD;
      included in the study will be informed about the purpose of the research, their verbal&#xD;
      consent will be obtained and the participant's informed consent form will be signed.&#xD;

      qualitative and quantitative stages in order to evaluate the effect of aromatherapy massage&#xD;
      on cramp frequency, cramp pain severity and quality of life in hemodialysis (HD) patients&#xD;
      with cramps. The pollsters who collect data will be blinded to which patients are in which&#xD;
      group. After enumerating the patients who meet the research criteria assignment of&#xD;
      intervention, placebo and control groups, determination of the days and sessions of the&#xD;
      groups will be determined and recorded in the digital randomization environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      566 patients receiving treatment in institutions that allow the study to be carried out&#xD;
      constitute the accessible universe of the study. The study will start with a total of 48&#xD;
      patients, including 16 patients in each group. The number of patients to be included in the&#xD;
      groups will be determined by making an interim evaluation of the obtained data. In the study,&#xD;
      aromatherapy massage was applied to the intervention group and baby oil massage was applied&#xD;
      to the placebo group, while no application other than routine care would be applied to the&#xD;
      control group. Aromatherapy massage to the intervention group; It will be applied with a 10%&#xD;
      mixture of lavender, rosemary and marjoram essential oils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent Variables: Cramp frequency, average of cramp pain severity with each follow-up&#xD;
      average and total score of the quality of life scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Variables: age, gender, body mass index, marital status, educational status,&#xD;
      income level, socio-demographic characteristics such as smoking and alcohol use,&#xD;
      characteristics related to the diagnosis-treatment process, comorbidities and laboratory&#xD;

    <description>The widespread use of VAS, which has been used in the research of subjective concepts from past years to the present, has been realized after the study of Aitken and Zealley in 1969. This scale; There is a number value of &quot;0 (no pain)&quot; at the beginning and &quot;10 (the most unbearable pain)&quot; at the end. The patient marks the severity of the cramp he is experiencing at that moment, and the starting and ending points of the scale as criteria. A VAS value between 1-3 means &quot;mild pain&quot;, between 4-6 means &quot;moderate pain&quot;, and a value between 7-10 means &quot;severe pain&quot;. Participants will mark the scale each time they experience a cramp.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Index Dialysis Version - III (Ferrans &amp; Powers)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the first and last meeting in 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Quality of Life Index Dialysis Version-3&quot; was developed by Ferrans and Power in 1985 in America. This scale consists of two parts measuring satisfaction from different areas of life and the importance of these areas for the individual, each part contains 34 items. In the satisfaction part of the 6-degree Likert-type scale consisting of 64 items, there are expressions from &quot;very satisfied&quot; to &quot;not satisfied at all&quot;, and &quot;very important to very unimportant&quot; in the importance part. The scale has 4 sub-dimensions: health and function, socio-economic, psychological-beliefs, and family. The &quot;translated total score&quot; is obtained by combining the satisfaction and importance scores of the scale with a special formula.</description>
