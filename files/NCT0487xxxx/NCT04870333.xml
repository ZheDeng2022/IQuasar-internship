  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 (novel coronavirus-induced disease) was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on&#xD;
      11th March 2020. Currently there are no drugs proven to prevent COVID-19 or to reduce the&#xD;
      severity of illness if given as prophylaxis. Although vaccines are now available, there&#xD;
      remains a need for other prophylactic agents until vaccine use becomes widespread globally&#xD;
      and effectiveness and durability is established, particularly in immunocompromised&#xD;
      individuals. Efforts are underway to repurpose established drugs with well understood drug&#xD;
      interactions and safety profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PROTECT-V is a platform clinical trial and aims to enrol patients at particularly high&#xD;
      risk of COVID-19 and its complications. the first agent to be tested is nasal nicolosamide&#xD;
      treatment as a prophylactic measure that either might prevent the disease from occurring or&#xD;
      may reduce the number of cases where the disease becomes serious or life-threatening.&#xD;
      PROTECT-V is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled event driven trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible for recruitment to the trial if they fall within one of the&#xD;
      following vulnerable populations: a)patients receiving dialysis, b)kidney transplant&#xD;
      patients, c)patients with vasculitis or glomerulonephritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1500 participants will be randomised to active treatment or placebo, stratified&#xD;
      by PROTECT sub-population, age and participating sites. Enrolment to the trial will be via an&#xD;
      online platform following informed consent with a face to face screening visit. Subsequent&#xD;
      assessments, aside from an in person end of trial visit, will be done via email or telephone&#xD;
      together with utilising the routine collected health data thus reducing the burden to&#xD;
      participants as well as reducing their exposure to COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first arm of PROTECT-V is a double-blind placebo controlled trial of prophylactic&#xD;
      niclosamide (UNI911) against SARS-CoV2 infection in vulnerable populations. The trial will&#xD;
      enrol vulnerable patients with kidney or autoimmune diseases, including patients in receipt&#xD;
      of dialysis, kidney transplant recipients, individuals with vasculitis and glomerular disease&#xD;
      receiving immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Identification and Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants can be identified via a number of avenues including advertisements,&#xD;
      word of mouth, trial specific invitation letter, face to face and existing cohort studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PROTECT website will contain the information from the approved patient information&#xD;
           sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional information, including the detailed Participant Information Sheets will be&#xD;
           available from the local site study team and on the study website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be obtained by the Principal Investigator at each trial site or by a suitably&#xD;
      qualified and delegated health professional and member of the research team at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening and baseline visits may be readily combined in those patients who agree to&#xD;
      participation in the trial. Screening will be conducted at participating sites. Participants&#xD;
      attending the screening visit will be given a unique ID number to be used in all CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants who proceed to randomisation will be provided with the trial&#xD;
      specific Patient ID Card which includes details of the trial IMP and contact details of the&#xD;
      local study team and Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI or suitably qualified and delegated member of the study team will confirm the&#xD;
      eligibility of a participant by entering their screening data into the PROTECT eCRF web&#xD;
      portal. Once the full screening details have been entered and eligibility confirmed, the&#xD;
      participant will be randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation 1:1 to niclosamide or placebo nasal spray will be carried out using a web-based&#xD;
      randomisation system (Sealed Envelope) accessible via password-protected access.&#xD;
      Randomisation will be stratified by PROTECT disease sub-group, age and site using a&#xD;
      stratified block randomisation method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate allocation of treatment will be performed, with documentation of the decision in a&#xD;
      blinded confirmatory email. The system will allocate the participant treatment pack code(s)&#xD;
      which will relate uniquely to the first supply of IMP. Different treatment pack code(s) for&#xD;
      every subsequent order of IMP supply will be allocated by the randomisation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and site teams will remain blinded to treatment allocation. The allocated&#xD;
      blinded IMP supply will be collected by participants when possible or sent at least 3-monthly&#xD;
      to their home by courier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following sections describe the schedule of assessments that will be completed by&#xD;
      participants. Further details are available in the trial procedures manual (TPM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research-specific face-to-face visits as part of their trial participation will be kept to a&#xD;
      minimum and aligned with routine clinical follow up whenever possible, as healthcare contact&#xD;
      needs to be minimised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, telephone follow-up and&#xD;
      self-reporting of symptoms will be utilised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 70 dialysis participants will be included in a Population PK cohort. These&#xD;
      participants will have additional assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the primary endpoint (COVID-19 infection) will be captured on a monthly basis via&#xD;
      linkage with PHE and by direct reporting by sites or by participants. All subsequent&#xD;
      assessments will consist of self-completed questionnaires online or through telephone calls&#xD;
      from the local trial team. Data will be collected in real time through linkage with NHS&#xD;
      Digital or equivalent, ONS, ICNARC or other routine data sources as necessary. Data on death&#xD;
      will be reported by sites or obtained via linkage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone consultations - weeks 1,2,3, 4 and 6 (±3 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be telephoned by the local PI or research nurse and asked about the&#xD;
      treatment received and symptoms suggestive of potential side effects of niclosamide/placebo&#xD;
      or of COVID-19 infection, once every week for the first 4 weeks and then again on the sixth&#xD;
      week of the trial. If concerns are raised about potential side effects of&#xD;
      niclosamide/placebo, the information will be reviewed by the PI and a decision made whether&#xD;
      to continue IMP. Participants will be asked to keep a diary of IMP administration with&#xD;
      reasons for any missed doses. This will initially be provided in paper format but will also&#xD;
      be incorporated in the PROTECT smartphone app to provide participants with the option of&#xD;
      electronic IMP diaries if they prefer. The app will also allow participants to set reminders&#xD;
      and confirm when a given dose has been taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-Weekly self-reporting - week 8 onwards&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a short questionnaire regarding COVID-19&#xD;
      self-assessment/reporting and potential side effects of niclosamide/placebo, once every two&#xD;
      weeks during trial conduct via email (linking to the PROTECT data portal), via the PROTECT&#xD;
      smartphone app, in paper form via mail, or via telephone interview. Participants receiving in&#xD;
      centre haemodialysis may be assessed during their dialysis sessions. The intention of&#xD;
      two-weekly self-reporting is to provide participants with the opportunity to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  indicate any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection and/or positive result of&#xD;
           COVID-19 test,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adverse effects of IMP administration,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  report new concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  report vaccination against COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant has not submitted data electronically for a period of 6 weeks, they will be&#xD;
      contacted by the local study team for a telephone interview to minimise loss to follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment will be conducted in the first 30 participants&#xD;
      receiving niclosamide for safety purposes, to exclude the unlikely possibility of&#xD;
      accumulation of niclosamide during the course of the trial in patients receiving dialysis&#xD;
      only. Given that participants and investigators will be blinded to treatment allocation, PK&#xD;
      samples will maintain blinding by including the first 70 dialysis patients in the PK sampling&#xD;
      cohort. Including 70 participants is necessary to exclude the scenario where a chance&#xD;
      imbalance in treatment allocation early in the study results in fewer than 30 participants&#xD;
      allocated to niclosamide. These participants will be identified as the 'PK Cohort'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK Cohort will have a blood sample taken at the start of dialysis, before taking the IMP.&#xD;
      PK Cohort participants receiving dialysis in the afternoon or evening may take the morning&#xD;
      dose of IMP, but should omit the evening dose until the PK sample has been obtained. The&#xD;
      procedure for obtaining PK samples is described in the trial procedures manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK samples will be obtained 7 (±3) days after the date of first IMP dose (or coincident with&#xD;
      the 3rd dialysis session post-dating randomisation), 14 (±3) days and 21 (±3) days after date&#xD;
      of first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unscheduled assessment - &quot;suspected COVID-19 infection&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should an individual develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection, which are listed in&#xD;
      the Participant Information Sheet, they must arrange a COVID-19 test via the NHS Test and&#xD;
      Trace system, booking online or calling 119 to organise an appointment at their nearest&#xD;
      testing facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants should continue taking trial medication until advised to stop by a member of the&#xD;
      trial team or admitted to hospital. Participants must follow the current public health&#xD;
      guidance for &quot;suspected COVID-19 infection&quot; at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final safety assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTECT is an event driven trial. The anticipated median treatment duration per participant&#xD;
      is 6-9 months. However, the trial may conclude while some participants are in the trial for&#xD;
      less than 6 months if the required number of events are observed. Upon completion of the&#xD;
      trial, participants will be notified by email, PROTECT smartphone application or by telephone&#xD;
      depending on participant preference. Participants will be asked to stop taking IMP and&#xD;
      acknowledge receipt of end-of-trial notification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final safety assessment will be conducted in person, 4-6 weeks after the final treatment&#xD;
      (defined as the day of notification of end of trial or date of last dose administered).&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to return all completed medication diaries and IMP bottles for&#xD;
      compliance assessment at this visit. Participants will be asked a series of questions to&#xD;
      identify any additional adverse events or adverse reactions experienced since their last&#xD;
      follow up assessment and a blood sample will be taken for a SARS-CoV2 total antibody assay,&#xD;
      to detect asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTECT is an event driven trial. The median anticipated treatment period is 6 months with a&#xD;
      maximum treatment period of 9 months. Last follow-up visit will be scheduled 4-6 weeks after&#xD;
      last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be withdrawn at the discretion of the PI/CI if continuation in the trial is&#xD;
      deemed to be against the participant's best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be withdrawn if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants become pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant is hospitalized for COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant experiences unacceptable drug reaction such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Moderate or severe pain in the nose&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe itch or burning sensation in the nose&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Spontaneous nose bleeding as result of nasal ulceration&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Oedema that prevents breathing through the nose Participants who have been&#xD;
                withdrawn from the trial treatment and are experiencing ongoing toxicity will be&#xD;
                followed up until the adverse reaction comes to its conclusion. In the event of a&#xD;
                Participant being withdrawn from the trial treatment, they will continue to receive&#xD;
                the most appropriate standard of care treatment available under the guidance of&#xD;
                their treating clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue allocated treatment until one of the following occurs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The required number of the primary outcome events have occurred&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The participant is hospitalised with COVID-19 (see 4.10.2.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 28 Days after a diagnosis of COVID-19 if hospitalisation is not required&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may receive a diagnosis of COVID-19 during the course of participation in the&#xD;
      trial, either as a result of routine testing or prompted by suggestive symptoms. Any&#xD;
      participant diagnosed with COVID-19 should continue with their randomised treatment for 28&#xD;
      days after the date of diagnosis, unless hospitalised. Participants hospitalised with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of COVID-19 should stop the randomised treatment immediately.&#xD;
