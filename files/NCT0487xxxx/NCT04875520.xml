  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine the most effective SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy&#xD;
      for successful return of in-person school in the under-served communities of St. Louis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular screening testing has been recommended by the CDC as an additive mitigation strategy&#xD;
      for in-person schools in areas of high community transmission. We will compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness and acceptance of two different school-based testing strategies among students&#xD;
      and school staff (symptomatic testing only versus weekly surveillance testing plus&#xD;
      symptomatic testing), measuring school-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission through a cluster&#xD;
      randomized trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will complete a cluster randomized trial to compare the incidence of school-based&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 transmission between weekly screening testing of students and school staff versus&#xD;
      testing only symptomatic students and staff. In this proposal, 16 middle and high schools&#xD;
      from five school districts in the St. Louis metropolitan area will be cluster randomized to&#xD;
      screening testing plus symptomatic testing versus symptomatic testing alone. The symptomatic&#xD;
      testing will be provided to the entire school community as well as household members of&#xD;
      students and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second Aim will evaluate existing mitigation strategies utilized in schools and the rate&#xD;
      of school-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission by defining the mitigation strategies utilized in&#xD;
      participating schools through survey tools developed with CDC and their impact on&#xD;
      school-based COVID-19 transmission and quantifying the rate of COVID-19 transmission in&#xD;
      schools and the impact of this transmission on households through extensive interviews and&#xD;
      testing of contacts and household members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our 3rd Aim involves partnering with community-based organizations to specify and address the&#xD;
      social, ethical, and behavioral implications of in-person schooling during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 testing on the school and community. Listening sessions&#xD;
      will be utilized to understand barriers and facilitators to testing, ethical concerns of the&#xD;
      community in research participation, and the behavioral health impact of lack of in-person&#xD;
      schooling.&#xD;
