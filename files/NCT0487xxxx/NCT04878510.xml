    <textblock>
      Non-Invasive ventilation (NIV) is a life saving intervention for patients with acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure (ARF). Some patients are not able to tolerate the NIV intervention and&#xD;
      ultimately fail, requiring the use of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and intubation.&#xD;
      Sedation may improve a patient's NIV tolerance. However, this practice has not been adopted&#xD;
      by intensivists as the risk of over-sedation resulting in respiratory depression, inability&#xD;
      to protect the airway, and inadvertent need for intubation are all large deterrents of&#xD;
      sedative use in NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Non-invasive Ventilation and Dexmedetomidine in Critically Ill Adults: a Vanguard&#xD;
      Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial (inDEX) is looking to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine compared to placebo in reducing non-invasive ventilation failures in patients&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital with acute respiratory failure. The results from this pilot trial,&#xD;
      will subsequently inform a large, pragmatic, powered trial to definitively address the&#xD;
      question.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a life-saving intervention for patients with acute&#xD;
           respiratory failure (ARF). Patients may find NIV intolerable and ultimately fail NIV&#xD;
           requiring intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Sedation may improve a&#xD;
           patient's NIV tolerance. However, this practice has not been adopted by intensivists as&#xD;
           the risk of over-sedation resulting in respiratory depression, inability to protect the&#xD;
           airway, and inadvertent need for intubation are all large deterrents of sedative use in&#xD;
           NIV. Current guidelines lack recommendations on which sedative, if any at all, should be&#xD;
           used during NIV due to the paucity of reliable data. Dexmedetomidine (dex) is a&#xD;
           relatively new sedative. It promotes patient wakefulness, has no effect on respiratory&#xD;
           drive, has important analgesic properties, and when compared to Î³-aminobutyric acid&#xD;
           receptor agonists like benzodiazepines, reduces delirium. Dex has been recommended to&#xD;
           use over benzodiazepines for sedation during IMV in critically ill adults, particularly&#xD;
           if delirium is precluding weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           We hypothesize that dexmedetomidine, when compared to placebo, reduces NIV failure in&#xD;
           hospitalized adults with acute respiratory failure and agitation or NIV intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To evaluate the feasibility of assessing if dexmedetomidine compared to placebo results&#xD;
           in a reduction of non-invasive ventilation failure in patients admitted to the hospital&#xD;
           with acute respiratory failure. This will subsequently inform a large, pragmatic,&#xD;
           powered trial to definitively address the question.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Study design: The inDEX trial is a pragmatic, international, multi-centered, stratified,&#xD;
      randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled vanguard trial. Patients,&#xD;
      investigators, healthcare team, data collectors, outcome assessors, and the statistician will&#xD;
      be blinded to trial arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Allocation and randomization: Local Research Coordinators (RC) will randomize eligible&#xD;
      patients in a fixed 1:1 allocation using undisclosed variable block sizes of four, six, or&#xD;
      eight. The randomization will be achieved using a random number sequence prepared by an&#xD;
      independent statistician. The independent statistician will have access to the random number&#xD;
      sequence and it will be provided to the research pharmacist. Upon request by the local&#xD;
      research coordinator, the research pharmacist will provide the care team with either placebo&#xD;
      or dexmedetomidine, according to the randomization schedule. 4.3 Blinding: Both&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine and normal saline placebo will be given as continuous infusion. To minimize&#xD;
      performance and ascertainment biases, and maintain blinding of patients, investigators,&#xD;
      clinical staff, and RCs; a Research Pharmacist, who is not involved in assessment of patient&#xD;
      outcomes or patient care, will prepare infusion bags. Titration of the infusion rate for both&#xD;
      arms will follow an identical volume-based titration algorithm. Despite optimal blinding&#xD;
      efforts, it is possible that the care team may be able to determine who is receiving&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine based on improvement in NIV tolerance and/or the decrease in heart rate and&#xD;
      blood pressure. However, the cointerventions may also improve tolerance, and can certainly&#xD;
      cause a reduction in heart rate and blood pressure.&#xD;
