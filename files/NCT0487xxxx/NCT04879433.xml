  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of adjunctive cenobamate&#xD;
      treatment of adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy in &quot;real world&quot; clinical setting,&#xD;
      providing &quot;real world experience&quot; to help guide future cenobamate treatment. This will be an&#xD;
      open label study comparing seizure frequency during 52 weeks of baseline observation period&#xD;
      with seizure frequency during 52 weeks of adjunctive cenobamate maintanance treatment. ~100&#xD;
      adults aged 18-70 with severe refractory focal epilepsy with focal seizures that have failed&#xD;
      to respond to ≥ 4 antiseizure drugs (ASDs) +/- respective surgery +/- vagal nerve stimulator&#xD;
      (VNS), responsive nerve stimulator (RNS) or deep brain stimulator (DBS) treatment with&#xD;
      epilepsy duration of ≥ 2 years and followed by the Investigator and/or his epileptologist&#xD;
      colleagues at the Investigator's institution for ≥ 1 year will be enrolled. Patients will be&#xD;
      on ASDs deemed by the Investigator to have achieved the best seizure control to-date. No more&#xD;
      than 5 ASDs will be used. VNS, RNS and DBS will be allowed and not counted as an ASD.&#xD;
      However, patients on VNS, RNS or DBS will have to have had the device placed ≥ 6 months&#xD;
      before study initiation and have had stable stimulator settings for ≥ 3 months. Baseline will&#xD;
      include 52 weeks of prospectively kept, well documented seizure diaries that have been&#xD;
      regularly, prospectively reviewed by the treating epileptologist during 52 weeks prior to&#xD;
      study initiation. Retrospective review of these diaries will be allowed and count as&#xD;
      baseline. As an alternative to seizure diaries, well-documented seizure frequency obtained&#xD;
      during regular clinical visits, reviewed by the treating epileptologist and documented in the&#xD;
      patient's chart during regular clinical visits during the 52 weeks' baseline period will be&#xD;
      allowed in lieu of seizure diaries. ASDs will be held stable during the last month of&#xD;
      baseline observation period. Following a baseline of 52 weeks patients will be started on&#xD;
      cenobamate, administered orally in qhs, qd or b.i.d. schedule. Both starting dose and&#xD;
      titration schedule up to initial target dose of 100-250 mg will follow FDA approved&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cenobamate target dose will range from 100-400 mg/day. Within this range, the target dose&#xD;
      will be individualized and will be the dose when seizure freedom, intolerable TEAEs or 400&#xD;
      mg/day is reached, whichever occurs first Maintenance period will start when seizure freedom,&#xD;
      250 mg/day dose or maximum tolerated dose of ≥ 100 mg/day is reached, whichever comes first.&#xD;
      Maintenance treatment will last for 52 weeks. Total treatment period may vary between&#xD;
      subjects depending on titration and final dose, but maintenance treatment period will be 52&#xD;
      weeks for all subjects. During both titration and cenobamate treatment, reduction of the dose&#xD;
      of concomitant other ASDs will be allowed as clinically indicated; increase in the dose of&#xD;
      concomitant ASDs will not be allowed, nor will initiation of any new antiseizure therapy&#xD;
      other than cenobamate. Initiation of new antiseizure treatment or clinically indicated need&#xD;
      for increase of ASD other than cenobamate will end of the active part of the study, although&#xD;
      patients will be followed to the end of the 52 week maintenance treatment period.&#xD;
