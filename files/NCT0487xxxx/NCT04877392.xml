    <textblock>
      Clipping of the tongue-tie is a common procedure that neonatologists perform in our neonatal&#xD;
      unit to help establish breastfeeding. It is a painful technique where the measures healthcare&#xD;
      providers usually perform to control pain (such as sucking) cannot be done at the time of the&#xD;
      clipping because the technique is performed on the tongue. The aim of this study was to prove&#xD;
      that inhaled lavender essential oil during the clipping of the tongue-tie can help control&#xD;
      pain. Participants were newborns born at our hospital during the study period. They were&#xD;
      offered to participate and enrolled in the study if their parents agreed to and signed an&#xD;
      informed consent. The use of inhaled lavender essential oil is safe. No side effects have&#xD;
      been found with its use. The procedure of the frenotomy did not change for patients who were&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. By demonstrating that inhaled lavender essential oil helps reduce&#xD;
      pain, its use was included as part of the regular measures to control pain during frenotomies&#xD;
      at our neonatal unit (Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain). The study started in August 2020&#xD;
      and ended in April 2021.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial was conducted with the neonates born at our hospital or less&#xD;
      than 15 days old who underwent a frenotomy for type 3 tongue-ties according to Coryllos&#xD;
      classification and the Hazelbaker tool during the study period (August 2020 to April 2021).&#xD;
      Healthcare providers assessed pain by means of crying time and the highest Neonatal Infant&#xD;
      Pain Scale (NIPS) score in the five minutes post procedure, and whether there was an increase&#xD;
      in heart rate (HR) and decrease in oxygen saturation (satO2). NIPS evaluates facial&#xD;
      expression, crying, breathing pattern, arm and leg position, and state of arousal on a scale&#xD;
      from 0 to 7, where 0-2 means no pain to mild pain, 3-4 mild to moderate pain, and &gt;4 severe&#xD;
      pain. In an exploratory preliminary study prior to the intervention, a mean (SD) crying time&#xD;
      of 19.80 (21.14) seconds was observed. In order to detect a difference of 10 seconds in&#xD;
      crying time, a sample size of 71 patients per group was required in order to draw conclusions&#xD;
      with a CI 95% and a power of 80%. Patients were enrolled if their parents agreed to and&#xD;
      signed a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were recorded on demographic (gender, gestational age, birth weight, age in hours at the&#xD;
      time of frenotomy) and clinical variables (HR and satO2 before, during, and after the&#xD;
      procedure, whether there was crying or not during the procedure, length of crying time in&#xD;
      seconds, presence of side effects during the procedure (apnea, desaturation, others) and&#xD;
      highest NIPS score within the first 5 minutes after the procedure). The independent variable&#xD;
      was the use or not of aromatherapy during frenotomy. The dependent variables were: HR and&#xD;
      satO2 pre and post procedure, presence of crying and duration, hours of life at the time of&#xD;
      the frenotomy, and the NIPS score. The controlled variables were gestational age, sex, and&#xD;
      birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the newborns are assessed for the presence of ankyloglossia as part of the routine&#xD;
      neonatal evaluation and a frenotomy is offered to all tongue-tied patients. The examiner&#xD;
      grades the ankyloglossia based on Coryllos's criteria and the Hazelbaker tool to assess its&#xD;
      impact on tongue movement and on breastfeeding. A lingual frenulum is symptomatic if it&#xD;
      scores 8 points or less in appearance and/or 11 points or less in function according to&#xD;
      Hazelbaker. Advice and help with positioning and attachment for breastfeeding is provided to&#xD;
      all the mothers by IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant) nurses. During&#xD;
      the study period, if a patient with a type 3 tongue-tie was identified, the patient's parents&#xD;
      were offered to participate in this study. Accepted patients were allocated into case or&#xD;
      control group by simple random sampling using the program OxMAR (Online Minimization and&#xD;
      Randomization for Clinical Trials). During the frenotomy the neonate was taken to the&#xD;
      neonatal unit and monitored with a pulse-oximeter (COVIDIEN Nellcor Portable SpO2 Patient&#xD;
      Monitoring System PM10N, Covidien Ireland Limited, IDA Business &amp; Technology Park, Tullamore,&#xD;
      Ireland) before, during and after the procedure. For both groups, neonates were swaddled,&#xD;
      administered 1 mL of oral sucrose, and allowed to suck for 2 minutes prior to the procedure.&#xD;
      The experimental group also had a 7 x 7 cm gauze pad with 1 drop (43.75 mg) of 100% pure LEO&#xD;
      (Pranarôm España S.L.) placed 2 cm under their nose for 2 minutes prior to starting the&#xD;
      frenotomy and for the duration of the procedure. The bottle of LEO has a dropper that always&#xD;
      dispenses the same amount of oil per drop. The procedure did not start the procedure until&#xD;
      the patients were calm and had a NIPS score of 0. Frenotomy was performed by one of the three&#xD;
      staff neonatologists using Coryllos' technique: placing a sterile groove director under the&#xD;
      tongue straddling the frenulum, holding the frenulum in place with visualization of tongue&#xD;
      base and frenulum, and snipping the frenulum with a scissor along the underside of the tongue&#xD;
      to its base just proximal to the genioglossus muscle, until a full release is achieved. Once&#xD;
      the procedure was completed, the gauze pad was removed and vital signs, whether the baby&#xD;
      cried or not, the seconds crying lasted, and the post procedure NIPS score were registered on&#xD;
      a data collection sheet. If a neonate cried, calming techniques such as holding, swaddling,&#xD;
      and sucking were employed. Following the frenotomy, the neonate was returned to the mother&#xD;
      for breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Quantitative variables (gestational age, birth weight, age at&#xD;
      frenotomy, heart rate pre and post-procedure, increase in heart rate post-procedure, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation pre and post-procedure, decrease in oxygen saturation post-procedure, and duration&#xD;
      of crying) are described using the mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      (CI); case vs control groups were compared with a Student's t test. Gender, the presence of&#xD;
      crying, and adverse effects between the two groups are presented in percentages and compared&#xD;
      using Fisher's exact test. NIPS scores between cases and controls were compared with the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test. Statistical significance was set for a p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX,&#xD;
      USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hospital Ethics Committee (CEIm-PSMAR) approved this study (reference code: 2020/9373/I).&#xD;
      Prior to patient enrollment, a signed informed consent was obtained from the neonate's&#xD;
      parents. This study was conducted according to the ethics code of the Barcelona Medical&#xD;
      Association and the principles of the Helsinki-Fortaleza Declaration 2013.&#xD;
