  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive of breast cancers and it is&#xD;
      usually treated with chemotherapy even before surgery. In many cases, the chemotherapy&#xD;
      completely &quot;melts&quot; the tumor and these patients do well. When the tumor is not eliminated by&#xD;
      the chemotherapy, the patient receive more chemotherapy after surgery to decrease the chances&#xD;
      of it coming back. Yet many of these patients don't need that extra chemotherapy and will do&#xD;
      well in any case. One of the most exciting recent developments in cancer is the use of&#xD;
      &quot;liquid biopsies&quot;. It turns out that the tumor's DNA, RNA and proteins can be detected in&#xD;
      small vesicles found in the patient's blood. Thanks to advances in Artificial Intelligence,&#xD;
      there is now informatics tools to integrate many types of molecular information. Our&#xD;
      industrial partner, MIMs, will apply novel informatics tools to generate a test using all the&#xD;
      molecular information obtained from blood vesicles and tissue that will be able to find out&#xD;
      early if tumor has spread outside of the breast, and how much tumor is left after surgery.&#xD;
      The goal is hope to develop a multi-dimensional test for TNBC patients that can be used to&#xD;
      decide how much treatment they need and if treatment given after surgery is working.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: The most aggressive form of breast cancer is triple negative breast cancer (TNBC),&#xD;
      so called because these tumors do not express hormone receptors or HER2 receptor, and&#xD;
      therefore have no readily targetable molecules. Chemotherapy is the only treatment, with&#xD;
      chemoresistance signaling a very poor outcome even in early TNBC. The presence of residual&#xD;
      tumor at surgery (non-pathological complete response or non-pCR) signals chemoresistance and&#xD;
      poor prognosis, with about 30-40% of these patients dying of TNBC within the first 5 years&#xD;
      after surgery. A recent clinical trial showed that the addition of further chemotherapy&#xD;
      (Capecitabine) results in improved survival in these patients with non-pCR, although only&#xD;
      about 15% of such patients do benefit. One of the most urgent unmet needs is to identify&#xD;
      patients who will do well despite non-pCR (so as to avoid extra chemotherapy) and who will do&#xD;
      poorly despite it, and also to identify factors of poor prognosis that may lead to novel&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current state of advancement of the technology: Until now, no biomarker except BRCA1/2&#xD;
      mutations has demonstrated clinical utility in the treatment of TNBC, likely due to the&#xD;
      complex biology and heterogeneity of the disease. With the recent advances in Artificial&#xD;
      Intelligence methodology, combining and integrating several layers of molecular data to&#xD;
      predict outcome, until now challenging, becomes a reality. The hypothesize is that combining&#xD;
      multi-dimensional data of tumor and plasma EVs can facilitate the development of prognostic&#xD;
      and predictive signatures in this very aggressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data: Thanks to our Q-CROC-03 biopsy driven clinical trial where tumor and plasma&#xD;
      from patients with TNBC resistant to chemotherapy were collected. Whole exome seq data were&#xD;
      translated to generate personalized circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays. Our data shows a&#xD;
      potential prognostic value to the detection of ctDNA after pre-operative chemotherapy. There&#xD;
      is a collaboration established with Rodney Ouellette (ACRI) to isolate and profile&#xD;
      extracellular vesicles (EVs) from plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of the present study is to develop signatures of good and poor&#xD;
      outcome as well of tumor response to chemotherapy in TNBCs by integrating multidimensional&#xD;
      profiling of both tumor and liquid biopsies making use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental approach: EVs profiling from plasma collected in the Q-CROC-03 trial and the JGH&#xD;
      biobank (prior, during and after chemotherapy treatment) will be performed. Profiling will&#xD;
      include Whole Genome Sequencing (GWS), proteomics, transcriptomics and miRNA analysis. In&#xD;
      collaboration with our industrial partner, My Intelligent Machines (MIMs), experts in&#xD;
      bioinformatics and AI, machine-learning algorithms will be developed to integrate OMICs data&#xD;
      from resistant tumors with matched plasma EVs data and generate a tumor/plasma signature&#xD;
      associated with poor outcome. In parallel, in collaboration with the EXACTIS Innovation&#xD;
      Network, patients recruitment, collection of residual tumors post chemotherapy and matched&#xD;
      serial plasma samples during capecitabine treatment after surgery to perform the validation&#xD;
      of the signature identified, the tumor/EV signature will be associated with patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milestones of the proposed project: 1. Profiling of EVs from plasma. 2. Profiling of&#xD;
      chemoresistant tumors 3. Development of algorithms to integrate multidimensional data from&#xD;
      tumor and EVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The developed signatures will be IP protected. Academic and industrial partners will have&#xD;
      shared IP (respective % to be determined). Prognostic tests will be developed on identified&#xD;
      biomarkers and distributed through MIMsOmic Platform. MIMsOmic is an AI-powered platform&#xD;
      commercialized by MIMs and enabling an easy, efficient and cost-effective delivery of&#xD;
      clinical tests involving Omic data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project will develop a biomarker signature of poor prognosis for the most&#xD;
      aggressive type of breast cancer. This signature will allow the identification of patients&#xD;
      who should not be treated with post-surgery chemotherapy, and avoid unnecessary exposure to&#xD;
      the toxicity associated with this drug.&#xD;
