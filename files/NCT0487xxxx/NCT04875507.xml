  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positive psychology interventions use positive psychology techniques to identify meaning and&#xD;
      value in life events to raise positive feelings and emotions. Application of PPIs has&#xD;
      steadily increased in clinical and non-clinical samples. However, that meta-analysis did not&#xD;
      include any study in a Chinese population, and it remains unclear whether PPIs are applicable&#xD;
      in the Hong Kong Chinese context.&#xD;

      A random controlled trial will be conducted. A convenience sample of 120 patients age 13 to&#xD;
      17 years with no cognitive and/or behavioral problem(s) will be recruited in secondary school&#xD;
      around Kwai Chung Estate Participants will be randomized into experimental and control group.&#xD;
      The experimental group, who will receive a 1.5-hour workshop covering positive psychology&#xD;
      techniques delivered by a qualified research assistant, in groups of less than 5 people. The&#xD;
      control group will received no intervention. Data collection will be conducted at baseline, 1&#xD;
      week, 1month, 3months and 6 months for both groups.&#xD;
