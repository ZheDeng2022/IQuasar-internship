  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accessible and effective interventions for chronic diseases such as diabetes are especially&#xD;
      needed in the under-resourced patient population. This is a pilot randomized control trial&#xD;
      compares usual diabetic care to usual diabetic care plus virtual health coaching utilizing&#xD;
      lifestyle action plans in under-resourced adult type II diabetic patients. This is a one-site&#xD;
      study at an under-resourced family medicine residency clinic. The primary outcome is the&#xD;
      change of insulin resistance as measured by HOMA2-IR. Secondary metabolic outcomes are being&#xD;
      tracked. Potentially confounding variables related to SDoH, race, and engagement in health&#xD;
      coaching are being assessed for. The cost of the intervention as well as expensive healthcare&#xD;
      utilization as measured by ER visits are also being tracked.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Those having difficulty with SDoH (Social Determinants of Health) are associated with a&#xD;
      higher incidence of diabetes as well as worse health outcomes. Inexpensive, effective virtual&#xD;
      options for chronic diseases conducive to all levels of socio-economic status would be very&#xD;
      beneficial. As early as 1934 there have been reports of nutritional interventions preventing&#xD;
      and reversing DMII. A recent randomised trial utilizing meal replacement and caloric&#xD;
      restriction noted greater diabetes remission rates with greater weight loss. Despite&#xD;
      knowledge that weight and dietary factors are at the foundation of DMII incidence, control&#xD;
      and even remission, it is challenging to find accessible, effective, community-based&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Culturally sensitive health coaches trained to use motivational interviewing to create&#xD;
      specific, measurable, attainable, reasonable and time-bound (S.M.A.R.T.) action plans through&#xD;
      shared-decision making and thus personalized to the patients' literacy, resources and&#xD;
      motivation level may overcome some of these cultural and literacy barriers. Accessibility is&#xD;
      further increased by utilizing phone and text. This allows for low-tech, inexpensive remote&#xD;
      patient monitoring. This real-time feedback may further increase patient self-efficacy and&#xD;
      engagement. While using health coaching methods may improve diabetic control, the exact&#xD;
      content of what should be delivered is unexplored. The mixed results of diabetes remission&#xD;
      rates in dietary intervention studies is attributed to delivery of too low a &quot;therapeutic&#xD;
      dose&quot; of lifestyle change. Therefore, it is postulated that health coaches personalizing the&#xD;
      behavioral interventions that may be most effective in controlling and reversing diabetes may&#xD;
      improve insulin resistance in a real-world primary-care based setting to those most&#xD;
      challenged by barriers to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot randomized control trial comparing usual care to usual care plus virtual&#xD;
      health coaching utilizing lifestyle action plans in adult type II diabetic patients. This is&#xD;
      a one-site study at an under-resourced family medicine residency clinic. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is the change of insulin resistance as measured by HOMA2-IR. Secondary metabolic outcomes are&#xD;
      being tracked. Potentially confounding variables related to SDoH, race, and engagement in&#xD;
      health coaching are being assessed for. The cost of the intervention as well as expensive&#xD;
      healthcare utilization as measured by ER visits are also being tracked.&#xD;

    <description>For the duration of the 12 weeks, Healthy at Home will provide health coaching in 10-20 minute phone calls weekly. They will request daily blood glucose logs as this is part of Healthy at Home's normal procedure. The health coach and subject will choose a patient-directed overarching goal such as &quot;lose weight,&quot; or improve my blood sugar numbers,&quot; etc. that the health coach will then help the patient turn into a SMART goal. They will do this by utilizing a list of lifestyle change categories as top priority goals from which to choose from in their patient-directed health coaching sessions. Texting will be utilized to request daily blood glucose and provide real-time coaching via text.</description>

    <description>Culturally sensitive health coaches trained in motivational interviewing provide 10-20 minutes of weekly phone-based health coaching. They not only guide the patient in creating a SMART goal, but assess and build off of the previous weeks' goal and problem-solve with the patient. During the week, the coach and patient text regarding daily blood glucose monitoring with real-time feedback and coaching about the implementation of the patients' goal.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes (Hemoglobin A1C 6.5% or higher in the last year) who are regular patients of&#xD;
             E. Blair Warner Clinic. English or Spanish speaking patients will be included who are&#xD;
             between 18 and 65 years old with a working phone. Subjects recently started on or&#xD;
             taking a short dose of medications that are known to influence insulin resistance&#xD;
             (i.e. atypical antipsychotics, steroids, thiazides). Subjects (and their providers) on&#xD;
             chronic doses of these medications will be asked to keep the dose the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose preferred language is not English or Spanish will be excluded due to&#xD;
             lack of health coaches speaking other languages. Approximately 50% of C-peptide is&#xD;
             cleared by the kidney and some studies excluded advanced renal failure. For our study&#xD;
             subjects with chronic renal failure with a GFR &lt;45 on most recent blood work will be&#xD;
             excluded. Subjects with conditions known to influence insulin resistance (i.e.&#xD;
             pregnancy, hemochromatosis, polytransfused individuals) will be excluded. Subjects&#xD;
             with syndromic obesity (i.e. hypothalamic obesity, pradi-willi syndrome) or type I&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus will be excluded. Subjects with diagnosed diseases that would hinder&#xD;
             giving consent or participating in health coaching (i.e. dementia, cognitive&#xD;
             impairment) will be excluded. Subjects who have attended an intensive lifestyle change&#xD;
             program and/or made an impacting lifestyle change in the last 3 months, such as losing&#xD;
             5% or more of their body weight in the last 3 months will also be excluded.&#xD;
