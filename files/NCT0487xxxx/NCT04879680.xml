      Background Radio Isotopes and Blue dye alone or in combination are the most commonly used&#xD;
      tracer agents in sentinel Node Biopsy for early breast cancer. Recent studies have found&#xD;
      fluorescence method using Indo Cyanine Green as a promising technology with fewer&#xD;
      disadvantages. This study represents the first within a North African setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Retrospective analysis of our database that includes patients with clinically&#xD;
      node-negative breast cancer scheduled for breast surgery and SN biopsy between 2016 and&#xD;
      January 2021. Patients who underwent detection using fluorescence-ICG were included in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      We performed a retrospective review our data base that includes breast cancer planned for&#xD;
      sentinel node biopsy at the F. Hached University teaching hospital(Sousse, Tunisia). Data&#xD;
      between April 2016 and January 2021 were reviewed. Only non-pregnant or lacting adult female&#xD;
      patients without palpable clinical node and considered suitable for such procedure at&#xD;
      multidisciplinary meeting were included. We excluded from our analysis the first ten cases&#xD;
      considered as a learning curve Same operator (SH) carried out all the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under general anesthesia 5 ml at 2.5mg/ml of Infracyanine ® were injected circumferentially&#xD;
      around the areola. Two ml of patent blue-V dye (Laboratoire Guerbet, Aulney-Sous-Bois,&#xD;
      France) were injected in combination in the cohort of patients undergoing the procedure after&#xD;
      primary chemotherapy. This was followed by a breast massage to facilitate absorption into the&#xD;
      lymph vessels, then the surgical lights were turned off and image were obtained under&#xD;
      near-infrared light using a first generation Near Infra Red device . Course of subcutaneous&#xD;
      lymphatic drainage pathway fluorescence was followed up to where it disappeared to enter to&#xD;
      deeper axilla and an incision was performed at that place. Lymphatic duct identification&#xD;
      using the NIR camera allowed localization and removal of the sentinel lymph node(s). Further&#xD;
      fluorescent imaging was performed to identify potential residual signal in the axilla and&#xD;
      such signal-sites were removed. Following ICG assisted-dissection, blue-stained nodes were&#xD;
      excised if any. All detected sentinel node were send for frozen section and processed for&#xD;
      histological examination. After sentinel node biopsy, conservative surgery or mastectomy were&#xD;
      performed according to indication and axillary dissection was performed according to&#xD;
      international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Baseline patient's and tumor characteristics, Identification Rate of the&#xD;
      sentinel node with Indocyanine green and with dye , when used, were recorded. Data were&#xD;
      entered and analyzed in Excel. The continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation and categorical variables are presented as count and percentages unless specified.&#xD;
      Informed consents from each patient and IRB approval were obtained&#xD;
