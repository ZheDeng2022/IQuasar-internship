  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) affect approximately 8% of babies in the UK and is the&#xD;
      worldwide leading cause of death in children under the age of 5. Subclinical infection&#xD;
      affects approximately 50% of women giving birth before 32 weeks. Infection contributes to&#xD;
      significant neonatal morbidity and mortality. Antibiotics such as erythromycin is currently&#xD;
      used to treat women who present with preterm rupture of membranes. While this has shown&#xD;
      short-term improvement in neonatal morbidity, it has not had any impact in reducing the&#xD;
      perinatal mortality and also little effect on the health of the children at age seven. Some&#xD;
      antibiotics such as co-amoxiclav has not shown to be effective in delaying delivery and some&#xD;
      studies have shown that antibiotics increases rather than reduces the risk of cerebral palsy.&#xD;
      Many women do not display signs of infection and the underlying bacteria is multifactorial&#xD;
      (bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, gonorrhoea, Chlamydia, ureaplasma, Group B&#xD;
      streptococcal and E. Coli) and remains a diagnostic challenge. The only available clinical&#xD;
      approach is to test the sample of amniotic fluid for bacteria and small case series have&#xD;
      shown prolongation of pregnancy when accurately targeted antibiotic treatment is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to prove that targeted antibiotic therapy results in a greater&#xD;
      prolongation of pregnancy than standard management for women with preterm prelabour rupture&#xD;
      of membranes (PPROM) and/or threatened preterm labour (tPTL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be randomised to standard care versus BioFire directed antibiotic treatment in&#xD;
      addition to standard care. Investigators will use the BioFire point of care testing to&#xD;
      identify the presence of infection and identify with anti-microbial resistance genes the&#xD;
      bacteria possess to guide the antibiotic treatment. To be certain that the presence of&#xD;
      infection is detected the investigators will use PCR to test the amniotic fluid for IL-6 and&#xD;
      white cell count.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall 10-15% of women delivering before 37 weeks have intraamniotic infection and of those&#xD;
      delivering before 32 weeks have 50% chance. Consequently, since infection is one of the most&#xD;
      important causes of spontaneous PTL it is possible that antibiotic treatment may delay&#xD;
      delivery and reduce the risk of fetal damage and consequently long-term disability. However,&#xD;
      most cases do not display typical symptoms or signs of infection, the only way to make the&#xD;
      diagnosis reliably is through performing an amniocentesis. The risk of this procedure is low&#xD;
      in the 3rd trimester and should be considered particularly in those in PTL at less than 32&#xD;
      weeks, when the risk of infection is high. Studies in non-human primate models of&#xD;
      intra-amniotic infection support for this approach, showing that specific antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      can prevent infection-induced PTL and prolong pregnancy with improved neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human studies have been less positive, with antibiotics failing to prolong pregnancy in PTL&#xD;
      or eradicate infection in PPROM. The Oracle trial assessed the ability of two antibiotics,&#xD;
      erythromycin and co-amoxiclav, to reduce the risk of PTD in women with PPROM using a&#xD;
      composite primary outcome of neonatal death, chronic lung disease, or major cerebral&#xD;
      abnormality on ultrasonography before discharge from hospital. Erythromycin, but not&#xD;
      co-amoxiclav, reduced the risk of the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two recent papers have challenged this negative view of the use of antibiotics for&#xD;
      intraamniotic infection. In the first, amniocentesis was performed to identify infection or&#xD;
      inflammation and broad-spectrum antibiotics administered to women with a singleton pregnancy&#xD;
      presenting with tPTL at between 20 and 34 weeks. Infection was thought to be present in at&#xD;
      least 60% of cases as judged by the presence of a raised WCC, although only 20% had positive&#xD;
      cultures using standard microbiological approaches. 100% had an elevated IL-6 level&#xD;
      confirming inflammation. Repeat amniocentesis confirmed resolution of inflammation in all&#xD;
      cases and overall average prolongation was 11.4 days. In a control group not given&#xD;
      antibiotics average prolongation was 3 days. In 3 cases infection was shown to be cleared by&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment. In the second report, women undergoing rescue cerclage had an&#xD;
      amniocentesis and those found to have evidence of infection or inflammation treated with&#xD;
      broad spectrum antibiotics. A repeat amniocentesis demonstrated resolution of&#xD;
      infection/inflammation with antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to recruit women to a multicenter randomised trial of standard management&#xD;
      vs. amniocentesis with the use of BioFire filmArray point of care testing to identify the&#xD;
      presence of bacteria and identify common anti-microbial resistance genes the bacteria possess&#xD;
      to guide the selection of an additional antibiotic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BioFire filmArray clinical application is currently being studied in patients with&#xD;
      pneumonia in the INHALE study. Investigators plan to use the BioFire filmArray in a maternity&#xD;
      setting and will use the information generated by the BioFire filmArray platform to give&#xD;
      targeted antibiotics in the amniocentesis arm in addition to routine erythromycin with the&#xD;
      aim of prolonging latency to delivery and of improving neonatal outcome.&#xD;
