  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current smoking cessation interventions are focused only on smoking behaviors, and drinking&#xD;
      habits are generally overlooked. The aims of the project is to examine the feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing an integrated smoking cessation and alcohol abstinence intervention in young&#xD;
      Hong Kong Chinese smokers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial. (1)The standard treatment group ,&#xD;
      participants will receive a brief smoking cessation intervention based on the '5A' and '5R'&#xD;
      model, then the RA will assist the participants to quit smoking using the STAR method. (2)&#xD;
      For the alcohol intervention group, participants will also receive a brief smoking cessation&#xD;
      intervention with the models as the ST group. After that they will receive a brief advice on&#xD;
      alcohol use based on the FRAMES model. Then the RA will invite participants to complete the&#xD;
      Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test(AUDIT). (3) For the Control group, participants&#xD;
      will be provide with two leaflets, one for smoking cessation and another for alcohol&#xD;
      abstinence. All the data collection will be conducted at baseline, 1 week, 1 month , 3 months&#xD;
      and 6 months for follow up.&#xD;

Then the RA will invite participants to complete the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and provide personalized feedback. There will be a one to one, 20-30 minutes semi-structured interviews with 30 participants. Participants with high(N=15) and low (N=15) adherence will be purposively selected. A booster intervention will be given over the phone at 1-week, 1month, 3-month, and 6 month follow-up.</description>
