      The present study aims at assessing the ability of a new pulse contour device for diagnosing&#xD;
      a &gt;15% stroke volume (SV) increase during patient hemodynamic optimization by fluid challenge&#xD;
      in high risk abdominal surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In European countries, day-7 mortality rate could reach 1-5. %. Emergency conditions,&#xD;
      American Society Assessment (ASA) and major surgery were associated with a higher risk of&#xD;
      immediate mortality. Moreover, hemodynamic instability is well known to lead to postoperative&#xD;
      complications and a higher risk of mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since, nearly 30 years, optimization of hemodynamic conditions, especially via an&#xD;
      optimization of the fluid administration has been shown to improve immediate and long-term&#xD;
      patient outcome. This strategy is currently widely accepted and recommended in medium and&#xD;
      high-risk surgery. Therefore, optimizing cardiac output and one of its surrogate is proposed&#xD;
      over intraoperative surgery. For assessing the cardiac output or the indexed stroke volume,&#xD;
      esophageal Doppler and pulse contour technique have been proposed and have shown that they&#xD;
      could improve patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the reliability of esophageal Doppler, pulse contour and non-invasive techniques&#xD;
      assessing cardiac output and its ability to detect a change in the initial value of CO have&#xD;
      been challenged. Initially, the reliability of a technique for measuring CO has been&#xD;
      described by using a correlation coefficient and by building Bland &amp; Altman diagram. However,&#xD;
      searching a correlation between two different techniques measuring the same parameter will&#xD;
      lead to a correlation. In the same, Bland &amp; Altman technique shows the mean difference&#xD;
      between measurements of the same parameters; However, demonstrating a good reliability should&#xD;
      be shown by a narrow limit of agreement with no definition of the narrowness. Indeed, a value&#xD;
      of cardiac index (CI) = 3 l/min/m2 with a mean difference of 0 +/- 1.1 /min/m2 by Bland &amp;&#xD;
      Altman technique mean that the CI value could be within 1 and 5 l/min/m2 that could lead to&#xD;
      different treatment such as fluid challenge, vasopressor or inotrope infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interesting method for comparing two techniques measuring the same parameter could be to&#xD;
      challenge one technique versus the other one in decision-making. Applying this method to&#xD;
      techniques measuring CO, we could search for the interest of a new technique for diagnosing&#xD;
      an increase in CO after a fluid challenge for optimizing cardiac preload and hemodynamic&#xD;
      status. Esophageal Doppler is classically recommended for optimizing hemodynamic patient in&#xD;
      high-risk surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new device using pulse contour technology has been available since a few years. Therefore,&#xD;
      the present study aims at assessing the ability of this device for diagnosing an increase in&#xD;
      CO &gt; 15% during patient hemodynamic optimization by fluid challenge.&#xD;
