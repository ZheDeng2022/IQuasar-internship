    <textblock>
      This study aims to elicit patient experiences, choices, and side effects associated with the&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine after breast cancer surgery. Lymph node swelling is a known and common side&#xD;
      effect of both the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. This is the body's normal reaction&#xD;
      to the vaccine. It is worrisome that lymph node swelling after the vaccine mimics that found&#xD;
      in breast cancer which has spread to the lymph nodes. This side effect will cause worry and&#xD;
      anxiety amongst patients as a result. For patients who have had lymph node removal (axillary&#xD;
      lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy) and are at risk of lymphedema, the&#xD;
      investigators are concerned that the lymph node swelling may tax the lymphatic system and&#xD;
      incite lymphedema in those at risk or worsen it in those with BCRL. Fear of lymphedema is&#xD;
      high in this population and the investigators need to better understand what risk, if any,&#xD;
      lymph node swelling after the COVID-19 vaccine imparts to BCRL risk.&#xD;

      -  Hypothesis 1: Patients will choose to receive the vaccine on the arm contralateral to&#xD;
           axillary lymph node removal, or in the lower extremity if they have had bilateral&#xD;
           axillary lymph node removal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: Patients with a history of breast cancer will experience axillary lymph&#xD;
           node swelling after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine at the same rate as the general&#xD;
           population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 3: Patients with axillary surgery who develop lymph nodes swelling in the&#xD;
           ipsilateral side might be at increased risk of developing lymphedema&#xD;
