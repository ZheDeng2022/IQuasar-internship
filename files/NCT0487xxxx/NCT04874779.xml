  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Within a year, COVID-19 has advanced from being an outbreak to a pandemic,&#xD;
      spreading rapidly and globally with devastating impact. Currently, there is an ongoing debate&#xD;
      among scientists about the pathophysiological relationship between COVID-19 and acute kidney&#xD;
      injury (AKI). While a few studies have concluded that the mechanisms of AKI in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients are seemingly multifactorial and have not been fully explicated, others asserted&#xD;
      that AKI remains rare among COVID-19-related diseases. Considering this knowledge-gap and its&#xD;
      potential impact on the management of COVID-19-associated AKI, our study aims to explore the&#xD;
      prevalence of AKI and to identify possible risk factors associated with AKI development among&#xD;
      COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Materials and Methods. This retrospective cohort study&#xD;
      included 83 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at AL-AHRAR Hospital, Zagazig, Egypt, between&#xD;
      June and August,2020. Exclusion criteria were: patients younger than 18 years of age;&#xD;
      diagnosed with end stage kidney disease; placed on maintenance dialysis; booked for a kidney&#xD;
      transplant or on nephrotoxic medications. All patients included in the study underwent&#xD;
      complete blood count; liver and renal function tests; examination of hemostasis parameters;&#xD;
      inflammatory markers; serum electrolytes; routine urinalysis; arterial blood gas and&#xD;
      non-enhanced chest and abdominal computer tomography (CT) scans&#xD;

      2.1. Study design and participants. Retrospective observational single-center study,&#xD;
      including (83) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (age ≥ 18 years), hospitalized and&#xD;
      isolated in the medical departments of AL-AHRAR Hospital, Zagazig, Egypt, from June 23 to&#xD;
      August 29, 2020. All patients were isolated in the medical departments. None of them were&#xD;
      admitted to the ICU or underwent mechanical ventilation. According to the WHO guidelines, a&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result of a quantitative real-time&#xD;
      reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection in a nasopharyngeal swab.&#xD;
      (9) We excluded the following from this study: patients younger than 18 years, patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with chronic kidney disease before admission, patients on maintenance dialysis or&#xD;
      awaiting renal transplantation and patients taking any nephrotoxic medications a week prior&#xD;
      to admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Data collection. The patients' medical history, underlying diseases, medications&#xD;
      administered at home and in hospital, laboratory data, non-enhanced chest and abdominal&#xD;
      computer tomography (CT) scans, were retrieved from electronic medical records. According to&#xD;
      the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), Egypt Management protocol for COVID-19&#xD;
      Patients, version 1.4, 30th May,2020, (10), all patients received standard of care treatment&#xD;
      including: (a) oxygen supply to achieve SaO2 ≥ 90%; (b) Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice in&#xD;
      first day then 200 mg twice for 6 days); (C) Vitamin C (1gm daily); (d) Zinc (50mg daily);&#xD;
      (e) Acetylcysteine 200 mg t.d.s.; (f) lactoferrin one sachet twice daily; (g) Anticoagulation&#xD;
      if D-dimer &gt; 1000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs using&#xD;
      Thermofisher SCIENTIFIC's TaqPathTM COVID 19 CE IVD RT PCR Kit, 1000 reactions (Cat. No.&#xD;
      A48067). The QUIAGEN extraction kit was used to extract viral RNA. Using Quick Dx Applied&#xD;
      Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR instruments, the purified nucleic acid was reverse transcribed&#xD;
      into cDNA and amplified using the TaqPathTM COVID 19 RT PCR Kit in one stage. Probes annealed&#xD;
      to three unique SARS-CoV-2 target sequences: ORF1ab, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S)&#xD;
      primers/probes for bacteriophage MS2. The result was deemed null because two of the three&#xD;
      genes and the MS2 (positive control) were all positive. COVID-19 was diagnosed whenever a&#xD;
      positive real-time RT-PCR result was identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. Laboratory procedures. Laboratory data included complete blood count by automated blood&#xD;
      counter, liver and renal function tests by colorimetric method, examination of hemostasis&#xD;
      parameters, inflammatory markers, serum Na, Serum K, serum Ca, urine dipstick test and&#xD;
      arterial blood gas analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5. Definitions. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified according to the guidelines of&#xD;
      Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). It is defined as any of the following: (I)&#xD;
      an S.cr increase ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 h; or (II) an S.cr increase to ≥1.5&#xD;
      times baseline within the previous 7 days; or (III) a urine volume ≤0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 h. AKI&#xD;
      is staged for severity according to the criteria presented in Table (1). (11) Urine output&#xD;
      criteria were not used consistently for the diagnosis of AKI due to a lack of daily urine&#xD;
      measurement in the electronic chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was developed as a morbidity severity&#xD;
      score to focus on organ dysfunction, which can reliably predict disease severity and outcome.&#xD;
      It includes 6 variables, each representing an organ system presented in Table (2). (12)&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses. The SPSS software, version 26, was used for statistical analysis. ANOVA&#xD;
      and univariate logistic regression analysis [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      (CI)] were performed (significance level: P &lt; 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics statement. In order to maintain and ascertain the rights of patients without&#xD;
      jeopardizing their privacy and confidentiality, informed verbal consents, in lieu of written&#xD;
      informed consents, were obtained directly from all patients or their relatives. The&#xD;
      requirements to obtain written informed consents were not attainable due to the inherent&#xD;
      hazardous and contagious nature of COVID-19 epidemic, the strict restrictions by the hospital&#xD;
      management, and the urgency of collecting the data.&#xD;
