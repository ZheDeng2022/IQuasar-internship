  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vedolizumab is a medicine that is currently prescribed for adults with moderately to severely&#xD;
      active ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, adults with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease will be treated with&#xD;
      vedolizumab according to their clinic's standard practice. The main aim of the study is to&#xD;
      check if participants have side effects from vedolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sponsor will not be involved in how participants are treated but will provide&#xD;
      instructions on how the clinics will record what happens during the study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, prospective study of participants with UC or CD who are&#xD;
      prescribed and will start vedolizumab in the real word setting for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of vedolizumab in a routine clinical&#xD;
      practice setting under real world conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 750 participants. The data will be prospectively&#xD;
      collected, at the centers from routinely scheduled follow-up visits and recorded into&#xD;
      electronic data capture (eDC). All participants will be enrolled in a single observational&#xD;
      group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Participants with UC or CD&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall duration of the study will be&#xD;
      approximately 72 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Ulcerative Colitis (UC) Achieving Clinical Response Based on Partial Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response in UC is defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 2 points reduction in partial mayo clinic score and &gt;=25 percent (%) decrease from baseline score accompanied with &gt;=1 point decrease in rectal bleeding sub-score or absolute rectal bleeding sub-score less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1 point. Partial mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consists of 3 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician rating of disease activity, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9; where higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Crohn's Disease (CD) Achieving Clinical Response Based on Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response in CD is defined as &gt;=3-point decrease in the HBI score. HBI score is used to measure disease activity of CD. It consists of clinical parameters: general well-being (0 equal to [=] very well to 4 = terrible), abdominal pain (0 = none to 3 = severe), number of liquid or soft stools per day, abdominal mass (0 = none to 3 = definite and tender), and complications (8 items; 1 score per item). The total score is sum of sub scores, where score less than (&lt;) 5 = remission, 5 to 7 = mild disease activity, 8 to 16 = moderate disease activity and greater than (&gt;) 16 = severe disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With UC Achieving Clinical Remission Based on Partial Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 54</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission in UC is defined as partial mayo clinic score &lt;=2 with no sub-score &gt;1. Partial mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consists of 3 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician rating of disease activity, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9; where higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 54</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission in CD is defined as HBI score of &lt;=4 points. HBI score is used to measure disease activity of CD. It consists of clinical parameters: general well-being (0 = very well to 4 = terrible), abdominal pain (0 = none to 3 = severe), number of liquid or soft stools per day, abdominal mass (0 = none to 3 = definite and tender), and complications (8 items; 1 score per item). The total score is sum of sub scores, where score &lt;5 = remission, 5 to 7 = mild disease activity, 8 to 16 = moderate disease activity and &gt;16 = severe disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With UC Achieving Endoscopic Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 54</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic remission in UC is defined as mayo endoscopic sub-score &lt;=1. Mayo endoscopic subscore (findings on endoscopy), each graded from 0 to 3 where 0 = Normal mucosa or inactive disease, 1 = Mild activity (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability), 2 = Moderate activity (marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, erosions), 3 = Severe activity (spontaneous bleeding, large ulcerations). Higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>
