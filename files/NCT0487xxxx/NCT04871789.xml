  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      200 participants should be included in the study. There will be three groups: 100&#xD;
      participants with a severe course of the disease 3 months ago, 50 asymptomatic carriers of&#xD;
      coronavirus infection 3 months ago and 50 people who were in close contact with patients with&#xD;
      confirmed coronavirus infection 3 months ago, but not sick and without antibodies to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two visits. At the first visit, after signing the consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study, a screening examination will be performed to assess the criteria&#xD;
      for inclusion and exclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the second visit, patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not have exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will undergo clinical and instrumental examination, and biological samples will be&#xD;
      collected for laboratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine the most significant clinical and laboratory markers of&#xD;
      the severity of the outcomes in the period of convalescence of the new coronavirus infection&#xD;
      COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory indicators, the number and severity of signs of postcovid&#xD;
      syndrome as well as pathological changes in lung tissue according to CT data in the group&#xD;
      with covid pneumonia and indicators of immune status, hemostasis, endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
      inflammation, metabolism will be assessed.&#xD;
