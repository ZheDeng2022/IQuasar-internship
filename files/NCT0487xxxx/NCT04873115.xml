      final visit of the double-blind period at D84. After the D84 assessment, patients will be&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 4, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial, multicentre study&#xD;
      conducted in France to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glycopyrronium bromide (Sialanar®)&#xD;
      versus placebo in addition to Standard of Care (SOC) management (rehabilitation) in children&#xD;
      with severe sialorrhea related to chronic neurodisabilities, i.e cerebral palsy, Angelman&#xD;
      syndrome, Rett's syndrome, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and mental retardation.&#xD;
      The patient population will be children aged from 3 to 17-year-old with severe sialorrhea due&#xD;
      to chronic neurological disorders, defined as a score of at least 6 on the modified Teachers&#xD;
      Drooling Scale (mTDS), after at least 3 months of non pharmalogical rehabilitation. A total&#xD;
      of 80 patients who meet the eligibility criteria (see section 6.3) will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. General eligibility criteria will be assessed and the DIS scale (French validated&#xD;
      version) performed at the enrolment visit. Patients, enrolled in the study, will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive the study drug in a doubleblind fashion, either Sialanar® of placebo.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the 2- treatment arms with no&#xD;
      additional stratification. Patients will receive the study drug, an oral solution, 3 times&#xD;
      daily during the 3-month blind period. The titration will be performed during the first 5&#xD;
      weeks as detailed in section 7.1.3 Outpatient visits will occur at D28 and D84. Telephone&#xD;
      interviews will occur every week during the titration period and at D56.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The double-blind placebo-controlled study duration will be scheduled for 3 months with the&#xD;
      final visit of the double-blind period at D84. After the D84 assessment, patients will be&#xD;
      invited to continue into a 6-month open-label study extension (OLSE) with ex-Sialanar®&#xD;
      patients continuing the treatment and ex-placebo patients starting Sialanar®. An period of&#xD;
      titration will be performed for patients starting Sialanar®, monitored by weekly telephone&#xD;
      interviews. Telephone interviews will also be scheduled at D140. Clinic visit will be&#xD;
      scheduled at D168 for all patients. Final OLSE visit will occur at D252. Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed for disease response with the Drooling Impact Scale (DIS) including 10 items rated&#xD;
      on a scale from 1 to 10 at D0 and during follow-up visits at D28, D84 and D252. Quality of&#xD;
      Life will be evaluated through the DISABKIDS self-reported instrument completed by parents/&#xD;
      caregivers as well as children, when possible. Adverse events will be collected at every&#xD;
      visit from parent or carer and participant where possible. All adverse events will be&#xD;
      recorded at every scheduled visit plus outside of visits as required. All SAEs and SUSARs&#xD;
      will be recorded and reported as per standard EMA guidelines (cf. Section 9.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study will approximately be 15 months including 6 months of enrolment and&#xD;
      9 months of follow up from the last patient enrolled (3 months for the blind period and 6&#xD;
      months for the OLSE). The end of the blind period will correspond to the last patient&#xD;
      completed D84 visit. The end of the OLSE will correspond to the last patient completed D252&#xD;
      visit. After all patients complete the blind period, the final analysis of the primary&#xD;
      outcome (change in DIS at D84) will be performed. The follow up analysis of the OLSE period&#xD;
      will be carried after all patients ended the study. All safety data will be analysed&#xD;
      regardless of the outcome of the trial.&#xD;
