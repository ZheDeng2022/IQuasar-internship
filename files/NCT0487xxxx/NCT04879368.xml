      To determine if the regorafenib and nivolumab combination (RegoNivo) improves overall&#xD;
      survival compared with current standard chemotherapy options in refractory AGOC.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this international study is to determine if the combination of regorafenib and&#xD;
      nivolumab is more effective than standard chemotherapy in prolonging overall survival in a&#xD;
      broad group of participants with AGOC, who have progressed after treatment with standard&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the INTEGRATE study, regorafenib alone was shown to be effective in prolonging the&#xD;
      progression-free period in people with AGOC following standard anti-cancer therapy (i.e. it&#xD;
      delayed tumour growth), and demonstrated a potential benefit on long term survival. Recent&#xD;
      research has shown the early results from this combination of regorafenib &amp; nivolumab may&#xD;
      improve outcomes for cancer patients. INTEGRATE IIb will investigate this effect further in a&#xD;
      larger group of participants with AGOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Whether the combination of regorafenib/nivolumab is likely to help patients with AGOC live&#xD;
      longer; ii. The effects of this treatment on progression-free survival; iii. The numbers of&#xD;
      participants responding to the treatment iv. The effects of this treatment on quality of life&#xD;
      v. The side effects and tolerability of this treatment vi. Molecular differences (e.g.&#xD;
      variations in genes or proteins) that may account for the effects of this treatment vii.&#xD;
      Differences in the costs of care for people on this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators plan to enrol 450 participants in the study from, but not limited to;&#xD;
      Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Canada, USA, Germany, Belgium, Spain,&#xD;
      France, Switzerland, Netherlands and Italy.&#xD;

    <description>Paclitaxel is one of several cytoskeletal drugs that target tubulin. Paclitaxel-treated cells have defects in mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cell division. Unlike other tubulin-targeting drugs, such as colchicine, that inhibit microtubule assembly, paclitaxel stabilizes the microtubule polymer and protects it from disassembly. Chromosomes are thus unable to achieve a metaphase spindle configuration. This blocks the progression of mitosis and prolonged activation of the mitotic checkpoint triggers apoptosis or reversion to the G0-phase of the cell cycle without cell division</description>

    <description>Camptothecin, one of the four major structural classifications of plant-derived anti-cancerous compounds, is a cytotoxic alkaloid which consists of a pentacyclic ring structure containing a pyrrole (3, 4 β) quinoline moiety, an S-configured lactone form, and a carboxylate form. Irinotecan is activated by hydrolysis to SN-38, an inhibitor of topoisomerase I. This is then inactivated by glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). The inhibition of topoisomerase I by the active metabolite SN-38 eventually leads to inhibition of both DNA replication and transcription.</description>

    <intervention_name>Trifluridine/Tipracil</intervention_name>
    <description>The drug consists of the cytotoxin trifluridine and the thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI) tipiracil. Trifluridine is incorporated into DNA during DNA synthesis and inhibits tumor cell growth. Trifluridine (TFT) is incorporated into DNA by phosphorylation by thymidylate kinase (TK) to TF-TMP; TF-TMP then covalently binds to tyrosine 146 of the active site of thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibiting the enzyme's activity. TS is vital to the synthesis of DNA because it is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the deoxynucleotide, thymidine triphosphate (dTTP). Inhibition of TS depletes the cell of dTTP and causes accumulation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP), which increases the likelihood that uracil gets misincorporated into the DNA.</description>
