  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to determine whether exposure to a narrow band of green light&#xD;
      (NBGL) improves outcome of psychotherapy sessions for the treatment of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a within-subject study design that examines NBGL effects (as compared to white light)&#xD;
      on anxiety level and treatment success, as evaluated by the treating psychotherapist and the&#xD;
      patient. For each participant, the study will consist of 8 therapy sessions, each lasting 60&#xD;
      minutes, in which light conditions will be presented in the following order&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1: White light, Session 2: white light, Session 3: NBGL (i.e., green light), Session&#xD;
      4: NBGL, Session 5: NBGL, Session 6: NBGL, Session 7: White light, Session 8: White light&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of lights (white vs.NBGL) on anxiety level will be evaluated at the beginning and end&#xD;
      of each therapy session by the patient, using a validated questionnaire. At the end of each&#xD;
      session, the treating psychotherapist will fill another evaluation form that summarizes&#xD;
      her/his impression of the treatment success or lack of.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient is treated once a week and thus, study participation time is expected to last 8&#xD;
      weeks. Patients will self evaluate their anxiety level at the beginning and end of each of&#xD;
      the 8 therapy sessions by completing the 20-questions State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI&#xD;
      Form Y-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapists will fill the following form after each of the 8 sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Did you feel any difference while working with the patient in the green light as compared to&#xD;
      regular room light?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Check all that apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I was more focused&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I was more relaxed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient was more relaxed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient was more engaged&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient seemed more open&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The therapy progressed further&#xD;

    <description>The Allay Lamp is a consumer product currently available and widely used in the US. It emits low intensity (1-10lux)narrow band (20nm) green light (peak wavelength 520nm) that is marketed as non-irritating to users. In that context, it is not a medical device and does not require a 510(k). However, we believe that light likely also has benefits for sleep. To better understand its effects,we are planning to conduct the proposed study. In that context, the Allay Lamp would be considered an investigational medical device because it has not been cleared or approved by FDA for the intended purpose of treating sleep. No FDA submission should be necessary for this study using 21 C.F.R. 812.3, because the Allay Lamp is a non-significant risk (NSR) device:&#xD;
It is not an implant It is not intended for use in supporting or sustaining human life The Allay Lamp provides a very low risk light-based therapy. The light provides no more risk than any other table lamp available on the market today.</description>
