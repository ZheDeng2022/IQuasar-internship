      This is a pilot study of the use of flash glucose monitoring (FGM) to assess glycemic&#xD;
      control, behavioural, quality of life benefits and manpower utilization in poorly controlled&#xD;
      T2DM patients on insulin in the transitional care period after discharge from hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalization often provides an opportunity to optimise the care of patients with diabetes,&#xD;
      however, there could be destabilisation of dietary habits and diabetes therapy during&#xD;
      admission. During transition from hospital to home, diabetes treatment may be intensified to&#xD;
      control hyperglycemia, such as starting insulin therapy, or, de-escalated, due to risks of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia secondary to variable oral intake and physical activity levels&#xD;
      peri-hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achieving optimal glycemic control necessitates frequent blood glucose monitoring. However,&#xD;
      patients may perceive repeated self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) as inconvenient,&#xD;
      intrusive and laborious as it requires pricking their fingers multiple times, resulting in&#xD;
      reduced compliance and poorer glycemic outcomes. Ambulatory flash glucose monitoring (FGM)&#xD;
      may overcome this and facilitate more rapid achievement of euglycemia due to the benefit of&#xD;
      immediate feedback of glucose levels with changes in diet, medication and activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the transitional care period is a period of stress for patients and an opportunity to&#xD;
      encourage behavioural change, we propose that the use of intermittent short term FGM in the&#xD;
      first two weeks post discharge, and for another two weeks at a 6-week interval may promote&#xD;
      behavioural change resulting in improvements in glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the use of FGM in patients with T2DM with baseline HbA1c &gt;9% and requiring&#xD;
           insulin who at risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, in facilitating the transition&#xD;
           care from inpatient to the ambulatory setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This pilot study is exploratory to determine the logistics and feasibility of the&#xD;
           protocol, and to collect preliminary information that will lead to a larger grant&#xD;
           application for a larger clinical trial in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. FGM use in patients with T2DM with baseline HbA1c &gt;9% and requiring insulin would&#xD;
           facilitate the transition of care from inpatient to the ambulatory setting, resulting in&#xD;
           improved glycemic control, as measured by HbA1c at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FGM use in the transitional care period would lead to improved time in range (TIR),&#xD;
           reduced time in hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, reduced readmission rates for hypo or&#xD;
           hyperglycaemia, improved quality of life, reduced loss to follow-up and encourage&#xD;
           individual lifestyle modification, without a significant increase in costs and manpower&#xD;
           utilization.&#xD;
