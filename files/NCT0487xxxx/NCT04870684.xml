  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In ischemic stroke, the recanalization rate after intravenous thrombolysis has been estimated&#xD;
      to be less than 50% in patients with proximal intracranial artery occlusion; this rate is&#xD;
      greater than 80% after endovascular thrombectomy. Thromboelastometry is a method of analysis&#xD;
      of coagulation and fibrinolysis in whole blood. The main objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate whether the parameters obtained by thromboelastometry are predictive of&#xD;
      revascularization at arteriography during mechanical thrombectomy, after treatment with rt-PA&#xD;
      thrombolysis.&#xD;

      This is a single-center prospective observational study at the University Hospital of Caen.&#xD;
      Any patient presenting a neurological deficit of sudden onset, compatible with a ischemic&#xD;
      stroke diagnosed on brain imaging and eligible for thrombolysis by rtPA and/or a endovascular&#xD;
      thrombectomy procedure will be included. Clot formation kinetics will be assessed by&#xD;
      thromboelastometry (ROTEM® and/or QUANTRA®) to determine the predictive parameters of&#xD;
      revascularization. The parameters of clot formation and lysis as well as revascularization&#xD;
      according to thrombo-inflammation processes will be studied.&#xD;

    <description>The use of the NIHSS score will allow the neurological evaluation of the patient (at admission and 24h/72h after the recanalization attempt). Neurological outcome, as assessed by the NIHSS score, is considered favorable if the NIHSS score at 24h/72h post-recanalization is equal to 0 or 1 or if there is an improvement in the NIHSS score of at least four points between the admission score and the score at 24h/72h post-recanalization.</description>

    <description>This study does not modify the usual care of the patient. Only 5 citrated tubes (maximum 15 mL of blood) are collected in addition to the initial emergency department sample (routine care). The patient's care follows the classic thrombolysis alert pathway. There is no additional complementary examination or additional neurological evaluation. Clot formation kinetics will be evaluated by thromboelastometry to determine the predictive parameters of revascularization. Clot formation and lysis parameters as well as revascularization according to thrombo-inflammation processes will be studied.</description>
