      Background: The majority of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) have ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease (IHD). If signs of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) acute coronary&#xD;
      angiography (CAG) and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is recommended. In&#xD;
      most cases, patients with OHCA who does not achieve Return Of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC)&#xD;
      are also triaged directly to a tertiary center with the possibility to establish mechanical&#xD;
      circulatory support, e.g. Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (eCPR) (Figure 1). For&#xD;
      the remaining group of patients with OHCA who achieves ROSC and have no signs of STEMI it is&#xD;
      unsettled whether there is a benefit of acute CAG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large international study (Direct or Subacute COronary angiography in out-of-hospital&#xD;
      cardiac arrest - DISCO) from Uppsala, Sweden, will study the role of acute CAG in 1006&#xD;
      patients with OHCA who are comatose after achieving ROSC (2). In the Swedish study they only&#xD;
      include comatose patients, and randomize patients to either acute CAG or CAG after 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Danish tertiary centers have decided to join the Swedish DISCO-study (From now on named&#xD;
      DISCO-MAIN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, many OHCA patients are not comatose, and without signs of STEMI, thus not eligible&#xD;
      for DISCO-MAIN. The investigators also want to investigate the role of acute CAG in these&#xD;
      patients, which is the purpose of the current study, named DISCO-no-COMA (Direct or subacute&#xD;
      coronary angiography in patients with out-of-hospital-cardiac arrest who are not comatose).&#xD;
      This study will include patients in parallel with the DISCO-MAIN-study. This means that all&#xD;
      patients with OHCA who receive ROSC and do not fulfill the criteria for acute CAG (STEMI) can&#xD;
      be randomized in either DISCO-MAIN (if comatose) or DISCO-no-COMA (if not comatose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This means that a patient with OHCA without obvious non-cardiac cause, should be triaged as&#xD;
      follows (See figure 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ROSC not achieved (ongoing CardioPulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)): These patients are&#xD;
           triaged directly to the catheterization laboratory with the possibility to establish&#xD;
           ECPR treatment (5) and perform CAG/PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) and implant&#xD;
           pacemaker if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Signs of STEMI: These patients are triaged directly for acute CAG according to&#xD;
           guidelines (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ROSC, COMA (Glasgow coma scale &lt;=8), not STEMI: Should be included in the DISCO-MAIN&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ROSC, Glasgow coma scale &gt;8, not STEMI: Should be included in the DISCO-no-COMA trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To randomize non-comatose (Glasgow coma scale &gt;8) OHCA survivors for acute CAG or subacute&#xD;
      CAG (after 12-24 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period: 1.5.2021 to 1.5.2024.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centers eligible for participation: Danish and European centers. The investigators will&#xD;
      primarily contact centers already participating in the DISCO-MAIN trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Acute CAG: The patient is triaged directly to the catheterization laboratory for&#xD;
      acute evaluation including Echocardiography (ECHO), acute CAG and PCI if indicated according&#xD;
      to guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Subacute CAG: The patient is triaged to the coronary care unit (CCU) for rhythm&#xD;
      surveillance, and additional diagnostics, and in case there is found indication for CAG, it&#xD;
      is planned for the coming day in daytime (12-24 hours after cardiac arrest).&#xD;
      Revascularization is performed if indicated according to guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Revascularization in group A and B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to perform revascularization of the culprit lesion. Additional lesions will be&#xD;
      scheduled for an elective procedure, typically after 3-4 weeks. If Coronary Artery Bypass&#xD;
      Grafting (CABG) is indicated, it will be scheduled according to the centers local routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-over:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient randomized to group B will be scheduled for acute CAG if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Signs of STEMI (acute CAG mandatory).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Persistent hemodynamic instability of more than 1 hour after randomization, defined as:&#xD;
           need of increased dose of vasopressor/inotropic, low Left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
           (LVEF), no clearance of lactate (Acute CAG should be considered)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recurrent cardiac arrest (Acute CAG should be considered)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: Data is analysed according to intention-to-treat. Continuous data will be&#xD;
      presented as mean Â± standard deviation, and comparison made using t-test if normally&#xD;
      distributed. Non-normal distributed data will be presented as median [interquartile range],&#xD;
      and compared using Mann Whitney U-test. Categorical variables are compared using Fischers&#xD;
      exact test or Chi square test as appropriate, and presented as numbers and per centages.&#xD;
      Significans level is p&lt; 0.05 (two-sided).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: Data will be collected and stored according to the Danish Privacy Law. The&#xD;
      E-CRF (Electronic Case Report Form) is computer-based (TrialPartner). Patient and procedure&#xD;
      information will be entered in the E-CRF by the study nurses at each site. Date is also&#xD;
      collected from the CPR-register, the Danish National Patient Register (LPR-register), as well&#xD;
      as the invasive registries covering procedure related data for all patients who have CAG or&#xD;
      PCI performed. TrialPartner is approved according to Danish regulative, and all access and&#xD;
      data-entry are logged. When the study is finalized and data from the various registries have&#xD;
      been merged, the personal identification number is removed, and all cases are assigned a key.&#xD;
      A separate key file is store. Data is then made anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of patients and consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with OHCA without obvious non-cardiac cause are triaged to the invasive centers.&#xD;
      The physician on call ensures that any patient with STEMI or ongoing CPR are triaged directly&#xD;
      to the catheterization laboratory. Remaining patients are included in the DISCO-MAIN study if&#xD;
      comatose. Non-comatose patients are included in the present DISCO-no-COMA study. They are&#xD;
      included according to the paragraph &quot;Research in acute situations&quot;, and are randomized when&#xD;
      they are still in the prehospital phase if possible, en route to the hospital. After arrival&#xD;
      to the hospital, the investigators will inform the patient further, to achieve written&#xD;
      informed consent also.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe it is legitimate to randomize patients to acute or subacute CAG&#xD;
      because Denmark nationally have centers that adhere to both strategies, and it is uncertain&#xD;
      whether there is a benefit from acute CAG in OHCA patients who have achieved ROSC and are&#xD;
      without signs of obvious STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, there are clear recommendations when to cross-over if randomized to a&#xD;
      conservative strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal from the study: The patients can at any point, and without any reason, decide not&#xD;
      to participate in the study. The patient will be asked if data collected from randomization&#xD;
      and until withdrawal may be used. Otherwise data will be deleted. Reason for withdrawal, and&#xD;
      the patient's decision whether data can be used or not, will be filled in the electronic&#xD;
      health record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biobank / biological material: A biobank is collected in the acute phase, and when collecting&#xD;
      signed consent, the patients is also asked whether the material may be used for later&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: The study is not blinded, which seems impossible to do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The national Privacy Law will be followed. The trial will be filed to the Central Denmark&#xD;
      Region (Instead of the Danish Data Protection Agency, according to current practice), to the&#xD;
      Ethical Committee in the Central Denmark Region and to Clinicaltrials.gov. The National Board&#xD;
      of Health will be aplied for access to data from the CPR-register and the National Patient&#xD;
      Register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to data: Data will be stored in TrialPartner. Any access or attempt to access will be&#xD;
      logged. Investigator/institution will grant access for monitoring and audit also from the&#xD;
      ethical committee. Investigator will be responsible and ensure that any patient has given&#xD;
      written consent, or a deputy consent has been achieved according to the rules for research in&#xD;
      acute situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint committee: An endpoint committee will be established consisting of a cardiologist&#xD;
      and an anesthesiologist who validates all clinical endpoints, and establish the final&#xD;
      diagnosis (cause of cardiac arrest) for the patient. They will have access to all study&#xD;
      material as well as information from patient health records if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coordinating center: The research department at the Department of cardiology, Aarhus&#xD;
      University hospital, will be the coordinating center, and responsible for establishing the&#xD;
      eCRF, collecting data, coordinating safety and endpoint committee meetings, and publish data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring: Aarhus University hospital will be responsible for trial monitoring. Study nurses&#xD;
      will visit each hospital when initiating the trial, and then approximately two times during&#xD;
      the study. The monitoring visits will as in the DISCO-MAIN trial focus on: a) That the study&#xD;
      adheres to the protocol, b) that inclusion of patients is according to protocol and inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, c) that the correct data is entered in the ECRF, and d) that necessary resources&#xD;
      are available locally to perform the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economy: The investigators will apply private funds for support to the study. The responsible&#xD;
      physicians will receive no honorarium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publications: All results, positive and negative or inconclusive will be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are limited data on mortality, and risk of recurrent cardiac arrest or cardiogenic&#xD;
      shock, in patients without coma who have achieved ROSC after OHCA and just waits for CAG. In&#xD;
      previous studies the 30-day mortality was 34% in patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction&#xD;
      (AMI) who had Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) or Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) (7), the risk of&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock was 9% in patients with VT and 27% in patients with VF (8), and the risk of&#xD;
      recurrent cardiac arrest was 7% within 48 hours (8). In the light of competing risks, and in&#xD;
      the light of a general reduction in case-fatality during the years, it is assumed that the&#xD;
      risk of the combined endpoint (MACE) is approximately 30% within 30 days of randomization.&#xD;
      With an alfa of 0.05, and power of 80%, it will be possible to document a difference in MACE&#xD;
      of 25% if 1080 patients are included. With an expected drop-out of 10% the aim is to include&#xD;
      1200 patients.&#xD;
