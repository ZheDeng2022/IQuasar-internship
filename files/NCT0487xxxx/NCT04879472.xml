      This was a prospective cohort study. The study was conducted in the two hospitals after&#xD;
      approval by the KNH/UON ethical committee and the board of management of Kikuyu Mission&#xD;
      Hospital. Trained data clerks were used for retrieval of data from the respective hospitals&#xD;
      with follow-up conducted in the respective clinics and through phone calls. The clerks were&#xD;
      not blinded to the study but every data was corroborated by interviewing the patients or&#xD;
      their relatives and evaluation of medical data availed as well as clinical status. Both KNH&#xD;
      and Kikuyu Mission Hospitals had handwritten patient notes/records at the time of the study&#xD;
      (not electronic) with central registries for storage of patient files. The patients files and&#xD;
      other medical documents will be available in the wards but upon discharge, stored at the&#xD;
      central registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WOMAC scores(assessment of the outcome measures) were conducted by the principal&#xD;
      investigator by direct interview of the patients/ their designated next of kin, or via&#xD;
      telephone contacts. The outcome measures included pain, stiffness and activities of daily&#xD;
      living.&#xD;

      This was a prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in the two hospitals after approval by the Kenyatta National Hospital&#xD;
      (KNH)/University of Nairobi (UON) ethical committee and the board of management of Kikuyu&#xD;
      Mission Hospital (KMH). Trained data clerks were used for retrieval of data from the&#xD;
      respective hospitals with follow-up conducted in the respective clinics and through phone&#xD;
      calls. The clerks were not blinded to the study but every data was corroborated by&#xD;
      interviewing the patients or their relatives and evaluation of medical data availed as well&#xD;
      as clinical status. Both KNH and Kikuyu Mission Hospitals had handwritten patient&#xD;
      notes/records at the time of the study (not electronic). Both institutions respectively&#xD;
      maintained central registries for storage of patient files following discharge from inpatient&#xD;
      care. At the time of the study, this were a hybrid of electronic and manual data storage&#xD;
      systems as the electronic system was being introduced. The patients files and other medical&#xD;
      documents will be available in the wards but upon discharge, stored at the central&#xD;
      registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores were&#xD;
      conducted by the principal investigator by direct interview of the patients/ their designated&#xD;
      next of kin, or via telephone contacts. This was for the assessment of the outcome measures&#xD;
      that included pain, stiffness and activities of daily living. The measures were accessed for&#xD;
      the period within two weeks before injury, for the pre-injury functional status and at three&#xD;
      months after injury for the early functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been completed and results available.&#xD;
