  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries and periodontal disease are the two most common diseases in dentistry. Caries&#xD;
      was caused by the acidic environment produced through the interaction of oral flora (biofilm)&#xD;
      and fermentable food residues on the tooth surface over time thus to destroying the tooth&#xD;
      structure. Periodontal disease was also highly associated with microorganisms in the&#xD;
      periodontal tissues and the inflammatory response of the host that irritate and destruct&#xD;
      periodontal and bone tissues. Recent studies have found that both stress and eating habits&#xD;
      are associated with decline in oral health. Probiotics have been traditionally used for&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. In the past decade, accumulated&#xD;
      studies further indicate that imbalance of oral microflora is highly related to oral diseases&#xD;
      thus probiotics has been suggested for maintaining oral health. It is thus conceivable that&#xD;
      probiotics as a buccal tablet may potentially restore the balance of oral flora providing a&#xD;
      novel strategy to combat oral diseases. Such strategy may also harbor great opportunities for&#xD;
      the long-term management of dental caries and periodontal infections. In order to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of probiotics buccal tablet in rebalancing oral flora and control to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of dental caries and periodontal diseases, the investigators aimed to conduct a&#xD;
      comprehensive clinical trials for subsequent product optimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grape King Biotechnology Co., Ltd. has successfully developed oral tablet mainly composed of&#xD;
      Lactobacillus plantarum GKD7 and Pediococcus acidilactici GKA4. These two probiotics were&#xD;
      found to inhibit caries through producing protective biofilms thus are more effective than&#xD;
      commercially available anti-tooth decay products. To evaluate the future potential of&#xD;
      clinical applications of the related products series and the impact on oral health-related&#xD;
      indicators, the investigators will explore the changes in the the following disease&#xD;
      associated indexes before and after using the oral tablet. These include periodontal pocket&#xD;
      depth, the gingival inflammation index, the plaque index, and the ratio of Firmicutes,&#xD;
      Bacteroidetes, Streptococcus mutans, and Porphyromonas gigivalis, as well as quantification&#xD;
      of total bacteria. This clinical study will be performed in Department of Stomatology in&#xD;
      NCKUH in collaboration with periodontics session and Family Dentistry session. A total of 50&#xD;
      healthy individuals within the range of 20~65 years old will be enrolled.&#xD;

      The following parameters will be collected and analyzed: periodontal pocket depth, the&#xD;
      gingival inflammation index, the plaque index, and the ratio of Firmicutes/&#xD;
      Bacteroidetes/Streptococcus mutans/Porphyromonas gigivalis, as well as total count of&#xD;
      microorganisms from the plaque collected.&#xD;

    <description>The scores from the six areas of the tooth may be added and divided by six to give the GI for the tooth.&#xD;
By adding the indices for the teeth and dividing by the total number of teeth examined, the Gl for the individual is obtained.</description>

    <measure>Plaque index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The disclosing solution is painted on all exposed tooth surfaces. After the patient has rinsed, the operator, using an explorer or the tip of a probe, examines each stained surface for soft accumulations at the dentogingival junction. When found, they are recorded by making a dash in the appropriate spaces on the record form.Silmilar to the gingival index, each of the six gingival areas of the tooth will be examined and recorded.&#xD;
The overall plaque index is calculated by dividing the number of plaque containing surfaces with the total number of available surfaces.</description>
