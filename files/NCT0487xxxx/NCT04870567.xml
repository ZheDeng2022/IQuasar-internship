      This is single center prospective phase 2 randomized trial aiming to compare biochemical and&#xD;
      clinical relapse free survival and toxicity profiles of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)&#xD;
      versus high dose rate brachytherapy (HDRB) for localized low- and intermediate risk prostate&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;

      Before SBRT three fiducial markers are obligatory inserted into the prostate. Simulation and&#xD;
      every SBRT sessions are performed after bowel preparation (enema) and bladder filling&#xD;
      (400ml).Planning MRI on diagnostic table with subsequent fusing with simulation CT is&#xD;
      obligatory. The clinical target volume (CTV) include the prostate only (low-risk patients) or&#xD;
      prostate and proximal 1/3 of seminal vesicles (intermediate-risk patients). CTV to planning&#xD;
      target volume (PTV) expansion was 3-5 mm in all direction except posteriorly (in the&#xD;
      direction of the rectum) where it is 1-3 mm. Dose must be delivered as 5 fraction of 7.25Gy.&#xD;
      V100% for PTV ≥ 95%. Main dose constraints are as follows: D 2cm³ ≤ 36Gy for rectum (below&#xD;
      75Gy EQD2)., V 37.5 Gy &lt;5 cm³ for bladder, V 20 Gy &lt;10 cm³ for femoral heads. Androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatments must be performed on conventional linear accelerators with cone beam CT&#xD;
      guidance before each fraction, intrafractional motion monitoring is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After spinal anesthesia steel or plastic needle placement performed under TRUS guidance. Pre-&#xD;
      and post-insertion ultrasound based planning is obligatory in all cases. Two fractions of&#xD;
      13Gy are delivered with 2 separate implantations and 2-3 weeks interval. The CTV was defined&#xD;
      as the prostate capsule with 1mm (low-risk) - 3 mm (intermediate risk) expansion plus&#xD;
      proximal 1/3 of seminal vesicles. The PTV was equal to CTV. The rectum, bladder and urethra&#xD;
      are contoured as organs at risk. The dosimetry plan objectives are the following: prostate&#xD;
      D90 - above 104% and V100% - above 92%; urethra D10 &lt; 110% , rectum D2cc&lt;75% (below 75Gy&#xD;
      EQD2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are assessed during treatment, 4-12 weeks after the end of the treatment, every 3&#xD;
      months for the first year and then every 6 months till the end of the study. Normal tissue&#xD;
      adverse events are reported according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE version 5.0). International prostate symptoms score (IPSS) and international index of&#xD;
      erectile function (IIEF-5) must be assessed on each visit, maximal urinary rate and residual&#xD;
      urine volume - annually.&#xD;
