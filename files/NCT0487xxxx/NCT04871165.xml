      The study will evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and efficacy of vaccines against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in oncohematological patient population and compare the results with patients&#xD;
      without prior oncohematological disease. The study is comprised of retrospective and&#xD;
      prospective parts. In retrospective part, biobanked residual biological patient material and&#xD;
      data will be used. In prospective part, vaccinated oncohematological patients and vaccinated&#xD;
      patients without prior oncohematological disease will be invited to participate in long-term&#xD;
      follow-up. The subjects will be invited for blood sample collection every three months from&#xD;
      the second vaccine dose administration, i.e. 3 mos., 6 mos., 9 mos. etc. Ten time points in&#xD;
      total will be collected and tested for humoral and cellular immunogenicity. For safety&#xD;
      analysis patient self-documented systemic events (fever, fatigue, headache, chills, vomiting,&#xD;
      diarrhea, new or worsened muscle pain, and new or worsened joint pain) occurring up to 7 days&#xD;
      following each vaccine dose will be systematized and compared between oncohematological&#xD;
      patients and healthy individuals. For efficacy analysis, PCR confirmed symptomatic disease&#xD;
      rates, hospitalization rates and mortality rates will be assessed.&#xD;

      The study will evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and efficacy of vaccines against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in oncohematological patient population and compare the results with patients&#xD;
      without prior oncohematological disease. The study is comprised of retrospective and&#xD;
      prospective parts. In retrospective part, biobanked residual biological patient material and&#xD;
      data will be used. In prospective part, vaccinated oncohematological patients and vaccinated&#xD;
      patients without prior oncohematological disease will be invited to participate in long-term&#xD;
      follow-up. The subjects will be invited for blood sample collection every three months from&#xD;
      the second vaccine dose administration, i.e. 3 mos., 6 mos., 9 mos. etc. Ten time points in&#xD;
      total will be collected and tested for humoral and cellular immunogenicity, detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample size is based on the number of oncohematological patient population,&#xD;
      eligible for priority vaccination according to the Lithuanian Government regulations -&#xD;
      approximately 1100 patients after stem cell transplantation and approximately 1200&#xD;
      oncohematological patients, who received specific treatment in the last 24 months. It is&#xD;
      estimated, that ~20% of patients reject the vaccination, ~10% will be unreachable, ~10%&#xD;
      reject participation in the Biobank and ~10% will be ineligible due to current treatment and&#xD;
      disease status. Therefore, our assumed study sample is up to 1000 patients with&#xD;
      oncohematological disease and up to 200 patients without prior oncohematological disease. The&#xD;
      size of the control group is aimed at achieving sufficient samples for statistical comparison&#xD;
      of the groups. All study participants will have received a vaccination schedule specified in&#xD;
      each vaccine's Summary of Product Characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For humoral immunogenicity evaluation blood serums from up to 1000 oncohematological patients&#xD;
      and 200 healthy individuals will be tested at the following time points: 1) up to 10 days&#xD;
      before the first vaccine dose, 2) on the day of second vaccine dose, 3) 1 to 3 weeks after&#xD;
      second vaccine dose. Further samples will be obtained every 3 months after administration of&#xD;
      second vaccine dose, 10 follow-up time points in total. The samples will be used to perform&#xD;
      S-binding IgG, RBD-binding IgG and N-binding IgG immunoassays, SARS-CoV-2 serum&#xD;
      neutralization assay and quantitative serum immunoglobulin tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cellular immunogenicity evaluation PBMC samples from up to 100 oncohematological patients&#xD;
      and 20 healthy individuals will be tested at the following time points: 1) up to 10 days&#xD;
      before the first vaccine dose and 2) 1 to 3 weeks after second vaccine dose. Further samples&#xD;
      will be obtained every 3 months after administration of second vaccine dose, 10 follow-up&#xD;
      time points in total. Cellular immunogenicity will be evaluated in oncohematological&#xD;
      patients, who may have a weak humoral response to vaccines. The following groups of&#xD;
      oncohematological patients will be included: 1) 20 to 40 recent recipients of allogeneic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (allo-SCT), meeting these requirements: 2-8 months after allo-SCT; CD3+&#xD;
      cell count &gt;0.1*109/L; patients with mild chronic GvHD and/or receiving &lt;0.5mg/kg&#xD;
      prednisolone (or equivalent); patients with &lt;2nd grade acute GvHD; &gt;3 months after anti-CD20&#xD;
      therapy; postgraft immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors is allowed; 2) 20 to 40&#xD;
      patients after recent administration of proteasome inhibitors (0-30 days after treatment),&#xD;
      who received at least one full cycle of treatment and achieved a satisfactory and stable&#xD;
      disease response, allowing a safe temporary treatment discontinuation for immunization&#xD;
      against COVID-19; 3) 20 to 40 patients after a recent anti-CD20 administration (0-180 days&#xD;
      after treatment), who received at least one full cycle of treatment and achieved satisfactory&#xD;
      and stable disease response, allowing a safe temporary treatment discontinuation for&#xD;
      immunization against COVID-19. Other specific patient groups will be enrolled in the cellular&#xD;
      immunogenicity part, as the primary analysis results show which specific subpopulations lack&#xD;
      humoral immune response. PBMC samples from individuals without prior diagnosis of&#xD;
      oncohematological disease will be selected randomly. The samples will be used for assessment&#xD;
      of proinflammatory cytokine (IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IL-4) production and immunophenotypic&#xD;
      analysis (CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, CD56, CD14, CD19) after stimulation with overlapping&#xD;
      S-peptides in PBMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety analysis patient self-documented systemic events (fever, fatigue, headache,&#xD;
      chills, vomiting, diarrhea, new or worsened muscle pain, and new or worsened joint pain)&#xD;
      occurring up to 7 days following each vaccine dose will be systematized and compared between&#xD;
      oncohematological patients and healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For efficacy analysis, PCR confirmed symptomatic disease rates, hospitalization rates and&#xD;
      mortality rates will be assessed.&#xD;
