    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized controlled, double-blind clinical study which will recruit&#xD;
      about 232 patients in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-dose Almonertinib versus&#xD;
      Osimertinib in the second-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutations in advanced NSCLC&#xD;
      with brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Patient Population:Age 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically proven&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC with brain parenchymal (BM) metastases.The patient was laboratory confirmed to&#xD;
      be EGFR T790M mutation positive at or after progression of 1/2 generation EGFR-TKI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Drug, Dosage and Medication Regimen:Almonertinib will be administered orally at a dose&#xD;
      of 165 mg per time, Q.D.If a patient cannot tolerate a dose of 165mg due to adverse&#xD;
      reactions, when the adverse reactions restore to level 1 (CTCAE 5.0) or below, the dosage&#xD;
      could be adjusted to 110mg per day, Q.D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osimertinib will be administered orally at a dose of 80 mg per time, Q.D. If a patient cannot&#xD;
      tolerate a dose of 40mg due to adverse reactions, when the adverse reactions restore to level&#xD;
      1 (CTCAE 5.0) or below, the dosage could be adjusted to 40mg per day, Q.D.&#xD;
