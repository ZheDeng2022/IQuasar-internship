      The objective of this study is to compare cardiovascular risk factors in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes before the start of the pandemic of the COVID 19 (time 1 - T1), after 1 year (time 2&#xD;
      - T2) and 2 years (time 3 - T3) duration. In patients with all types of diabetes, the&#xD;
      investigators will compare the value of blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, BMI (body mass&#xD;
      index) and glycated haemoglobin in T1, T2 and T3 during outpatient control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs),&#xD;
      which are the leading cause of death globally. To reduce overall cardiovascular risk in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes, it is necessary, in addition to compensation of diabetes, to reduce&#xD;
      other risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. The COVIDs 19 (coronavirus disease of 2019)&#xD;
      pandemic has in addition to direct influence (fever, pneumonia, olfactory loss, etc.)1,2&#xD;
      also, a lot of indirect effects. These include psychological effects (long term stress,&#xD;
      worries, sadness)3,4,5, increased alcohol consumption, changes in eating habits or decreased&#xD;
      physical activity due to restrictions to reduce the spread of the virus in population by&#xD;
      government.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Czech Republic (Central Europe region) is one of the most affected countries in the World&#xD;
      by COVID 19 pandemic. By 1st of March 2021, the SARS-COV2 virus infection was proven in the&#xD;
      Czech Republic in 1 247 051 thousand people, which is 11.7% of the population (11 627 per 100&#xD;
      000, in the USA 8743/100 000, in the UK 6300/100 000, in the Germany 2879/100 000, France&#xD;
      5379/100 000)6 Due to a long-lasting serious situation, we expect an adverse effect on number&#xD;
      of risk factors for CVDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare cardiovascular risk factors in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes before the start of the pandemic of the COVID 19 (time 1 - T1), after 1 year (time 2&#xD;
      - T2) and 2 years (time 3 - T3) duration. In patients with all types of diabetes, the&#xD;
      investigators will compare the value of blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, BMI (body mass&#xD;
      index) and glycated haemoglobin in T1, T2 and T3 during outpatient control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate behaviour of patients during COVID 19 pandemic. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a questionnaire. It will be anonymous for a more accurate assessment.&#xD;
