  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single-arm feasibility study is to develop and pilot test a novel&#xD;
      process-based and modular group therapy approach for patients with acute psychotic symptoms&#xD;
      in an inpatient setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the enormous economic and social costs of psychotic-spectrum disorders, increasing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment options has become an important subject for psychiatric research.&#xD;
      Latest findings in the field of psychotherapy for psychosis show some promising results for&#xD;
      so-called Process-based Therapies (PBT) such as the Metacognitive Training (MCT) and&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) (Barnicot et al., 2020). Instead of trying to change&#xD;
      the content of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, PBT directly address&#xD;
      cognitive processes, which have been found to maintain the disorder's symptomatology (Hayes&#xD;
      et al., 2020). While MCT focusses on changing patients' cognitive biases by inducing&#xD;
      metacognition (Moritz &amp; Woodward, 2007), ACT works with psychological processes such as&#xD;
      mindfulness, willingness and cognitive distancing (Gaudiano &amp; Herbert, 2006). There is a&#xD;
      growing study base for PBT in a psychotic outpatient setting, research in non-ambulatory&#xD;
      settings though is rare (Barnicot et al., 2020). Therefore, the aim of the current study is&#xD;
      to develop and test the feasibility and safety of a new process-based group therapy program&#xD;
      for acute psychotic patients. The five-week treatment approach will consist of three&#xD;
      different modules combining interventions from both MCT and ACT (Module I: Psychoeducation,&#xD;
      Module II: Metacognition, Module III: Cognitive Defusion). First preliminary effectiveness&#xD;
      and process measures (PANSS, BPRS, WHO-DAS, CGI, BCIS and CFQ) will also be included in order&#xD;
      to inform the design of future research. Thus, the study will give valuables insights in the&#xD;
      feasibility and effectiveness of an innovative psychotherapy approach and breaks new ground&#xD;
      in the field of psychotherapy research for psychosis.&#xD;

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Metacognitive and Defusion Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Module I will give a brief introduction into the rational of the therapy and explain the terms cognitive biases and relational responding and their role in the development of psychological problems (psychosis) in a simple language and with the help of examples and small exercises. The principle of metacognition and cognitive defusion in psychotherapy will be made clear. An outlook on the procedures and the goals of the group therapy will be given. Module II will include interventions adapted from the MCT manual (Moritz et al., 2017) and Module III with consist of defusion strategies taken from the ACT group manual (Dambacher et al., 2020) and existing studies on ACT and psychosis (Bach et al., 2013; Gaudiano &amp; Herbert, 2006).</description>
