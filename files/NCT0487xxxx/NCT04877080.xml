    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, single-center prospective study to determine the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of Fast Dual CAR-T cells in patients diagnosed with CD19+ refractory/relapsed B cell&#xD;
      non-Hodgkinlymphoma (R/R B-NHL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Fast Dual CAR-T in R/R&#xD;
      B-NHL. Fast Dual CAR-T is an autologous dual chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy&#xD;
      that targets CD19 and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). The study will include 15 subjects to&#xD;
      receive Fast Dual CAR-T single infusion.&#xD;
