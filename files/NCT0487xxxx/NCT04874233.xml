      This is a Phase 2a, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind,&#xD;
      repeated-dose study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three oral dose levels of HU6&#xD;
      compared to placebo over the course of 61 days in subjects with high BMI and evidence of&#xD;
      elevated liver fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened over a 45 day period to determine their eligibility based on&#xD;
      specific history, physical, laboratory and imaging evaluations as per the Schedule of&#xD;
      Assessments. Due to scheduling of the procedures, multiple visits will likely be necessary to&#xD;
      complete the screening process. However, if all screening assessments and procedures,&#xD;
      including the MRI, can be completed within 30 days of the first dose, then a single screening&#xD;
      visit is permissible.&#xD;
