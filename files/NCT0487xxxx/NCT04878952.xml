  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will examine if the monitoring of daily step counts during a course of concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer will enable clinicians to&#xD;
      deliver improved supportive care and reduce the rate of adverse events during the course of&#xD;
      radiation treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate that monitoring daily step counts during a course of concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer will enable clinicians to&#xD;
      deliver improved supportive care and reduce the rate of adverse clinical events during the&#xD;
      radiotherapy course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring daily step counts during a course of&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy in the setting of a multi-institutional trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the association between baseline activity level and clinical outcomes related&#xD;
      to treatment tolerance, quality of life, chemoradiotherapy adverse events, and physical&#xD;
      function preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To demonstrate associations between daily step counts and short-term hospitalization&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore predictors of step count decline during chemoradiotherapy among clinical&#xD;
      factors and radiotherapy plan parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore patterns of care regarding adjuvant immunotherapy administration following&#xD;
      definitive chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the association between baseline activity level with progression free survival&#xD;
      and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Usual Care&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Usual Care + Continuous physical activity monitoring via a wearable device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to undergo activity monitoring will use a wearable device from the time&#xD;
      of study enrollment until four weeks after the completion of thoracic radiotherapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned initiation (within the 30 days after study registration) of fractionated (≥15&#xD;
             treatments) thoracic radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy. Expected treatment&#xD;
             scenarios include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Definitive treatment of stage III disease (most common)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Definitive treatment for locoregional recurrence of early stage disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Definitive treatment of unresectable stage II disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Preoperative treatment of stage III disease&#xD;

             informed consent prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving thoracic radiotherapy without concurrent chemotherapy are&#xD;
             ineligible. Patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy and another form of systemic&#xD;
             therapy (e.g., immunotherapy) are eligible. Patients receiving radiotherapy with&#xD;
