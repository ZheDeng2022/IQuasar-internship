      This is a 24-month, prospective, exploratory, observational study to investigate immune&#xD;
      phenotypes in patients with MS following treatment with ocrelizumab. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted on Health Sciences University Istanbul Haydarpaşa Numune Training and Research&#xD;
      Hospital, Neurology Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to treat with ocrelizumab must be made prior to and independently from the&#xD;
      proposal to enroll the patient into this study and in line with the Summary of Product&#xD;
      Characteristics (SmPC) approved by the Turkish Ministry of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be recorded at screening visit, baseline visit (month 0), second visit on 6th&#xD;
      month, third visit on 12th month and last visit (end of the study [EOS]) on 24th month&#xD;
      according to local clinic practice. Optional ad hoc visits could be conducted if relapse of&#xD;
      MS or infection after vaccination occurs during ocrelizumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study for each patient will be 24 months.&#xD;
