      This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study using three doses and&#xD;
      two schemes of administration of a recombinant vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 based on a viral&#xD;
      vector (Newcastle Disease virus) in 90 healthy volunteers at a single research site in Mexico&#xD;
      City.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lack of highly effective treatments against COVID-19 and the social and economic impact&#xD;
      that the current pandemic has exerted on public health highlights the uncontested importance&#xD;
      of developing vaccines that, in addition to their safety and ability to induce a protective&#xD;
      response, are logistically suitable for massive administration across a variety of countries&#xD;
      and settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first clinical study of the development program of a vaccine based on a unique&#xD;
      recombinant viral vector technology that has been successful in the design of avian vaccines&#xD;
      and that has no contraindication for use in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recombinant vaccine subject to research in this study is based on an active viral vector&#xD;
      of a recombinant Newcastle Disease virus (rNDV) LaSota strain, in which the gene that codes&#xD;
      for the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has been inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is a paramyxovirus responsible for the Newcastle Disease in&#xD;
      birds. There are three main families of NDV according to the level of virulence. The one with&#xD;
      the lowest virulence is the lentogenic group. One lentogenic viral strain is LaSota (NDV_LS),&#xD;
      which is broadly used in the development of avian vaccines. The LaSota strain seems to&#xD;
      replicate only at the site of inoculation and, although it does not reach the lymph nodes, it&#xD;
      reduces the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines while boosting a robust protective immune&#xD;
      response. Very importantly, this virus cannot insert itself into the human genome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the key factors for an increased virulence in NDV is the activation of the cleavage&#xD;
      site that corresponds to the protein F precursor phenotype. In highly virulent strains, the&#xD;
      cleavage is performed by ubiquitous intracellular proteins, which leads to a widespread&#xD;
      replication in birds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the cleavage site in attenuated or non-virulent strains is activated by a secretory&#xD;
      protease which restrains viral replication to mucosal surfaces. This is the same secretory&#xD;
      protease which acts in NDV-LS in humans and non-human primates, limiting viral replication to&#xD;
      the upper airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is of note that the NDV genome is non-segmented. For this reason, transcription results in&#xD;
      a single-stranded RNA which provides the genome with enough stability to avoid reassortment&#xD;
      events. These features underpin the antigenic and genetic stability that have contributed to&#xD;
      the success of NDV across decades as a vaccine vector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recombinant nature of the viral vector is based in the design and synthesis of a gene&#xD;
      that codes for the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2. Such design is based in the sequence of the&#xD;
      Wuhan-Hu-1 virus (NC_045512.2) and assembled in silico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lentogenic strains like LaSota have been used for more than 70 years of vaccination in avian&#xD;
      populations and have proven to be safe and with a remarkable naturally attenuated viral&#xD;
      activity. In fact, studies have shown that the insertion of foreign genes into the NDV genome&#xD;
      leads to a further reduction of pathogenicity in birds. Furthermore, the rNDV is not excreted&#xD;
      in feces and therefore not transmitted from bird to bird. Safety tests with avian rNDV&#xD;
      vaccines have shown that doses 10 times higher than the dose suggested in this study are not&#xD;
      associated with any pathogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rNDV vaccine against SARS-CoV and other emerging infections had been proposed. It has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that a rNDV vector expressing the S-protein in the SARS-CoV coronavirus is&#xD;
      capable of developing protective immunity without safety concerns when administered to&#xD;
      African green monkeys by the intranasal route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that rNDV injected by the IV route in non-human primates (Macaca&#xD;
      fascicularis) was not associated with any severe disease or abnormalities in hematological or&#xD;
      biochemical lab values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a vaccine based on a S-protein expressing&#xD;
      viral vector of the Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) has been studied using both a wild type and&#xD;
      a pre-fusion membrane-anchored vector format. These studies were performed in mice and&#xD;
      hamster models with two administrations of the vaccine. The tested vaccines induced high&#xD;
      levels of neutralizing antibodies when administered by the intramuscular route. Notably,&#xD;
      these vaccine prototypes protected mice against a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 challenge: neither&#xD;
      viral load nor viral antigen were detected in the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To produce the rNDV, a cell line is transfected by plasmids that express the whole viral&#xD;
      genome that contains the gene in question. The clone of the whole NDV genome is transfected&#xD;
      with helper plasmids that code for the viral proteins N, P and L under the control of the&#xD;
      bacteriophage T7 RNA-polymerase promoter. The chimeric virus is obtained from the culture and&#xD;
      propagated in chicken embryo SPF of 10 days of age, until the original vaccine virus is&#xD;
      generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine has been formulated for intranasal and intramuscular administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, ninety healthy volunteers with no history of COVID-19, vaccination against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 or an activity associated with a higher risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 will be&#xD;
      assigned sequentially into one of nine treatment groups at a single research site in Mexico&#xD;
      City.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These treatment groups correspond to three different doses and three different schemes of&#xD;
      administration. All these schemes foresee two vaccine administrations separated by 21 days.&#xD;
      (see &quot;Arms and Interventions&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for efficacy and safety measurements. Efficacy will be measured by&#xD;
      circulating and neutralizing IgG and IgM antibodies against the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, IgA&#xD;
      titers in nasal mucosa and cytokine-mediated T cell responses. Patient safety will be&#xD;
      monitored by the collection of information on adverse events and safety laboratory&#xD;
      assessments (mainly hematology and blood chemistry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first intervention for each treatment group will be administered in a sequential way to&#xD;
      eighteen sentinel subjects. Once all sentinel subjects have received the first intervention&#xD;
      and the Safety Data Monitoring Board has determined that safety conditions have been met, the&#xD;
      study will proceed to enroll the rest of the subjects until a total of 90 participants is&#xD;
      reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical tests will be applied to each treatment group with similar baseline&#xD;
      characteristics. For continuous variables Student's t distribution and ANOVA will be used to&#xD;
      compare mean values, while chi-square and Fisher´s exact test will be used to assess&#xD;
      categorical values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three working hypotheses to be tested, one for each scheme of administration. They&#xD;
      can be consolidated as follows : The recombinant anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on a viral&#xD;
      vector (rNDV) administered [two times by the intramuscular route / two times by the&#xD;
      intranasal route / the first by the intranasal route and the second by the intramuscular&#xD;
      route] is safe (i.e. an acceptable low profile or reactogenicity: low frequency of&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate and no severe local or systemic adverse reactions) and induces a humoral and&#xD;
      cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2 similar (or greater) to that measured in sera&#xD;
      from naturally-acquired COVID-19 convalescent individuals.&#xD;
