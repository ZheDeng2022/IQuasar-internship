  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-labeled, non-randomized, multi-center clinical study to collect&#xD;
      safety and efficacy data on the TempSure Firm. The intended use of the TempSure device is to&#xD;
      use the Firm handpieces for non-invasive lipolysis.&#xD;

      Up to 12 subjects will be enrolled at up to 3 study centers. Subjects will attend a&#xD;
      screening/pretreatment visit which may be performed on the same day as the treatment visit.&#xD;
      Subjects may receive 1 treatment on the abdomen with the TempSure firm. Subjects will undergo&#xD;
      abdominoplasty surgery at one of 4 predetermined timepoint after an abdomen treatment: day 0&#xD;
      (within 24 hours after treatment), 10 days (+/- 3 days), 20 days (+/- 3 days), or 30 days&#xD;
      (+/- 7 days). This will be determined by the availability of the subject and/or an as needed&#xD;
      basis and this will be decided by the Investigator and the Sponsor.&#xD;
