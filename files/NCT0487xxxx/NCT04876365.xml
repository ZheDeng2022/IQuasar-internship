  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of the study are to assess the safety profile of Adynovate as well as how well&#xD;
      people respond to the preventive treatment with Adynovate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is about reviewing and collecting data of the participants before and after the&#xD;
      switch to Adynovate that are already available. No new information will be collected during&#xD;
      this study. The total time for data collection in the study will be approximately 72 months&#xD;
      (36 months before and 36 months after switching to Adynovate). Participants will not receive&#xD;
      Adynovate as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As participants are not treated in this study, they do not need to visit their doctor in&#xD;
      addition to their normal visits.&#xD;

    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Assessed by Patient-reported Outcome Burdens and Experiences (PROBE) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 72 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROBE questionnaire is a tool for the assessment of patient-reported outcome, burdens and experiences. Until now, it has been used in persons living with hemophilia (PWH) and healthy controls. PROBE questionnaire consists of four major sections: demographic data, general health problems, hemophilia-related health problems and health-related quality of life. Scores range from 0-1, with a higher value indicating better health status.</description>

    <measure>HRQoL Assessed by EuroQoL Group 5-Dimension 5-Level Self-Report (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 72 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system assesses health in five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), each of which has five levels of response (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems/unable to). This part of the EQ-5D questionnaire provides a descriptive profile that can be used to generate a health state profile. Health state index scores generally range from less than 0 (where 0 is the value of a health state equivalent to dead; negative values representing values as worse than dead) to 1 (the value of full health), with higher scores indicating higher health utility. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analogue scale (VAS) on which the participant rates his/her perceived health from 0 (the worst imaginable health) to 100 (the best imaginable health).</description>
