  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mucositis is a very common complication in bone marrow transplant setting. It is a result of&#xD;
      injury to the gut caused by high dose chemotherapy. Currently there are no universal&#xD;
      protocols that have been accepted as a standard to prevent and treat mucositis in the&#xD;
      transplant setting. Post transplant upto 80% of patients suffer from a severe mucositis.&#xD;
      Proinflammatory cytokines play a major role in the development of mucositis. Interventions&#xD;
      that decrease the levels of these cytokines may be beneficial in preventing mucositis. This&#xD;
      study is aimed at evaluating the role of curcumin in reducing cytokine levels and the&#xD;
      incidence and duration of mucositis in patients undergoing autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mucositis is an inevitable side-effect of intensive conditioning therapy used for&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and usually refers to the mucosal ulceration of mouth&#xD;
      and throat. However, it is generally accepted that oral mucositis (OM) is in reality the most&#xD;
      obvious manifestation of damage or injury elsewhere particularly that of the gut. The&#xD;
      incidence of oral mucositis (WHO grades I-IV ) with certain myeloablative conditioning&#xD;
      regimens has been reported in up to 90% with range of severe mucositis (WHO grade III/IV)&#xD;
      from 10 to 78%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucositis is a complex biological process which occurs in four phases - 1.&#xD;
      inflammatory/vascular phase; 2. epithelial phase; 3. ulcerative/bacteriological phase; 4.&#xD;
      healing phase. Each phase is interdependent and is the consequence of a series of actions&#xD;
      mediated by cytokines, the direct effect of the chemotherapeutic drug on the epithelium, the&#xD;
      oral bacterial flora and the status of the patient's bone marrow. Pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      such as interleukin -1 (IL-1), interleukin -6 (IL-6),interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-17&#xD;
      (IL-17), Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), Transforming Growth Factor-B&#xD;
      (TGF-B),Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and certain prostaglandins play a central role in its&#xD;
      pathogenesis. Chemotherapy, in particular, affects the release of both interleukin-1 (IL-1)&#xD;
      and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)from the epithelium. TNF-α is capable of causing&#xD;
      tissue damage and may be an accelerating and initiating event in the mucositis process. IL-1&#xD;
      incites an inflammatory response resulting in increased sub-epithelial vascularity with a&#xD;
      potential consequent increase in the local levels of cytotoxic agent. On the other hand,&#xD;
      cytokines like TGF-β are known inhibitors of epithelial cell proliferation by preventing cell&#xD;
      cycle progression and accumulating cells in G1 or G0. For clonogenic stem cells in the&#xD;
      intestine, this might render them more resistant to the cytotoxic damage, leaving more&#xD;
      clonogenic stem cells to start the regeneration process. Cytokine modulation is the primary&#xD;
      mechanism of action of several agents experimented in the recent past to reduce mucositis.&#xD;
      For example, Triclosan oral rinse and interleukin-11 (IL-11) therapy reduce ulceration and&#xD;
      duration of mucositis by downregulation of PGE2, TNF-α, IL-12 and IFN-γ. It is quite possible&#xD;
      that a role exists for transcription factors which modify the genetic expression of cytokines&#xD;
      and enzymes which are critical in producing tissue damage. Such factors, such as NF-kappa B,&#xD;
      increase the rate of gene transcription and thereby the rate of messenger RNA and protein&#xD;
      production. Therefore inhibition of NF-kB could be beneficial in the reduction of mucosal&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are no universal protocols that have been accepted as a standard to prevent&#xD;
      and treat OM in the transplant setting. Research is proceeding on several new fronts.&#xD;
      Palifermin, recombinant human - keratinocyte growth factor-1, has been shown to the most&#xD;
      effective agent so far in few phase II studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulating evidence suggests that curcumin inhibits various inflammatory cytokines through&#xD;
      inhibition of Nuclear Factor Kappa- β. Curcumin, polyphenol derivative with low toxicity&#xD;
      profile, is commonly used in India for its anti-inflammatory actions. It is derived from the&#xD;
      plant Curcuma longa. In vitro studies have shown potent anti-inflammatory activity at&#xD;
      concentrations of 1 umol/L. Though oral bioavailability of curcumin is poor, in vivo sepsis&#xD;
      models in mice have shown good anti-inflammatory activity despite poor plasma levels.&#xD;
      Similarly significant decrease of ex vivo production of LPS induced PGE2 levels have been&#xD;
      seen in patients treated with curcumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I studies in cancer patients have shown that curcumin can be given at doses ranging&#xD;
      from 440 mg to 12 grams daily without any toxicity. There was no dose-limiting toxicity;&#xD;
      dosing was limited by the number of pills that patients could or would swallow daily.&#xD;
      Curcumin used for cancer prevention is seldom administered in a pure chemical form. Rather,&#xD;
      it typically consists of three separate curcuminoids consisting of curcumin itself as well as&#xD;
      demethoxycurcumin and bisdesmethoxycurcumin. Plasma levels of curcumin and its metabolites&#xD;
      such as curcumin glucuronide and curcumin sulphate have been shown to be in the range of 10-&#xD;
      50 ng/ml in patients receiving doses greater than 3.6 gms daily. This peak concentration is&#xD;
      seen 1 hour after a given dose. In a recently published study of curcumin in pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer little, if any, free or unconjugated curcumin was detected in the plasma of 19&#xD;
      subjects who received a daily dose of 8 g curcumin. An apparent steady-state level of&#xD;
      conjugated curcumin in plasma that was achieved by day 3; this level was 22 to 41 ng/mL.&#xD;
      Though the peak plasma concentration of curcumin detected is low, at these doses, biological&#xD;
      activity demonstrated by either reduction of cytokine levels or decrease in the activity of&#xD;
      NK-kB has been seen in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no studies exploring the role of curcumin in mucositis in patients undergoing high&#xD;
      dose chemotherapy .The Investigators aim to study the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      of curcumin in the above setting. Patients with mucositis may have difficulty in swallowing&#xD;
      tablets. Therefore a lozenge formulation of curcumin will be employed in this study. Lozenges&#xD;
      will be manufactured by Pharmanza Herbal Pvt. Ltd (PH). Each lozenge of 1g contains 100mg of&#xD;
      curcumin. A capsule formulation of curcumin manufactured by PH containing 27% of curcuminoids&#xD;
      was employed in an earlier study in osteogenic sarcoma patients at this centre. Single dose&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics with 4g of the formulation yielded peak curcumin concentration of 37.69&#xD;
      ng/ml and half-life of about 2.5 hours - (unpublished data). The time to peak concentration&#xD;
      was around 3 hours. Based on this data, a dose of four lozenges (4 gm) twice a day (BID) was&#xD;
      deemed necessary and sufficient to achieve the desired inhibition of NF-kB.&#xD;
