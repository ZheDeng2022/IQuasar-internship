      Prolapse is a condition that causes up to 13% of women to have surgery in their lifetime.&#xD;
      There are many surgical techniques for the treatment of prolapse, each with its advantages&#xD;
      and disadvantages. The techniques by vaginal approach aim to put back in tension the&#xD;
      supporting tissue, the endopelvic fascia, damaged and released. This technique has the&#xD;
      advantage of not causing an abdominal scar, a quick recovery and often little pain. In&#xD;
      contrast, the use of already damaged native tissue results in a recurrence rate of up to 15%&#xD;
      to 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other technique is the abdominal route either by laparotomy or by a minimally invasive&#xD;
      approach such as laparoscopy, assisted or not by robotics. With this technique, we use&#xD;
      prosthetic material introduced around the vaginal wall without opening the latter, therefore&#xD;
      without contamination and without dissection of the vaginal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During upper surgery, a subtotal hysterectomy is performed, that is to say that the uterine&#xD;
      cervix is preserved and serves as an anchoring point for the synthetic nets which are&#xD;
      attached to the cervix and then sutured to the promontory of the sacrum. (sacrocervicopexy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the vaginal route, a total hysterectomy is traditionally performed and the vaginal dome is&#xD;
      sutured to the sacro-spinal ligament (Richter's operation). The stitches are then passed&#xD;
      through the thickness of the often thin vaginal wall constituting a possible release point of&#xD;
      the assembly. There are currently no studies that compare prosthetic sacrocervicopexy with&#xD;
      fixation of the remaining cervix to the sacro-spinal ligament without prosthesis, and repair&#xD;
      of the endopelvic fascia with native tissue. The study consists of performing a subtotal&#xD;
      hysterectomy by minimally invasive approach in both cases and then randomize for either a&#xD;
      prosthetic sacrocervicopexy or fixation of the remaining cervix to the sacro-spinal ligament&#xD;
      via the abdominal or vaginal route.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Genital prolapse is caused by the collapse of the supporting structures of the pelvic organs.&#xD;
      This results in the organs sliding down through the pelvic hiatus. The pelvic organs involved&#xD;
      are the bladder, which rests on the anterior vaginal wall like a hammock made of supportive&#xD;
      connective tissue called the anterior endopelvic fascia. When too much stress is placed on&#xD;
      this support tissue, microtrauma or tears gradually weaken this tissue, which relaxes and&#xD;
      causes the bladder to gradually lower. In the same way, the rectum is separated from the&#xD;
      posterior vaginal wall by this same endopelvic fascia which can suffer the same kind of&#xD;
      lesion with the same consequences. The middle compartment, i.e. the top of the vagina is made&#xD;
      up of the cervix which is supported by a condensation of this endopelvic tissue in the form&#xD;
      of ligaments that suspend this cervix in the center of the pelvic cavity. If these ligaments&#xD;
      weaken, the uterus, or the &quot;vaginal cuff&quot; in the event of a previous hysterectomy, will also&#xD;
      gradually lower, or even externalize. The middle compartment is considered the keystone of&#xD;
      pelvic organ support. All interventions to correct severe prolapse should include suspension&#xD;
      of the middle compartment. Traditionally, the sacro-spinal ligament is used during the&#xD;
      intervention via the low approach and the sacral promontory via the high approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a classification (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification or POP-Q) in stages of&#xD;
      descent of the pelvic organs. At the first stage, the organs are not exteriorized and in most&#xD;
      cases asymptomatic. In the second stage, the vaginal walls reach the vaginal introitus and&#xD;
      begin to cause symptoms such as pelvic discomfort or heaviness, whether or not associated&#xD;
      with functional disorders of the organs involved. In the following stages, the patients are&#xD;
      generally symptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolapse is a condition that causes up to 13% of women to have to have surgery in their&#xD;
      lifetime. It causes both an impairment of the quality of life by the discomfort caused by the&#xD;
      externalization of the organs and by the functional disorders that it causes, such as urinary&#xD;
      or fecal incontinence, bladder emptying disorder, sexual disorders, etc. all of these&#xD;
      disorders can be measured by dedicated questionnaires and validated in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many surgical techniques for the treatment of prolapse, each with its advantages&#xD;
      and disadvantages. The techniques by vaginal approach aim to put back in tension of the&#xD;
      native supporting tissue damaged and released. This technique has the advantage of not&#xD;
      causing an abdominal scar, a quick recovery and often little pain. On the other hand, the use&#xD;
      of already damaged tissue results in a recurrence rate of up to 15-30%. In an attempt to&#xD;
      reduce this rate of recurrence, by taking the example of abdominal hernia surgery, prosthetic&#xD;
      reinforcements have started to be used in order to make the repair more solid and durable.&#xD;
      The prostheses were introduced through a vaginal incision (naturally contaminated medium) and&#xD;
      directly under the mucosa. It turned out that a reduction in recurrence was achieved,&#xD;
      especially in the anterior compartment, but at the cost of complications directly linked to&#xD;
      the use of prostheses such as erosions of the vaginal mucosa, infections and, when using&#xD;
      implantation kits supplied by industry, pain that is often difficult to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other technique is the abdominal route either by laparotomy or by a minimally invasive&#xD;
      approach such as laparoscopy, assisted or not by robotics. With this technique, prosthetic&#xD;
      material is also used but it is introduced around the vaginal wall without opening it,&#xD;
      therefore without contamination and without dissection of the vaginal wall, with a much lower&#xD;
      rate of erosion or other complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have compared these different techniques without reaching a definitive&#xD;
      conclusion on the best approach. The use of synthetic material introduced vaginally using&#xD;
      kits has recently been the subject of warnings from the FDA due to the sometimes severe&#xD;
      complications followed by a gradual withdrawal of these products or even a ban in most&#xD;
      Anglo-Saxon countries. On the other hand, the use by the abdominal route not causing the same&#xD;
      complications has not been questioned by the FDA&#xD;
&#xD;
      . In our department, the management of symptomatic prolapse involves two techniques, vaginal&#xD;
      without prosthesis or minimally invasive abdominal with prosthesis, according to various&#xD;
      criteria such as age, surgical history or severity of the prolapse. During upper surgery, a&#xD;
      subtotal hysterectomy is performed, i.e. the uterine cervix is preserved and serves as an&#xD;
      anchoring point for the synthetic nets which are attached to the cervix and then sutured to&#xD;
      the promontory of the sacrum. (sacro-cervicopexy). In the vaginal route, a total hysterectomy&#xD;
      is traditionally performed and the vaginal dome is sutured to the sacro-spinal ligament&#xD;
      (Richter's operation). The stitches are then passed through the thickness of the often thin&#xD;
      vaginal wall constituting a possible release point of the assembly. There are currently no&#xD;
      studies that compare prosthetic sacro-cervicopexy with fixation of the remaining cervix to&#xD;
      the sacro-spinal ligament without prosthesis and repair of the endopelvic fascia with native&#xD;
      tissue. The study consists of performing a subtotal hysterectomy by minimally invasive first&#xD;
      in both cases and then randomise for the mode of suspension of the uterine cervix, either a&#xD;
      prosthetic sacro-cervicopexy or to fix the remaining cervix to the sacro-sinous ligament by&#xD;
      abdominal or vaginal route. We would thus obtain more solid anchoring points at the level of&#xD;
      the middle compartment with less risk of dropping and a more lasting result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to demonstrate that this new intervention gives similar results to the&#xD;
      reference intervention by the upper route. For this we use a composite definition of the&#xD;
      success of the intervention which takes into account the anamnestic aspect, the absence of a&#xD;
      sensation of prolapse, the clinical examination, the absence of measurable prolapse, and the&#xD;
      absence of secondary surgery. The secondary objectives are to ensure a similar improvement in&#xD;
      the quality of life in the two groups by relying on specific questionnaires validated for&#xD;
      this indication.&#xD;
