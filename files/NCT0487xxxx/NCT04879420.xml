    <textblock>
      Investigators are building an empirical evidence base for real world data through large-scale&#xD;
      replication of randomized controlled trials. The investigators' goal is to understand for&#xD;
      what types of clinical questions real world data analyses can be conducted with confidence&#xD;
      and how to implement such studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE&#xD;
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical&#xD;
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance claims&#xD;
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly&#xD;
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.&#xD;
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a&#xD;
      statistical balancing of measured covariates according to standard practice. Investigators&#xD;
      assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that&#xD;
      failure to replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims&#xD;
      data for replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the&#xD;
      validity of the original RCT finding.&#xD;

        full code and algorithm definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible cohort entry dates:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Teriparatide indication for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women was approved&#xD;
        by FDA on Nov 26, 2002 (the approval of risedronate for the same indication was antecedent&#xD;
        to 2002). The initial eligible cohort entry date was the first date after Nov 26, 2002&#xD;
        commonly available in both the databases investigated. The last date eligible as cohort&#xD;
        entry date was the end of available data for one of the two databases. For the second&#xD;
        database, we excluded the data cut that overlaps with the COVID-19 pandemic (range April&#xD;
        1st - Jun 30th, 2020), since we assumed a higher proportion of drug discontinuation during&#xD;
        that time period. The following eligible cohort entry dates were included:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For IBM MarketScan: Jan 1, 2004 (start of available data - December 31, 2018 (end of&#xD;
             available data)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Optum CDM: Jan 1, 2004 (start of available data) - Mar 31, 2020&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal women &gt;= 45 years of age at the time of entry into the trial, whose&#xD;
             last menstrual period occurred at least 2 years prior to entry into the trial and are&#xD;
             sufficiently mobile to complete study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women &lt; 55 years of age in whom a bilateral oophorectomy cannot clearly be documented&#xD;
             must have their postmenopausal status confirmed by a serum FSH level &gt; 40 IU/L and&#xD;
             serum estradiol level &lt; 20 pg/mL or &lt; 73 pmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum of 2 moderate (SQ2) or 1 severe (SQ3) vertebral fragility fractures&#xD;
             [radiographic evidence of at least two moderate (ie, a reduction in vertebral body&#xD;
             height of 26-40%) or one severe (more than 40% reduction) prevalent vertebral&#xD;
             fragility fracture]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AP lumbar spine or total hip or femoral neck BMD ≥ 1.5 SD below the average BMD for&#xD;
             young healthy, non-Hispanic, Caucasian women (T-score ≤ -1.5 SD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Increased baseline risk of osteosarcoma. This includes patients with Paget's disease&#xD;
             of the bone [..]. As elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase activity may indicate the&#xD;
             presence of Paget's disease, an unexplained elevation of this enzyme activity will&#xD;
             also be exclusionary [Day 365, Day 0]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  [...] previous primary skeletal malignancy, or skeletal exposure to therapeutic&#xD;
             irradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of unresolved skeletal diseases that affect bone metabolism, other than&#xD;
             osteoporosis, including renal osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Abnormally elevated values of serum albumin-corrected calcium levels at baseline,&#xD;
             defined as ≥ 10.6 mg/dL (or ≥ 2.65 mmol/L). In cases with borderline non-eligible&#xD;
             values (≥ 10.6 and ≤ 10.7 mg/dL), a re-test would be allowed during the screening&#xD;
             period [Day 30, Day 0]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormally low values of serum albumin- corrected calcium levels at baseline, defined&#xD;
             as &lt; 8.0 mg/dL (or &lt; 2.0 mmol/L). In cases with borderline non-eligible values (&gt; 7.8&#xD;
             to &lt; 8.0 mg/dL), a re-test would be allowed during the screening period to allow&#xD;
             normalization with vitamin D and calcium supplements before the randomization visit&#xD;
             [Day 30, Day 0]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignant neoplasms in the 5 years prior to Visit 2, with the exception of&#xD;
             superficial basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin that have been&#xD;
             definitively treated. Patients with carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix treated&#xD;
             definitively more than 1 year prior to entry into the study may be randomized.&#xD;
             Patients with multiple myeloma or metastases to bone are excluded [Day 1,825, Day 0]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active liver disease or clinical jaundice. Significantly impaired hepatic function,&#xD;
             defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 75 U/L or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)&#xD;
             &gt; 75 U/L or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) &gt; 300 U/L [Day 365, Day 0]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significantly impaired renal function as defined by a calculated endogenous creatinine&#xD;
             clearance (ClCr) &lt; 30 mL/min using the following Cockcroft-Gault formula for ClCr&#xD;
             (Cockcroft and Gold 1976) [Day 365, Day 0]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis within 1 year prior to Visit 2. [Day 365,&#xD;
             Day 0]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been treated with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty within the last 6&#xD;

          -  Patients with history of osteonecrosis of the jaw or who are, according to the&#xD;
             clinical judgment of the investigator, at high risk to develop osteonecrosis of the&#xD;
             jaw, including poor oral hygiene, scheduled invasive dental procedures, high doses of&#xD;
             bisphosphonates and/or chemotherapy to treat malignancy [All Data, Day 0]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of atypical subtrochanteric or diaphyseal femoral fractures,&#xD;
             according to the diagnostic criteria of the American Society for Bone and Mineral&#xD;
             Research Task Force (Shane et al. 2010). [All Data, Day 0]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or recent history of significant upper gastrointestinal disorders, such as&#xD;
             esophageal disorders which delay esophageal transit or emptying (e.g. stricture or&#xD;
             achalasia). [Day 365, Day 0]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poor medical or psychiatric condition for participating in a clinical study, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator. [Day 0, Day 0]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of excessive consumption of alcohol or abuse of drugs in the 1 year prior to&#xD;
             Visit 2, in the opinion of the investigator. [Day 365, Day 0]&#xD;

          -  &quot;Previous treatment with the following bone active drugs is allowed but treatment must&#xD;
             be discontinued at Visit 1 or at the time indicated below:&#xD;
