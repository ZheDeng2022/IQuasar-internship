  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transpulmonary pressure may be higher in ARDS patients due to decreased respiratory system&#xD;
      compliance. The hypothesis is that tidal volumes which are generated by Intellivent- Adaptive&#xD;
      support ventilation (ASV) are safe range by transpulmonary pressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Patients will be enrolled in the first 24 hours of admission to the intensive care unit.&#xD;
      APACHE-2 and SAPS-2 scores will be noted 24 hours after admission. COVID-19 pneumonia will be&#xD;
      confirmed according to World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance. Level of sedation&#xD;
      will be monitored with Ramsey Sedation Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An esophageal balloon will be inserted in order to measure transpulmonary pressure(Ptp). The&#xD;
      proper localization will be estimated according to ear-nose-xiphoid length. Localization of&#xD;
      the balloon will be confirmed with the Baydur maneuver. Mojoli methods will be used to&#xD;
      optimize the balloon filling volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be mechanically ventilated under Intellivent-ASV mode. Initial settings&#xD;
      will based on predicted body weight. 45 cmH2O will be determined as target end-tidal&#xD;
      carbondiokside (ETCO2) but permissive hypercapnia will be allowed if necessary, to maintain&#xD;
      lung protective ventilation. Safe pH value will be determined 7.25 independent from ETCO2&#xD;
      levels in patients who will be applied lung protective ventilation. FiO2 and PEEP will be set&#xD;
      to maintain an SpO2 of 88-92%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ptpinsp will be calculated by subtracting the esophageal pressure from the alveolar pressure&#xD;
      measured during inspiratory pause maneuver. Targeted inspiratory transpulmonary pressure&#xD;
      (Ptpinsp) was determined to be below 20 cmH2O. If Ptpinsp exceeds 20 cmH2O, minute-volume&#xD;
      (MinVol) will be decreased by 10%. Minvol will be reduced below 100% if necessary, to achieve&#xD;
      the target. Expiratory transpulmonary pressure (Ptpexp) will be calculated by subtracting the&#xD;
      esophageal pressure from the alveolar pressure measured during expiratory pause maneuver.&#xD;
      Targeted Ptpexp was determined from 0 to 3 cmH2O. If Ptpexp is below 0 cmH2O, PEEP will be&#xD;
      increased until Ptpexp is positive. If Ptpexp exceed 3 mH2O, PEEP will be decreased until&#xD;
      Ptpexp is below 3 mH2O. Transpulmonary pressure will be recorded at the beginning after that&#xD;
      at least twice daily morning and evening visits. All measurement will be made in passive&#xD;
      condition. Transpulmonary pressure measurement will continue until the patient is awake.&#xD;
