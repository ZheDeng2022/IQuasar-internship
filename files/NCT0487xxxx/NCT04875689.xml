      Knee osteoarthritis is the most common condition presented in physiotherapy OPD.LASER therapy&#xD;
      is new treatment option and to find out its effects in knee osteoarthritis is need of the&#xD;
      hour. With this research one can find out best treatment program for knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      patients which can be shared with other community members. If there will be added effect of&#xD;
      LASER treatment in reducing the visits or stays it will be a cost effective option. this&#xD;
      study will help to find better management option for patients with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address the scarcity of research on this topic in Pakistan and will help to&#xD;
      raise awareness among patients about the effects of LASER THERAY.&#xD;

      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the loss of articular&#xD;
      cartilage, subchondral bone remodeling, joint space narrowing and the formation of bone&#xD;
      spurs. The initiation of cartilage breakdown is stimulated by mechanical stress or injury and&#xD;
      the degenerative process progresses slowly over many years. In the advanced stage of OA, the&#xD;
      abnormal remodeling of cartilage and subchondral bone results in the formation of osteophytes&#xD;
      at the joint surface and margins, which irreversibly destroys the affected joint. Obesity,&#xD;
      previous trauma, female gender and older age are considered the most common risk factors for&#xD;
      knee OA. The prevalence of radiographic KOA for all age groups and found a value of 27.3 %&#xD;
      for women and 21.0 % for men.Clinical manifestations include joint pain, stiffness, decreased&#xD;
      range of motion (ROM), muscle weakness, proprioceptive changes, difficulties in activities of&#xD;
      daily living (ADL) such as walking, climbing / descending stairs and housekeeping[5]Many&#xD;
      physical therapy agents such as ultrasound[6], electrical stimulation, strengthening&#xD;
      exercise[8]and thermal therapy[9] have been introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the non-invasiveness and advantage of inciting nearly no adverse side effects,&#xD;
      low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been widely used to relieve pain in different&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorder. It also promotes fibroblasts, collagen synthesis, cell oxygen&#xD;
      recovery, and bone remodeling. Laser efficacy depends on 4 factors of wavelength, duration of&#xD;
      treatment, dose, and areas of the application.Low level laser therapy induces photochemical&#xD;
      physiological actions in living tissues at the cellular level. Some of these effects include&#xD;
      cellular oxygenation, release of neurotransmitters associated with pain modulation and&#xD;
      release of anti-inflammatory, endogenous mediators. LLLT consists of a monochromatic light&#xD;
      source without any thermal effect that stimulates reparative properties in human cartilage.&#xD;
      Moreover, it has an analgesic effect, although the mechanisms through which this occurs&#xD;
      remain uncertain. The suggested mechanisms include: increased mitochondrial ATP and tissue&#xD;
      oxygenation, increased levels of neurotransmitters implicated in pain modulation (such as&#xD;
      serotonin) and anti-inflammatory effects. Study stated that the reduction in pain through&#xD;
      using LLLT might be due to mechanisms such as physiological effects mediated by photochemical&#xD;
      actions at cellular level in animal or human tissue, and through increased levels of the&#xD;
      neurotransmitters implicated in pain modulation, such as serotonin. Some researchers have&#xD;
      also concluded that LLLT has an effect on joint cartilage regeneration, achieved through&#xD;
      proliferation of chondrocytes and synthesis and secretion of extracellular matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study on &quot;Effect of laser therapy on chronic osteoarthritis of the knee in older subjects&quot;&#xD;
      showed that there was a significant reduction in VAS and pain intensity, an increase in&#xD;
      isometric muscle strength and range of motion of the knee as well as increase in physical&#xD;
      functional ability in three treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study on &quot;Efficacy of low-level laser therapy on pain and disability in knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials&quot;&#xD;
      showed that LLLT reduces pain and disability in KOA at 4-8 J with 785-860 nm wavelength and&#xD;
      at 1-3 J with 904 nm wavelength per treatment spot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study on &quot;effectiveness of low-level laser therapy in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a&#xD;
      systematic review and meta-analysis&quot; this study indicated that low level laser therapy has&#xD;
      neither early nor later benefits in reducing pain or improving function in patients with KOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study on &quot;The Effect of Low Level Laser Therapy on Pain and Range of Motion of Patients&#xD;
      With Knee Osteoarthritis&quot; showed that the effectiveness of low-power laser in reducing pain&#xD;
      and improving the range of motion in patients with knee osteoarthritis is similar to the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the placebo laser. Low-power laser is recognized as an appropriate medical&#xD;
      modality to treat knee osteoarthritis in animals and humans and can be used along with&#xD;
      acupuncture or exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study on Effect of low level laser therapy (904nm) and static stretching in patients with&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis: a protocol of randomized controlled trial showed that the The European&#xD;
      League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations indicate stretching exercises as an&#xD;
      adjunctive treatment.&#xD;
