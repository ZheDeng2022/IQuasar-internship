      This is a Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study in up to 50 adolescent&#xD;
      or adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
      leukemia, or mixed phenotype acute leukemia. Patients will receive a single dose of MRX-2843&#xD;
      followed by continuous oral MRX-2843 in 28 day cycles at predefined dose cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose expansion arm of approximately 12 patients (with 6 patients being FLT3 ITD+ and 6&#xD;
      patients being Mer+/FLT3 WT) will be accrued to further evaluate patients at the RP2D.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be accrued using a 3+3 approach. Cohorts will be escalated based on review of safety data for each patient and cohort.&#xD;
The highest dose level administered prior to the dose in which ≥ 33% of patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity [DLT]) will be defined as the MTD. Based on PK, pharmacodynamic data, efficacy, safety and patient tolerability, a recommended dose for further development (RP2D) may be identified that is less than the formal MTD. A dose expansion arm of approximately 12 patients (with 6 patients being FLT3 ITD+ and 6 patients being Mer+/FLT3 WT) will be accrued to further evaluate patients at the RP2D.</intervention_model_description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a male or female at least 12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must weigh at least 40 Kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of AML as defined by&#xD;
             the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (2017), ALL, or MPAL and is in second or&#xD;
             later relapse or is refractory to at least one induction regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of MRX-2843 on developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to remain abstinent, or agree to&#xD;
             practice double barrier forms of birth control in which 2 of the following precautions&#xD;
             are used during the study and for 4 months after last dose of study drug(s):&#xD;
             vasectomy, tubal ligation (or other transcervical sterilization procedures), vaginal&#xD;
             diaphragm, intrauterine device, birth control pills, birth control implant, or condom&#xD;
             or sponge with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be nonpregnant, nonlactating, and have&#xD;
             a negative pregnancy test result at Screening and a negative pregnancy test on Day 1&#xD;
             of Cycles 1-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is able to provide written, informed consent or assent for patients &lt; 18 years&#xD;
             of age is provided along with parent/guardian consent before initiation of any study&#xD;
             related procedures, and patient is able, in the opinion of the investigator, to comply&#xD;
             with all the requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is able to swallow oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has white blood cell (WBC) lower than 25,000/mm3 at Screening prior to&#xD;
             initiation of MRX-2843. Patients who are otherwise medically eligible for enrollment&#xD;
             but have WBC above 25,000/mm3 are allowed concurrent treatment with hydroxyurea to&#xD;
             stabilize the WBC. In these situations, hydroxyurea will be discontinued once WBC is&#xD;
             below 10,000/mm3 and at least 1 day prior to start of study treatment. Treatment with&#xD;
             hydroxyurea will be allowed during Cycle 1 if deemed needed by the Investigator.&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 60 mL/min. For creatinine clearance estimation, the&#xD;
                  Cockcroft and Gault equation should be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Male: CrCl (mL/min) = (140 - age) × wt (kg) / (serum creatinine × 72) (For&#xD;
                  females: Multiply above result by 0.85)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3.0 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 or&#xD;
