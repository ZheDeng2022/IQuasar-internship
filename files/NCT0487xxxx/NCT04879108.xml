  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomised and controlled study is to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation combined with physiotherapy and rehabilitation&#xD;
      program on pulmonary function and functional exercise capacity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-thoracotomy pain is one of the most severe types of post-surgical pain. When pain after&#xD;
      thoracotomy is not treated effectively, it causes decrease in pulmonary compliance, inability&#xD;
      to cough and deep breathing. Increased secretion leads to atelectasis and pneumonia. After&#xD;
      surgery, early mobilization, providing airway cleaning (humidification, aspiration, forced&#xD;
      expiration, assisted coughing), oxygen therapy, controlled breathing exercises, the use of&#xD;
      incentive spirometry and such selected exercises, including posture and general exercises&#xD;
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation approaches can prevent complications. A carefully planned&#xD;
      pre and postoperative chest physiotherapy and rehabilitation program minimizes postoperative&#xD;
      complications; it will restore normal function in these patients. Post-surgical physiotherapy&#xD;
      applications should be combined with pain therapy for effective participation of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anesthetics, opioids and different special analgesia techniques including intercostal,&#xD;
      paravertebral, interpleural and epidural blocks are used to relieve pain after thoracotomy.&#xD;
      However, these techniques have serious side effects such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory&#xD;
      depression, and sleepiness. It has been reported that the use of Transcutaneous Electrical&#xD;
      Nerve Stimulation (TENS), in addition to traditional analgesia methods, may reduce the use of&#xD;
      analgesics, side effects, and postoperative recovery period, and is useful for pain control.&#xD;
      After cardiac surgery, TENS has been found useful in the treatment of postoperative incision&#xD;
      pain. It has been reported that TENS therapy after thoracotomy as effective as&#xD;
      patient-controlled analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study planned to investigate the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation combined with physiotherapy and rehabilitation program on pulmonary function and&#xD;
      functional exercise capacity in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Visual Analogue Scale that is an easy, reproducible, minimal tool-requiring, and understandable measurement tool for the assessment of pain intensity was used. This scale consists of a horizontal, straight line. There is a value of 0 at the beginning of the line and 10 at the end.</description>

    <measure>Peak cough flow</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Functional Exercise Capacity at postoperative 5th days.</time_frame>
    <description>It was evaluated with the peak flow meter device while the patient was sitting upright in a chair with a back. The test method is explained and a trial test is carried out. The nosepiece was attached to the nose and the mouthpiece of the device was wrapped tightly with the lips.&#xD;
It was asked to take a deep breath and suddenly and quickly blow into the device fron the patient. The best out of three acceptable tests was recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and postoperative 5th days.</time_frame>
    <description>It was evaluated with a 0-10 point borg scale. Dyspnea was measured at rest and after exertion. An increase in score is interpreted as an increase in dyspnea.</description>
