  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several interventional and surgical procedures are available to treat moderate-to-critical&#xD;
      acute pancreatitis (AP) in its late phase. The ongoing debate on these options, together with&#xD;
      the scarcity of reported mid-term follow-up information in the Literature, prompted the&#xD;
      investigators to conduct a review of our surgical experience, focused on those issues. The&#xD;
      investigators reviewed retrospectively all the patients treated for moderate-to-critical AP&#xD;
      according to Determinant-Based Classification (DBC), in the last nine years. Patients treated&#xD;
      conservatively or operated within 4 weeks of the onset of the pancreatitis were excluded. All&#xD;
      the included patients were managed following a &quot;tailored&quot; step-up approach, and divided into&#xD;
      four groups, according to the first interventional procedure performed: percutaneous drainage&#xD;
      (PD), endoscopic approach (END), internal derivation (INT), and necrosectomy (NE).&#xD;
      In-hospital and mid-term follow-up variables, including a quality-of-life assessment, were&#xD;
      analyzed and compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following variables were evaluated: sex, age, severity of inflammation according to the&#xD;
      DBC classification, PA etiology, CT scan severity index according to Balthazar criteria ,&#xD;
      clinical prognostic score using bedside index of severity of acute pancreatitis (BISAP)&#xD;
      score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total length of hospitalization, operative management, necrosis cultures, total and&#xD;
      post-interventional Intensive Unit Care (ICU) were also recorded and analyzed together with&#xD;
      the in-hospital morbidity, mortality and re-admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were checked after discharge within 14 days and followed monthly as outpatients by&#xD;
      gastroenterologists. A CT scan was performed within 4 months, or before in case of recurrent&#xD;
      symptoms. During the follow-up, the English Standard Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire was&#xD;
      used to evaluate the general quality of life at three and six months, one and two years. The&#xD;
      SF-36 examines 8 areas consisting of social and physical function, physical and emotional&#xD;
      well-being, bodily pain, vitality, mental health and overall general health perception. At&#xD;
      the six-month follow-up, the patients also completed a specific questionnaire about the&#xD;
      pancreatic function. In particular, the total score takes in consideration abdominal pain&#xD;
      using visual analogue pain score, diarrhea, unintentional weight loss, new onset of diabetes&#xD;
      and use of enzyme supplementation. The score ranges between zero to five (all symptoms&#xD;
      present). The work has been reported in line with the STROCSS criteria&#xD;

    <description>English Standard Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire is used to evaluate the general quality of life. The SF-36 examines 8 areas consisting of social and physical function, physical and emotional well-being, bodily pain, vitality, mental health and overall general health perception. The eight scaled scores are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
