  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center single-arm clinical trial with a paired design which compares the&#xD;
      effectiveness of 3T MRI with (modified) and without (standard) radiofrequency pulse&#xD;
      polarization optimization in reducing metal-related artifacts in patients with hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty implants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty participants with symptomatic primary total hip arthroplasty will be imaged with both&#xD;
      methods. The results of the two methods will be compared in reference to the size of the&#xD;
      artifact-degraded regions, visibility of the normal structures and the rate of abnormality&#xD;
      detection.Primary Objective: To assess the size of the artifact-degraded regions, defined as&#xD;
      regions of the image where underlying anatomic structure are obscured, between modified and&#xD;
      standard MRI protocols. Secondary Objectives: (1) To assess the visibility of normal&#xD;
      structures between modified and standard MRI protocols. (2) To assess the abnormality&#xD;
      detection rate using modified and standard MRI protocols.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects enrolled in this study will undergo both standard and new MRI techniques. The standard MRI is needed for your routine care and as ordered by the referring doctor. The new MRI is performed for research purposes. Participants will be imaged with both methods and the results will be compared.</description>

    <description>A technical modification to the standard MRI which only affects radiofrequency pulse polarization attempting to optimize the image quality. All other factors, including pulse sequence parameters, and patient and coil positioning is similar to that of the standard MRI.</description>
