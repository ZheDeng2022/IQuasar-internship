  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the high incidence, cancer and the concomitant presence of malnutrition are currently&#xD;
      a worldwide public health problem. The loss of weight and body tissues is a common condition&#xD;
      in cancer patients with lesions of the airways and digestive tract and is related to anorexia&#xD;
      and the presence and duration of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea. The latter&#xD;
      directly interferes with the progression of enteral diets, which are administered in order to&#xD;
      provide adequate nutritional support for the recovery of patients and nutritional status. In&#xD;
      this sense, the importance of measures to help reduce diarrhea episodes is reinforced, aiming&#xD;
      at the adequate infusion of enteral diets and, consequently, nutritional needs. It is known&#xD;
      that the use of antimicrobials is closely related to the increased incidence of nasocomial&#xD;
      diarrhea, as it facilitates colonization by pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium&#xD;
      difficile. In addition, nosocomial diarrhea is a very relevant occurrence due to the&#xD;
      financial burden it causes for the hospital institution, which can also worsen the patient's&#xD;
      clinical condition, since he is weakened due to the underlying disease. Despite these&#xD;
      important aspects, studies carried out with the aim of reducing diarrhea episodes in patients&#xD;
      with airway and digestive lesions are still not described in the literature. In this context,&#xD;
      the use of symbiotics presents itself as a possibly beneficial alternative, considering the&#xD;
      role of probiotics and prebiotics in the modulation of intestinal function. In this sense,&#xD;
      this work aims to evaluate the impact of perioperative supplementation with symbiotic on&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and intestinal function of patients with colon cancer and digestive airways&#xD;
      undergoing colorectal resection. It is assumed that the use of symbiotics could have better&#xD;
      results than the use of probiotics and isolated prebiotics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most cancer patients have a compromised nutritional status, 80% are malnourished at the time&#xD;
      of the initial diagnosis. It is known that in patients with airway and digestive cancer the&#xD;
      risk of malnutrition is increased, due to changes caused by the location of the tumor such as&#xD;
      dysphagia, odynophagia and changes in taste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical effects of malnutrition are manifested by difficulty in healing after surgery,&#xD;
      increased risk of infection and treatment toxicity, in addition to greater demand for care&#xD;
      and hospital costs. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to provide adequate nutritional&#xD;
      needs to these patients, since adequate nutritional therapy (NT) is able to improve their&#xD;
      clinical response and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional support is seen as an important strategy for the treatment and recovery of these&#xD;
      patients, since it promotes greater adequacy of nutritional support, improving nutritional&#xD;
      status as well as response to treatment and immune function, in addition to improving quality&#xD;
      of life and reducing hospital costs. However, gastrointestinal complications, such as&#xD;
      diarrhea, represent important causes for not receiving the planned enteral diet volume, or&#xD;
      the patient's intake inadequacy, which causes an insufficient supply of calories, proteins,&#xD;
      vitamins and minerals over the days, contributing with worsening nutritional status, as well&#xD;
      as increased hospital stay and costs with hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diarrhea affects about 16% to 63% of patients on enteral nutrition. The most frequent causes&#xD;
      of diarrhea in cancer patients are related to medications, such as antibiotics, antacids with&#xD;
      magnesium, lactulose, laxatives, supplements with potassium and phosphorus and medications&#xD;
      with sorbitol6. Other possible causes of diarrhea include hypoalbuminemia, rapid infusion and&#xD;
      intolerance to some component of the diet, infectious causes such as the presence of&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile, severe malnutrition and, more rarely with the use of industrialized&#xD;
      diets, bacterial contamination of the enteral formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the presence of nosocomial diarrhea - defined as infectious diarrhea acquired&#xD;
      in a hospital environment - increases the length of stay of patients (eight days, on&#xD;
      average), increases the likelihood of infections in surgical wounds, and consequently,&#xD;
      hospital mortality. Among the identifiable causes of this type of diarrhea, the&#xD;
      indiscriminate use of antimicrobials has been identified as an important predisposing factor,&#xD;
      particularly in facilitating colonization and intestinal infection by Clostridium difficile.&#xD;
      This bacterium has an incidence between 5% and 39%, with an increased incidence in&#xD;
      hospitalized post-surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it is necessary to study strategies that reduce the incidence of diarrhea in these&#xD;
      patients. In this context, the use of probiotics and prebiotics seems to be an effective&#xD;
      alternative, since the therapeutic effect in the treatment and prevention of intestinal&#xD;
      diseases has been extensively researched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate and sufficient quantities,&#xD;
      confer benefits to the health of the host. In addition, they compete with pathogenic bacteria&#xD;
      for space and nutrients, blocking their effects and binding them to the intestinal mucosa.&#xD;
      They produce antibacterial substances (bacteriocins), acidify the intestinal pH by&#xD;
      fermentation and production of lactic acid, stimulate the production of mucin and increase&#xD;
      the production and secretion of immunoglobulin A (sIgA). There is evidence that probiotics&#xD;
      also contribute to the reduction of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      (TNF) and growth transformation factor (TGF-β) that modulate the inflammatory response and&#xD;
      favor immune balance. Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus&#xD;
      and Bifidobacterium are some of the probiotics that have benefits described in the&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cimperman et al (2011), in a pilot study, double masked, controlled placebo evaluated the&#xD;
      effect of treatment with probiotics in patients using antibiotics. The results showed that&#xD;
      the administration of the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri significantly reduced diarrhea&#xD;
      compared to patients who received a placebo. Still, D'Souza et al (2002), Cremonini et al&#xD;
      (2002) &amp; McFarland (2006) concluded through meta-analyzes that the use of probiotics is&#xD;
      associated with the prevention of diarrhea associated with the use of antibiotics in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prebiotics are defined as food substances that, when ingested, are not digested and absorbed&#xD;
      by the small intestine. When they reach the colon, they are used as a substrate for&#xD;
      probiotics, selectively stimulating the growth of the intestinal microbiota in addition to&#xD;
      producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) that are substrates for colonocytes. SCFAs also&#xD;
      modulate the intestinal microbiota, maintain metabolism and promote a decrease in intestinal&#xD;
      pH, thereby inhibiting the development of pathogenic microorganisms. Rushdi, Pichard &amp; Khater&#xD;
      (2004) evaluated in a prospective, double-masked controlled study the effect of adding&#xD;
      soluble fiber to the enteral diet of patients hospitalized with diarrhea. Patients were&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups: control (enteral diet without soluble fiber) and treated&#xD;
      (enteral diet with soluble fiber). The results showed a reduction in diarrhea episodes in the&#xD;
      study patients, suggesting the prebiotic benefit of soluble fiber. Examples of prebiotics are&#xD;
      fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings propose that interventions aimed at modulating intestinal function related to&#xD;
      the prevention and control of diarrhea in cancer patients in the postoperative period deserve&#xD;
      to be implemented and evaluated. However, these trials used different probiotic organisms,&#xD;
      prebiotics, doses, duration of treatment and target audience, providing low reproducibility&#xD;
      of the results. In addition, some studies have shown that symbiotics (defined as a&#xD;
      combination of probiotics and prebiotics) can optimize the beneficial results in relation to&#xD;
      the isolated use of probiotics in terms of modulating the immune system and the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota. It is suggested that under the action of symbiotics there will be better control&#xD;
      of intestinal functioning and improved prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sense, evaluating the symbiotic administration in patients with colon, upper airway&#xD;
      and digestive cancer undergoing surgical treatment would be a potentially beneficial&#xD;
      alternative to be studied, since the consumption of this food component could lead to&#xD;
      modulation of intestinal function, preventing diarrhea that, according to our data, occurs in&#xD;
      30% of the patients hospitalized at the Alfa Institute of Gastroenterology at UFMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of the symbiotic on the intestinal function of patients with malignant&#xD;
      neoplasm of the colon, upper airways and digestive tract submitted to surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the incidence of diarrhea in the study group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify other gastrointestinal symptoms such as stasis, vomiting, bloating;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify and monitor the evolution of the nutritional status of patients through&#xD;
           subjective global assessment, anthropometry and food consumption;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Track postoperative complications, in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out at the Alfa Institute of Gastroenterology, Hospital das&#xD;
      Clínicas, Federal University of Minas Gerais, located in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais.The&#xD;
      sample will comprise 42 patients (21 in the intervention group and 21 in the control group).&#xD;
      The sample calculation was performed according to Hulley et al. (2001), using the proportion&#xD;
      of 30% improvement in the symptom of diarrhea with the use of symbiotic from the average of&#xD;
      other studies, considering a range of 45% of the confidence interval (difference between the&#xD;
      highest and the lowest value found) and 12% loss with the intervention, also observed in the&#xD;
      reference studies. Individuals will be invited to participate in the study and will have a&#xD;
      detailed explanation of the procedure and research in which they will be inserted, and must&#xD;
      sign a free and informed consent form. Individuals who have inflammatory bowel diseases will&#xD;
      be excluded; have previously undergone operations on the gastrointestinal tract; have used&#xD;
      antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics or symbiotics in the last 15 days and are using an&#xD;
      enteral fiber diet. The study will be double-masked and the individuals will be randomly&#xD;
      divided into two groups: Symbiotic group (S) - will receive the symbiotic (association of&#xD;
      fructooligosaccharide, prebiotic, and four probiotic strains: Lactobacillus casei,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus Acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum) enterally or&#xD;
      orally in the amount of a sachet, twice a day. Control Group (C) will receive maltodextrin&#xD;
      placebo (carbohydrate easily absorbed and digested, not fermented by colonic bacteria and&#xD;
      which does not interfere in the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract or in the&#xD;
      metabolism and function of the intestine), either enterally or orally in a sachet. hours&#xD;
      until hospital discharge. Personal information such as full name, medical record number, sex,&#xD;
      age, marital status, origin, date of birth and hospitalization will be collected for patient&#xD;
      identification. Information regarding the location of the tumor, type of tumor, age of&#xD;
      diagnosis in years and months, type of previous and current treatment (surgical, radiotherapy&#xD;
      and / or chemotherapy) use of antibiotics, comorbidities and presence or not of infection&#xD;
      will be collected from the medical record . The evaluation of intestinal functioning will be&#xD;
      made by direct questioning to patients and family members, as well as the nursing records.&#xD;
      The occurrence or not of diarrhea (defined as more than three bowel movements / day),&#xD;
      frequency and volume, whether or not gastrointestinal symptoms such as distension and&#xD;
      abdominal pain during hospitalization will be assessed. Nutritional assessment will be&#xD;
      carried out by Subjective Global Assessment proposed by Detsky (1987) and using&#xD;
      anthropometric parameters: current weight, height, arm, tricipital skin fold, subscapular and&#xD;
      biochemical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The start of the diet in the postoperative period and the nutrient supply will be verified&#xD;
      through the analysis of food consumption and / or infusion of the enteral diet, which was&#xD;
      calculated according to the service protocol, contemplating 30 calories per kilogram of&#xD;
      current weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications will be assessed through the daily assessment of the patient and medical&#xD;
      records and classified according to the proposal by Dindo (2004).&#xD;
