      Sedentary lifestyles in modern obesogenic society produce several dysfunctions that cause&#xD;
      chronic diseases in lederly population and this phenomenon is becoming a major public health&#xD;
      problem. Regular physical activity has a profound effect on the expression of the potentials&#xD;
      of human resilience, resulting in a decreased risk of chronic diseases. The identification of&#xD;
      the biological mechanisms that are candidates for exercise-induced health benefits through&#xD;
      biological pathways that are largely different from those targeted by common drugs, is highly&#xD;
      relevant, since it might help to improve our knowledge of the pathophysiology of the chronic&#xD;
      diseases in the sedentary population as well as to maximize the efficacy of physical activity&#xD;
      interventions by implementing the best possible exercise dosage in older adults. For this&#xD;
      purpose, the first aim of this project will be to identify the bioactive molecules and&#xD;
      functional mechanisms that are candidates for exercise-induced health benefits. Moreover, in&#xD;
      the view of more reliable, ecological and tailored approaches to counteract the problem of&#xD;

      The first aim of this projects will be to identify the bioactive molecules and functional&#xD;
      mechanisms that are candidates for exercise-induced health benefits through biological&#xD;
      pathways that are largely different from those targeted by common drugs. In the view of more&#xD;
      reliable, ecological and tailored approaches to counteract the pandemic problem of sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle in elderly population, the second aim of this project will be to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an ecological exercise intervention (EEI) in comparison to traditional&#xD;
      exercise intervention (TEI) in sedentary older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: Despite our society has developed several advances in technology and medicine,&#xD;
      the human genetic framework is largely tailored to support the physical activity (PA)&#xD;
      patterns of hunter-gatherer societies living 2.5 million years ago, for which food finding&#xD;
      was obligatorily associated to PA. The energy expenditure of hunter-gatherers (1,500&#xD;
      kcal/day) is similar to 3h/day of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Contrarily, technological&#xD;
      improvements have influenced the dramatic drop in human PA levels: 1/3 of adults worldwide&#xD;
      are currently inactive, and the endemic inactivity trend starts in early life. Indeed,&#xD;
      sedentary behaviors in contemporary obesogenic environments trigger dysfunctions that cause&#xD;
      chronic diseases and this phenomenon is becoming a major public health problem.&#xD;
      Interestingly, regular PA has a profound effect on the expression of the potentials of human&#xD;
      resilience, resulting in numerous positive adaptations and decreased risk of chronic&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protective role of exercise on cardiovascular disease risk factors: There is strong&#xD;
      epidemiological evidence indicating that regular PA is associated with reduced rates of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, stroke, metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Moreover, a dose-response of PA is usually observed in the general population. It is&#xD;
      important to note, that exercise training has an improving effect on endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polypill-like effect of Exercise: Despite, in the last 40 years the pandemic increase of&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic diseases has paralleled the advances in medicine, CVD remains the leading&#xD;
      cause of death worldwide. In this complicated scenario, Wald and Law first described a&#xD;
      combination pill for CVD prevention, which they called a &quot;polypill&quot;. These authors claimed&#xD;
      that CVD could be reduced by 88% and strokes by 80% if all those over 55 years of age were&#xD;
      given a polypill containing statin, low-dose aspirin, and folic acid. This controversial and&#xD;
      provocative approach of &quot;medicalizing&quot; the population is not possible and not ethical, but&#xD;
      polypill-like benefits are achievable with a drug-free intervention, regular PA. It is worth&#xD;
      of mention that the identification of the bioactive molecules and biological mechanisms that&#xD;
      are candidates for exercise-induced health benefits through biological pathways that are&#xD;
      largely different from those targeted by common drugs, is highly relevant, since it might&#xD;
      help to improve our knowledge of the pathophysiology of the chronic diseases in the sedentary&#xD;
      eldely population as well as to maximize the efficacy of PA interventions by implementing the&#xD;
      best possible exercise dosage, resulting in optimal circulating levels of &quot;health&quot; molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise polypill: Skeletal-muscle fibers can produce a plethora of secreted factors,&#xD;
      including proteins, growth factors, cytokines, with such secretory capacity increasing during&#xD;
      active exercise, myogenesis and muscle remodeling. Muscle-derived molecules exerting either&#xD;
      paracrine or endocrine effects are termed &quot;myokines&quot; and can be consider the exercise&#xD;
      polypill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since regular exercise has protective effects on cardiovascular diseases and, interestingly,&#xD;
      it is more protective than expected based on the improvement of traditional risk factors&#xD;
      (blood lipids, hypertension, diabetes) it is easy to speculate that additional positive&#xD;
      effects could be mediated by myokines on targets such as adipose tissue or liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, IL-6 is probably the myokine prototype because its level increases with exercise&#xD;
      intensity and duration. Systemic low-level inflammation is a cardinal feature of&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic diseases, and it can be attenuated by the cumulative effect of regular&#xD;
      exercise bouts, during which the muscle releases IL-6 which creates a healthy milieu by&#xD;
      inducing the production of other anti-inflammatory cytokines. Another prototype of&#xD;
      contraction-induced myokine is IL-15, with resistance exercise stimulating its secretion.&#xD;
      Muscle-derived IL-15 is one of the mediators of the anti-obesity effects of exercise. Recent&#xD;
      research identified a novel PGC-1 -induced myokine called iriscin. Iriscin is associated with&#xD;
      improved aerobic fitness in cardiac patients, muscle mass, and metabolic factors in healthy&#xD;
      people, and neurogenesis in animal models. Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine&#xD;
      (SPARC) is a matricellular glycoprotein released into the bloodstream by skeletal muscle in&#xD;
      response to aerobic exercise plays a pivotal role in adipocyte differentiation and adipose&#xD;
      tissue turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myostatin, is a potent muscle-growth inhibitor, endurance or resistance exercise downgrade&#xD;
      myostatin expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another class of molecules which are potentially up-regulated with regular exercise and could&#xD;
      have additional effects on the protective effects of regular exercise are neurotrophins.&#xD;
      Among them, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the most affected by exercise.&#xD;
      Increased levels of BDNF are well documented, providing mechanistic support for a beneficial&#xD;
      exercise effect in cognitive function. Furthermore, BDNF increases phosphorylation enhancing&#xD;
      fatty acid oxidation and glucose utilization in skeletal muscle.The emerging general feature&#xD;
      is that During physical inactivity, adipose tissue secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines, which&#xD;
      can lead to development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, such as T2DM and&#xD;
      atherosclerosis (Iyer et al., 2010). The study of myokines as potential biomarkers for&#xD;
      effectiveness of exercise is an attractive approach to develop better physical protocols to&#xD;
      apply to the elderly population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention approaches: Sedentary behaviors in older adults are strongly associated with&#xD;
      systemic dysfunctions that cause chronic diseases and this phenomenon is becoming a major&#xD;
      public health problem. Moreover, the recognized polypill-like effect of exercise, needs&#xD;
      further research in order to identify the biological mechanisms that are candidates for&#xD;
      exercise-induced health benefits. Furthermore, it is necessary to maximize the efficacy of PA&#xD;
      interventions by implementing the best possible exercise dosage. In this complicated&#xD;
      scenario, Owen and colleagues explain in their scientific contribution &quot;Adults' Sedentary&#xD;
      Behavior Determinants and Interventions&quot; the relevant phases of the behavioral epidemiology&#xD;
      research strategy on sedentary behavior for children and adults, highlighting several&#xD;
      strengths of the evidence relevant to interventions and public health initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ecological-Exercise-Intervention: One of the goals of public health interventions would be to&#xD;
      reduce total sedentary time and also to increase the number of breaks in sedentary time. A&#xD;
      starting point for this 'Ecological-Exercise-Intervention'(EEI), would be to limit sitting&#xD;
      time to no more than 2 hours/day, and to stand up and move after 30 minutes of continuous&#xD;
      sitting. In accordance with several epidemiologic evidences light-intensity activities would&#xD;
      be encouraged to substitute sedentary time (e.g., standing up while talking on the telephone,&#xD;
      ironing while watching TV). Taking into consideration the guidance provided by ecologic&#xD;
      models of health behavior evidences about specific constructs to guide EEI may be derived&#xD;
      from behavioral research on physical activity. However, further studies are needed to clarify&#xD;
      the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of EEI in young and adult populations. On&#xD;
      this matter, promising results have been observed in studies targeting increases in daily&#xD;
      walking. Moreover, systematic evaluations of these &quot;natural approaches&quot; could be highly&#xD;
      informative, especially through assessing whether changes in sedentary time actually do&#xD;
      result.&#xD;
