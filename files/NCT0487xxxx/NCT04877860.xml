    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are: 1) To design and implement the PaiNEd system for the&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment based on Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE) in cancer survivors with&#xD;
      sequelae derived from medical treatments; 2) examine the reliability of the PaiNEd system to&#xD;
      treat real patients; 3) Study the effectiveness of the PaiNEd system integrated in a&#xD;
      multimodal physical recovery program compared to traditional biomedical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to first carry out the design and implementation of an e-health system for&#xD;
      the evaluation and treatment of pain, in which 15 cancer survivors will be studied to verify&#xD;
      the reliability of the proposal. Secondly, a randomized controlled experimental study will be&#xD;
      carried out in which 84 cancer survivors will be recruited and randomly assigned to three&#xD;

      People who have suffered cancer often do not find an adequate therapeutic response for the&#xD;
      sequelae derived from its treatments. The objectives of this study are: 1) To design and&#xD;
      implement the PaiNEd system for the evaluation and treatment based on Pain Neuroscience&#xD;
      Education (PNE) in cancer survivors with sequelae derived from medical treatments; 2) examine&#xD;
      the reliability of the PaiNEd system to treat real patients; 3) Study the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the PaiNEd system integrated in a multimodal physical recovery program compared to&#xD;
      traditional biomedical information. In this regard, there is a shortage of proposals for&#xD;
      certain subgroups of patients who demand special attention. This project aims to first carry&#xD;
      out the design and implementation of an e-health system for the evaluation and treatment of&#xD;
      pain, in which 15 cancer survivors will be studied to verify the reliability of the proposal.&#xD;
      Secondly, a randomized controlled experimental study will be carried out in which 84 cancer&#xD;
      survivors will be recruited and randomly assigned to the three study groups: a) physical&#xD;
      recovery program + access to the PaiNEd system; b) physical recovery program + traditional&#xD;
      biomedical recommendations; c) control group. The evaluation will be carried out at baseline&#xD;
      (at the beginning of the study), at 8 weeks (time of completion of the intervention) and at 6&#xD;
      months of follow-up of the patients.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized into each of the groups using a random number generation program (EPIDAT 4.2, junta de Galicia). The sequence will be placed in an opaque envelope closed by a member outside the investigation and will be opened once the baseline assessment is completed, so the assessment staff will be masked for the randomization of the participants, thus reducing the risk of bias during the evaluation. The blinding of evaluators will be guaranteed by the fact that some members of the group are specialized in the treatment of cancer patients and others in their evaluation.</masking_description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline in Pressure Pain Thresholds (Algometry) at 2 and 6 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure Pain Threshold is the minimal amount of pressure where a sensation of pressure first changes to pain. It will be performed at the points related to the cervical area and the shoulder girdle (joint C5-C6, upper trapezius, levator scapulae, masseter, deltoid, sternoclavicular joint and tibialis anterior) with an algometer.&#xD;
The pressure is applied at a rate of approximately 30 kilopascals / seconds by a 1-cm2 probe. Participants will be instructed to press the switch when the sensation first change from pressure to pain. The mean of 3 trials is calculated and used for the analysis. A 30-second resting period is allowed between each trial.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The shoulder pain and disability index is a 13-item, self-administered questionnaire with two subscales: pain and disability. Subjects report the pain and disability experienced in the previous week. Each item is rated on a 0-10 scale, from no pain/no dysfunction 0 to maximum pain/impossible 10. The scores for pain and disability are calculated from the sum of the corresponding items divided by the maximum score possible and multiplied by 100. To obtain the total score, the mean of the pain and disability scores is calculated.</description>
