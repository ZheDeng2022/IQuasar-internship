      The Phase II study is a multi-center, open, dose escalation and dose extension clinical&#xD;
      trial. It is planned to enroll 24 patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutation (EGFR 19 exon deletion or 21 exon mutation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation select JY025 12mg/kg and 16mg/kg Q3W administration combined with EGFRTKI&#xD;
      (gefitinib 250mg or erlotinib 150mg) QD plan, each dose group enrolled 6 subjects, in the&#xD;
      first cycle Perform DLT evaluation. If 2/6 cases or more of DLT occur at 12 mg/kg, then the&#xD;
      extended phase dose is reduced to 10 mg/kg; if 16 mg/kg occurs at 2/6 cases or more of DLT,&#xD;
      the extended phase test is not performed at this dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose expansion selects 1 or 2 doses of JY025 Q3W administration combined with EGFR-TKI&#xD;
      (gefitinib 250mg or erlotinib 150mg) QD regimen, each dose group enrolled 6 subjects&#xD;
      (gefitinib and Erlotinib (3 cases each).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase III study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. It is planned to enroll 396 patients with EGFR mutation (EGFR 19 exon deletion or 21&#xD;
      exon [L858R] mutation) with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included a test drug group and a placebo control group. The dosage regimen of the&#xD;
      test drug group was: JY025 is based on phase II clinical recommended dose, once every 21&#xD;
      days, gefitinib 250mg or erlotinib 150mg once a day; placebo The dosage regimen of the&#xD;
      control group is: placebo is based on phase II clinical recommended dose, once every 21 days,&#xD;
      gefitinib 250mg or erlotinib 150mg once a day. The ratio of the test drug group to the&#xD;
      placebo control group is 1:1, and they will receive continuous administration until confirmed&#xD;
      disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or meet any of the criteria for stopping the study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;

Hierarchical logrank test was used to compare the differences between groups, and Kaplan-Meier method was used to fit the survival curve. Stratified factors included EGFR mutation type ( 19del or L858R ), baseline tumor stage ( stage III or IV ), and brain metastasis ( yes or no ). HR and 95 % confidence interval were estimated by stratified COX proportional hazard model.</description>
