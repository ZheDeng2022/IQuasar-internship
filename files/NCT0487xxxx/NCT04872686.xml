      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge&#xD;
      we have faced since World War Two. We have now reached the tragic milestone of two million&#xD;
      deaths, and the human family is suffering under an almost intolerable burden of loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Description of Bangasafe (proposed name) Oro-Nasal Spray: The spray contains PVP-I is a&#xD;
           water-soluble iodophor that consists of a complex between iodine and a solubilizing&#xD;
           polymer carrier, polyvinylpyrrolidone. In aqueous solution, a dynamic equilibrium occurs&#xD;
           between free iodine, the active virucidal agent, and the PVP-I-complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Composition: Oro-Nasal spray contains 0.6% PVP-I as an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients&#xD;
           (API) in sterile de-ionized water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Product Development, Quality Control and Quality Assurance: Following aspects of raw&#xD;
           materials including API, manufacturing in-process steps, finished product are to be real&#xD;
           time monitored and produced in Bangladesh Reference Institute for Chemical Measurements,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Raw materials characterization: Appearance, solubility, identification, nitrogen&#xD;
                content, iodide value, loss on drying, pH, sulphated ash and available iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Solvent/diluent characterization: pH, conductivity, total organic carbon, heavy&#xD;
                metal (Pb, As), endotoxin, microbial count.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality testing in several stages during product development: pH, available iodine,&#xD;
                iodide, UV absorbance, potency.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Impurity profile testing: 1-Vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 2-Pyrrolidinone, heavy metal&#xD;
                (Pb)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Accelerated &amp; real time stability study and shelf-life determination: pH, available&#xD;
                iodine, iodide, UV absorbance Up to 3 (three) month at 25C, 30C and 35C&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mode of Action: PVP itself has no microbicidal activity but rather delivers the free&#xD;
           iodine to target cell membranes. The basic mechanism leads to strong microbicidal&#xD;
           activity expressed by multiple modes of action as oxidation of amino acids and nucleic&#xD;
           acids that disrupt the microbial metabolic pathways, as well as destabilization of the&#xD;
           structural components of cell membranes, causing irreversible damage to the pathogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Dosage and Administration: Mouth &amp; Nostril: 2 puffs, in 3-4 hours interval not more than&#xD;
           4 times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. How Supplied: Oro-nasal spray aqueous solution containing 0.6%PVP-I is supplied in 30ml&#xD;
           amber color High Density Poly Ethylene (HDPE) bottle designed for pharmaceutical&#xD;
           packaging to provide adequate protection against sun light.&#xD;
