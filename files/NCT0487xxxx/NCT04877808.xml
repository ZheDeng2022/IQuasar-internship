      The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of bacterial surinfections (sepsis, VAP and&#xD;
      catheter infections) in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from 13th of March 2020 until&#xD;
      17h of October 2020. In addition, the association of these infections with the dose of&#xD;
      corticosteroids, the length of stay in ICU and in hospital, the presence of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism, the number of bacterial episodes, the different types of bacteria causing&#xD;
      the infections and ICU mortality will be evaluated as well as the associations between the&#xD;
      presences of thrombi and bacteremia/catheter sepsis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5% of patients with respiratory impairment develop a severe form with acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure and require specialized management in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).&#xD;
      Invasive mechanical ventilation (IVM) exposes ICU patients to a particular risk of a&#xD;
      nosocomial infectious complication called ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). In Europe,&#xD;
      the incidence density is 18.3 VAP per 1000 days of IMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and has rapidly spread worldwide (Liu).&#xD;
      The mortality of critical ill patients with COVID-19 has been reported variously as low as&#xD;
      11% and as high as 61% (Liu). Since March 2020, several thousand people have been receiving&#xD;
      IMV due to severe COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informal exchanges between clinicians regarding the current pandemic indicate a high&#xD;
      frequency of VAP. Several factors may account for a higher incidence of VAP in the population&#xD;
      hospitalized in the ICU for SARS CoV-2 infection (Blonz 2021):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A longer ventilation period, leading to greater mechanical exposure to the risk of VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The frequency of comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The frequency of ARDS, which is associated with a higher incidence of VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A form of acquired immunosuppression related to SARS-CoV-2 infection,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Organizational factors related to the fact that this is the first major pandemic in&#xD;
           modern history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of bacterial surinfections (sepsis, VAP&#xD;
      and catheter infections) in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from 13th of March 2020&#xD;
      until 17h of October 2020. In addition, the association of these infections with the dose of&#xD;
      corticosteroids, the length of stay in ICU and in hospital, the presence of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism, the number of bacterial episodes, the different types of bacteria causing&#xD;
      the infections and ICU mortality will be evaluated as well as the associations between the&#xD;
      presences of thrombi and bacteremia/catheter sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This is a retrospective, single-center study investigating the incidence of bacterial&#xD;
      surinfections in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from 13th of March 2020 until 17th of&#xD;
      October 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria All adult COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from 13th of March until&#xD;
      17th of October 2020 were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The primary endpoint of this retrospective study is to assess the incidence&#xD;
      of bacterial surinfections (sepsis, VAP and catheter infections) in COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      admitted to the ICU from 13th of March 2020 until 17th of October 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are the association of these infections with the dose of corticosteroids,&#xD;
      the length of stay in ICU and in hospital, the presence of venous thromboembolism, the number&#xD;
      of bacterial episodes, the different types of bacteria causing the infections and ICU&#xD;
      mortality as well as the associations between the presences of thrombi and&#xD;
      bacteremia/catheter sepsis in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU between 13th of March&#xD;
      2020 until 17th of October 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
