  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label trial to assess the efficacy of MBM-02 (Tempol) as a treatment for&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in biochemical recurrence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary data shows MBM-02 has anti-prostate cancer activity without hormone suppression&#xD;
      or toxicity to non-cancerous cells and organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solid tumors contain hypoxic regions (low oxygen) due to their high rates of cell&#xD;
      proliferation and formation of aberrant blood vessels. Intratumoral hypoxia is associated&#xD;
      with increased risk of invasion, metastasis, and patient mortality. Cancer cells respond to&#xD;
      hypoxia by stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and hypoxia inducible factor 2&#xD;
      (HIF-2). HIF-1 and HIF-2 activate a transcription of genes encoding proteins that mediate&#xD;
      major adaptive responses to hypoxia that are critical for cancer cell survival. Without&#xD;
      activation of HIF-1 and HIF-2, cancer cells would not survive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBM-02 has been shown to inhibit the genes responsible for prostate carcinogenesis, HIF-1 and&#xD;
      HIF-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is an open label study that will employ a 3+3 escalation design up to 1600 mg/day.&#xD;
      Patients will be exposed to study drug for 20 weeks. PSA and scans will be taken at baseline&#xD;
      and week 20 for efficacy.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male 18 years or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must have had previous treatment with definitive surgery or radiation therapy,&#xD;
             cryoablation, or brachytherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient may have prior salvage therapy (surgery, radiation or other local ablative&#xD;
             procedures) within 6 months prior to randomization if the intent was for cure.&#xD;
             Prophylactic radiotherapy to prevent gynecomastia within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             randomization is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must have evidence of biochemical failure after primary therapy and subsequent&#xD;
             progression. Biochemical failure is declared when the PSA reaches a threshold value&#xD;
             after primary treatment and it differs for radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. For radical prostatectomy the threshold for this study is PSA ≥ 0.8ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For radiation therapy the threshold is a PSA rise of 2 ng/mL above the nadir PSA&#xD;
                  achieved post radiation with or without hormone therapy (2006 RTOG-ASTRO&#xD;
                  Consensus definition).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. PSA progression requires a PSA rise above the threshold measured at any time point&#xD;
             since the threshold was reached;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. PSA doubling time ≤ 12 months. PSA calculation requires two consecutive PSA rises&#xD;
             (PSA2 and PSA3) above the threshold PSA (total 3 PSA values); PSA2 and PSA3 must be&#xD;
             obtained within 12 months of study entry. All baseline PSAs should be obtained at the&#xD;
             same reference lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Ability to swallow the study drugs;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. If a male with a female partner of child bearing potential, adequate methods of&#xD;
             contraception must be employed;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. If male, no sperm donation for 90 days until after the conclusion of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Be properly informed of the nature and risks of the clinical investigation, comply&#xD;
             with all clinical investigation-related procedures, and sign an Informed Consent Form&#xD;
             prior to entering the clinical investigation;&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Be able to participate for the full term of the clinical investigation;&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt;70;&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Have a life expectancy ≥ 6 months; and&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Have adequate baseline organ function (hematologic, liver, renal, nutritional and&#xD;
             metabolic):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hematology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL Platelets ≥ 100,000 per&#xD;
        microliter of blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hepatic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
        (AST) ≤2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        Renal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 60 ml/min within 2 weeks prior to registration determined by&#xD;
        24-hour collection or estimated by Cockcroft-Gault formula: CrCl male = [(140 - age) x (wt&#xD;
        in kg)] [(Serum Cr mg/dl) x (72)] CrCl female = 0.85 x (CrCl male)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of metastatic disease on imaging studies (CT and/or bone scan);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Fasting blood glucose &gt; 126 mg/dl or,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Random blood glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin A1C &gt; 6.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with QTc &gt;480 msec&#xD;

             radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Treatment within the last 30 days with any investigational drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Radiation therapy within prior 6 months (prophylactic radiotherapy to prevent&#xD;
             gynecomastia within 4 weeks prior to randomization is allowed);&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient with previous or concurrent malignancy. Exceptions are made for patients who&#xD;
             meet any of the following conditions: Basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin or prior malignancy that has been adequately treated and patient has been&#xD;
             continuously disease free for ≥ 2 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Evidence of a significant medical illness, or a psychiatric illness/social situation&#xD;
             that would, in the investigator's judgment, make the patient inappropriate for this&#xD;
             study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, biliary shunt, or significant bowel&#xD;
             resection that would preclude adequate absorption of the study drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have had a recent, serious, non-malignant medical complication that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, makes the individual unsuitable for study participation;&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Have a history of a positive blood test for HIV;&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. At the time of screening, have a significant active medical illness which, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, would preclude completion of the study; and&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Body weight less than 35 kg (77 lbs.)&#xD;
