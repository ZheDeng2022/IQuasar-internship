  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to characterize pain sensitivity and psychological profile of CLBP patients&#xD;
      in comparison with pain free adults, and explore their predictive role on hypnosis outcomes,&#xD;
      an effective intervention for pain control.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a very prevalent condition, associated with high disability&#xD;
      and financial costs. Pain sensitization and psychological status have been associated with&#xD;
      symptom severity and treatment outcomes, but their prognostic value is not yet well&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial, with an experimental (hypnosis) and one&#xD;
      control group (standard care), and 5 assessment points: baseline, post intervention, 1, 3 and&#xD;
      6 months follow-up. Participants will be 160 CLBP patients and 50 pain free adults, assessed&#xD;
      on sociodemographic, clinical, pain, disability, psychophysical (Quantitative Sensory&#xD;
      Testing) and psychological variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will contribute to a better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying CLBP and of the&#xD;
      patient characteristics that can predict treatment outcomes after hypnosis. The findings have&#xD;
      the potential to improve patient-targeted treatment approaches.&#xD;
