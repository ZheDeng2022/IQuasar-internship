  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the study is to evaluate sleep disorders in breast cancer patients prior to&#xD;
      and during a course of radiotherapy in terms of severity of sleep disorders, distress for the&#xD;
      patients and use of sleeping drugs, in order to evaluate the potential effect of habituation&#xD;
      to radiotherapy during the course of treatment and generate hypotheses thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire prior to radiotherapy, after 5 and 15&#xD;
      fractions of radiotherapy, and at the end of radiotherapy. The questionnaire includes&#xD;
      questions regarding symptoms, distress, sleep disorders and sleeping drugs. In addition, a&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding the use of smartphones / tablets will be completed prior to&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-eight patients with documented start of radiotherapy and with a documented completed&#xD;
      questionnaire at baseline and at least one completed questionnaire after start of&#xD;
      radiotherapy should be subjected to statistical analysis. Assuming that 5% of patients do not&#xD;
      fulfil these requirements, a total of 51 patients should be enrolled to this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of breast cancer patients receive adjuvant radiotherapy, either following&#xD;
      breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy. The situation that a patient needs to be irradiated&#xD;
      may cause distress due to a sense of menace in view of the technology, fear of the exposure&#xD;
      to radiation and fear of radiation-related adverse effects. These fears and other factors may&#xD;
      lead to sleep disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous the study, cancer patients reported the most sleep disorders prior to and at&#xD;
      the beginning of radiotherapy. The patients appeared to develop coping strategies during the&#xD;
      treatment. In another study, an increase of insomnia was observed during the course of&#xD;
      radiotherapy due to treatment-related side effects. In general, very little is known about&#xD;
      the prevalence of sleep disorders prior and during a radiotherapy course. This study mainly&#xD;
      aims to evaluate the course of sleep disorders during radiotherapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the rate of patients with decrease of sleep disorders during the course of&#xD;
      radiotherapy compared to baseline, defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease of severity of sleep disorders by at least 2 points on a patient self-rating&#xD;
           scale (0=no problems; 10=maximum problems) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease of distress caused by sleep disorders by at least 2 points on a patient&#xD;
           self-rating scale (0=no distress; 10=maximum distress) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of the dose of sleeping drugs by at least 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required sample size of N=51 (including drop-outs) is set at the maximum that is deemed&#xD;
      achievable in this study within the timeframe of the study given the size of the target&#xD;
      population. However, with this sample size a one-sample binomial test with a one-sided&#xD;
      significance level of 2.5% has a power of 80% to yield statistical significance if the rate&#xD;
      of patients with decrease of sleep disorders during the course of radiotherapy compared to&#xD;
      baseline is 25% (rate under the alternative hypothesis) and assuming that a decrease of only&#xD;
      10% or less has to be judged as a random, non-causal change in this uncontrolled study&#xD;
      setting (null hypothesis). The latter rate was chosen after respective discussions with&#xD;
      experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of the statistical analysis is descriptive and exploratory in nature. If&#xD;
      statistical tests are applied beyond the prespecified statistical hypothesis testing for the&#xD;
      primary study endpoint, they are to be interpreted on an exploratory perspective. All data&#xD;
      recorded in the case report forms describing the study population (demographic and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, at baseline) will be analyzed descriptively. Categorical data will be&#xD;
      presented in tables with frequencies and percentages. Continuous data will be summarized with&#xD;
      at least the following: frequency (n), median, quartiles, mean, standard deviation (standard&#xD;
      error), minimum and maximum. Number of patients with protocol deviations during the study and&#xD;
      listings describing the deviations will be provided. Sleep disorders at baseline and during&#xD;
      the course of radiotherapy will be rated using two patient self-reporting scales (sleep&#xD;
      disorders and distress) and the intake of sleeping drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the rate of patients with decrease of sleep disorders during the course of&#xD;
      radiotherapy compared to baseline, the dichotomized composite endpoint is considered. The&#xD;
      point estimate of the rate of decrease and the associated 95% confidence interval will be&#xD;
      presented. To test whether the rate of decrease is significantly greater than 10%, the&#xD;
      one-sided binomial test at a one-sided 2.5% significance level will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further assess the potential impact of other relevant factors on the primary study&#xD;
      endpoint stratified analyses will be conducted. The associated factors of particular&#xD;
      importance are sleeping disorders at baseline (≤ median score on sleep disorder self-rating&#xD;
      scale vs.&gt; median score) and the use of smartphones at bedtime (≤ median score vs. &gt; median&#xD;
      score). Furthermore, a logistic regression model including sleep disorder rating scale at&#xD;
      baseline (≤ median score on sleep order self-rating scale vs.&gt; median score), the use of&#xD;
      smartphones / tablets at bedtime (≤ median score vs. &gt; median score) and other factors,&#xD;
      namely age, type of breast surgery, systemic anticancer treatment, body mass index,&#xD;
      co-morbidity will be fitted to identify potentially relevant prognostic factors for the&#xD;
      decrease of sleep disorders. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence interval (Wald χ2) will&#xD;
      be derived thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, each component of the primary composite endpoint will be subjected to&#xD;
      statistical analyses to evaluate the sleep disorders during the course of the study using&#xD;
      descriptive statistical methods. These analyses allow for detailed assessment of the scales&#xD;
      over time taking into account potential decrease as well potential increase in sleep orders.&#xD;
      For graphical visualization Spaghetti-plots and Box-Whisker diagrams will be provided.&#xD;
      Moreover, the change from baseline values will be considered and subjected to descriptive&#xD;
      analyses. Friedman tests and Wilcoxon-Mann Whitney tests may be applied for comparison of&#xD;
      study visits. Cumulative distribution plots of changes from baseline at each visit will be&#xD;
      presented; these plots will display a continuous change from baseline on the x-axis and the&#xD;
      cumulative percentage of patients experiencing that change on the y-axis. The above mentioned&#xD;
      analyses will be further stratified by sleeping disorders at baseline (≤ median score on&#xD;
      sleep disorder self-rating scale vs.&gt; median score) and the use of smartphones at bedtime (≤&#xD;
      median score vs. &gt; median score). For further exploratory analysis, the rates of patients&#xD;
      experiencing any sleep disorders (yes/no) at each time will be estimated together with their&#xD;
      associated confidence intervals; these analyses will also be stratified by sleeping disorders&#xD;
      at baseline and the use of smartphones at bedtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment of all 51 patients (48 patients plus 5% drop-outs) should be completed within&#xD;
      4.5 months. The radiotherapy period will be 3-6.5 weeks. This equals a total running time for&#xD;
      the study of approximately 6 months.The recruitment of all 51 patients (48 patients plus 5%&#xD;
