  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is the first involving the two most common neurodevelopmental disorders, ASD and&#xD;
      ADHD, as well as TDC to establish a multi-dimensional database (clinic, behavior,&#xD;
      neurocognitive function, brain imaging, metabolomics, and microbiome) using the same&#xD;
      methodology. Based on this integrated multi-dimensional databank, we anticipate exploring&#xD;
      metabolic flows of the gut-brain axis during brain development and identifying the common and&#xD;
      unique biomarkers of ASD and ADHD and high-risk materials related to their functions and the&#xD;
      underlying mechanism. Moreover, distinguishing the characteristics of the gut microbiota,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders, and microbial flora dysbiosis also helps us, in turn, to&#xD;
      accelerate the process of identifying biological treatments that can interfere or slow down&#xD;
      the severity of cognitive impairments in neurodevelopmental disorders. Eventually, we&#xD;
      anticipate finding the clinical and neurocognitive measures related to the direct or indirect&#xD;
      influence of gut-brain signaling. Our findings are anticipated to improve the knowledge about&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders, enhance developing early detection, diagnosis, and treatment&#xD;
      for ASD and ADHD, and contribute to precision medicine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders in Taiwan and worldwide (prevalence rate, ASD, 1%; ADHD, 3-10%),&#xD;
      presenting as clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders with early onset at&#xD;
      childhood lasting to adulthood. Both disorders bring a tremendous impact on individuals,&#xD;
      families, and society. Despite extensive studies on these two disorders, our knowledge about&#xD;
      their pathogenetic mechanism is still minimal, and there are no biomarkers for effective&#xD;
      prevention, early detection, diagnosis and biological treatment (ineffective in 30% ADHD&#xD;
      patients, none for ASD). Although they have distinct symptom inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      intervention, emerging evidence suggests that ASD and ADHD may share some genetic influences&#xD;
      and susceptibility involving neuroanatomical phenotypes, cognitive deficits, and behavioral&#xD;
      phenotypes. However, few studies have investigated these two disorders simultaneously.&#xD;
      Moreover, the role of metabolomics and microbiome in neuropsychiatric disorders has drawn&#xD;
      much attention recently. With the PI's long-term commitment to the&#xD;
      neurocognitive/imaging/gene research ADHD and ASD in separate projects, our knowledge about&#xD;
      these two disorders improved, but their underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. Hence, a&#xD;
      multi-dimensional prospective gut-brain axis integration study highlighting the metabolism in&#xD;
      the whole body to identify the common and unique factors of these two disorders and discover&#xD;
      their gene-microenvironment interaction mechanism is extremely urgent and warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify and compare the early environmental factors (e.g., maternal, and pre-,&#xD;
           peri-, and post-natal factors) affecting the gut- microbiome, cognition, and brain&#xD;
           structures and functions among the ASD, ADHD and TDC groups at ages of 4-12 years old;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the symptomatology, neuropsychology, neuroimaging, gut microbiome and&#xD;
           metabolic biomarker signatures at Time 1 and Time 2 among the three groups while&#xD;
           considering food, GI symptoms, and life style;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the changes (Time2-Time1), stability, and interactions of the&#xD;
           symptomatology, neuropsychology, neuroimaging (MRI+MRS), gut microbiome and metabolic&#xD;
           biomarker signatures in youths with ASD and ADHD as compared to TDC over a 2-4-year&#xD;
           follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify the predictors from the environmental (perinatal, food, lifestyle, family,&#xD;
           school, neighborhood) and individual (behavior, gut microbiota, metabolomics, brain&#xD;
           structure) factors for the neurocognitive/brain function and psychosocial outcomes in&#xD;
           the follow-up.&#xD;
