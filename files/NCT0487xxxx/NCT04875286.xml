  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares patients' attitudes regarding marijuana products for medical use and&#xD;
      other treatments for cancer-related pain. This study may help researchers gain better&#xD;
      understanding of patient's perception on their use of marijuana products in treating&#xD;
      cancer-related pain and other common cancer-related symptoms.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the patient's reported preference for cancer pain improvement with opioids,&#xD;
      opioids with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-marijuana and/or opioids with cannabidiol&#xD;
      (CBD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the association between perception of cancer-related symptom relief and use&#xD;
      of THC-marijuana and/or CBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare patient perception of THC-marijuana and/or CBD versus (vs.) cancer treatments&#xD;
      in treatment of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate patient report of adverse effects experienced while using THC-marijuana&#xD;
      and/or CBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate patient reported concerns while using THC-marijuana and/or CBD. V. To&#xD;
      evaluate patient attitude of dosing, forms and use of THC-marijuana and/or CBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate demographic, physical and psychosocial factors that influence patient&#xD;
      perception and attitudes of THC-marijuana and/or CBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To explore the difference of patient perception of THC-marijuana and CBD in cancer&#xD;
      centers in a legalized vs. a non-legalized state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To explore the patient reported preference of THC-marijuana and CBD for cancer pain and&#xD;
      symptom relief of patients in a Supportive Care Center vs. Integrative Medicine Center at&#xD;
      University of Texas (U.T.) MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' medical records are reviewed and then complete questionnaires over 27 minutes.&#xD;
