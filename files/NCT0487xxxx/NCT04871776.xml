    <textblock>
      This study aims to increase uptake of the COVID vaccine through messaging in formed by&#xD;
      Construal Level Theory. Patients in the Mass General Brigham (MGB) health system aged 18 and&#xD;
      older who have not received a dose of any COVID vaccine will be randomized to one of four&#xD;
      messaging arms: 1) &quot;why&quot; messaging, 2) &quot;how&quot; messaging, 3) &quot;how&quot; messaging with a vaccine&#xD;
      marked as reserved, or 4) standard of care (&quot;usual care&quot;). Messages will be sent twice, two&#xD;
      weeks apart, and will be delivered through the electronic patient portal or by mail. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be rates of receipt of at least one dose of a COVID vaccine at 6 weeks&#xD;
      after the first message. Secondary outcomes include the rate in each arm of receipt of one&#xD;
      dose and the full COVID vaccine series at 3 months.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>&quot;Why&quot; messaging</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this arm, patients will be sent two messages separated by two weeks each, either by electronic patient portal or by mail. Messages will focus on reasons to get the COVID vaccine, including protecting self and loved ones or the idea of herd immunity.</description>

    <arm_group_label>&quot;How&quot; messaging</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this arm, patients will be sent two messages separated by two weeks each, either by electronic patient portal or by mail. &quot;How&quot; messages will focus on the details of scheduling a vaccination appointment, what to expect, and how to prepare for the visit.</description>

    <arm_group_label>&quot;How&quot; messaging with a vaccine marked as reserved</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this arm, patients will be sent two messages separated by two weeks each, either by electronic patient portal or by mail. The &quot;how&quot; messaging with a vaccine marked as reserved will provide the same information as the &quot;how&quot; messaging arm and will be enhanced by saying &quot;a vaccine has been reserved for you&quot; and a prompt to schedule at the MGB vaccination location closest to the patient's address.</description>

    <description>In this arm, patients will be sent two messages separated by two weeks each, either by electronic patient portal or by mail. The messages will be the routine messages that are sent to patients notifying them of eligibility to schedule a COVID vaccine.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Messaging informed by construal level theory</intervention_name>
    <description>Messages are informed by construal level theory, which suggests that emphasizing &quot;why&quot; elicits more abstract thinking, or high-level construals, and can induce an emotional mindset, which could challenge an individual's sense of identity, autonomy, or political preferences. Conversely, emphasizing &quot;how&quot; is more cognitive and evokes concrete thinking, or low-level construals, and encourages a planning or implementation mindset, which may be better for encouraging vaccine uptake.</description>
