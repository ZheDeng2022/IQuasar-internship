    <textblock>
      The purpose of this experiment is to analyze facial pigmentation and skin microbiome changes&#xD;
      after topical almond oil application, compared to the use of topical hydroquinone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of 50 subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  25 randomized to receive almond oil nightly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  25 randomized to receive 2% hydroquinone nightly&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Timelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of an individual subject's participation will last from the day of the&#xD;
           consent/screening (visit 1) until visit 5 where they will have images taken and&#xD;
           measurements collected to assess skin pigment, skin hydration, sebum excretion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of participation is 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The estimated time for the investigators to complete primary analysis is 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>The research team will quantify the presence of facial redness with a SkinColorCatch from Delfin Technologies. This will measure the RGB colors and average them from each participant for each of the visits.&#xD;
Skin pigment, including the presence of redness, will be measured using a SkinColorCatch from Delfin Technologies. This device shows the RGB Colors, CIE L*a*b* and L*c*h* color space coordinates when the device is applied to the skin.Included is the link to the device (http://www.truesystem.co.kr/product/pdf/SkinColorCatch%20Brochure%202016.pdf).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal women of Fitzpatrick skin types 3 to 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with a nut allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoking is an independent risk factor and serves as a confounder for the development&#xD;
             of facial aging [18]. Therefore current smokers, those that have smoked within the&#xD;
             past year, and former smokers with greater than a 20 pack year history of smoking will&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with an autoimmune photosensitive condition or a known genetic condition with a&#xD;
             deficiency in collagen production (such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) will be excluded as&#xD;
             this can be a confounder for facial photoaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormonal medications or therapies will not be allowed unless they have been stable on&#xD;
             their medications for at least 2 months. Examples include oral contraceptives,&#xD;
             progesterone-based injections, and estrogen based hormonal replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who have undergone any cosmetic procedures to the face in the 4 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment in the opinion of the investigator. People that have undergone deeper&#xD;
             chemical peels (TCA based peels) within 1 year prior to enrollment will also not be&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are unwilling to discontinue vitamin E containing supplements and food&#xD;
             sources during the washout and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individual who are unwilling to discontinue topical cosmetic products during the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are not willing to engage in a two-week washout on topical treatments&#xD;
             known to affect facial pigmentation and these agents will be restricted during the&#xD;
             study period as well. These include topicals that contain:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Retinoids such as tretinoin, adapalene, retinol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antioxidant ingredients such as vitamin C or vitamin E.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pigment-reducing agents such as hydroquinone, azelaic acid, kojic acid per the&#xD;
                  discretion of the investigator except for the hydroquinone that is provided in&#xD;
                  this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Topicals that contain a nut oil or nut extract as part of their ingredient list.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Furthermore, subjects will be asked to refrain from use of any other topical products&#xD;
             for one week prior to each visit apart from the study agents supplied from this study.&#xD;
