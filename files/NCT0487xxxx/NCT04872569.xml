    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to pilot test a decision-making tool that is tailored for&#xD;
      women with SCI to support them in the decision-making process. Pilot testing focuses on&#xD;
      feasibility and preliminary efficacy.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the readiness to make a choice in Stage of Decision-Making Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Decision or choice predisposition about pregnancy. The single-item scale ranges from &quot;haven't begun to think about choices&quot; to &quot;have already made a decision and unlikely to change my mind&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Decisional Conflict Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 3 months]</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional conflict is characterized by uncertainty about a decision. The Decisional Conflict Scale consists of 9 items with 5 response options. Total scores range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 45 (extremely high decisional conflict).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of decision making tool as assessed by participant rating of the presentation of information</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of decision making tool is measured by 11 items that measure the presentation of information are rated on Likert scales ranging from 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent) with higher scores reflecting better information presentation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of decision making tool as assessed by participant rating by the usefulness in supporting decision making</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability is measured by 9 items. The items measure the usefulness of worksheets in the decision making tool and are rated on Likert scales ranging from 1 (not at all useful) to 5 (very useful). Higher scores indicate an increase in usefulness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Demand of decision making tool as assessed by duration of intervention use</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tracking usage through web statistics (i.e. site traffic and length of stay on the webpage)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Demand of decision making tool as measured by question on likeliness of using the tool after the study is over</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is measured with a single item rated on Likert scales of 1 (definitely not likely) to 5 (very likely). Higher scores indicate a higher likelihood of using the tool after the study is over.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Implementation of decision making tool as measured by question of ease of use of tool</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Implementation is measured with a single item rated on Likert scales ranging from 1 (very hard) to 5 (very easy).</description>
