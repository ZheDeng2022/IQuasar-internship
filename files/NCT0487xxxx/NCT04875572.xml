  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management and prediction of pain is one of the most crucial jobs for anesthetists. It&#xD;
      has been shown that a patient's ability to remain calm during stressful situations is related&#xD;
      to their post-surgical pain scores. The MetroDoloris Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI)&#xD;
      monitor is a heart-rate monitor that provides us with a number which reflects a patient's&#xD;
      state of relaxation (or parasympathetic tone). For this reason, the investigators are testing&#xD;
      whether ANI can be used as a metric for perioperative anxiety, and a predictive tool for pain&#xD;
      after c-sections.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the MDoloris ANI monitor as an effective&#xD;
      tool for objectively measuring perioperative stress, and as a prediction of post-operative&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: High perioperative anxiety scores, high post-operative pain scores, high&#xD;
      post-operative anesthetic dosing, and high incidence of provider intervention will be&#xD;
      positively correlated with frequency and magnitude of changes in the ANI score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Anesthetists are constantly monitoring a patient's heart rate during caesarean&#xD;
      sections. This is standard care, and this monitoring provides useful information about a&#xD;
      patient's level of sedation, analgesia, and comfort. The ANI monitor takes more heart rate&#xD;
      information through two electrodes placed on a patient's chest, and non-invasively provides&#xD;
      more information by which anesthetists can improve the patient's standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine whether the ANI monitor is a viable means of measuring&#xD;
      perioperative anxiety during C-sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the ANI monitor is capable of providing anesthetists with an objective&#xD;
      prediction variable for post-operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods and Design: Once eligibility is determined , the patient will be approached&#xD;
      in the pre-operative waiting area at a time determined by the charge nurse. If they consent&#xD;
      to the study, they will be given an validated questionnaire which assesses the patient's&#xD;
      level of operative stress. After the survey, they will have the ANI electrodes placed on&#xD;
      their chest by a member of the study team. The collection of this pre-surgical data provides&#xD;
      the research team with a baseline to which they will compare the operative and post-operative&#xD;
      results. Five to ten minutes prior to their surgery, the electrodes will be removed, and the&#xD;
      monitor will be brought to the OR. The monitor will be plugged in to an electrical socket far&#xD;
      away from areas of high traffic, and will not disturb the flow of OR staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the operation, a member of the study team will constantly watch the ANI monitor to&#xD;
      check for optimal connectivity, and will record the events of surgery. A record of the events&#xD;
      is critical to interpreting the meaning of the ANI score, as it allows the team to match&#xD;
      distinct stimuli with the number produced by the monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spinal block typically wears off after 24 hours, so at 24- and 48 hours following the&#xD;
      c-section, a study team member will approach the patient on the wards, and ask for their&#xD;
      resting, and evoked pain scores on a VAS 0-100 mm scale. Evoked pain is pain caused by&#xD;
      movement. The investigators have chosen the previously used metric of a change in position:&#xD;
      from lying to sitting. If the patient has received drugs for pain already, the investigator&#xD;
      will ask them to score the pain they experienced before receiving medication. The study&#xD;
      investigator will finally record the provider-administered dose of pain medication from the&#xD;
      patient's chart.&#xD;
