  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, two-arm, randomised and controlled trial. Adults with thyroid nodules&#xD;
      suspected of malignancy are to be included consecutively. A total of 340 patients are&#xD;
      randomly assigned 1:1 to have FNA with a spinal (25G) or a conventional (25G) needle. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is the rate of diagnostic cytological samples according to the Bethesda&#xD;
      system. Secondary outcomes are cost-effectiveness, patient's experienced pain and&#xD;
      complication rates. In addition, a subgroup analysis of the surgically treated patients aims&#xD;
      to examine the diagnostic correlation between FNA cytology and histology.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Till 1 month after last inclusion. Corresponding to about 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Complications, such as infections, bleedings or hematomas requiring treatment or admission, recurrent nerve injury and Horner's syndrome, will be recorded during the procedure. All patients are instructed to contact the department responsible for their management if they suspect complications. These will then be documented in the patient's medical record. At the end of the study period, the patient's medical records will be reviewed for admissions or contacts concerning complications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of cytology with histology</measure>
    <time_frame>Till 1 month after last inclusion. Corresponding to about 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation with histology is examined to ensure comparable diagnostic accuracy of the needles, and will only be analysed on patients who are subsequently treated with surgery.&#xD;
Cases with cytological diagnoses positive or suspicious for malignancy or follicular adenoma, which on final histologic examination are diagnosed as malignant or with follicular adenoma, are considered true positives. The cases with benign cytology that histologically have benign diagnoses are considered as true negatives. Cases with a benign histology that are cytologically suspicious or positive for thyroid malignancy or follicular adenoma are classified as false positives. A false-negative diagnosis is assigned to cases with follicular adenoma or malignant histology that have been cytologically diagnosed as benign. Results will be reported as predictive values.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>About 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain is assessed using the VAS (Visual Analog Scale) immediate after the procedure.&#xD;
The score is ranging from 0 to 10 with higher numbers indicating a more painful procedure.</description>
