  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide increase in the prevalence of obesity is a cause of great concern.&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatment options are being explored at the moment with a major focus on the&#xD;
      hormones produced by the gastrointestinal tract which regulate hunger and satiation/satiety.&#xD;
      Modulating the release of these hormones via bitter substances reduced appetite-related&#xD;
      sensations and gastrointestinal motility in lean female volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intragastric administration of a quinine-solution has shown to decrease hunger sensations in&#xD;
      healthy female volunteers. Now, we want to examine whether this effect is still seen in an&#xD;
      overweight female population.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of acute administration of quinine&#xD;
      hydrochloride on the consumed milkshake volume, gastrointestinal hormone levels,&#xD;
      appetite-related sensations and whole blood glucose levels in overweight female individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded, cross-over study. Forty&#xD;
      healthy overweight females will be recruited. An acute dose of 320 mg of quinine&#xD;
      hydrochloride is administered as a solution via a nasogastric feeding tube. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected at regular time points to measure gastrointestinal hormone release and&#xD;
      whole blood glucose levels. Appetite related sensations will be scored at regular time points&#xD;
      on visual analogue scales.&#xD;
