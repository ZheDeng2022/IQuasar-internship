  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In-hospital mortality after cardiac surgery ranges from 2-6%. Many patients suffer from major&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) which results in impaired disability-free survival.&#xD;
      Troponin plays the central role in identifying MACE. However, interpretation after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery is difficult due to ischemia-reperfusion-injury and direct surgical trauma. While the&#xD;
      4th universal definition of type 5 myocardial infarction uses the 10 x ULN as cut-off, &gt;90%&#xD;
      of patients after on-pump procedures exceed this cut-off. Clinical consequences are unclear.&#xD;
      The dynamic of Copeptin and Heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) concentrations&#xD;
      starts very early, i.e. several hours before Troponin. The investigators plan a prospective&#xD;
      multicenter cohort study to evaluate 1) the independent association between Copeptin and&#xD;
      H-FABP with disability -free survival and MACE after cardiac surgery; 2) the predictive gain&#xD;
      of their addition to the Euroscore II; 3) the independent association between H-FABP and&#xD;
      acute kidney injury.&#xD;

      The initial patient visit will take place after screening of patients and eligibility&#xD;
      assessment and no later than on the day before surgery (day -1). After provision of patient&#xD;
      information and written informed consent, baseline data will be extracted from clinical&#xD;
      source documents. Blood will be sampled prior to induction (Troponin), upon arrival in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (Troponin, HFABP and Copeptin), and on postoperative day 1 and 2&#xD;
      (Troponin). Sampling will occur as far as possible concurrently to clinically indicated blood&#xD;
      samples. Blood samples will be analyzed in a certified laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be contacted after 30 days and 12 months by E-Mail, postal mail and/or&#xD;
      phone call to obtain for the 12-item WHODAS 2 and information on potential events.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Data will be entered into a secure on-line database documenting the time and individual entering the data. Data will be collected directly from source documents into the eCRF. A copy of the original source documents will be stored within a locked cabinet/office accessible to authorized personnel only. An identifiable patient data page reporting the assigned patient identification code will be stored separately also in a locked cabinet/office (accessible to authorized personnel only) in order to record in-hospital outcomes, conduct follow-up, supply missing data points, and to allow potential monitoring visits by regulatory authorities. All collected data will be archived for a period of 15 years.&#xD;
The secure database run by the clinical trials unit of the University Hospital Duesseldorf allows for data entry accountability and high security standards.</ipd_description>
