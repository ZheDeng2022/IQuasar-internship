  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central vein stenosis (CVS) is a well-known complication of central venous catheterization,&#xD;
      especially after insertion of temporary hemodialysis catheters (tHDC). Incidence and&#xD;
      prevalence differ between studies, and exact figures are hard to tell since proper&#xD;
      venographies seldom are performed unless the patient is symptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most tHDC are placed in the jugular or femoral veins as catheters in the subclavian veins&#xD;
      have been shown to result in CVS to a greater degree. However, some studies are equivocal and&#xD;
      there are several advantages with the subclavian vein such as a lower risk for infectious and&#xD;
      thrombotic complications, longer durability (thereby avoiding placement of a new catheter&#xD;
      with repeated tissue trauma), increased comfort during insertion and use, less effect on&#xD;
      blood flow if the patient moves the head, easier to mobilize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies on CVS incidence originate from the 1990s when ultrasound-guided insertions were&#xD;
      unheard of and polyurethane catheters were prevalent. The investigators believe that there is&#xD;
      less tissue trauma when using ultrasound guidance in real-time. Furthermore, CVS is less&#xD;
      common when silicone catheters are used instead of polyurethane catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid unnecessary vascular trauma and patient suffering, any pre-existing CVS should&#xD;
      ideally be detected before cannulation attempts. A CT scan of the chest with IV contrast is&#xD;
      preferred, but this exposes the patient to ionized radiation, is time-consuming and (although&#xD;
      debated) may cause contrast-induced nephropathy. A brief ultrasound examination to verify&#xD;
      central venous patency would be useful provided it is shown to have an adequate sensitivity&#xD;
      for stenosis detection.&#xD;

      This is a multicentric, prospective, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded,&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial. Patients will be enrolled in three hospitals (Lund, Malmö,&#xD;
      Helsingborg) in southern Sweden. The trial is investigator-initiated and non-commercial. The&#xD;
      radiologist interpreting CT venographies will be blinded to study group allocation, whereas&#xD;
      the patient, the treating physicians and other care providers will not be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive a silicone tCDC either in the right subclavian vein&#xD;
      (intervention) or in the right internal jugular vein (control). A pre-catheterization&#xD;
      ultrasound scan will be performed to verify vein patency and to detect CVS. All&#xD;
      catheterizations will be performed in a standardized manner. A questionnaire regarding the&#xD;
      patient's experience of the catheterization procedure is handed out as soon as possible,&#xD;
      preferably immediately after catheterization if the clinical situation permits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up is carried out at least three months after the removal of the catheter to eliminate&#xD;
      transitory thrombosis. A CT venography with a customized protocol for this study will be&#xD;
      performed to look for CVS. The pre-catheterization ultrasound examination is repeated,&#xD;
      preferably by the same physician.&#xD;
