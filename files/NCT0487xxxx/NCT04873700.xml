  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to check the disease activity in people with moderate to severe&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete questionnaires about their disease and quality of life on Day 1&#xD;
      clinic visit. They will do this during a standard scheduled appointment with their doctor.&#xD;
      Some of this study will also involve collecting information about participants from their&#xD;
      medical records.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, cross-sectional, and non-interventional study of participants with&#xD;
      moderate to severe IBD (UC or CD). The study will have a cross-sectional evaluation on Day 1&#xD;
      to provide the real-world data of disease activity, treatment patterns, burden of disease and&#xD;
      quality of life in participants with moderate to severe UC or CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve an additional retrospective review of medical charts of participants&#xD;
      of previous 3 years to describe the IBD treatments and use of other healthcare resources&#xD;
      related with the management of UC or DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 335 participants. All participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      one observational cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Mexico. The overall time for data collection in&#xD;
      the study will be approximately 3 years before the start of the study (Day 1).&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Active CD at Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with active CD observed, where active CD will be defined as Harvey Bradshaw index (HBI) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 8 or Crohn's disease active index (CDAI) &gt;=220. CDAI assesses CD based on clinical signs and symptoms such as number of liquid stools, intensity of abdominal pain, general wellbeing, presence of comorbid conditions, use of antidiarrheal, physical examination and laboratory findings. Total score ranges from 0 to 600 points. Higher score indicates more severe disease. HBI score is used to measure disease activity of CD and consists of 5 clinical parameters: general well-being, abdominal pain, number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass, and complications. Total score is sum of individual parameters. Score ranges from a minimum score of 0 to no pre-specified maximum score as it depends on number of liquid stools, where higher scores indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants with active disease UC disease will be observed, where UC is defined as 9-point Partial Mayo Score (pMayo score) &gt;=5. The Mayo score is composed of four categories (bleeding, stool frequency, physician assessment, and endoscopic appearance) rated from 0-3 that are summed into a total score ranging from 0-12. pMayo score consists of 3 sub scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician global assessment of disease severity, each graded from 0 to 3. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9; where higher scores indicating more severe disease. The pMayo score when compared with the full Mayo score and categorizes UC patients as being in remission (score of 0 to 2), having mild activity (pMayo of 3 or 4) or moderate to severe activity (pMayo of &gt;=5).</description>

    <description>SF-36 is a general quality of life (QoL)-questionnaire, which evaluates 8 health dimensions: physical functioning, bodily pain, role physical (limitations due to physical problems), role emotional (limitations due to personal or emotional problems), mental health, social functioning, vitality, and general health perceptions. Based on these 8 dimensions, two weighted scores are generated: the physical component summary (PCS) score and the mental component summary (MCS) score.

    <description>IBDQ is a disease-specific questionnaire with 32 items that measures four dimensions: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms, and social function. Within dimensions, each question presents seven possible answers/points. Each domain score is the sum of 8 responses each ranging from 1 to 7, where 1 indicates worst function and 7 the best. The sub-score ranges from 8 to 56 and thus the total score ranges from 32 to 224, where higher score indicates better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Mean Total Percentage of Work Impairment Assessed by Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire (WPAI) in UC or CD Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>The last 7 days prior to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>WPAI assesses the impact of IBD on work productivity and daily activities during the previous 7 days. The WPAI includes 6 questions: 1 (if currently employed); 2 (hours missed due to disease); 3 (hours missed other reasons); 4 (hours actually worked); 5 (degree disease affected productivity while working); 6 (degree disease affected regular activities). WPAI generates four component scores: percentage of work time missed (absenteeism); percentage of impairment while working (presentisms); percentage of overall work impairment (absenteeism and presentisms combined); and percentage of activity impairment. Scores for WPAI range from 0% to 100%, where 0 % indicates no impairment and 100% is total loss of work productivity/activity. Employed participants will be evaluated for this outcome measure. Mean total percentage of work impairment (absenteeism and presentisms) will be reported in terms of hours.</description>
