  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of the study are to assess the safety profile of Teduglutide (Revestive®) in&#xD;
      people with Short Bowel Disease as well as how well people respond to the treatment with&#xD;
      Teduglutide (Revestive®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is about collecting data only; participants receive Teduglutide (Revestive®) by&#xD;
      their doctors according to the clinical practice but not as part of this study. Only standard&#xD;
      care information available in the participant's medical records will be reviewed and&#xD;
      collected for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants do not need to visit their doctor in addition to their normal visits.&#xD;
