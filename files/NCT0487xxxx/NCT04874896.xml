  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACKGROUND: The development of new molecular techniques, in recent years, has increasing the&#xD;
      knowledge of the composition and functionality of the intestinal microbiota. In the area of&#xD;
      kidney transplantation, observational studies have described a change in the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota during the immediate post-transplantation period that seems to be related to the&#xD;
      appearance of clinical outcomes such as diarrhea, repeated urinary tract infections, the need&#xD;
      for adjustment of immunosuppressive treatment or acute rejection. However, intervention&#xD;
      studies on this subject are necessary to determine how far the microbiota can influence in&#xD;
      the development of these events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To clarify the influence of maintaining the composition and functionality of the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota on post-transplant clinical outcomes such as diarrhea, urinary tract&#xD;
      infections, kidney graft rejection and the need for dose adjustment of immunosuppressive&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: single-center, randomized, interventional pilot study with 50 deceased&#xD;
      kidney donor transplant patients at low immunological risk. Each patient will be randomized&#xD;
      at the time of inclusion in the study to one of the 2 branches of the study: 1) Intervention&#xD;
      group: 25 patients who will receive a autologous fecal matter transfer during the first 6&#xD;
      months post-transplantation, 2) Control group: 25 renal transplant patients with the same&#xD;
      characteristics who will not receive any type of intervention in addition to the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment indicated according to hospital protocol.&#xD;
