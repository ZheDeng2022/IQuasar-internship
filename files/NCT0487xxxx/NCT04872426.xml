  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the relationship between activation of AMP-activated protein kinase&#xD;
      (AMPK) in human skeletal muscle and the subsequent improvement in muscle insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      for the stimulation of glucose uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be investigated in young healthy lean male subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to demonstrate the association between AMPK activation and increased insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in human skeletal muscle. We intend to examine insulin sensitivity after various&#xD;
      levels of AMPK activation in skeletal muscle that includes exercise at different intensities&#xD;
      as well as exercise combined with leg blood flow restriction (ischemia). Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that exercise combined with ischemia will result in an increased activation of AMPK compared&#xD;
      to exercise alone, and therefore we expect that exercise combined with ischemia will result&#xD;
      in the greatest improvement in muscle insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main experiment consists of 3 experimental days (A, B and C), separated by a minimum of&#xD;
      14 days and carried out in a randomised order. On all the study days the participants will&#xD;
      arrive in the laboratory after an overnight fast. Catheters will be placed in both femoral&#xD;
      veins and in one femoral artery. A muscle biopsy will be obtained from vastus lateralis of&#xD;
      one leg (resting leg). Experiment A consists of one-legged muscle work for 1 hour at 70% of&#xD;
      the leg maximum aerobic work capacity with the other leg serving as a resting control. In&#xD;
      experiment B, the same work are performed, but with periodic at the same constricting the&#xD;
      blood supply to the working leg (25 seconds every 2 min). Experiment C consists of one-legged&#xD;
      muscle work for 1 hour at 70% and 95% of the leg maximum aerobic work capacity (alternately&#xD;
      every 5 min). Immediately after each type of exercise a biopsy will be obtained from the&#xD;
      exercising leg and the participants will rest in the fasted state for 3 hours before a third&#xD;
      set of muscle biopsies (from both legs) will be obtained. Subsequently, insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      will be evaluated during a 2-hour physiological hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. By the end&#xD;
      of the clamp a final set of biopsies (both legs) will be obtained. Throughout the study day&#xD;
      sampling of artery and venous blood/plasma samples allow estimation of substrate extraction&#xD;
      by the two legs. Further, measures of artery blood flow by Ultrasound Doppler technique will&#xD;
      allow a final calculation of substrate uptake/release across the two legs before exercise,&#xD;
      during exercise and in recovery from exercise. Importantly, the ability for insulin to&#xD;
      stimulate theses process can be evaluated in both a rested and in the prior exercised leg.&#xD;
