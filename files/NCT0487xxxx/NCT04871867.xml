      During this world COVID-19 outbreak, and according to the experience of team doctors, after&#xD;
      their return, some players could have been affected by the SARS-cov2. Also, this study aims&#xD;
      to clearly determine the condition of athletes at the end of lockdown after this COVID-19&#xD;
      crisis and the cardiorespiratory consequences in particular in those who have been affected&#xD;
      by COVID-19 and the prevalence of acute myocarditis. The investigators assess in this&#xD;
      observational study the cardiac and lung consequences of COVID-19..&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 virus, beginning in November 2019, initially&#xD;
      in China, has being marked by a rapid spread, numerous severe respiratory cases and an&#xD;
      elevated mortality rate. Although that 85% on average of patients with SARS-cov2 are not&#xD;
      symptomatic or poor symptoms, these people were not systematically tested by PCR and&#xD;
      spontaneously recovered. However, at the end of lockdown, the challenge for the medical staff&#xD;
      in each first league soccer team involves to assess their clinical health conditions&#xD;
      including clinical evaluation, COVID-19 tests, chest CT, and cardiac function in order to&#xD;
      detect potential anomalies. Especially, physicians should be cautious about the risk of acute&#xD;
      viral myocarditis, often asymptomatic, in patients having COVID-19 with any or poor symptoms,&#xD;
      reported in 7 to 28%. The risk could be a myocardial dysfunction, arrhythmic complications&#xD;
      and/or sudden death during return to exercice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observational study, the investigators included the soccer player after the spring&#xD;
      lockdown. After firstly an exhaustive interview to assess the lockdown quality of the&#xD;
      athlete, clinical status and potential mild or poor symptoms of COVID-19 during the outbreak,&#xD;
      and secondly COVID-19 serology and regular PCR tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The athletes having a positive nasopharyngeal SARS-cov2 PCR and/or positive COVID-19 serology&#xD;
      test, with or without symptoms, were included in the study. Up to 10 days after first&#xD;
      positive PCR, a cardiac evaluation is done including EKG, cardiac ultrasound echography and&#xD;
      stress test in running ground and Chest Computer Tomography (chest-CT). According to the&#xD;
      results of cardiac tests and Lung CT-scan, these athletes also require Cardiac MRI to&#xD;
      eliminate the risk of acute myocarditis.&#xD;
