  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 16-week study in adult participants with chronic hand eczema (CHE). The&#xD;
      participants will visit the clinic regularly to have the study doctor assess their CHE and to&#xD;
      answer questions about itch, pain, CHE symptoms, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to assess how delgocitinib cream works to treat CHE when compared to a placebo&#xD;
      cream with no active substance.&#xD;

    <description>The Investigator's Global Assessment for chronic hand eczema (IGA-CHE) is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the participant's global chronic hand eczema (CHE) and is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). IGA-CHE treatment success (IGA-CHE TS) is defined as an IGA-CHE score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with a ≥2-step improvement from baseline.</description>
