    <textblock>
      The Post discharge after surgery Virtual Care with Remote Automated Monitoring technology&#xD;
      (PVC-RAM)-2 Trial is a multicentre, parallel group, superiority, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      to determine the effect of virtual care with remote automated monitoring (RAM) technology&#xD;
      compared to standard care on acute-hospital care during the 30-day follow up after&#xD;
      randomization, in adults who have undergone semi-urgent (e.g., oncology), urgent (e.g., hip&#xD;
      fracture), or emergency (e.g., ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm) surgery. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes at 30 days after randomization include 1) hospital re-admission; 2) emergency&#xD;
      department visit; 3) medication error detection; 4) medication error correction; and 5)&#xD;
      surgical site infection. Additional secondary outcomes are pain of any severity, and&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe pain assessed at 7, 15, and 30 days. We will also assess optimal&#xD;
      management of long-term health by evaluating among patients with atherosclerotic disease&#xD;
      whether patients are taking classes of efficacious medications at 30 days.&#xD;

    <description>Medication errors include mistakes in medication prescribing, transcribing, dispensing, administering, or monitoring due to preventable events or actions taken by a patient, caregiver, or healthcare worker. Medication errors include: drug omission (i.e., patient did not take a drug they were supposed to take), drug commission (i.e., patient taking a drug they were not supposed to take), duration error, dosing error, frequency error, route error, and timing error. We will record all drug errors identified and also report whether they resulted in harm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain of any severity</measure>
    <time_frame>7, 15, and 30 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity and related interference with usual daily activities, will be measured via the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF).19 The BPI-SF includes four 11-point numeric rating scales (NRS) of pain intensity, which measure &quot;average&quot;, &quot;least&quot;, and &quot;worst&quot; pain intensity in the past 24 hours (hrs.), respectively, as well as pain intensity &quot;now&quot; (0= no pain, 10= pain as bad as you can imagine).</description>

    <description>Pain intensity and related interference with usual daily activities, will be measured via the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF).19 The BPI-SF includes four 11-point numeric rating scales (NRS) of pain intensity, which measure &quot;average&quot;, &quot;least&quot;, and &quot;worst&quot; pain intensity in the past 24 hours (hrs.), respectively, as well as pain intensity &quot;now&quot; (0= no pain, 10= pain as bad as you can imagine). Pain is of moderate or greater severity is defined by a score of â‰¥4/10 on a standard numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain.</description>

    <measure>Optimal pharmacological management for patients with atherosclerotic disease</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Among patients with atherosclerotic disease, we will also assess optimal pharmacological management based upon whether patients are taking 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the following classes of efficacious medications at 30 days (i.e., an antiplatelet or anticoagulant drug; an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker; and a statin).</description>

    <measure>Health services utilization-related costs</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Data on hospital re-admission, healthcare utilization, and costs of health service utilization will be obtained from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) data repository. Administrative databases used to describe the health service utilization include: 1. Registered Persons Database (RPDB) - demographics and vital statistics of all legal residents of Ontario; 2. Discharge Abstract Database - records of inpatient hospitalizations from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI); 3. Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) Database - physician billing claims, and the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System - information on emergency department visits from CIHI.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-level cost of recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The Ambulatory and Home Care Record (AHCR) will be used to comprehensively measure patient-level costs of illness from a societal perspective. This approach gives equal consideration to health system costs and costs borne by patients and unpaid caregivers (e.g., family members, friends). AHCR items can be categorized as publicly financed (e.g., public sector paid resources) or privately financed care (e.g., all out-of-pocket and third-party insurance payments, and time costs incurred by caregiver). Face validity and reliability of the AHCR is well established in multiple groups, including surgical patients.</description>

    <description>Persistent post-surgical pain at has been adopted by the proposed classification for chronic post-surgical pain established by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). A patient will meet the primary outcome if: 1) the patient reports non-zero pain (NRS pain score &gt;0 at rest) in the last 24-hours, 2) located around the surgical incision (i.e., axilla, medial arm, shoulder, or chest wall on the side of surgery), 3) at 3-months after surgery (IASP's time required for normal healing from injury), 4) with no other identifiable cause of pain (e.g., no pre-existing pain condition, infection, or malignancy). Pain is of moderate or greater severity is defined by a score of â‰¥4/10 on a standard numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the PVC-RAM-2 intervention will take biophysical measurements with the RAM technology, complete a daily recovery survey, complete video visits with a virtual care clinical team, and take would photos during the 30 days after randomization. If the patient's RAM measurements exceed predetermined thresholds, the patient reports specific symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath), a drug error is identified, or the virtual nurse has concerns about the patient's health that they cannot resolve, the virtual nurse will escalate care to a pre-assigned and available physician.</description>
