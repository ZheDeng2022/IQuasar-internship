  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of an acidic formulation of Acalabrutinib (ACP-196),&#xD;
      acidic beverage, or grapefruit Juice on the PK of ACP-196 alone and coadministered with&#xD;
      omeprazole.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part study. Each part of the study will compare the effect of an acidic&#xD;
      formulation of ACP-196, acidic beverage (orange drink), or grapefruit juice on the PK profile&#xD;
      of ACP-196 alone and when coadministered with omeprazole. Participants will be enrolled into&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study first and then subsequent participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to either Part 2 or Part 3 of the study. Participants will be screened within 28 days before&#xD;
      the dose. Participants will be contacted approximately 14 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug administration to determine if any adverse event has occurred since the last dose of&#xD;
      study drug.&#xD;
