  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted by using MEAD to detect the meridian changes in patients with head&#xD;
      and neck cancer after conventional treatment of chemotherapy or radiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is observe the change of meridian energy in patients have be&#xD;
      diagnosed with head and neck cancer. The instrument we use is a non-invasive device called&#xD;
      meridian energy analysis device(MEAD). The theory of MEAD is use conductive rod to measure&#xD;
      the skin resistance from the specific point in human body, and to calculate the meridian's&#xD;
      energy change. In Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, physician doctor believe that the&#xD;
      median in human body would be affected by disease or uncomfortable condition. So, this time,&#xD;
      we who a group of physician of Traditional Chinese medicine department conduct this research&#xD;
      to assess the energy change in patients with head and neck cancer. The trail cooperate with&#xD;
      radiation oncology department and hematology oncology department. Subject enrollment from&#xD;
      radiation oncology department and hematology Oncology department. All of subjects have be&#xD;
      diagnosed with head and neck cancer, and will to receive conventional treatment, no matter&#xD;
      chemotherapy or/and radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major assessment of our research is meridian energy by MEAD before treatment, and six&#xD;
      consecutive cycles. In addition to this, pain degree, oral mucositis condition, impact on&#xD;
      life quality, and blood test, diagnosis imaging data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to G*Power( 3.1.9.4 edition), we expected to recruit 34 subjects. All of&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis will use SPSS, pair-t test is used to analyze continuous variable,&#xD;
      categorical variable will be analyzed by Chi-Square Test. Multivariate regression analysis&#xD;
      will be apply to discuss the major factor of the meridian changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEAD is a kind of non-invasive device, hasn't had adverse effect until now. We will start&#xD;
      emergency handling If accidents happened within measurement.&#xD;
