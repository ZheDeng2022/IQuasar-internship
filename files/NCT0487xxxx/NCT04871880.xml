      Lifestyle changes aiming at weight loss remain the cornerstone of MAFLD treatment.Evaluating&#xD;
      the motivational stage of patients' change and providing targeted lifestyle guidance may&#xD;
      significantly improve the efficiency of weight loss. The investigators hypothesize that gut&#xD;
      microbiota may affect motivation to lose weight, and the changes in gut microbiota due to&#xD;
      weight loss may positively feedback the behavior of motivation, forming a virtuous circle.&#xD;
      Thus, this study aims at ①evaluating the relationships between motivational stage of weight&#xD;
      loss and the gut microbiota (Gut-brain axis); ②investigating the effects of lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions on the gut microbiota in MAFLD patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fatty liver associated with metabolic dysfunction is common, affects a quarter of the&#xD;
      population, and has no approved drug therapy. In 2020, two position articles have proposed&#xD;
      not only the change of the terminology from NAFLD to metabolic associated fatty liver disease&#xD;
      (MAFLD), but also an update and revision of the definition of fatty liver disease. According&#xD;
      to these papers, indeed, the diagnosis of MAFLD can be made with the presence of hepatic&#xD;
      steatosis (detected by serum biomarker scores, imaging methods or histology) and at least one&#xD;
      of the fol- lowing metabolic criteria: (a) overweight/obesity, (b) T2DM and (c) metabolic&#xD;
      dysregulation (that means at least two factors among increased waist circumference,&#xD;
      hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, low serum HDL-cholesterol levels, impaired fasting&#xD;
      glucose, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] &gt; 2.5 or high&#xD;
      sensitivity C-reactive protein &gt; 2 mg/L). Here，the investigators focus on the obese NAFLD,&#xD;
      which considered as a sub-phenotype in MAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle changes aiming at weight loss remain the cornerstone of MAFLD treatment. However,&#xD;
      it is not easy to make patients change their unhealthy lifestyle. Behavior therapy may only&#xD;
      be successful in motivated patients, and motivation to dieting and exercising may be&#xD;
      different according to age and sex. Personal motivation for change plays a pivotal role in&#xD;
      behavior changes. The transtheoretical model (TTM) is an empirically validated model of&#xD;
      individual behavioral change, which involves progress through a series of stages to make a&#xD;
      particular behavioral change. TTM-based interventions have been applied to facilitate health&#xD;
      behavioral changes, such as physical exercise, smoking cessation, and weight management,&#xD;
      studies of which continue to demonstrate positive effects. Evaluating the motivational stage&#xD;
      of patients' change and providing targeted lifestyle guidance may significantly improve the&#xD;
      efficiency of weight loss. The investigators hypothesize that gut microbiota may affect&#xD;
      motivation to lose weight, and the changes in gut microbiota due to weight loss may&#xD;
      positively feedback the behavior of motivation, forming a virtuous circle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a total of seventy obese patients with NAFLD will be recruited in this study, divided&#xD;
      into lifestyle modification program group(n=35) and usual care group(n=35). All subjects will&#xD;
      undergo dietary assessment based on Food Frequency Questionnaire ( FFQ) and motivational&#xD;
      stages evaluation based on TTM. Stool samples will be collected at each visit. Demographic&#xD;
      data will be recorded, consisted of age, weight, height, waist circumference, BMI, and so on.&#xD;
      MRI-PDFF will be performed to evaluate liver steatosis. Meanwhile, vibration-controlled&#xD;
      transient elastography will be carried out, which include liver stiffness (LSM) and&#xD;
      controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurements. Biochemistry tests will be conducted as&#xD;
      supplementary for assessment of NAFLD and cardiovascular risks, comprising liver function&#xD;
      test, lipid, fasting glucose, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim at ①evaluating the relationships between motivational stage of weight&#xD;
      loss and the gut microbiota (Gut-brain axis); ②investigating the effects of lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions on the gut microbiota in MAFLD patients.&#xD;
