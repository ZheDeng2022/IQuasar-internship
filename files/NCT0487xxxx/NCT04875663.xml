  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial on the effects of group-based LM as an&#xD;
      intervention for depression. Prior to all study procedures, an online informed consent (with&#xD;
      phone support) will be obtained from potential participants. Around 90 eligible participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either the LM intervention with self-tracking tools (LM/S), pure&#xD;
      LM intervention (LM), or care-as-usual (CAU) control group in a ratio of 1:1:1. The&#xD;
      randomization will be performed by an independent assessor using a computer-generated list of&#xD;
      numbers. In order to obtain unbiased data with respect to the participants' attitudes and&#xD;
      behaviors, incomplete disclosure will be used to withhold the self-tracking component in this&#xD;
      trial. Participants in the two LM groups will receive six weekly group lifestyle modification&#xD;
      sessions (~2 hours each) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (an online approach will be&#xD;
      adopted if face-to-face sessions are not possible due to COVID-19). The group treatment will&#xD;
      primarily be delivered by clinical psychology trainees under the supervision of a clinical&#xD;
      psychologist and other healthcare professionals such as a dietitian and a fitness trainer.&#xD;
      The CAU group will continue receiving the routine care as usual and be given a&#xD;
      smartphone-based LM intervention after the completion of follow-up assessments. Both the&#xD;
      treatment groups and control group will complete a set of online questionnaires before the&#xD;
      treatment commences, immediately after treatment, and 12 weeks after the treatment sessions&#xD;
      are completed. In addition, participants in the LM/S group will complete a set of&#xD;
      self-developed survey questions related to lifestyle and mood on a daily basis.&#xD;

    <description>WHOQOL-BREF consists of 24 items assessing perception of quality of life (QoL) in four domains, including physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environment, and two items on overall QoL and general health.
