  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An intervention group and a control group will complete a battery of questionnaires at four&#xD;
      time points to investigate the impact of first-ever hearing aid fitting on fatigue and&#xD;
      associated variables. The study is observational as all participants in the intervention&#xD;
      group will already be receiving their first-ever hearing aid as part of their routine&#xD;
      audiological care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hearing Impairment leads to increased listening effort which could result in short and/or&#xD;
      long term fatigue. Previous research has shown that people with a hearing loss score higher&#xD;
      on fatigue questionnaires than people without a hearing loss. Hearing Aid fitting has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce fatigue in an objective measurement study, however no reduction has been&#xD;
      shown using subjective measurement. To examine the effect of hearing aid fitting on fatigue a&#xD;
      longitudinal study will be conducted. A battery of questionnaires measuring fatigue,&#xD;
      listening effort, daily activity, need for cognition and hearing handicap as well as an&#xD;
      objective hearing test will be conducted at 4 time points. These time points will be a&#xD;
      baseline assessment before hearing aid fitting, 2 weeks after fitting (~3 months after&#xD;
      baseline), 3 months after fitting and 6 months after fitting. A control group with no change&#xD;
      in hearing aid status will also be measured at these time points. The study is observational&#xD;
      as all participants in the intervention group will already be receiving their first-ever&#xD;
      hearing aid as part of their routine audiological care. This study monitors the effect of the&#xD;
      hearing aid fitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general hypothesis is that hearing aid fitting will reduce fatigue. More specifically it&#xD;
      is expected that fatigue will increase immediately after fitting and then decrease by the 6&#xD;
      month time point. It is also expected that social activity levels will increase after fitting&#xD;
      and that individual differences in this activity change will explain some of the differences&#xD;
      between participants in rate of change in fatigue. It is predicted that high Need for&#xD;
      Cognition and Hearing Handicap scores will increase the amount of change in fatigue for the&#xD;
      intervention group. 57 participants will be recruited for each group, each participant being&#xD;
      involved in the study for no more than 7 months with the study running for a total of 15&#xD;
      months. The data will be analysed using multi-level analysis.&#xD;
