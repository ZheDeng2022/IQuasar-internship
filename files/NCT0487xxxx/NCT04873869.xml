        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female 12 to 21 years of age, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a diagnosis of SCN8A-DEE supported by both clinical and genetic findings&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have on average at least 1 countable motor seizure per week and not be seizure-free&#xD;
             for more than 20 consecutive days&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Being treated with at least 1 other antiseizure medication (ASM), but no more than 4&#xD;
             ASMs&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have failed to achieve seizure freedom with at least 2 ASMs&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must be using a nocturnal alerting system or practice consistent with standards of&#xD;
             care at the time of screening and continue to use this for the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must have an adequate rescue medication regimen per the investigator's judgment in&#xD;
             place at the time of screening and for the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have a body weight of at least 10 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject's parent/caregiver is able to accurately identify seizure types,&#xD;
             especially countable motor seizures (defined as GTCS, tonic, atonic or FOS with&#xD;
             noticeable motor component) and is able to complete seizure diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have previously been enrolled in this study and received blinded treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have participated in an interventional clinical trial &lt; 30 days prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have symptoms that would be more consistent with another epilepsy disorder such as&#xD;
             Dravet syndrome (eg, fever-induced episodes of status epilepticus, frequent myoclonic&#xD;
             seizures, worsening on sodium channel blockers)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Are currently receiving cannabinoids or medical marijuana except Epidiolex/Epidyolex,&#xD;
             unless approved by the Sponsor&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Are currently taking systemic steroids (excluding inhaled medication for asthma&#xD;
             treatments). If subject has received these medications in the past, must be off these&#xD;
             medications for at least 3 months prior to the screening visit and these drugs may not&#xD;
             be initiated during the duration of the study. Intermittent steroids to treat&#xD;
             nonepilepsy related diseases (such as allergies or dermatological conditions) are not&#xD;
             exclusionary&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have a history of moderate or severe head trauma or other neurological disorders or&#xD;
             systemic medical diseases that are, in the investigator's opinion, likely to affect&#xD;
             nervous system functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have a clinically significant medical condition or chronic disease, that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator would preclude the subject from participating in and&#xD;
             completing the study or that could confound interpretation of study outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have clinically significant abnormal vital signs at the screening visit as determined&#xD;
             by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have one or more clinical laboratory test values outside the reference range, based on&#xD;
             blood samples taken at the screening visit, that are of potential risk to the&#xD;
             subject's safety as determined by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have, at the screening visit, an electrocardiogram (ECG) finding of a corrected QT&#xD;
             interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt; 450 msec or presence of any significant&#xD;
             cardiac abnormality&#xD;
