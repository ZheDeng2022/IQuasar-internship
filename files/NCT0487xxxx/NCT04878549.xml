  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute undifferentiated febrile infection (AUFI) is a common presenting syndrome in&#xD;
      low-resource settings and better diagnostics are urgently needed to improve patient&#xD;
      management and guide disease prevention interventions. Assessment of the host gene expression&#xD;
      response to infection in endemic populations has demonstrated significant promise as a new&#xD;
      approach to identifying patients with enteric fever and for potential in differentiating&#xD;
      between other causes of AUFI. Signatures identified through new data analytic techniques&#xD;
      could be developed into a point-of-care test for use in endemic settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multisite diagnostic evaluation study we will collect prospective clinical,&#xD;
      laboratory and diagnostic data from two endemic settings to evaluate host gene expression&#xD;
      signatures for detecting enteric fever and for determining the cause of AUFI in LMIC&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;

The index test of host gene transcription responses by a 5 gene-signature will be compared to the reference test of blood culture confirmation for a diagnosis of enteric fever in patients with AUFI.</description>

        We will recruit adults aged 15 to 45 years presenting to hospital with fever at 2 sites in&#xD;
        Asia where enteric fever is endemic. All included febrile participants will have a&#xD;
        documented tympanic/rectal temperature of ≥ 38°C or an axillary/oral temperature of ≥&#xD;
        37.8°C on presentation and will report a history of fever lasting 3 to 14 days. In&#xD;
        parallel, healthy community control participants will be recruited from each site catchment&#xD;
        area during the course of the study with enrolment designed to result in an even&#xD;
        representation of age groups and seasonal variation. Identified signatures of infection&#xD;
        will be explored in a cohort of febrile children aged 2 to 14 years at each site. 600&#xD;
        febrile adults, 200 febrile children and 200 afebrile adult controls will be recruited at&#xD;
        each site.&#xD;
