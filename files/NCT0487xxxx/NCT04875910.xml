      A good rehabilitation program may not be accessible for all individuals living with stroke&#xD;
      due to cost, transportation and compliance. Telerehabilitation is an alternative health care&#xD;
      program that may help in overcoming this issue. In this study we aim to find if the use of&#xD;
      telerehabilitation in Saudi Arabia would improve balance and walking in stroke survivors&#xD;
      during this pandemic.&#xD;

      Background: Rehabilitation program is commonly provided after stroke to improve functional&#xD;
      outcomes. A good rehabilitation program may not be accessible for all individuals living with&#xD;
      stroke due to cost, transportation and compliance. Telerehabilitation is an alternative&#xD;
      health care program that has been used to provide therapy for stroke survivors living in&#xD;
      rural areas. With COVID-19 pandemic, many stroke survivors have lost their access to&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Therefore, telerehabilitation may help in overcoming this issue. In this&#xD;
      study we aim to find if the use of telerehabilitation in Saudi Arabia would improve balance&#xD;
      and walking in stroke survivors during this pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 2 stroke survivors ( male and female/ &gt;6 months post stroke) are included in this&#xD;
      case study. Participants will receive a task-specific activity training (3days/week moderate&#xD;
      exercises for 4 weeks) Both participants will provide feedback through questionnaires pre and&#xD;
      post the 4 weeks intervention. We will use the Activities- specific balance confidence (ABC)&#xD;
      scale, Lower limb functional scale (LEFS) and Stroke severity quality of life scale (&#xD;
      SS-Qol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Intervention: The participants will follow a home-based exercise through videos with follow&#xD;
      up from the therapists for 4 weeks.&#xD;
