      Multi-center randomized trial to assess the safety and performance of low-frequency&#xD;
      therapeutic ultrasound for maintaining renal function after contrast exposure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to assess the safety&#xD;
      and performance of the Sonogenix RENOBOOST as an adjunctive therapy for maintaining renal&#xD;
      function after contrast exposure. The trial will enroll up to 234 subjects not taking oral&#xD;
      nitrates and at high-risk of developing PC-AKI undergoing coronary arteriography for a&#xD;
      planned percutaneous coronary intervention in up to 10 clinical sites in the US and up to 3&#xD;
      clinical sites outside the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be pre- treated with 0.9 percent NaCl at 3 ml/kg/h 1 hour before and 1&#xD;
      ml/kg/h during and 6 hours post procedure. Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion&#xD;
      to either active adjunctive therapy with the Sonogenix RENOBOOST or sham control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have clinical follow-up examination 30 days post index procedure.&#xD;
