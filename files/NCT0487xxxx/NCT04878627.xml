  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No studies of cannabidiol (CBD) have focused on Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Dose, side effects,&#xD;
      tolerability, acceptability of pure CBD in AN must be established. The current study is an&#xD;
      important first step in the investigation of CBD for AN. Cannabis products have been recently&#xD;
      legalized in many states, and CBD in particular has been shown to reduce anxiety. Therefore,&#xD;
      CBD may represent a promising new treatment for AN. The endocannabinoid system is involved in&#xD;
      the regulation of functions relevant to eating disorders. Furthermore, data suggest that&#xD;
      eating disorders are associated with alterations of the endocannabinoid system. Prior&#xD;
      attempts to target the endocannabinoid system in AN have focused on CB1 receptor agonists&#xD;
      that can increase anxiety. Moreover, CBD may be particularly beneficial in decreasing anxiety&#xD;
      in AN via its action at serotonin receptors. Lastly, the impact of CBD on eating behavior and&#xD;
      weight in AN must be determined. The current study seeks to explore these hypotheses using&#xD;
      the aims in the following section.&#xD;
