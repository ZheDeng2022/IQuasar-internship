  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common conditions causing disability and&#xD;
      limitation in the elderly population, with 13% of women and 10% of men over the age of 60&#xD;
      suffering from symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Pain and other symptoms of OA significantly&#xD;
      affect the quality of life, manifesting itself in pain, decreased range of motion, functional&#xD;
      limitation and change in gait patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Knee Replacement Surgery (TKR) is the most common solution for patients with advanced&#xD;
      cartilage erosion and is considered a successful surgery with high satisfaction rates (about&#xD;
      80%). The surgery becomes necessary when pain limits the daily functioning and impairs the&#xD;
      quality of life and after the failure of conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Still, patients undergoing TKR suffer in the first period after surgery from pain, decreased&#xD;
      balance and proprioceptive impairment. Despite the improvement in pain and function, the&#xD;
      rates of falls after surgery do not change drastically and remain high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About a third of older adults fall each year, leading to fractures, functional decline and in&#xD;
      some cases death. Walking is a complex task, and with advancing age walking becomes less&#xD;
      automatic and requires additional attention. Among adults, it is known that an increased risk&#xD;
      of falls is associated with reduced ability to perform complex walking tasks, such as walking&#xD;
      while talking or crossing obstacles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After TKR, most falls occur while walking due to slipping / tripping. In addition,&#xD;
      proprioceptive impairment, pain and poor balance are associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      falling after TKR. The mechanism underlying these effects may be increased allocation of&#xD;
      cognitive resources to walking. Thus, this study will examine the ability of people before&#xD;
      and after TKR to perform complex walking tasks, in order to examine the change in attention&#xD;
      allocation to walking following surgery. It is hypothesized that after surgery, the ability&#xD;
      to walk while performing an additional task will be lower than prior to surgery.&#xD;
