      This project was a Randomized clinical trial conducted to find out the Comparative Effects of&#xD;
      Gong's Mobilization with Gradually Graded Exercise Therapy for Chronic Neck Pain among the&#xD;
      users of Electronic Gadgets so that we can have best treatment option for patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study design was a Randomized Clinical Trial. For the study data was collected from&#xD;
      sports and spine professionals. Sample size was calculated with the help of Epitool&#xD;
      calculator. The study will be completed in 6 months duration. Neck Disability Index (NDI),&#xD;
      Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) for pain intensity and Universal Goniometers for measuring&#xD;
      (ROMs) and Forward head posture (FHP) were assessed before and 4 weeks after the treatment&#xD;
      through the craniovertebral angle (CVA) measured from a digitized, lateral-view photograph of&#xD;
      each subject. All the subjects were selected using Non Probability convenient sampling&#xD;
      technique. The Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following two groups: Gong's&#xD;
      Mobilization (Group 1) or Gradually Graded Exercise Therapy (Group 2).This study was&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with the rules of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written Informed&#xD;
      consent were taken from all the subjects before participating in this trial. SPSS 25 was used&#xD;
      for data entry and analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Change in Craniovertebral angle (CVA) from baseline was measured at 12th session. Craniovertebral angle (CVA) is a factor that significantly influences pain in those individuals with a forward head posture (FHP). Craniovertebral angle (CVA) (the angle between the horizontal line passing through C7 and a line extending from the tragus of the ear to C7).</description>

    <description>Group A received Gong's mobilization and common treatnent (TENs,Hot pack and cervical stretches). Gong's mobilization which is concurrent application of Apophyseal joint gliding and end range passive physiological movements while the subject's cervical postures are passively Neutral in order to induce Normal Cervical Extension. The Subjects in Group A were treated three times in a week for 4 weeks.</description>

    <description>The Subjects in Group B were received Exercise Therapy and common treatment (TENs, Hot pack and cervical stretches) three times in a week continue for 4 weeks . Each exercise session will take 30 min. It will be consisted of 5 min warm-up exercises, 20 min stabilization exercises, 5 min cool-down, and stretching exercises including neck and shoulder girdle muscles.&#xD;
The aim of Exercise program was to create a neutral spine and activate deep muscles of the cervical spine. The patients were educated to maintain neutral spine during the exercises and throughout the day as much as possible.&#xD;
Scapulothoracic stabilization exercises were included_ specific exercises for the muscles affecting scapular orientation related to neck pain. The subjects were educated to maintain the positions and contractions during the exercises including scapular retraction, eccentric scapular retraction, and combined scapular retraction with shoulder lateral rotation, forward punch, and dynamic hug.</description>
