  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Therma COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test is an in vitro rapid, lateral flow immunoassay&#xD;
      intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein antigens in human&#xD;
      saliva specimens. This test is intended for near-patient use at the point-of-care or lay&#xD;
      person, self-use in a non-laboratory or home setting using saliva samples from individuals&#xD;
      with or without symptoms of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Therma COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test will be compared to a Health Canada approved RT-PCR&#xD;
      COVID-19 test. Nasopharyngeal (for RT-PCR) samples will be collected at a COVID-19 Testing&#xD;
      centre and saliva (for the rapid antigen test) samples will be collected and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective, observational, feasibility study will test 300 participants to establish the&#xD;
      performance characteristics of the test on saliva specimens.&#xD;

    <description>To establish the performance characteristics of the Therma COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test in a near-patient, point-of-care (POC) setting with lay users (no laboratory experience) testing a participant that has self-collected the saliva specimen. Clinical accuracy of the rapid antigen test compared to RT-PCR test results. Accuracy refers to the (PPA, positive percent agreement (sensitivity) and (NPA, negative percent agreement (specificity) between the results of the tests. The expected performance of the test for symptomatic participants shall be &gt;90% PPA and &gt;98% NPA.</description>
