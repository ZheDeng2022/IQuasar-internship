  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence among young age groups is rising and&#xD;
      overwhelming. This new trend of young-onset CRC incidence is evident in western countries.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, Asian countries have shown the same epidemic shift in the past few years. As a&#xD;
      consequence, this situation might necessitate revisiting the current screening program in&#xD;
      this region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saudi Arabia has a two-fold increase in CRC incidence among young age groups in the last 18&#xD;
      years (9.6/100000 for male versus 9.3/100000 for female). This rising incidence ascribed to&#xD;
      the lack of a screening program and suggested lowering CRC screening to 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The low awareness about risk factors, signs, and symptoms of the disease causes late&#xD;
      presentation of CRC cases. Therefore, most presenting cases are associated with a poor&#xD;
      prognosis and short survival. Educational and screening programs are, by no means, considered&#xD;
      valuable and essential as CRC tends to affect younger age groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CRC is cancer that starts in the innermost lining mucosa of the colon or rectum. According to&#xD;
      the global cancer Observatory (GCO) 2018, CRC incidence is the third (10.2%) globally, after&#xD;
      lung and breast cancers (11.6%). In Saudi Arabia, 2010 report, the incidence was 10.4/100,000&#xD;
      that slightly higher in male groups. Unfortunately, the incidence among young age groups is&#xD;
      more than that in countries with high incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the CRCs initially found as small benign growth or projections known as polyps inside&#xD;
      the lumen of colorectal space. A polyp is precancerous if it is &gt;1 cm or the presence of more&#xD;
      than two polyps, or if dysplasia present after the polyp removal. There are two main types of&#xD;
      polyps: precancerous and hyperplastic polyps or inflammatory polyps, which are not&#xD;
      precancerous. The early resection will prevent future cancer development and total cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different lifestyle factors that could increase CRC's risk include lack of regular physical&#xD;
      exercise, a diet low in fruit and vegetables, a low-fibre and high-fat diet, diary intake&#xD;
      during adolescence, overweight and obesity, alcohol consumption and tobacco use. Adherence to&#xD;
      CRC screening is essential to limit CRC cancer incidence and improve population health; and&#xD;
      then, health providers need to understand the stages of the disease to recommend effective&#xD;
      screening strategies.&#xD;
