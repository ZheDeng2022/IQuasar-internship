    <textblock>
      Pain control is a critical after many surgical procedures. It is well known that orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeries are among the most painful procedures, with total joint arthroplasty being a clear&#xD;
      example of this situation. Current trends in pain management are morphing and multimodal&#xD;
      opioid sparing protocols are now being evaluated and implemented, with results showing a&#xD;
      decrease in the amount of opioids being prescribed. Despite all efforts, most patients&#xD;
      experience pain and, in order to control it, multiple medications have been tried with&#xD;
      variable results. The most commonly prescribed medications are opioids, but side effects&#xD;
      associated with their use as well as their addictive potential are making them a less&#xD;
      desirable option for patients. Currently there is a trend towards diminishing opioids&#xD;
      consumption and prescribing alternative pain control regimens.Caffeine is a well known&#xD;
      molecule that when associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) potentiates&#xD;
      their analgesic effect and decreases the amount of doses required to control pain. Little is&#xD;
      known about the effect of caffeine over pain relief in patients undergoing total joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty, but preliminary results in other fields make us believe it could have a&#xD;
      potential benefit for patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty.&#xD;
