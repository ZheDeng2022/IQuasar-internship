    <textblock>
      A subset of patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV2 infection&#xD;
      present with lymphopenia. The degree of lymphopenia, and in particular reduced cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation (CD)8+ T-cell numbers, is correlated with clinical deterioration and&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The underlying reasons for lymphopenia in coronavirus&#xD;
      disease (COVID)-19 is currently unclear, We aim to assess differences in the in vivo&#xD;
      distribution of CD8+ T-cells in patients with proven SARS-CoV2 presenting with lymphopenia or&#xD;
      with normal lymphocyte counts, using Zirconium-89 ([89Zr])Df-IAB22M2C positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) imaging.&#xD;

      Rationale: A subset of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 infection present with lymphopenia.&#xD;
      The degree of lymphopenia, and in particular reduced CD8+ T-cell numbers, is strongly&#xD;
      correlated with clinical deterioration and ICU admission .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying reasons for lymphopenia in COVID-19 is currently unclear, but several&#xD;
      hypotheses have been put forward; 1) sequestration of CD8+ T-cells in peripheral tissues&#xD;
      (e.g. lung) either during the effector phase of their lifespan or passively by local&#xD;
      chemotactic signals, 2) accelerated maturation and apoptosis either induced by storm of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines or direct infection or 3) resulting from decreased lymphopoiesis&#xD;
      induced by reduced levels of stem cell factor. The lack of data on in vivo distribution of&#xD;
      CD8+ T-cells hampers a more thorough understanding of this critical prognostic factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: We aim to assess differences in the in vivo distribution of CD8+ T-cells in patients&#xD;
      with proven SARS-CoV2 presenting with lymphopenia or with normal lymphocyte counts, using&#xD;
      [89Zr]Df-IAB22M2C PET/CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a prospective, observational non-randomized pilot study in 20 patients&#xD;
      with microbiologically proven SARS-CoV2 infection. All patients will undergo a whole body&#xD;
      [89Zr]Df-IAB22M2C PET/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Twenty patients ≥50 years of age with proven COVID-19, who are admitted to&#xD;
      the ward will be included, patients will be stratified according to lymphocyte counts on&#xD;
      admission to ensure an even distribution: presenting with lymphopenia (&lt;1.0 x10e9/L) (n=10)&#xD;
      and with lymphocyte numbers within normal range (1.0 - 3.5 x10e9/L) (n=10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure: All patients will undergo a [89Zr]Df-IAB22M2C PET/CT scan 21-27 hours post&#xD;
      intravenous injection of 1.5mg protein dose labelled with 37 megabecquerel (MBq) (1 mCi)&#xD;
      89Zr; and one additional blood sample at the day of scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess differences in the&#xD;
      in vivo distribution of CD8+ T-cells in patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 presenting with&#xD;
      lymphopenia or with normal lymphocyte counts, using [89Zr]Df-IAB22M2C PET/CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the spatial correlation between [89Zr]Df-IAB22M2C uptake and abnormal findings&#xD;
           on routine contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the correlation between in vivo biodistribution of [89Zr]Df-IAB22M2C and&#xD;
           concurrent flowcytometric phenotypic and quantitative assessment of lymphocyte&#xD;
           populations&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore the correlation between in vivo biodistribution of [89Zr]Df-IAB22M2C and&#xD;
           clinical course of disease&#xD;
