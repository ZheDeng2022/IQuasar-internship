    <textblock>
      Previous work has demonstrated patients presenting with ruptured aneurysms that develop&#xD;
      radiographic and clinical vasospasm have a higher permeability of the blood brain membrane.&#xD;
      Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) has been studied and recently implicated in both the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of the blood brain barrier breakdown and vasogenic edema of ischemia strokes,&#xD;
      and is suggested to be an accurate biomarker to predict the onset of cerebral vasospasm after&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage. The therapeutic benefit of minocycline, an MMP9 inhibitor, has been&#xD;
      investigated in ischemic stroke population, however its role in the treatment of cerebral&#xD;
      vasospasm from ruptured aneurysms remains unknown. Our project has two main goals: to further&#xD;
      confirm MMP9 has a reliable biomarker for the onset of cerebral vasospasm, and secondarily to&#xD;
      investigate any possible therapeutic benefit that minocycline has in the vasospasm&#xD;
      population. Vasospasm continues to be one of the major contributors of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in the ruptured aneurysm population, and close monitoring of the neurologic exam&#xD;
      during the 'vasospasm window' usually requires two weeks in the intensive care unit in most&#xD;
      academic settings. As such, if we are better able to predict which patients are at risk of&#xD;
      developing vasospasm based on MMP9 levels, we will be better able to anticipate the need for&#xD;
      intervention and therefore mitigate the risk of vasospasm induced ischemic strokes,&#xD;
      ultimately resulting in better outcomes in the ruptured aneurysm population. Further, if we&#xD;
      are able to identify minocycline as a therapeutic agent to deter, or lessen the severity of&#xD;
      vasospasm, we can possibly improve neurologic outcomes, decrease hospital stays, ultimately&#xD;
      providing an improved and more cost-effective treatment strategy to our patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&#xD;
      (aSAH) is approximately 30%.8 The resulting ischemic complications contribute substantially&#xD;
      to the overall morbidity and mortality of brain aneurysm patients.1,13 Clinical,&#xD;
      translational, and laboratory SAH studies suggest that extravascular inflammation (serum and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid) is a potent effector of cerebral vessel reactivity.2,16,21,26 Dhar et&#xD;
      al. demonstrated a correlation between the systemic inflammatory response syndrome on&#xD;
      admission and delayed cerebral vasospasm.6 Provencio and colleagues have shown that high&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neutrophil content three days following aSAH is predictive of&#xD;
      subsequent vasospasm onset.21 While the intact blood brain barrier (BBB) prohibits egress of&#xD;
      cytokines, chemokines, and cellular traffic, aneurysmal rupture allows blood and toxic blood&#xD;
      breakdown products to rapidly enter the cerebral cisterns and extravascular space.7,11&#xD;
      Subarachnoid blood activates leukocyte transmigration by cellular margination, adhesion, and&#xD;
      diapedesis.2 In a clinical study, Dr. Mack's team (mentor on this grant proposal) previously&#xD;
      demonstrated that elevated serum levels of intercellular adhesion molecule -1 (ICAM-1) during&#xD;
      the vasospasm risk period correlated with poor functional outcome.17 The team further found&#xD;
      that increased rates of serum soluble ICAM-1 elevations predicted the onset of angiographic&#xD;
      vasospasm. While this and other data suggests that inflammation plays a critical role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of vasospasm, the mechanisms responsible for BBB dysregulation that allows&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators to permeate the extravascular space are not clear. The current&#xD;
      proposal focuses on the relationship between matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and BBB&#xD;
      permeability. The study leverages off-label use of an approved therapeutic agent,&#xD;
      Minocycline, to target this proximal step in the SAH- inflammation-vasospasm axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matrix metalloproteinases are membrane bound proteases known to be involved in remodeling of&#xD;
      the extracellular matrix through interactions with laminins, collagenases, and&#xD;
      proteoglycans.10 Previous studies have established that MMPs contribute to inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions and BBB breakdown in the central nervous system.24 The majority of MMP studies&#xD;
      related to CNS dysfunction and SAH/ vasospasm have focused on MMP9.19 In a rat SAH model,&#xD;
      Sebha et al. demonstrated colocalization of upregulated MMP-9 and collagen IV degradation in&#xD;
      the basal lamina of cerebral blood vessels.23 Clinical studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      elevated serum levels of MMP9 predict subsequent delayed cerebral vasospasm, implicating BBB&#xD;
      permeability as a critical mediator.27,28 BBB permeability is measurable in a clinically&#xD;
      relevant model system. Our group has utilized MR permeability (DCE-MR) imaging to,&#xD;
      non-invasively examine the integrity of the blood brain barrier in the setting of aSAH. Data&#xD;
      suggest that increased permeability can reliably predict subsequent delayed cerebral ischemia&#xD;
      (DCI) [Appendix B].22&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic and potent MMP9 inhibitor, was initially studied as a&#xD;
      neuro-protective agent in the setting of ischemic stroke.9,20,27,30 A recent investigation by&#xD;
      Vellimana et al. demonstrated that MMP9 deletion attenuated cerebral vasospasm and resulted&#xD;
      in less neurobehavioral deficits in a murine SAH model.27 The investigators demonstrated that&#xD;
      Minocycline decreased rates of SAH-induced vasospasm in both murine and rabbit experimental&#xD;
      models. Our group conducted a pilot clinical study (n=20 patients, 10 placebo, 10&#xD;
      Minocycline) of high dose intravenous Minocycline treatment in the setting of ICH.4&#xD;
      Minocycline was associated with a significant decrease in MMP9 levels between days 1 and 5.&#xD;
      No serious adverse events or complications were associated with the Minocycline infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians would benefit from identification of aSAH patients most likely to be afflicted by&#xD;
      cerebral vasospasm prior to its radiographic/ clinical onset. This could facilitate&#xD;
      preventative and treatment strategies focused on early pathophysiological correlates. Current&#xD;
      benchmarks such as the Fisher scale, which relate the extent of subarachnoid blood at the&#xD;
      time of aneurysm rupture to the likelihood of developing clinical vasospasm, are coarse and&#xD;
      imprecise. If BBB dysfunction reliably precedes neuroinflammation and subsequent vasospasm,&#xD;
      then DCE-MRI could serve as a sensitive radiographic biomarker and a relevant assay for&#xD;
      therapies targeting the BBB. However, we do not yet know the effects of minocycline on BBB&#xD;
      permeability. The issue of the establishment of the measure as a biomarker is to be an aim of&#xD;
      a future work. We propose to use this advanced MR imaging technique to assess the ability of&#xD;
      Minocycline, and MMP9 inhibition, to mitigate BBB dysfunction following aSAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is to assess the effect of minocycline on BBB permeability&#xD;
      and serum MMP9 levels. We hypothesize that minocycline infusion will lead to a lesser&#xD;
      increase in serum MMP9 levels compared to the control group. Further, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      infusion of minocycline will correlate to a less permeable BBB on the MRI permeability&#xD;
      imaging. Secondary and tertiary outcomes include the ultimate effect of minocycline on&#xD;
      clinical vasospasm and safety profile within the aSAH population. We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      MMP9 inhibition via minocycline will lead to a less permeable BBB, therefore mitigating&#xD;
      shifts in Ktrans. This translates clinically into a lower incidence of clinical vasospasm,&#xD;
      and thus DCI in the minocycline treatment cohort. We hypothesize that the administration of&#xD;
      minocycline at the mentioned dosage will be both safe and effective in the minocycline&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
