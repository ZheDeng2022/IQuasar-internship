  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an early phase pilot study designed to test the safety and feasibility of using a&#xD;
      novel, wireless, wearable device (Leo) for assessing respiratory parameters (lung volume,&#xD;
      respiration rate, heart rate and indices related to tidal breathing flow volume loop) in&#xD;
      children with respiratory condition (such as asthma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no product currently on the market that is comparable to this novel Leo device&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a single visit to evaluate the feasibility and safety of using the Leo&#xD;
      device on 20 children with clinically stable asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stable asthmatic children between the age of 3 and 6, inclusive, will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no disease-specific intervention, nor changes to the participant's care&#xD;
      management program for their asthma.&#xD;
