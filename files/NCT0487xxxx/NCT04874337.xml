  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to respond correctly to disasters, medical teams must have the necessary training&#xD;
      and sufficient equipment. However, in many countries, disaster nursing education is not&#xD;
      adequately included in nursing curricula (Kalanlar and Kublai, 2015). This is seen as an&#xD;
      important situation affecting the capacity of nurses to respond to disasters. In particular,&#xD;
      it is emphasized that providing disaster nursing and management training to nurse students&#xD;
      will have positive consequences for disaster-affected individuals and communities, such as&#xD;
      reduced death rates, improved health services, and reduced disaster-related costs (Kalanlar&#xD;
      and Kublai, 2015). For this reason, disaster preparation of both nurses and student nurses is&#xD;
      important for combating disasters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that nursing students provide assistance in issues such as monitoring&#xD;
      the physical and psychological health of disaster victims, improving hygiene, and health&#xD;
      counseling, using the knowledge and skills acquired in vocational education (Kashiwaba and&#xD;
      Okudera, 2014; Tomizawa et al., 2014). Some studies have shown that student nurses do not&#xD;
      have sufficient knowledge and skills in disaster preparedness and response (Schmidt et al.,&#xD;
      2011; Smithers et al., 2020). However, in most schools where the curricula of domestic&#xD;
      nursing schools are examined, disaster nursing courses are conducted as electives rather than&#xD;
      majors. Despite these limitations, nursing students tops the teams that have a key role in a&#xD;
      potential disaster or disaster (Satoh et al., 2016). Therefore, groups that can contribute&#xD;
      during disaster response must have sufficient knowledge and skills. Because the lack of&#xD;
      experience during intervention leads to stress and fear of intervening in disasters, while&#xD;
      the belief that it is adequately prepared for disaster situations increases confidence in&#xD;
      intervening in disasters. To overcome the lack of experience in Disaster Response, Education&#xD;
      that will provide insight into the reality of disaster response is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the goal of training medical personnel capable of disaster response, a variety of&#xD;
      training methods are needed, such as not only in-depth theory training, but also Case-Based&#xD;
      Learning and practice in simulated situations with a multidisciplinary approach. In this&#xD;
      context, the education model that stands out in the literature is the disaster nursing and&#xD;
      management model developed by Jening. Jenning's disaster nursing management model was&#xD;
      developed directly for Nurse students and describes the nurse's duties at each stage of&#xD;
      Disaster Management. It is a model developed to explain disaster nursing to students and to&#xD;
      provide them with knowledge about disaster management. In this aspect, the model differs from&#xD;
      other disaster management models (Jennings Sanders, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to evaluate the impact of disaster nursing and management&#xD;
      education given to students using Jenning's disaster nursing and management model on general&#xD;
      disaster preparedness belief state, disaster response self-efficiency and psychological&#xD;
      resilience of students.&#xD;

    <measure>General Disaster Preparedness Belief Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The General Disaster Preparedness Belief Scale was developed in 2018 by Inal et al. The scale based on the Health Belief model measures belief in disaster preparedness. The scale, consisting of 31 items, has 6 sub-dimensions. These are self efficacy (8 items), cues to action (5 items), perceived susceptibility (6 items), perceived barriers (6 items), perceived benefits (3 items) and perceived severity (3 items). The scale has no breakpoint. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the subscales ranged from 0.90 to 0.74. In the study, the cronbach alpha (α) value of the scale was found to be 0.81. The scale's scoring system is coded for each expression as (1) strongly disagree, (2) disagree, (3) disagree, (4) agree, (5) strongly agree. The minimum score is 31 points and the maximum is 155 points.</description>

    <measure>The Disaster Response Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Disaster Response Self-Efficacy Scale was developed in 2017 by Hong-Yan Li et al. Validity and reliability studies of the Turkish form of the scale were conducted by Koca et al. (2018). It consisted of a total of 19 items and 3 sub-dimensions, and the answers were taken with a likert scale of 5.(1=no self-confidence, 2=basically no self-confidence, 3=some self-confidence, 4=basically self-confidence, 5 = full self-confidence). High scores indicate that disaster response self-sufficiency is high. The Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0.96. For on-site rescue competency, disaster psychological nursing competency, disaster role quality and adaptation competency subscales, it was 0.93.</description>

    <measure>Brief Resilience Scale (BRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This self-reporting instrument developed by Smith et al. (2008) to measure the psychological well-being of individuals. The Turkish adaptation and psychometric studies of the scale were performed by Tayfun Doğan on 295 university students (2015). Explanatory and confirmatory factor analyses showed that the scale had a single-factor structure. The high scores obtained from the scale after translating the items coded in reverse order in the scale (items 2, 4 and 6) indicate a high psychological strength. Factor analysis was performed to determine the construct validity of the scale. The factor loads related to the items were found to be between 0.68 and 0.91 (Doğan, 2015).</description>

    <description>The subjects for the training program were prepared by the researchers by scanning the relevant literature. In particular, the ICN Framework of Disaster Nursing Competencies developed by the International Nurses Association (ICN) and the World Health Organization (WHO), the second is the universal standards that should be fundamental in nursing and midwifery education (Global Standards for the Initial Education of Professional Nurses and Midwives). The training program was conducted both theoretically and practically. The theoretical section is based on Jenning's disaster nursing management model. Investigator is a First and Emergency Aid instructor. In addition, support was received from an experienced psychologist and AFAD trainers who provided support to the victims of the Izmir earthquake during the training process. In this context, an 8-module training program was created.</description>
