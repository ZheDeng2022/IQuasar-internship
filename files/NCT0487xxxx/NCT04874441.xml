  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the implementation of a new technique for invasive&#xD;
      candidiasis diagnosis by PCR. The main objective will be to evaluate the effect of this&#xD;
      strategy on the time required to obtain results in patients from intensive care units with&#xD;
      suspected systemic invasive candidiasis. This PCR method could allow an antifungal switch to&#xD;
      be made earlier, limiting the appearance of resistance and reducing the cost of antifungals&#xD;
      for healthcare facilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive candidiasis is a serious infection caused by yeasts of the genus Candida sp. Their&#xD;
      incidence is increasing, particularly in intensive care. The prognosis is severe and depends&#xD;
      on the early initiation of adequate antifungal treatment. At present, the diagnosis of&#xD;
      invasive candidiasis is difficult since blood culture, the reference technique, has major&#xD;
      limitations due to its low sensitivity, as well as very long delays in obtaining results. As&#xD;
      a consequence, suspected invasive candidiasis is often treated empirically with&#xD;
      echinocandins, resulting in the development of resistance and extremely high costs for health&#xD;
      care facilities. The switch to treatments such as fluconazole is often delayed, although this&#xD;
      molecule is effective on most Candida species except C. krusei and glabrata and is much less&#xD;
      expensive than echinocandins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, the present study developed faster and more efficient methods to diagnose&#xD;
      Candida krusei and glabrata species, based on the detection of DNA in the blood by PCR,&#xD;
      allowing an earlier switch from echinocandins to Fluconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included will be divided into 2 groups: one group of patients will benefit from&#xD;
      a diagnostic strategy based on blood culture (reference technique for the detection of&#xD;
      Candida) and another group of patients will benefit from a diagnostic strategy based on this&#xD;
      new PCR technique. The main objective will be to evaluate the effect of the PCR strategy on&#xD;
      the time to obtain results and on the switch of antifungal agents. After inclusion, patients&#xD;
      will be followed up at day 14, day 28 until discharge (or 3 months if the patient is still&#xD;
      hospitalised).&#xD;
