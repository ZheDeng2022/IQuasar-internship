  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the current Covid-19 pandemic, many hospitals worldwide have been overwhelmed and&#xD;
      strategies based on new technologies have been considered to improve the outcomes in patients&#xD;
      with diabetes and Covid-19 and to prevent healthcare workers' exposure. Point-of-care blood&#xD;
      glucose measurements, with the need of frequent and intermittent blood glucose testing and&#xD;
      the associated time burden for hospital staff workers, have evident limitations. To this&#xD;
      respect, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) might represent an effective tool in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients. The latest CGM devices have alarms alerting clinicians (or patients)&#xD;
      to abnormal blood glucose values. Furthermore, CGMs not requiring calibration with capillary&#xD;
      glucose testing have the potential to decrease both nurse and patient burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin therapy is recommended in hospitalized patients with diabetes and Covid-19,&#xD;
      conventionally by multiple daily insulin injections, i.e., rapid-acting insulin before meals&#xD;
      and long-acting insulin once-a-day. Such a complex regimen demands also multiple daily&#xD;
      fingerstick for glucose control. Use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in hospital&#xD;
      has been considered, and simple, less sophisticated pumps might be appro¬priate for prompt&#xD;
      use by healthcare providers not specialized in diabetes treatment. V-Go® is a skin-patch&#xD;
      insulin delivery device to be replaced every 24 h. It is fully mechanical, without tubing or&#xD;
      electronics, and does not require any programming. It delivers a continuous basal infusion of&#xD;
      rapid-acting insulin and allows for additional units before meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the implementation of CGM and automated insulin infusion in Covid-19 hospitals has&#xD;
      the potential to improve clinical outcomes, protect frontline healthcare workers, and&#xD;
      preserve personal protective equipment. However, because only observational retrospective&#xD;
      data for CGM use and no data on insulin pump use are currently available, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials are needed to determine whether using these technologies in hospital is of&#xD;
      significant help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to explore, in patients with diabetes in COVID-19 wards, whether&#xD;
      using continuous glucose monitoring with a glucose telemetry system and/or using a disposable&#xD;
      insulin pump may improve blood glucose control and Covid-19 outcomes, and facilitate diabetes&#xD;
      management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia are associated with poor outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19. In these patients, severe hyperglycaemia after hospital admission is a strong&#xD;
      predictor of death among non-ICU patients and inpatient hyperglycaemia is associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of death even in patients without diabetes. However, there is no current&#xD;
      indication for blood glucose targets in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the current COVID-19 pandemic, many hospitals worldwide have been overwhelmed and&#xD;
      diabetes care centers are considering strategies based on technology to improve the outcomes&#xD;
      in patients with diabetes and COVID-19 and to prevent healthcare workers' exposure, while&#xD;
      optimizing the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Point-of-care (POC) blood glucose&#xD;
      measurements, in the context of a Covid-19 ward, with the need of frequent and intermittent&#xD;
      blood glucose testing and the associated time burden for nursing and ancillary hospital staff&#xD;
      workers, have shown significant limitations. From this point of view, continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring (CGM) might represent an effective tool for blood glucose tracking in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients. Consistently, in April 2020 the FDA authorized the use of CGM in patients with&#xD;
      Covid-19, making CGM a potential favoured option in these patients. Companies, like Abbott&#xD;
      and Dexcom, have supplied CGM systems to hospitals and provided education to use their&#xD;
      devices effectively. The latest generation of CGM devices have alarms that can alert&#xD;
      clinicians (or patients) to abnormal blood glucose values. Furthermore, CGMs that no longer&#xD;
      require calibration with POC glucose testing (factory-calibrated) have the potential to&#xD;
      decrease both nurse and patient burden associated with frequent POC glucose testing in the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare professional societies recommend insulin therapy in hospitalized patients with&#xD;
      diabetes, and this holds especially true in Covid-19 patients. The conventional treatment&#xD;
      approach involves multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) and includes the administration of&#xD;
      rapid-acting insulin analogues before meals and a long-acting insulin analogue once a day.&#xD;
      Such a complex regimen demands also multiple daily POC fingerstick for glucose control.&#xD;
      Automated insulin delivery including CSII (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) has been&#xD;
      considered in the hospital setting. In type 2 diabetes, insulin pump therapy induces better&#xD;
      glycaemic control than MDI. A likely mechanism for the improved control on CSII is that the&#xD;
      traditional large bolus injections of long-acting insulin required during MDI in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes are more erratically absorbed than the slow rapid-acting insulin infusion of CSII.&#xD;
      In this respect, the same dose of insulin given via the basal rate of CSII induced better&#xD;
      glycaemic control and higher circulating serum insulin concentrations than when given as an&#xD;
      injection of long-acting insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, starting and managing CSII in the hospital setting by personnel and patients not&#xD;
      adequately trained might represent a challenging barrier in a Covid-19 ward. Therefore,&#xD;
      simpler and less sophisticated pumps might become more appropriate for prompt use by&#xD;
      healthcare providers not specialized in diabetes treatment. V-Go® (Zealand Pharma A/S,&#xD;
      Denmark) is a wearable insulin delivery device, fully mechanical without tubing or&#xD;
      electronics, that does not require any programming. It delivers a continuous basal infusion&#xD;
      of rapid-acting insulin (20, 30, or 40 units/24 h) and allows for up to 36 additional units&#xD;
      for mealtime dosing in 2-unit increments. V-Go® is filled with fast-acting insulin and is&#xD;
      worn like a patch on the skin using a hypoallergenic and latex-free adhesive. It is designed&#xD;
      to be replaced every 24 h and is fully disposable. The implant of the device is easily&#xD;
      obtained by the push of a button that inserts a 4.6-mm, 30-gauge stainless steel needle&#xD;
      subcutaneously and starts the delivery of the continuous pre-set basal rate of insulin.&#xD;
      Mealtime bolus insulin doses are administered on-demand by pressing the bolus-ready button&#xD;
      and the bolus delivery button. Previous studies showed that switching patients from&#xD;
      traditional insulin delivery modes to V-Go® was associated with significantly improved&#xD;
      glycaemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the implementation of CGM and insulin infusion technologies in Covid-19 hospitals&#xD;
      has the potential to improve clinical outcomes, help to protect frontline healthcare workers,&#xD;
      and preserve PPE. However, because only observational retrospective data for CGM use and no&#xD;
      data on insulin pump use are currently available, randomized controlled trials are needed to&#xD;
      determine whether use of CGM and CSII systems in the hospital can be of significant help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to explore whether in patients hospitalized in COVID-19 non-ICU:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the use of CGM with a glucose telemetry system, compared with intermittent capillary&#xD;
           blood glucose monitoring and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the use of a disposable insulin pump, compared with a conventional multiple daily&#xD;
           insulin injection, may improve blood glucose control and COVID outcomes in patients with&#xD;
           type 2 or secondary diabetes mellitus and facilitate diabetes management by health care&#xD;
           providers.&#xD;

In the blinded CGM group, sensor readings will be blinded to patient and healthcare providers.&#xD;
The MDI groups will be managed with basal/bolus insulin regimen, as clinically indicated.&#xD;
