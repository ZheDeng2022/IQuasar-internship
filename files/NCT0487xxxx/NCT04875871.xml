  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a novel, recently developed unconventional radiotherapy technique which&#xD;
      consists of three high-dose fractions directed to special segments of unresectable bulky&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a mono-centric, prospective, two-arms, feasibility study in which the investigator&#xD;
      will enroll up to 22 patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancers with at least one&#xD;
      bulky (≥6cm) lesion. This study uses a novel, recently developed unconventional radiotherapy&#xD;
      technique, consisting of a short course (3 fractions) high dose partial irradiation targeting&#xD;
      exclusively the hypoxic segment of unresectable bulky tumors while sparing the peritumoral&#xD;
      immune microenvironment for induction of immune-mediated tumoricidal bystander and abscopal&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will explore the potential biological and physical advantages of&#xD;
      particle-based radiotherapy to deliver a highly conformal radiation dose to the hypoxic tumor&#xD;
      segment defined by using hypoxia-specific Copper-64-Diacetyl-bis (N4-methylthiosemicarbazone)&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography-Computer Tomography (64Cu-ATSM PET-CT) and dynamic contrast&#xD;
      enhanced Magnetic Resonance Tomography imaging. Based on tumor location, volume and risk&#xD;
      factors related to nearby organs at risk, patients will be divided in the &quot;high-dose&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;reduced-dose&quot; group which will be treated with different dose-schedules according to risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, radiotherapy will be administered at the precise timing, determined&#xD;
      individually for each patient, based on the serially mapped homeostatic immune fluctuations&#xD;
      by monitoring blood levels of the inflammatory markers. The objective is to synchronize the&#xD;
      radiation treatment with the favorable, most reactive anti-tumor immune response phase, in&#xD;
      order to break tumor´s immune-tolerance locally and systemically.&#xD;
