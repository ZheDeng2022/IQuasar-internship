  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether the study drug ASTX727 is an effective treatment&#xD;
      for people who have MPNST with a PCR2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASTX727 is a combination of two drugs (cedazuridine and decitabine) that have been designed&#xD;
      to target cancer cells with a PCR2 mutation and to disrupt the cells' ability to survive and&#xD;
      grow. The study researchers think that the study drug allows decitabine to work better than&#xD;
      decitabine given alone.&#xD;
