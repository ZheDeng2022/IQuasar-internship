  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to increase the frequency and effectiveness of post code&#xD;
      debriefs by piloting a novel intervention tool and partnering clinicians with board certified&#xD;
      chaplains trained to facilitate group processes. A post code debrief will involve two&#xD;
      aspects: a technical debrief (a discussion to process the technical, procedural aspects of a&#xD;
      medical code/cardiopulmonary arrest), which will be led by a clinician, and an emotional&#xD;
      debrief (a discussion to process the emotional, existential impact of a medical&#xD;
      code/cardiopulmonary arrest), which will be led by a chaplain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Technical debriefs already are a familiar part of practice; the novel portion of this study&#xD;
      is the introduction of the chaplain-led portion of emotional debrief. Also novel is the&#xD;
      combination of the technical and emotional debriefs. As part of the study debrief,&#xD;
      participants are asked to be present for and engaged in the discussion reviewing the code&#xD;
      event, though there is no expectation or requirement for providing verbal input. Data about&#xD;
      the content of the code debrief and the interventions provided during the debrief will be&#xD;
      recorded by the Code Blue Chaplain in REDCap. Data about participants will be self-reported&#xD;
      in their REDCap survey responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians who participate in resuscitation attempts during cardio-pulmonary arrests (CPA)&#xD;
      experience psychological, emotional, and moral distress, including feelings of anxiety,&#xD;
      grief, and regret. These experiences directly impact feelings of burnout, which is a leading&#xD;
      cause in staff turnover. While debriefing soon after the experience has been shown to&#xD;
      increase positive coping and reduce acute stress, post code debriefs are rarely conducted.&#xD;
      Current models rely on physicians to facilitate debriefs and do not provide a standard tool.&#xD;
      Physicians often feel untrained and uneasy with this role. To address these findings, we seek&#xD;
      to implement a standardized post-code debriefing process that is co-led by a clinician and a&#xD;
      chaplain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate and describe current stress of clinical staff who participate in CPA&#xD;
      events. During the first six months of the grant period, a staff chaplain will respond to all&#xD;
      &quot;Code Blues.&quot; The chaplain will recruit at least five clinical staff participants from at&#xD;
      least two different disciplines to complete surveys one-week and six-weeks after the CPA&#xD;
      event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Pilot intervention to debrief CPA experience. During the second six months of&#xD;
      the grant period, the research team will pilot the new debrief tool on the Cardiac Medical&#xD;
      Critical Care Unit (CMCC). The designated &quot;Code Blue&quot; Chaplain will respond to all code blues&#xD;
      on CMCC. The Code Blue Chaplain will be responsible for establishing the time and location of&#xD;
      the Post Code Debrief, providing the technical debrief tool to a qualified clinician, and&#xD;
      facilitating the emotional debrief following the semi-structured debrief tool. The Code Blue&#xD;
      Chaplain will recruit participants to complete follow up surveys one-week and six-weeks&#xD;
      following the CPA event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Assess feasibility and acceptability. Describe team member experience. During&#xD;
      the final year of the grant period, the research team will expand the intervention tool&#xD;
      throughout IU Health Methodist Hospital. The Code Blue Chaplain will respond to all overhead&#xD;
      code blue pages and proceed with the intervention and recruiting as stated above.&#xD;
