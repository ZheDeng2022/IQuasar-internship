  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumococcal disease causes thousands of infections, such as meningitis, bloodstream&#xD;
      infections, pneumonia, and ear infections in US annually. As pneumococcal vaccines provide&#xD;
      serotype-specific protection, it is important to induce sufficient immune responses for the&#xD;
      most clinically relevant serotypes. All adults aged 65 years or older are recommended to&#xD;
      receive PPSV23 vaccination irrespective of underlying medical conditions. Thus, since May&#xD;
      2013, South Korea introduced PPSV23 in the national immunization program for elderly&#xD;
      individuals aged ≥65 years. Following PPSV23 vaccination, serotype-specific IgG&#xD;
      concentrations and OPA titers increase and then decline over time thereby decreasing&#xD;
      protective efficacy, although these might remain above pre-vaccination levels until 5 years&#xD;
      from PPSV23 administration. The decline of pneumococcal immunity may be more prominent among&#xD;
      chronically ill patients, including those with diabetes. Currently however, revaccination is&#xD;
      not recommended. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the serotype specific immunogenicity&#xD;
      between healthy elderly people and old adults with diabetes after revaccination with PPSV23&#xD;
      at the age of 70-75 years. Serotype-specific IgG concentrations and opsonophagocytic killing&#xD;
      activity (OPA) titers will be assessed.&#xD;

Participants will be asked to record pain, tenderness and redness diameter at both injection sites and systemic symptoms such as headache, malaise, chills, muscle aches, and arthralgia. Severity will be recorded according to the Food and Drug Administration Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials. Subjects will be also asked to record any unsolicited adverse event during the 14 days after vaccination.</description>
