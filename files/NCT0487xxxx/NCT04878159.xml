      To assess whether perioperatively elevated TnT levels, using high sensitivity troponin T&#xD;
      (hsTnT) measurements, are associated with an increased risk of postoperative mortality as&#xD;
      well as severe postoperative complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac Troponin T (TnT) is a cardiac-specific molecule, released into the systemic&#xD;
      circulation following myocardial cell injury. The release of cardiac Troponins is common&#xD;
      during critical illness and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The&#xD;
      mechanisms by which TnT is released in the blood during critical illness are not fully&#xD;
      understood, but sepsis and inflammation are primary non-cardiac conditions during which&#xD;
      elevated TnT levels are commonly seen. Previous research has shown that 84 percent of&#xD;
      patients admitted to ICU had at least one elevated TnT measurement perioperatively. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing high-risk abdominal surgery, defined as immediate emergency laparoscopy or&#xD;
      laparotomy, are critically ill, often septic and with an acute inflammatory response and&#xD;
      potential multiple organ system dysfunctions both prior but largely after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that there is an association between elevated perioperative levels of&#xD;
      cardiac Troponin T and mortality in patients undergoing emergency high-risk abdominal&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess whether perioperatively elevated TnT levels, using high&#xD;
      sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) measurements, are associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      postoperative mortality as well as severe postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients requiring immediate emergency laparotomy or laparoscopy, including reoperations&#xD;
      after elective gastrointestinal surgery and reoperations after previous non emergency&#xD;
      high-risk abdominal surgery surgery, will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two primary exposure measures will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Peak Troponin T values ≥14 vs. Troponin T values &lt;14. Patients with at least one&#xD;
           measured Troponin T value ≥14 postoperatively will be allocated to the &quot;elevated hsTnT&quot;&#xD;
           group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperative hsTnT concentration ≥14 as well as a &gt;50% relative increase from&#xD;
           preoperative hsTnT concentration. Patients with hsTnT levels meeting these conditions&#xD;
           will be allocated to the &quot;elevated hsTnT&quot; group hsTnT will be taken by blood samples&#xD;
           preoperatively as well as on postoperative day 1, 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analyses investigating the association between hsTnT and 30-day mortality (yes/no)&#xD;
      and severe complications (yes/no) will be done using logistic regression models.&#xD;
