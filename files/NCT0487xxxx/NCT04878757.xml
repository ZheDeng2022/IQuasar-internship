  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess effects of a previously validated fraction&#xD;
      intervention when it is conducted classwide on the fraction knowledge of fourth-grade&#xD;
      students with and without math learning difficulties (MLD). The study population is 4th-grade&#xD;
      students with MLD and without MLD. Teachers agree to be randomly assigned to two conditions.&#xD;
      In one condition, teachers include classwide fraction intervention (CFI) in their standard&#xD;
      math program. In the other condition, teachers conduct their standard math program without&#xD;
      CFI. CFI is implemented 2 times per week for 20 weeks for about 30 minutes each time.&#xD;
      Students in both conditions are tested before and after CFI ends.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted in the Metropolitan-Nashville Public Schools. Teachers decide if they&#xD;
      want to participate. Parents of students in their classrooms decide if they want their&#xD;
      children to participate in the study; participation means students complete the study's&#xD;
      pretesting and posttesting, and teachers report their test scores on a school-collected&#xD;
      measure. Students decide if they want to participate. Teachers complete a survey, report&#xD;
      student scores on the school-collected measure, and are observed during CFI implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each CFI session comprises 3 segments. In Segment 1 (10-12 minutes), teachers conduct that&#xD;
      day's CFI lesson. In Segment 2 (10-12 minutes), students work in pairs, taking turns being&#xD;
      &quot;coach&quot; and &quot;player&quot; as they explain their thinking and solution strategies taught in that&#xD;
      day's Segment 1. Students use CFI help cards to provide constructive feedback to each other.&#xD;
      Segment 3 (5-7 minutes) is independent practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-points are students' posttest fraction ordering, fraction number line&#xD;
      estimate, fraction calculations. Secondary end-points are students' performance on more&#xD;
      distal fraction measures. Other measures are a teacher survey describing fractions&#xD;
      instruction and reliance on CFI procedures and their perceptions of CFI's effectiveness and&#xD;
      feasibility, as well as CFI adherence from audio recordings and live observations of teachers&#xD;
      implementing CFI.&#xD;

Percentile scores range from 0 to 99. The Rasch Unit (RIT) scores range from 100-300. For both measures, higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>
