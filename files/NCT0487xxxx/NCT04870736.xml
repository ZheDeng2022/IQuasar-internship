  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complex practical basic life support (BLS) training have been stopped all over the world due&#xD;
      to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020. While launching the new Simulation Centre&#xD;
      at Medical Faculty of Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic, teachers and students have&#xD;
      been dealing with the risk of COVID-19 transmission during the simulation training. One of&#xD;
      the highest risks for the transfer of COVID-19 between the medical students is during the&#xD;
      mouth-to-mouth ventilation training in BLS. It has been assumed that rescuers during BLS&#xD;
      simulation training with use of breathable nanofiber respirator with layers with accelerated&#xD;
      copper can provide efficient mouth-to-mouth rescue breaths to the mannequin in compliance&#xD;
      with safety rules.&#xD;

      The main aim of this study is to assess the efficiency of mouth-to-mouth ventilation through&#xD;
      breathable self-sterilizing nanofiber respirators with accelerated copper in COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic time. 100 volunteers (medical students trained as BLS trainers an medical students&#xD;
      trained in BLS) will provide 2 minutes cycle of BLS according to European Resuscitation&#xD;
      Council (ERC) guidelines 2021 wearing the breathable self-sterilizing nanofiber respirators&#xD;
      with accelerated copper in three different mannequins: Professional Adult Medium Skin CPR-AED&#xD;
      Training Manikin (trademark) with CPR Monitor (Prestan = trademark), Resusci Anne QCPR AED&#xD;
      (Laerdal = trademark), Resusci Baby QCPR (Laerdal = trademark). The mannequin will be&#xD;
      utilised in a randomised order. The efficiency of mouth-to-mouth rescue breaths as &quot;visible&#xD;
      breath &quot; and &quot;not visible breath&quot; will be recorded. In first BLS mannequin, the visibility of&#xD;
      chest rising by the observer will be recorded. In two other mannequins, the ventilation&#xD;
      metrics and each rescue breath evaluation in QCPR Skill Reporter (software trademark) will be&#xD;
      recorded. Overall, 3 levels of visible breath according to the relation to set optimal breath&#xD;
      volume (400 to 600 mL in adult, 30 to 50 mL in infant): low volume breath (below 400ml in&#xD;
      adults and below 30ml in infant), optimal volume breath (between 400-600ml in adult and&#xD;
      between 30-50 ml in infant), high volume breath (over 600ml in adult and over 50ml in infant)&#xD;
      will be evaluated. For the primary analysis of efficiency of mouth-to-mouth ventilation, data&#xD;
      from all three mannequins using outcome No breath / Visible breath will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Secondary analysis will utilize data from two mannequins where detailed stratification No&#xD;
      Breath / low / optimal / high Visible breath is possible. The mean volume of rescue breaths&#xD;
      in the 2-minute cycle, average pause, longest pause, success in achieving the optimal breath&#xD;
      volume, adverse events will be recorded. Regarding the technique of provided mouth-to-mouth&#xD;
      ventilation, head tilt in adult or neutral position in infant and pinching of the nose will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;
