  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose to the current study was to examine the efficacy of a telehealth, group-based,&#xD;
      combined and intensive intervention for youth with tic disorders (TDs) and common&#xD;
      co-occurring diagnoses. Families seeking treatment for TDs and common co-occurring diagnoses&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive treatment immediate (enrollment in the next group) or&#xD;
      remain on a 1-month waitlist, and then receive treatment. Outcomes will be assessed across&#xD;
      the treatment phase, immediately following treatment (post), as well as 1-, 2- and 3-months&#xD;
      following the end of treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 1,000,000 children in the U.S. have a tic disorder (TD). TDs can substantially impact&#xD;
      daily child functioning across numerous domains leading to a significant public health impact&#xD;
      of TDs. Additionally, an overwhelming majority of children with a TD have at least one&#xD;
      co-occurring disorder. Over 60% also meet criteria for attention deficit/hyperactivity&#xD;
      disorder (ADHD), half struggle with anxiety and at least a third have clinically elevated&#xD;
      Obsessive Compulsive-spectrum symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) is a first-line treatment for youth&#xD;
      with TDs. It has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency, duration, and severity&#xD;
      of tics in children and adolescents. Nonetheless, access to trained CBIT providers remains&#xD;
      limited, and common comorbid conditions are not addressed in standard CBIT. Thus, there is a&#xD;
      desperate need for interventions that can simultaneously increase CBIT access and incorporate&#xD;
      treatment strategies for comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive, group-based interventions are well-established for the treatment of comorbid&#xD;
      disorders and have been shown to be a cost-efficient modality for delivering multimodal&#xD;
      interventions. Intensive formats provide the opportunity for families to gain access to&#xD;
      treatment for a limited time without the extended burden often associated with weekly&#xD;
      treatment sessions. Further, intensive group-based treatments can simultaneously treat&#xD;
      comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the critical need for increasing access to CBIT and simultaneously treating common&#xD;
      comorbidities, a week-long group-based intensive intervention for children with TDs and&#xD;
      common co-occurring diagnoses (Taming Tics Together) has been developed and will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Participants will be randomly assigned to immediate treatment or a 1-month&#xD;
      waitlist control. Assessments will take place pre-treatment, daily throughout the&#xD;
      intervention, as well as at 1-, 2-, and 3-months post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of the current study are to evaluate symptom reduction in tic severity and&#xD;
      co-occurring condition symptom severity. Importantly, the investigators seek to learn more&#xD;
      about the effectiveness of an intensive-format for tics and co-occurring diagnoses, which may&#xD;
      lead to mechanisms to improve access to care for families who often are not able to access&#xD;
      effective treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre-treatment to post, 1-, 2- and 3-months following the end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (Leckman et al., 1989). The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale is a clinician-administered assessment evaluating tic history, as well as tics present over the past 7-10 days. The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale has been used in several randomized controlled trials and has exhibited excellent internal consistency (i.e., McGuire et al., 2018). Motor and vocal tics are rated based on their number, frequency, intensity, complexity and interference (each rated on a scale from 0-5), and impairment (rated on a scale from 0-50). The Total Tic Severity Score evaluates overall motor and vocal tic severity (range 0-50), and the Total Yale Global Tic Severity Scale Score evaluates the total tic severity score in additional to impairment, with a range of scores from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate increased severity.</description>

    <description>Subjective Units of Discomfort (SUDS as outlined in Woods et al., 2008). Youth are asked to rate each tic on a scale from 0 (not present or not distressing) to 10 (significantly distressing).</description>

    <measure>Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre-treatment to post, 1-month, 2-months and 3-months</time_frame>
    <description>Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS; Chorpita et al., 2000). The RCADS is a 47-item self-report measure to evaluate several internalizing domains. Items are rated on a scale from 0 (never) to 3 (always). The RCADS has demonstrated high internal consistency (Chorpita, Moffit, &amp; Gray, 2005)).</description>

    <measure>Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating Scale (DBD-RS)</measure>

    <description>Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating Scale (DBD-RS; Pelham et al.,1992). The DBD-RS is a 45-item parent rating scale to assess for disruptive behaviors, specifically, ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder. Informants complete the rating scale using a four-point Likert scale (zero = not at all; one = just a little; two = pretty much; three = very much). The DBD-RS has demonstrated high internal consistency (Pelletier et al., 2006).</description>
