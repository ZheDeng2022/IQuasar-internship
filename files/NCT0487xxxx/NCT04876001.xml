  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to compare face-to-face and internet-based nurse-led BBTI compare to a&#xD;
      wait-list conditions in the stroke population. This study is a parallel, three-arm,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). Each participant will be randomized into one of the&#xD;
      treatment arms; face-to-face BBTI, internet-based BBTI, and waiting-list. The BBTI,&#xD;
      emphasizes behavioral aspects of insomnia care, arises from techniques of sleep restriction&#xD;
      and stimulus control. The face-to-face and internet-based BBTI have equivalent content based&#xD;
      on the standard portion. All participants will be asked to fill the online questionnaires at&#xD;
      weeks 0 (baseline), 1 (mid-treatment), 2 (post-treatment), 4, and 12 (follow up). After the&#xD;
      final follow-up, the waiting-list participants will be allowed to join the internet-based&#xD;
      BBTI treatment. Our hypotheses are that patients with stroke who receive face-to-face or&#xD;
      internet-based BBTI, compared to a wait-list condition, will experience fewer insomnia&#xD;
      complaints.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-stroke insomnia is a common complaint with prevalence rates remain high. Patients&#xD;
      suffering from insomnia following stroke could impair their health-related quality of life&#xD;
      and negative rehabilitation outcomes. Identifying effective treatment in managing post-stroke&#xD;
      insomnia has become clinically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief behavioral therapy for insomnia (BBTI), a 4-section of treatment for insomnia, has&#xD;
      similar treatment components with CBTI, with the exception of cognitive therapy. Previous&#xD;
      evidence found that both BBTI and CBTI have comparable effects on improving sleep quality and&#xD;
      consolidation. Existing literature has suggested that BBTI was effective on mitigating&#xD;
      primary and comorbid insomnia. Nonetheless, thus far, no study has explored its effects in&#xD;
      stroke population. Of note, BBTI still requires certain contact with therapists. To enhance&#xD;
      the widespread dissemination of BBTI, it is important to establish the internet-based BBTI&#xD;
      treatment model (more flexible time schedule) to target more populations with insomnia. The&#xD;
      recent study of the online tailored BBTI has proven the comparable effects to reduce insomnia&#xD;
      severity in the general population. However, no study investigates the efficacy of&#xD;
      internet-based nurse-led BBTI in the stroke population.&#xD;
