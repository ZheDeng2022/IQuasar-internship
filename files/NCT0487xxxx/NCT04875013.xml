  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People that have difficulty with balance, such as those with damage to their inner ear, have&#xD;
      a higher risk of falling, which may lead to anxiety and reduced quality of life. Some&#xD;
      individuals that have lost part of their sense of balance can learn to compensate using&#xD;
      information from their vision, their sense of where their limbs are in space, and from other&#xD;
      balance organs that are still intact. Our study aims to determine if virtual reality used&#xD;
      together with information from footplate sensors can be used to train people with balance&#xD;
      problems to compensate for their inner ear deficits.&#xD;
