  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-period, prospective study will investigate intra- and interindividual differences in&#xD;
      digestible and metabolizable energy during a 9-day energy balanced, controlled-feeding diet&#xD;
      in non-Hispanic black (NHB) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) females who are either normal-weight&#xD;
      (BMI:18.5-24.9kg/m^2) or overweight (BMI: 25-29.9kg/m^2) but have similar energy&#xD;
      requirements. This study will also examine factors that may predict intestinal absorption&#xD;
      efficiency (i.e., digestibility) including microbial composition of stool, fasting and&#xD;
      postprandial metabolomics, gastrointestinal transit time, thermic effect of food, 24 h&#xD;
      glucose concentrations and variability, and hydrogen gas production.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The obesity epidemic is well documented, and despite a complex etiology influenced by&#xD;
      genetic, physiological, psychological, social, behavioral, and environmental factors, obesity&#xD;
      seems to be the result of energy imbalance, where energy intake exceeds energy expenditure,&#xD;
      regardless of the internal and external influences. Studies aiming to quantify and manipulate&#xD;
      modulators of energy balance, including gastrointestinal (GI) energy absorption rates (i.e.,&#xD;
      digestibility), are crucial for reducing the incidence of overweight and obesity and&#xD;
      improving overall human health. Despite considerable interindividual variability in the&#xD;
      amount of ingested energy that is absorbed (~87-98% of ingested energy) by the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, generalized equations are used to calculate individual energy intake&#xD;
      requirements, and the factors that contribute to such variability are largely unknown. The&#xD;
      proposed study will 1) investigate intra- and interindividual differences in intestinal&#xD;
      energy absorption in normal-weight and overweight NHB and NHW females when following a&#xD;
      controlled weight maintenance diet and 2) determine factors that mediate and/or predict&#xD;
      intestinal absorption efficiency. Females with estimated daily energy requirements of 1890 Â±&#xD;
      75 kcal/d will be recruited for this study. Participants will be provided a diet containing&#xD;
      1890 kcal/d [1350 kcal/d*1.4 (activity factor); 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein, 30% fat] for 9&#xD;
      d on 2 occasions (to assess intraindividual variability) separated by at least 3 wk.&#xD;
      Participants will collect stool during each feeding phase. Gross energy content (heat&#xD;
      combustion by bomb calorimetry) of the diet and stool samples will be used to calculate&#xD;
      energy digestibility (diet gross energy - stool gross energy). Factors that may mediate&#xD;
      and/or predict energy digestibility efficiency, including gastrointestinal microbial&#xD;
      composition, transit time, and gas production, fasting and postprandial metabolites,&#xD;
      continuous glucose concentrations, and thermogenesis will be assessed.&#xD;
