    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial evaluates the best dose, side effects and possible benefit of CBL0137&#xD;
      in treating patients with solid tumors, including central nervous system (CNS) tumors or&#xD;
      lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Drugs,&#xD;
      such as CBL0137, block signals passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. Blocking&#xD;
      these signals can affect many functions of the cell, including cell division and cell death,&#xD;
      and may kill cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      FACT complex-targeting curaxin CBL0137 (CBL0137) administered via infusion on Day 1 and Day 8&#xD;
      of a 21-day cycle to children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including CNS tumors&#xD;
      and lymphoma. (Phase 1 Dose Escalation) II. To preliminarily determine the antitumor effects&#xD;
      as measured by objective response rate of CBL0137 in children with progressive/recurrent&#xD;
      diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and other H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline gliomas.&#xD;
      (Phase 2) III. To preliminarily determine the antitumor effects as measured by objective&#xD;
      response rate or stable disease for at least 4 months of CBL0137 in children, adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults with osteosarcoma. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily determine the antitumor effects of CBL0137 in children with refractory&#xD;
      solid tumors and other CNS tumors, to the extent possible in the context of a Phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and describe the toxicities of CBL0137 in children with recurrent or refractory&#xD;
      solid tumors, including CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of CBL0137 in children with recurrent or refractory&#xD;
      solid tumors, including CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure biologic marker FACT in tumor specimens with potential for correlation with&#xD;
      disease response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of CBL0137 on immune response by measuring the effects on the&#xD;
      interferon response pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To preliminarily determine the effect of treatment with CBL0137 on overall survival of&#xD;
      children with DIPG or other diffuse midline gliomas, H3 K27M-mutant, in comparison with&#xD;
      historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive CBL0137 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 17 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48&#xD;
      and 60 months.&#xD;

             to enrollment unless otherwise indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corrected QT (QTC) &lt; 480 msec (performed within 7 days prior to enrollment unless&#xD;
             otherwise indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with seizure disorder may be enrolled if seizures well controlled without the&#xD;
             use of enzyme-inducing anti-convulsant agents. Well controlled is defined by no&#xD;
             increase in seizure frequency in the prior 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nervous system disorders (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]&#xD;
             version [v]5) resulting from prior therapy must be =&lt; grade 2, with the exception of&#xD;
             decreased tendon reflex (DTR). Any grade of DTR is eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have consented to receive a central venous catheter prior to the&#xD;
             administration of CBL0137. A central line is required for CBL0137 administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to risks of&#xD;
             fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal/human studies, OR because there&#xD;
             is yet no available information regarding human fetal or teratogenic toxicities.&#xD;
             Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal. Males or females of&#xD;
             reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use two&#xD;
             effective methods of birth control, including a medically accepted barrier or&#xD;
             contraceptive method (e.g., male or female condom) for the duration of the study.&#xD;
             Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving corticosteroids who have not been on a stable or decreasing dose of&#xD;
             corticosteroid for at least 7 days prior to enrollment are not eligible. If used to&#xD;
             modify immune adverse events related to prior therapy, &gt;= 14 days must have elapsed&#xD;
             since last dose of corticosteroid&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents are not eligible (except&#xD;
             leukemia patients receiving hydroxyurea, which may be continued until 24 hours prior&#xD;
             to start of protocol therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving cyclosporine, tacrolimus or other agents to prevent&#xD;
             graft-versus-host disease post bone marrow transplant are not eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving drugs that are strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4,&#xD;
             CYP2B6 (e.g., carbamazepine) and CYP1A2 (e.g., ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, fluvoxamine,&#xD;
             smoking) are not eligible. These agents are to be avoided for 7 days prior to the&#xD;
             start of CBL0137 and for the duration of the protocol therapy. Sensitive substrates of&#xD;
             CYP2D6 (e.g., atomoxetine, desipramine, dextromethorphan, eliglustat, nebivolol,&#xD;
             nortriptyline, perphenazine, tolterodine, R-venlafaxine) should also be avoided for&#xD;
             the duration protocol therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving drugs that prolong QTc are not eligible. QTc- prolonging&#xD;
             drugs are to be avoided for 7 days prior to the start of CBL0137 and for duration of&#xD;
             the protocol therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known peripheral vascular disease are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of pro-thrombotic disorder are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received a prior solid organ transplantation are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the&#xD;
             safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible&#xD;
