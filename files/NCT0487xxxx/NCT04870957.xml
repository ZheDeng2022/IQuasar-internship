    <textblock>
      This study is being completed to better understand who benefits from different chronic pain&#xD;
      treatments and how these treatments work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include a four week run-in period for all cLBP participants. After completing&#xD;
      the PainGuide (online or smart phone accessible website) run-in period, participants will be&#xD;
      assessed using either the light or light plus deep phenotyping assessment battery and those&#xD;
      who minimal or modest improvement in their pain (based on PGIC) will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      four 8-week treatments (mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), physical therapy (PT) and&#xD;
      exercise, acupressure self-management, or duloxetine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will complete study visits including physical exams, complete&#xD;
      surveys, provide samples (blood,saliva, etc.), wear an electronic wrist device at certain&#xD;
      times, and have Magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following one of the 4 treatments (8 weeks) if participants have a certain level of pain&#xD;
      (that meets eligibility for more treatment) they will be then randomized to complete one of&#xD;
      the 3 treatments that was not already assigned to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      that this interventional response phenotyping can identify individuals with different&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms for their pain who thus respond differentially to evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions for chronic lower back pain (cLBP).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition, the following mechanistic hypothesis and Aims are included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: the study predicts that patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) will preferentially&#xD;
      respond to this therapy if PROs indicate higher levels of pain catastrophizing, as measured&#xD;
      by the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, or lower scores on the Experiences Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: the study hypothesizes that cLBP patients with decreased activation in response to&#xD;
      pain in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and Prefrontal Cortex and increased&#xD;
      activation in somatosensory cortex (S1) and thalamus will respond preferentially to MBSR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Therapy (PT) and Exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: The primary hypothesis for the light phenotyping protocol is those individuals with&#xD;
      the highest scores on the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire and lowest scores for PROMIS&#xD;
      Self-Efficacy for Managing Symptoms will be most likely to improve from PT/Exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: the study hypothesis that low vagal tone and high basal inflammation will predict&#xD;
      responsiveness to the PT/Exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupressure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: The study hypothesizes that females with cLBP will respond better to acupressure than&#xD;
      men, as will those with higher scores on the 2011 Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: The study predicts that cLBP patients with higher posterior insula glutamate and/or&#xD;
      greater insula - Default Mode Network (DMN) connectivity (as well as increased DMN-S1&#xD;
      connectivity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duloxetine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: the study hypothesizes that it will replicate previous studies suggesting that&#xD;
      participants with cLBP will preferentially respond to this therapy if patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes indicate stronger elements of either neuropathic pain (indicated by a high&#xD;
      PainDETECT score) or centralized/nociplastic pain (indicated by more widespread pain on the&#xD;
      2011 Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: the study anticipates then that deficient pain inhibition on quantitative sensory&#xD;
      testing, decreased periaqueductal gray (PAG)-insula connectivity, and elevated stimulated&#xD;
      inflammatory responses will be associated with a positive response to centrally-acting&#xD;
      duloxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a subset of individuals (n=160) from these groups will be asked to participate&#xD;
      in an expanded phenotyping study that will include structural and functional brain&#xD;
      neuroimaging, quantitative sensory testing (QST), plasma measures of inflammation, and&#xD;
      digital measurement of autonomic tone.&#xD;

    <description>In this group (mindfulness-based stress reduction) participants will take part in 9 group sessions.&#xD;
The groups sessions will be divided into 8 weekly 2-hour groups sessions and one 6-hour &quot;retreat&quot;. During the sessions participants will practice mindfulness exercises directed by the a MBSR therapist. Additionally, participants will also be asked to practice daily formal mindfulness at home using audio recordings of 30-45 minute guided meditation exercises. These audio recordings can be accessed online. The sessions may take place in-person or virtually.</description>

    <description>Participants will take part in 10 physical therapy visits over the course of 8 weeks. Participants will meet with the physical therapist twice a week for a 1-hour session for weeks 1 and 2 and then weekly for the remaining 6 weeks. The physical therapist will tailor a program to the participant's needs according to recommended PT practice guidelines that will include in-person treatment, home exercise prescription, and encouragement of progressive, low-intensity, submaximal fitness and endurance activities, such as walking.&#xD;
Participants will be given a home program of exercises to be done daily and asked to engage in daily walking with a set goal based on the individual's capacity and current fitness level. Walking was selected as the aerobic exercise of focus for this treatment because it is recommended for patients with all levels of pain severity, is highly feasible to complete, and has shown effects on outcomes such as pain and disability.</description>

    <description>For days 1-7, patients will take 30mg of duloxetine once a day, in the morning. Starting day 8, participants tolerating the medication will be escalated to 60mg once a day. They will also have the option of staying at 30mg, once a day or stopping the medication. At the end of the 8-week intervention period, participants will have the option to continue the medication commercially (non-study medication) under the care of their physician or taper off the medication. During the entire 8-week intervention, patients will be asked to keep a daily log of medication dosage, any missed doses, and any side-effects they may have experienced.</description>

          -  Normal visual acuity or correctable (with corrective lenses- glasses or contacts) to&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Data (including bio-specimens, omic data, raw imaging data, and other study data) will be shared with consortial partners. Data will be held at a Data Acquisition Center (DAC) hosted at the University of North Carolina. Omics data will be shared through NIH portals as required. Data dictionaries are harmonized across study sites and shared with consortial partners.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_time_frame>Per the study data sharing plan, data will be shared to the consortial DAC at fixed intervals after 20% completion is attained (and then at each subsequent 20%). The consortium currently plans for perpetual access for consortial partners.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>The data will be available only to members of the consortium and is governed by a consortial data use agreement. Members must submit a request form for data access. The Data Access and Publications Committee will review requests and notify Data Access Team when access can be granted.</ipd_access_criteria>
