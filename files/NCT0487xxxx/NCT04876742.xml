  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that the daily administration of 0.5L alcohol-containing wheat&#xD;
      beer at 8 pm over a study period of 6 days in a row leads to a lower prevalence of delirium&#xD;
      compared to alcohol-free wheat beer following the same administration scheme and likewise&#xD;
      alcohol-free wheat beer compared to no intervention.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium is a complex state of confusion that can be seen as an acute failure of brain&#xD;
      function. It is characterised by fluctuating deficits in cognition and attention,&#xD;
      dysregulation of emotions and circadian rhythm as well as psychomotor changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In intensive care units (ICU) delirium is the most frequent syndromic complications as they&#xD;
      are found with a prevalence between 26 - 60%. In mechanically ventilated patients, delirium&#xD;
      is even detected in more than 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occurrence of delirium is associated with several negative repercussions: Delirious patients&#xD;
      show a higher prevalence in morbidity and mortality, longer stays in intensive care units and&#xD;
      normal wards, as well as impaired cognitive function several months after the acute illness.&#xD;
      The intensity of impairment in cognitive and executive function correlates with the duration&#xD;
      of delirium. Further, delirious patients cause major additional costs of up to 20% more&#xD;
      compared to non-delirious patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are several approaches for prevention and treatment of delirium in ICU their&#xD;
      impact is still limited. Improvement of existing and development of new prevention strategies&#xD;
      is therefore crucial and highly necessary. Further it has to be shown if prevention of&#xD;
      delirium has an effect on clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS AND STATE OF RESEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of alcoholic beverages and therewith beer is widespread in Switzerland. Healthy&#xD;
      effects of moderate beer consumption, especially benefits for prevention of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases, are discussed in literature. Beer's major ingredients are water, hop, malt and&#xD;
      yeast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys in US American ICUs showed a pre-existing alcohol use disorder in 16-31% of ICU&#xD;
      patients. Further research showed anamnestic alcohol abuse as a significant risk factor for&#xD;
      development of delirium in the ICU. Swiss governmental statistics show a widespread alcohol&#xD;
      consumption among the swiss population: While 82% consume alcohol periodically, 10% drink&#xD;
      alcoholic beverages on a daily and almost 60% in minimum on a weekly basis. Alcohol&#xD;
      consumption increases with age. In the group of the over 75-year-olds around 40% drink&#xD;
      alcohol daily. Around 5% of population bear a chronic risky alcohol consumption, 16% get&#xD;
      drunk at least once a month. Thereby beer is one of the most popular beverages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol, in alcoholic beverages ethanol, targets multiple central receptors and neural&#xD;
      networks. In habituated individuals an abrupt abstinence from alcohol consumption leads to&#xD;
      generalised central hyperexcitability, due to unchecked excitation and impaired inhibition&#xD;
      whereby alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and delirium tremens (DT) is more likely to occur.&#xD;
      Similar mechanisms can be thought of in patients with moderate, non-abusive alcohol&#xD;
      consumption favouring and causing delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hop:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hop (Humulus lupulus) is a major ingredient of beer. Its main pharmacologically active&#xD;
      constituent is humulone. It bears several health enhancing properties: Its main impact is the&#xD;
      calming effect, which could be shown in a study in healthy nurses when consuming alcohol-free&#xD;
      beer. Improvement of sleep quality and a hypnagogic effect induced by alcohol-free beer and&#xD;
      hop extracts could also be shown in different studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On molecular level the hop's sedating and hypnotic effect could be shown at the GABA A&#xD;
      receptor in a rat model which, positively modulated by ethanol, shortened sleep onset,&#xD;
      increased duration of sleep and decreased the spontaneous locomotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yeast - Saccharomyces cerevisiae (boulardii):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotic and preventive effects for diarrhoea of the so-called brewer's yeast could be shown&#xD;
      in tube-fed patients in ICUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the previous evidence, the investigators hypothesise the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The daily administration of a moderate alcohol amount decreases the prevalence, duration&#xD;
           and intensity of deliriums in intensive care patients whereby duration of ICU stay is&#xD;
           shortened.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal of alcohol predisposes for development of delirium in critically ill patients&#xD;
           with pre-existing moderate non-abusive alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The hop's constituents and the alcohol have a positive effect on calming, decreasing&#xD;
           intensity of delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The yeast contained in beer takes a probiotic effect and decreases the prevalence of&#xD;
           diarrhoea and obstipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now no clinical trials investigating the administration of a moderate amount of beer&#xD;
      for delirium prevention in non-alcoholic patients in ICUs have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the BABE-D (Basel Beer for Prevention of Delirium) clinical trial is the proof of&#xD;
      concept of prevention, mitigation or decrease in length of delirium by daily administering a&#xD;
      moderate amount of wheat beer in non-alcoholic ICU patients and simultaneously a decrease of&#xD;
      prevalence of obstipation and diarrhoea.&#xD;
