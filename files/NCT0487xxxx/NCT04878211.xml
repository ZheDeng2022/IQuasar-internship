  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate if participants treated with ofatumumab 20 mg subcutaneous (s.c.)&#xD;
      administered once monthly can develop an adequate immune response to the COVID-19 mRNA&#xD;
      vaccine compared to participants on an interferon or glatiramer acetate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-cohort, multicenter, prospective study of up to 66 relapsing MS participants.&#xD;
      The first cohort will be participants receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine at least two weeks&#xD;
      prior to ofatumumab start. The second cohort will be participants receiving an mRNA COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine at least four weeks after beginning ofatumumab. The third cohort will be participants&#xD;
      currently on an interferon or glatiramer acetate planning to receive COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.&#xD;
      Participants will obtain the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine from their HCP (private insurance) or&#xD;
      appropriate federal, state or local program.&#xD;
