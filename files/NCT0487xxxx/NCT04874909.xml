    <textblock>
      The purpose of the C'IL-LICO RICM study is to develop innovative and transformative&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic for patients suffering from ciliopathies leading to renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives is to decipher disease mechanisms and highlight signaling pathways altered in&#xD;
      at-risk to develop renal failure patient groups and to produce a prognostic biomarker-based&#xD;
      kit to predict the evolution of ciliopathy patients towards renal impairment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ciliopathies are a large group of rare and severe genetic diseases caused by ciliary&#xD;
      dysfunction, in which nearly all organs can be affected. In spite of being individually rare,&#xD;
      they affect collectively up to one per 2000 people. Over the past two decades, more than 90&#xD;
      genes have been reported as mutated in ciliopathy patients. Most proteins encoded by these&#xD;
      genes play key roles in the biogenesis or function of cilia, in which they define different&#xD;
      functional subdomains. Genetic analyses of ciliopathies revealed a vast clinical variability&#xD;
      and a broad genetic heterogeneity as: 1) mutations of the same disease-causing gene can&#xD;
      result in distinct clinical entities and, conversely, 2) mutations in several independent&#xD;
      genes can lead to similar clinical features, implying both phenotypic and genetic overlaps.&#xD;
      The extent and severity of organ involvement may be correlated in part with the nature or&#xD;
      location of the mutational event, the cell/tissue specific expression and effect of the&#xD;
      mutated protein on cilia dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal involvement is one of the most frequent manifestations in ciliopathies, and it leads to&#xD;
      excessive morbidity and mortality. This includes renal cystic dysplasia (RCD), a kidney&#xD;
      developmental defect, and nephronophthisis (NPHP), a chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis,&#xD;
      both disorders representing frequent causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during&#xD;
      childhood to early adulthood. This makes ESRD a terminal endpoint of either isolated or&#xD;
      syndromic ciliopathies, with, hitherto, no available curative treatment of chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease whatsoever. The only bearable option is renal transplantation. As the average&#xD;
      life-span of a functioning kidney transplant is about 10-15 years, it is urgent to identify&#xD;
      therapeutic solutions that slow down progression of CKD in ciliopathies, and delay or avoid&#xD;
      dialysis or transplantation. Today, the diagnosis of ciliopathies is first based on primary&#xD;
      clinical manifestations, and then confirmed by gene mutation identification. However, even in&#xD;
      patients with identified causative mutations, it is impossible to predict the severity of the&#xD;
      disease, the risk of appearance (if not present at diagnosis), and/or the rate of progression&#xD;
      of CKD. Thus, a crucial issue in the field of ciliopathies is to be able to perform early&#xD;
      detection of at-risk patients prior to development of CKD as well as to predict disease&#xD;
      progression rate.&#xD;
