  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the rate of inguinal hernia repair operations in England is 10 per 100,000 people. The&#xD;
      rate in the United States is found to be 28 per 100,000 people. Today, the effectiveness&#xD;
      between open repair and laparoscopic repair in inguinal hernia repair is still debated.&#xD;
      Laparoscopic approach offers many advantages over open repair. Regional blocks have an&#xD;
      important place in the multi-modal anesthesia approach applied to reduce postoperative pain.&#xD;
      In this sense, the Transversus Abdominis Plane Block (TAPB) emerges as an effective regional&#xD;
      anesthesia method that reduces postoperative pain. This method can be applied with the help&#xD;
      of ultrasound or laparoscopy. The aim of this study is to compare the ultrasound-assisted&#xD;
      TAPB application and Laparoscopy-assisted TAPB application in Total Extraperitoneal hernia&#xD;
      repair (TEP) to reveal the effects of postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients will be included in the study; 30 of these patients will be injected&#xD;
      with local anesthetic into the fascia between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique&#xD;
      muscles with the help of ultrasound from the designated area (Before the operation starts,&#xD;
      TAPB with 20 ml 0.25 % bupivacaine will be applied to the surgical side under&#xD;
      ultrasonography); In the other 30 patients, local anesthetic injection will be made to the&#xD;
      same area under laparoscopic direct vision. 50 mg Bupivacaine (0.25 % 20 ml bupivacaine&#xD;
      solution) has been determined as the application dose and this amount will be applied in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) will be used in postoperative pain follow-up. 50 mg&#xD;
      intravenous tramadol will be administered to patients with VAS &gt; 4 and tramadol will be&#xD;
      supplemented to 100 mg in patients with high pain levels after 30 minutes. Oral non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory will be given at the postoperative 8th hour. Patients whose pain persists&#xD;
      despite current therapy will be given 25 mg of meperidine intravenously as a rescue&#xD;
      analgesic. The doses of analgesic administered in the postoperative period and the hours of&#xD;
      administration will be recorded&#xD;

      While the rate of inguinal hernia repair operations in England is 10 per 100,000 people. The&#xD;
      rate in the United States is found to be 28 per 100,000 people. Today, the effectiveness&#xD;
      between open repair and laparoscopic repair in inguinal hernia repair is still debated.&#xD;
      Laparoscopic approach offers many advantages over open repair. These are topics such as&#xD;
      postoperative pain, quick recovery, and shortening of returning to work. Postoperative pain&#xD;
      is the most important determinant of recovery after abdominal surgeries. Postoperative pain&#xD;
      can be explained by two pathways connected to the peritoneum; The first is the parietal&#xD;
      peritoneum, which has a very rich innervation, and the other is the visceral peritoneum&#xD;
      stimulated by the vagus. In order to eliminate these peritoneal pains, surgeons have been&#xD;
      injecting local anesthetic into various areas on the anterior abdominal wall and&#xD;
      intraperitoneal space since 1950. Regional blocks have an important place in the multi-modal&#xD;
      anesthesia approach applied to reduce postoperative pain. In this sense, the Transversus&#xD;
      Abdominis Plane Block (TAPB) emerges as an effective regional anesthesia method that reduces&#xD;
      postoperative pain. TAPB; It is a type of regional anesthesia applied to the facial plane&#xD;
      between the internal oblique muscle and the transversus abdominis muscles, targeting the&#xD;
      somatic nerves (T6 - L1). This method can be applied with the help of ultrasound or&#xD;
      laparoscopy. The aim of this study is to compare the ultrasound-assisted TAPB application and&#xD;
      Laparoscopy-assisted TAPB application in Total Extraperitoneal hernia repair (TEP) to reveal&#xD;
      the effects of postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEP will be performed with 2-3 mg / kg propofol, 2 mcg / kg fentanyl and 0.6 mg / kg&#xD;
      rocuronium in patients who will undergo anesthesia induction with BIS &lt; 60, after intubation,&#xD;
      40 % oxygen / 1.5 - 2 % sevoflurane inhalation will be applied to keep the BIS value between&#xD;
      40 - 60 in 60 % air. Before the operation starts, TAPB will be made with 20 ml 0.25 %&#xD;
      bupivacaine in the direction of ultrasonography on the side to be operated. During the&#xD;
      operation, if there is a 20 % increase in blood pressure and heart rate from baseline, 0.5&#xD;
      mcg / kg intravenous fentanyl will be administered and the administered fentanyl dose will be&#xD;
      recorded. 1gr paracetamol 30 minutes before the end of the operation and 4 mg ondansetron 15&#xD;
      minutes before the end of the operation will be administered intravenously. With the help of&#xD;
      a 22 G injector, local anesthetic injection will be made from the anterior to the area where&#xD;
      the midaxillary line intersects the Bogros area. Digital examination will be performed to&#xD;
      define the injection site and the injection area will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients will be included in the study; 30 of these patients will be injected&#xD;
      with local anesthetic into the fascia between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique&#xD;
      muscles with the help of ultrasound from the designated area (Before the operation starts,&#xD;
      TAPB with 20 ml 0.25 % bupivacaine will be applied to the surgical side under&#xD;
      ultrasonography); In the other 30 patients, local anesthetic injection will be made to the&#xD;
      same area under laparoscopic direct vision. 50 mg Bupivacaine (0.25 % 20 ml bupivacaine&#xD;
      solution) has been determined as the application dose and this amount will be applied in both&#xD;
      groups. Bart 3D anatomical polypropylene patch will be used in both groups and the patch will&#xD;
      be attached with the help of 1 absorbable tacker. Carbon dioxide gas will be given to the&#xD;
      preperitoneal area at a rate of 4 - 6 L / min and at a pressure of 15 mm Hg. 3 trocars will&#xD;
      be used; One 10 mm camera trocar and two 5 mm working trocars will be entered through the&#xD;
      midline below the navel. At the end of the operation, the patients will be extubated by&#xD;
      antagonizing the muscle relaxant effect with 0.02 mg / kg atropine and 0.05 mg / kg&#xD;
      neostigmine. 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) will be used in postoperative pain follow-up. 50&#xD;
      mg intravenous tramadol will be administered to patients with VAS &gt; 4 and tramadol will be&#xD;
      supplemented to 100 mg in patients with high pain levels after 30 minutes. Oral non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory will be given at the postoperative 8th hour. Patients whose pain persists&#xD;
      despite current therapy will be given 25 mg of meperidine intravenously as a rescue&#xD;
      analgesic. The doses of analgesic administered in the postoperative period and the hours of&#xD;
      administration will be recorded.&#xD;
