  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by severe inflammation of the small bowel&#xD;
      and/or the colon leading to recurrent diarrhea and abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is characterized by abdominal pain or&#xD;
      discomfort, gas, loose and frequent stools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Butyrate has shown anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties, providing symptomatic&#xD;
      relief when orally supplemented in patients suffering from various colonic diseases. The&#xD;
      investigator proposes to investigate the effect of a microencapsulated form of sodium&#xD;
      butyrate on the fecal microbiota of patients with IBD and IBS-D.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IBDMicro is an interventional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A&#xD;
      novel oral formulation of butyrate contained in a lipophilic microcapsule, that provides&#xD;
      extensive capacity for intestinal diffusion and facilitates slow release of the active&#xD;
      ingredient will be used (&quot;Butyrose&quot; produced by SILA SRL, Italy). A proof-of-concept study&#xD;
      has been already published in this context, and preliminary data showed that butyrate&#xD;
      administration was able to change the gut microbiota of patients with IBD and IBS-D after 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment, in association with the changes of intestinal inflammation indexes (fecal&#xD;
      calprotectin). In keeping, investigators will assess the microbiota before and after the&#xD;
      butyrate administration. Also, clinical data will be collected by using validated&#xD;
      disease-specific questionnaires (Rome IV and clinical indexes for IBD). Quality of life will&#xD;
      be also recorded. The analysis of intestinal microbiota will be carried out by collecting a&#xD;
      fecal sample and analyzed with metagenomics techniques.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>NGS analysis ( 16S rRNA) will be used to highlight the microbiota variation induced by Butyrose/Placebo administration in 160 IBD and 40 IBS-D patients after 8 weeks of treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The 16S rRNA is a fundamental component of the prokaryotic ribosome, where defines structural and functional properties interacting for example with the mRNA. Its structure and sequences were characterized during the 70's/80's, and the corresponding DNA coding sequence is referred to 16s rRNA gene. The 16s rRNA gene started to be used as the phylogenetic marker in the 70's due to its ubiquity among bacterial kingdom, allowing comparison between evolutionarily distant organisms.&#xD;
A new oral formulation of sodium-butyrate, at the dose of 3 capsules/d (1800 mg/d), will be administered, during the main meals, in consecutive IBD or IBS-D patients, for 90 days. At the same time, a control group will receive three starch capsules with similar color, flavor, and size.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment effects on clinical activity by fecal calprotectin.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of fecal calprotectin will be evaluated by clinical routinary analysis before and after treatment with Butyrose/Placebo. The Butyrose treatment at the dose of 3 capsules/die, will be administered in consecutive IBD and IBS-D patients, for 90 days. At the same time, a control group received three starch capsules with similar color, flavor, and size.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment effects on lifestyle by IBD Questionaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The IBD questionnaire is a disease-specific questionnaire to highlight the patients' lifestyle before and after treatment. The IBDQ analysis will be performed as described in Yarlas A. et al.;J Patient Cent Res Rev 2020 10.17294/2330-0698.1722</description>
