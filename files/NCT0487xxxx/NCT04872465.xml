  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thea-burst stimulation (TBS) is a novel form of rTMS, providing greater modulation effect on&#xD;
      neural activity. So far, no study was conducted to use TBS as treatment in LLD. Therefore, we&#xD;
      aim to examine the effect of TBS over bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) among&#xD;
      patients with LLD on mood condition and relevant biomarkers. The study used a two-arm,&#xD;
      parallel, double-blind, randomized, and sham-controlled design. We plan to enroll sixty&#xD;
      patients with LLD, thirty for active intervention and thirty for sham-controlled group. An&#xD;
      Magstim Rapid2 stimulator with eight-figure coil was used for stimulation. Location of brain&#xD;
      area are based on bilateral DLPFC. 3-pulse 50-Hz bursts was given every 200ms (at 5 Hz) and&#xD;
      an intensity of 80% active motor threshold was settled. We initially used cTBS (continuous&#xD;
      TBS) over right DLPFC with 120-s train of uninterrupted bursts (1800 pulses) in each session&#xD;
      per day. After that, we continuous use iTBS (intermittent TBS, iTBS) over left DLPFC with 2-s&#xD;
      train of bursts was repeated every 10 s for a total of 570 s (1800 pulses). Each patient&#xD;
      received daily stimulation for two weeks with total ten sessions. The primary outcomes were&#xD;
      change of depression severity including response and remission rate. Secondary outcome were&#xD;
      biomarkers related to depression. Assessments were administered at baseline, immediately&#xD;
      after 5 and 10 sessions of stimulation, and 3 months after the completion of stimulation.&#xD;

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, HAM-D</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 1, 2 weeks and three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Ham-D is the most widely used clinician-administered depression assessment scale. The original version contains 17 items pertaining to symptoms of depression experienced over the past week. A score of 0-7 is generally accepted to be within the normal range (or in clinical remission), while a score of 20 or higher (indicating at least moderate severity) is usually required for entry into a clinical trial.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck depression inventory, BDI-II</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 1, 2 weeks and three months</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II was a 1996 revision of the BDI. Participants were asked to rate how they have been feeling for the past two weeks. BDI-II also contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs used as follows: 0-13: minimal depression; 14-19: mild depression; 20-28: moderate depression; 29-63: severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck anxiety inventory, BAI</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 1, 2 weeks and three months</time_frame>
    <description>The BAI, created by Aaron T. Beck and other colleagues, is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that is used for measuring the severity of anxiety in children and adults. The BAI contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). Higher total scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms. The standardized cutoffs are as follows: 0-7: minimal anxiety; 8-15: mild anxiety; 16-25: moderate anxiety; 26-63: severe anxiety.</description>
