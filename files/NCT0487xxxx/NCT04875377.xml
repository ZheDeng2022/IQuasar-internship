  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators propose an intervention design testing the efficacy of a&#xD;
      food reformulated with seaweed as an ingredient in meal, capsules against placebo and no&#xD;
      intervention controls. The randomised control trial (supplementation) will last 24 weeks. The&#xD;
      aim is to study the effect of the food matrix on variables associated with iodine nutrition:&#xD;
      iodine status and thyroid function.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Glasgow,&#xD;
      United Kingdom. Inclusion criteria are as follows: healthy premenopausal women aged 18 - 60&#xD;
      years who would remain a resident in Glasgow for 24 weeks; who were self-reported low iodine&#xD;
      consumers consuming milk less than once per day and non-oily fish less than once per week.&#xD;
      Those with a history of thyroid dysfunction, taking medications other than the contraceptive&#xD;
      pill or smoking, as well as pregnant or lactating women and those planning to conceive, were&#xD;
      excluded. Those taking dietary supplements containing iodine would also excluded and there&#xD;
      was no restriction related to body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are recruited via social media and advertisements displayed around the Greater&#xD;
      Glasgow area. Interested parties are screened and, if eligible, invited to a 30-minute&#xD;
      appointment at which participants were randomly assigned through a web-based randomisation&#xD;
      service to one of four groups after consent is obtained; reformulated pizza, control pizza,&#xD;
      iodine capsules, or placebo capsules. During this initial meeting anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, blood pressure and a venous blood sample are collected, and participants are&#xD;
      also asked to complete a sociodemographic questionnaire and an iodine specific food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire (FFQ). Participants are provided with instructions and equipment to record a&#xD;
      3-day estimated food diary and to collect 12 spot urine samples at different times of day&#xD;
      over 2-7 days. Upon returning the spot urine samples, participants were given either the&#xD;
      pizzas or supplements to begin the intervention. Participants are asked to consume one pizza&#xD;
      or supplement three times a week for 24 weeks. Participants are asked to collect a further&#xD;
      10-12 sample spot urine samples at week 2 of the intervention. Participants are asked to&#xD;
      attend another 30-minute appointment at 12 and 24 weeks in which baseline measurements are&#xD;
      repeated along with a change to diet questionnaire.&#xD;
