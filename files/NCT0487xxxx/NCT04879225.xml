  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menthol cigarettes comprise almost one-third of the United States (US) market share and are&#xD;
      disproportionately smoked by racial minorities. Tobacco control policies targeting menthol&#xD;
      flavoring in tobacco could have significant public health outcomes, especially among black&#xD;
      smokers. One key challenge of tobacco regulation is weighing the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      potential policies across different populations (i.e., users and non-users). Tension arises&#xD;
      between policies intended to prevent adolescent and young adult (AYA) tobacco initiation and&#xD;
      those intended to reduce harm among current tobacco users. The availability of menthol&#xD;
      e-liquids may be important for encouraging menthol cigarette smokers to switch to e-&#xD;
      cigarettes, but mint e-liquids, which are appealing to AYA, may be unnecessary to facilitate&#xD;
      switching. Including mint e-liquids in flavor bans but allowing menthol e-liquids to remain&#xD;
      on the market as potential substitution products for menthol smokers may be an optimal policy&#xD;
      approach. The study team is proposing a lab study and field assessment to determine how&#xD;
      including menthol and mint e-liquids in e-liquid flavor bans or sales restrictions affects&#xD;
      tobacco product purchasing and use among menthol cigarette smokers. At lab sessions,&#xD;
      participants will complete the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM) task, a behavioral&#xD;
      economics task in which they receive account balances to an online store and can buy menthol&#xD;
      cigarettes at escalating costs or buy e-liquids, non-menthol cigarettes, or nicotine&#xD;
      replacement gum at fixed costs. They will complete the task under four marketplace&#xD;
      conditions: (1) only tobacco e-liquids available, (2) menthol and tobacco e-liquids&#xD;
      available, (3) menthol, mint, and tobacco e-liquids available, and (4) tobacco, menthol,&#xD;
      mint, fruit, dessert. During a field assessment, product choice is validated by assessing use&#xD;
      of products purchased during the ETM task. This proposal will inform policy-makers about the&#xD;
      impact banning menthol and mint e-liquids will have on facilitating menthol cigarette smokers&#xD;
      switching to e-cigarettes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team proposes to conduct a within-subjects, multi-session virtual lab study and&#xD;
      validation field assessment to determine how the availability of menthol and mint e-liquids&#xD;
      affects product purchasing among menthol cigarette smokers. Adult daily menthol cigarette&#xD;
      smokers will be recruited for this study. After initial eligibility is assessed, participants&#xD;
      will complete six virtual sessions and one field assessment to evaluate their tobacco use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from Winston-Salem, North Carolina (NC) and the surrounding&#xD;
      area using advertisements on public transit, community flyers, and social media. Curbside&#xD;
      visits to drop off biosamples and pickup study products will be conducted outside the Wake&#xD;
      Forest Tobacco Control Center of Excellence located in Biotech Place in the Innovation&#xD;
      Quarter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team anticipates recruiting up to 100 participants to achieve 80 completers. Equal&#xD;
      numbers of black and white participants will be enrolled.&#xD;
