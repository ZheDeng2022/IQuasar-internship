  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global health crisis with, so far, over 21 million&#xD;
      registered cases and more than 700.000 deaths worldwide. In order to slow down the rate of&#xD;
      new infections, millions of people have been directed to stay at home, thereby accepting&#xD;
      severe restrictions of social contact and personal freedom to move. With fear of infection&#xD;
      and economical loss as additional burdens, the current conditions have led to a significant&#xD;
      increase in psychological distress and risk for the onset of mental disorders among the&#xD;
      general population. Empirical evidence on effective measures to support mental health in&#xD;
      COVID-19 &quot;homestayers&quot; is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators therefore used a randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      design to investigate the effects of two online intervention programs derived either from the&#xD;
      field of positive psychology (PP) or acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) with a third&#xD;
      group of participants writing an online diary only (control group). Furthermore, over the&#xD;
      entire study period, individual daily coping strategies were collected. A total of 138 adult&#xD;
      German &quot;homestayers&quot; participated in the RCT with two weeks of daily interventions during the&#xD;
      first &quot;lock-down&quot; period in Germany (April 19th to May 3rd 2020). Measures of stress, mental&#xD;
      health (depression, anxiety) and subjective well-being (subjective vitality, overall&#xD;
      well-being) were collected at baseline, at the end of the two-week intervention period and&#xD;
      another 14 days after that (follow-up).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 138 individuals - recruited via university-wide emails and social media -&#xD;
      completed the baseline questionnaire and agreed to participate in the study. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were an age between 18 and 70 years, knowledge of the German language as well as&#xD;
      conditions of increased social isolation at the beginning of the study. The latter criterion&#xD;
      was operationalized by only including individuals who were currently staying mostly at home&#xD;
      due to the Corona crisis (home office; quarantine measures; stay-at-home orders) with no (or&#xD;
      only very few) direct contacts outside of their own household. The only relevant exclusion&#xD;
      criterion was an acute diagnosis (within the last 3 months) of a mental disorder by a medical&#xD;
      professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: A link in the invitation email of the study led to the online platform&#xD;
      SoSciSurvey, where participants received information about the study, standards of data&#xD;
      security, gave informed consent to participate and filled out pre-measures (t1). Upon&#xD;
      completion, all participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      three groups (ACT, PP, control group) and received their personal login credentials to the&#xD;
      online platform [Synergetic Navigation System, SNS: ccsys.de, Version 3.7.54; 36, 37-39],&#xD;
      which was used to administer daily questionnaires and intervention programs. In order to keep&#xD;
      the changing societal situation constant for all participants, the study protocol started on&#xD;
      April 19th 2020 for all three groups. For a period of 14 days, the two intervention groups&#xD;
      received a daily prompt (at 6 AM) via email that their &quot;exercise of the day&quot; was accessible&#xD;
      in the SNS. In order to read the exercise instructions, participants had to log into their&#xD;
      account via app or web browser. Every day, a new exercise appeared in the system. The&#xD;
      intervention period with daily email prompts ended after 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the evening (at 5.30 PM), all three groups received an email notification to fill in their&#xD;
      daily review questionnaire (&quot;online diary&quot;), every day over the entire study period of 28&#xD;
      days. On day 14, all participants received an email notification to fill in the post measures&#xD;
      (t2) available in their SNS account. On day 28, all participants received a notification to&#xD;
      fill in the follow-up measures (t3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires and testing material:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At t1 (baseline assessment) participants were asked for information regarding general&#xD;
      demographics, their personal living situation, social situation and current status of health.&#xD;
      Moreover, participants were asked to indicate the influence of the Corona crisis on their&#xD;
      personal lives as well as the adequacy of political measures taken to meet the Corona crisis&#xD;
      on visual analogue scales (1 = not at all - 100 = very much).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following outcome measures were assessed to evaluate the impact of the time spent in&#xD;
      relative isolation under conditions of increased stress due to the Corona crisis and&#xD;
      potential buffering effects of the interventions: General stress level was assessed using the&#xD;
      German version of the stress module of the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-D); as a measure&#xD;
      of depression, we used the nine items of the depression module of the patient health&#xD;
      questionnaire (PHQ-9); anxiety over the last two weeks was assessed using the 10-item German&#xD;
      short version of the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (trait version, referenced to the last two&#xD;
      weeks); additionally, five items measuring participants' general subjective vitality were&#xD;
      included to measure the influence of social distancing on a dynamic feeling of energy and&#xD;
      psychosomatic well-being; overall well-being was assessed using five items of the World&#xD;
      Health Organization Well-being Index (WHO-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Online diary&quot; and assessment of coping strategies: All participants received a daily review&#xD;
      questionnaire which contained two open questions instructing participants to write down 1)&#xD;
      relevant events during the day, and 2) things that had helped them in coping positively with&#xD;
      the current situation. Participants from the intervention groups were also asked to indicate&#xD;
      whether they had carried out the intervention that day (yes/no).&#xD;

    <description>General stress level was assessed using the German version of the stress module of the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-).
