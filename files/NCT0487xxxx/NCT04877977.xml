      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 12,000 people have taken part in research at the Experimental Therapeutics &amp;&#xD;
      Pathophysiology Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Program. This&#xD;
      has led to advances in the treatment of depression, bipolar disorder, and suicide risk.&#xD;
      Researchers want to follow up with this group to see if they continue to have mental health&#xD;
      symptoms and receive psychiatric treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn the long-term impact of depression, bipolar disorder, and suicide risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who signed consent for Protocol 01-M-0254 over a year ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 2 phases: an online phase and a telephone phase. It has no in-person or&#xD;
      face-to-face contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, participants will fill out online surveys. They will access the surveys through&#xD;
      the study website. The questions will focus on their current thoughts and feelings. The&#xD;
      surveys will also ask about their current treatments for their mental health symptoms. At the&#xD;
      end of the surveys, they will be asked if they would like to take part in Phase 2. If so,&#xD;
      they will mark yes. Phase 2 includes a phone interview. They will be contacted by email to&#xD;
      schedule the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, participants will be asked more in-depth questions about how they are feeling.&#xD;
      They will also be asked which psychiatric medicines and treatments they have used since they&#xD;
      left NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both phases, participants can skip any questions they do not want to answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online surveys will take 30 minutes to complete. The phone interview will last 1-4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information that participants give in this study may be linked to their other NIH&#xD;
      research records.&#xD;

      Synopsis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title: Long-term Observation of Participants with Mood Disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description: The proposal will leverage existing data on former participants with mood&#xD;
      disorders collected in the Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch in order to&#xD;
      identify predictors of long-term depressive symptoms, suicide attempts and ketamine&#xD;
      utilization. The ETPB has collected a wealth of clinical, biologic, neuroimaging and sleep&#xD;
      data on individuals with treatment resistant depression and bipolar disorder over the last 20&#xD;
      years. This study would re-contact these individuals for online and telephone assessment of&#xD;
      current symptoms. We would then determine the ability of these clinical and biological&#xD;
      measures to predict long-term outcomes. We will also use this protocol for recruitment for&#xD;
      in-person neurobiological studies and clinical trials of treatment resistant depression,&#xD;
      bipolar disorder and suicide risk, both for ETPB and other branches of the NIMH IRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to identify predictors of long-term treatment-resistant&#xD;
      depression. The secondary and tertiary objectives are to identify predictors of long-term&#xD;
      risk for suicide attempt and identify predictors of repeat use of ketamine, respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Score on Beck Depression Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Self-reported suicide attempt after NIH study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Self-reported ketamine utilization after NIH study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The sample size will be up to 1000 participants who previously signed&#xD;
      consent into Protocol 01-M-0254: The Evaluation of Patients with Mood and Anxiety Disorders&#xD;
      and Healthy Volunteers and will include participants 18 years and older, any gender and&#xD;
      health status including both individuals with mood or anxiety disorders and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: The study will be conducted online&#xD;
      through a secure study website. Data collection can also occur over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 1.5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration: 20 minutes- 4 hours&#xD;
