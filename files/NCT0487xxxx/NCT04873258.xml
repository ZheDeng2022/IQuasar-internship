    <textblock>
      Fatty liver disease is a common condition (25% of the population) which can lead to liver&#xD;
      inflammation, liver scarring and even liver cancer. Clinical trials are often performed in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers, who may have underlying fatty liver without knowledge of it. In clinical&#xD;
      trials fatty liver can both mean volunteers have abnormal liver tests, preventing them&#xD;
      joining the trial, as well as more likely to have a possible liver drug reaction, causing&#xD;
      volunteers to withdraw from a clinical trial of a new drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objective of the study is to develop a clinical scoring tool that can&#xD;
      accurately predict fatty liver disease in study volunteers, without the need for invasive&#xD;
      tests (such as a tissue biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to recruit initially 500 volunteers to this study, both healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      patients with known NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will attend the unit to undergo all assessments on one day. Once consent is given&#xD;
      with a study research physician, bloods will be taken and body measurements made (including&#xD;
      BMI, weight, waist circumference). A full medical history and physical examination will then&#xD;
      be performed by the research physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioimpedance body composition analysis will then be performed on an ACUNIQ device. Finally&#xD;
      ultrasound of the liver and fibroscan will be performed. Once all assessments are complete&#xD;
      the study volunteer will be discharged from the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all results are finalised, analysis will be performed on all the data to create a&#xD;
      clinical score to predict the presence of NAFLD, both with statistical and machine learning&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
