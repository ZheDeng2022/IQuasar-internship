  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a smart bolus&#xD;
      calculator that adjusts insulin dosing for meals according to real-time insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      (SI) in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using a hybrid closed loop (HCL) system during&#xD;
      an active week of diabetes camp.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, double-blind, randomized, crossover trial. The study team will&#xD;
      target enrollment of 30 adolescents (age 12 - &lt;18 years) with T1D who currently manage their&#xD;
      diabetes with an insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1 to the use of the standard HCL system (USS Virginia) vs. the HCL&#xD;
      system with the smart bolus calculator first. Participants will then attend a 6 day/5 night&#xD;
      diabetes camp. Crossover to the other treatment group will occur midweek. Participants and&#xD;
      study personnel actively involved in the study will be blinded to the treatment groups.&#xD;
