      Background and Aim: Breast carcinoma is the most common type of cancer and the most common&#xD;
      cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought&#xD;
      to be responsible for tumor initiation, progression, dissemination and resistance to&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy. CD133 is a trans-membrane glycoprotein which is considered as&#xD;
      a putative CSCs marker. It has been extensively used as a stem cell marker for normal and&#xD;
      cancerous tissues. Emerging evidence suggests that CD133 may be a critical factor in tumor&#xD;
      development, progression and metastasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate expression&#xD;
      status of CD133 in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast and its role during breast&#xD;
      cancer progression and to correlate its expression with some known clinicopathological&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast carcinoma is the most frequent malignant tumor in women worldwide comprising 30% on&#xD;
      average of all cancers and the most likely cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide.&#xD;
      In Egypt, according to the official statistics of the National Cancer Institute, Cairo&#xD;
      University, breast carcinoma is the most prevalent cancer among women representing 35.1% of&#xD;
      total cancer cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast carcinoma is currently regarded as a heterogeneous group of tumors with diverse&#xD;
      morphology, behavior, outcome and response to therapy. In spite of advances in diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of breast carcinoma, the clinical outcome remains unsatisfactory due to recurrence,&#xD;
      metastasis or chemotherapy-resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are recognized as a subpopulation of cancer cells that show the&#xD;
      characteristics of normal stem cells. They are believed to possess the capacity to&#xD;
      self-renewal and are responsible for tumor formation and progression. CSCs also promote tumor&#xD;
      cell heterogeneity and metastasis. In addition, CSCs are thought to be more resistant to&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Given the significance of CSCs in tumor development, the&#xD;
      identification and characterization of CSCs could lead to the development of directed&#xD;
      therapies against these aggressive cells, hence more effective treatments for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over recent years, CSCs have been described in different types of cancers including breast&#xD;
      cancer. In the mammary gland, the microenvironment provides clues to control the behavior of&#xD;
      epithelial stem and progenitor cells. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) subpopulation was&#xD;
      shown to express higher level of pro-invasive genes and had highly invasive properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With evidence forthcoming regarding the effects of the stroma and the microenvironment in&#xD;
      breast tumor progression, several genes have also been reported to be associated with BCSCs.&#xD;
      The phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is important discovery during&#xD;
      progression of breast carcinoma and explanation for their ability to invade and to colonize&#xD;
      other parts of the body. With all these knowledge, targeting BCSCs for breast carcinoma&#xD;
      treatment was demanded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD133, also known as prominin-1, is a member of pentaspan trans-membrane glycoproteins,&#xD;
      frequently expressed on multipotent progenitor cells, including immature hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      and progenitor cells. CD133 is a putative CSCs marker; it has been extensively used as a stem&#xD;
      cell marker for normal and cancerous tissues. CD133 expressing cells possessing stem&#xD;
      cell-like characteristics including self-renewal, high proliferation and drug resistance&#xD;
      substantiating a tumorigenic role of CD133-expressing cells. It also plays a role in cell&#xD;
      differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging evidences suggest that CD133 may be a critical factor in tumor development,&#xD;
      progression and metastasis. CD133-positive CSC showed increased expression levels of CXCR4&#xD;
      which is a critical protein for the adhesion and/or migration of tumor cells, indicating an&#xD;
      important role of CD133 in tumor cells migration and tumor invasion. CD133 is used as a&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic marker which is overexpressed in various neoplasms. In breast&#xD;
      cancer, its overexpression confers a poor prognosis. Increasing clinical evidence has&#xD;
      confirmed that it is involved in breast cancer progression. CD133 is a promising marker for&#xD;
      the identification of CSC in breast cancer subtypes including aggressive HER2+ and&#xD;
      triple-negative classes.&#xD;
