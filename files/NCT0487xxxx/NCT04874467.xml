      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems that some local and systemic factors can be associated with an increased incidence&#xD;
      of peri-implant diseases. Predisposing to an increase inflammatory response when plaque is&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is still controversy on which factors can be considered as risk indicators. One of them&#xD;
      is the keratinized mucosa width (KM), that seems to facilitate plaque control around&#xD;
      implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the relationship between keratinized mucosa and the recurrence of mucositis, comparing&#xD;
      bleeding on probing (BOP) in implants with mucositis for 24 weeks after implant disinfection&#xD;
      therapy, the control group is defined by having KM ≥ 2 mm and the test group KM &lt; 2 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      38 patients presenting one single implant each with a single screw retained crown loaded for&#xD;
      at least 1 year. Periodontal maintenance therapy will be performed and oral hygiene&#xD;
      instruction will be delivered. Follow up visits will be after 8, 12 and 24 weeks in which the&#xD;
      following parameters will be registered: Keratinized Mucosa width, Attached mucosa, Gingival&#xD;
      Index, Vestibule Depth, Mucosa Thickness. Probing Pocket Depth, Recession, modified Plaque&#xD;
      Index, Bleeding on Probing, modified Bleeding Index. Also a microbiologic test will be taken&#xD;
      in the implant sulcus before the periodontal maintenance therapy and at 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multilevel statistical analysis will be conducted comparing the control and the test group,&#xD;
      adjusting for the correlation among multiple observations.&#xD;

    <description>The main objective of the study is to evaluate the association between MQ and recurrence of mucositis, comparing the bleeding index on probing (BoP) in implants that have mucositis, in a control group characterized by 2 mm or more of MQ and a test group characterized by less than 2 mm of MQ over a 24-week period after peri-implant maintenance therapy.</description>

    <description>A complete professional prophylaxis session will be performed, which includes ultrasound debridement, scaling with curettes and dental polishing with a rubber cup. On the other hand, in implants affected by mucositis, supra and sub-gingival debridement will be performed using a combination of ultrasound with a titanium tip and titanium curettes.&#xD;
All patients will receive personalized hygiene instructions. Patients will be instructed to brush their implants twice daily using the modified Bass technique with a medium-hard manual toothbrush and low-abrasive toothpaste. In addition, they will be taught to use specific interproximal brushes. If access with an interdental brush is not possible, flossing will be indicated. Oral hygiene instructions will be reviewed at each visit.</description>
