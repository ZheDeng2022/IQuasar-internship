      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes (marginal discoloration,&#xD;
      marginal adaptation, gingival health, debonding and patient satisfaction) of translucent&#xD;
      zirconia crowns bonded by TheraCem (MDP, calcium and fluoride releasing) self-adhesive resin&#xD;
      cement compared to multilink self-adhesive resin cement.&#xD;

      Clinical outcomes of bonded monolithic translucent zirconia crowns using two different&#xD;
      compositions of self-adhesive resin cements (Randomized Clinical Trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will TheraCem self-adhesive resin cement (MDP, calcium and fluoride releasing cement) give&#xD;
      better outcomes when bonding monolithic translucent zirconia crowns to tooth structure&#xD;
      compared to Multilink self-adhesive resin cement (non MDP, non-calcium and fluoride releasing&#xD;
      cement) in terms of marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation, gingival health, debonding&#xD;
      and patient satisfaction?&#xD;
&#xD;
      PICOS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      P: Population: Patients requiring single zirconia crowns I: Intervention: TheraCem&#xD;
      self-adhesive resin cement (MDP, calcium and fluoride releasing cement) C: Comparison:&#xD;
      Multilink adhesive resin cement (non MDP, non-calcium and fluoride releasing cement)&#xD;
&#xD;
      O: Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Primary outcome Marginal discoloration using USPHS for 9 months Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      1. Marginal adaptation&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. patient satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of the problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bonding of zirconia restorations to tooth structures is still challenging. The success of the&#xD;
      restoration may be affected by the type of cement used as it may affect marginal&#xD;
      discoloration, marginal adaptation, gingival health, debonding and patient satisfaction. The&#xD;
      effect of newly introduced TheraCem self-adhesive resin cement (MDP, calcium and fluoride&#xD;
      releasing cement) on the clinical behavior of bonded translucent monolithic zirconia is not&#xD;
      yet fully reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The aim of the present study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes (marginal discoloration,&#xD;
      marginal adaptation and patient satisfaction) of translucent zirconia crowns bonded by&#xD;
      TheraCem (MDP, calcium and fluoride releasing) self-adhesive resin cement compared to&#xD;
      multilink self-adhesive resin cement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research null hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -There will be no difference in color stability, marginal adaptation and patient satisfaction&#xD;
      of translucent zirconia crowns bonded either with TheraCem or Multilink self-adhesive resin&#xD;
      cements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary outcome: Marginal discoloration using USPHS Secondary outcomes: 1. Marginal&#xD;
      adaptation 2. Patient satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;

      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TheraCem (MDP containing - calcium and fluoride releasing self-adhesive resin cement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The outcomes will be assessed at the following time points&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0 = immediately after restoration delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Marginal Discoloration Alpha (A): no discoloration (There is no visual evidence of&#xD;
      marginal discoloration different from the color of the restorative material and from the&#xD;
      color of the adjacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (visual inspection)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bravo (B): discoloration without axial penetration (There is visual evidence of marginal&#xD;
      discoloration at the junction of the tooth structure and the restoration, but the&#xD;
      discoloration has not penetrated along the restoration in a pulpal direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (visual inspection)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Charlie (C): discoloration with axial penetration (There is visual evidence of marginal&#xD;
      discoloration at the junction of the tooth structure and the restoration that has penetrated&#xD;
      along the restoration in a pulpal direction. (visual inspection Secondary 1.Marginal&#xD;
      Adaptation Alpha (A) No visible evidences of crevice along the margins; no catch or&#xD;
      penetration of the explorer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bravo (B) Visible evidence of crevice and/or catch of explorer; no penetration of the&#xD;
      explorer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Charlie (C) Visible evidence of crevice and penetration of explorer 2.Patient satisfaction&#xD;
      Numerical (discrete) (&quot;0&quot; unsatisfied - &quot;10&quot; satisfied)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The patient will be treated in visits designated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Pre-operative records, face-to-face adherence reminder session, clinical,&#xD;
      radiographic examination, intraoral photographs and primary impression (alginate impression*)&#xD;
      for diagnostic cast construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Teeth preparation, secondary impression using addition silicone rubber base&#xD;
      material† and temporary restoration‡.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Try in Visit 4: placement and permanent cementation of the final restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Marginal discoloration, color stability, marginal adaptation and patient satisfaction will&#xD;
      be evaluated immediately after cementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recall visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same evaluators evaluated the participants during the recall appointments with a mirror&#xD;
      and a sharp explorer at 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. Periapical radiographs were made&#xD;
      and postoperative data were collected and used as a documentation tool with the clinical&#xD;
      photographs. Marginal adaptation, esthetics, patient satisfaction and clinical examination&#xD;
      were assessed using USPH After delivering the crowns, the participants were asked to rate the&#xD;
      level of the satisfaction with their restorations by using a 1 to 10 numeric rating scale&#xD;
      (1=poor, 5=acceptable, 10=excellent) at 3 months, 6 months and 9 months. Mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation and 95% confidence interval for the mean were used to summarize patient&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Marginal discoloration will be assessed by using HSPHS criteria Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes: 1. Marginal adaptation will be assessed using the modified USPHS criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Patient satisfaction will be assessed by using normal scores numerical score from 1 to 10&#xD;
      (1=poor, 5=acceptable, 10=excellent)&#xD;
