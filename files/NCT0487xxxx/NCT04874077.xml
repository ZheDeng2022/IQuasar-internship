  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Depression and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent of all mental disorders, with an estimated&#xD;
      annual prevalence of 9.7% and 18.1% respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been known for the last 100 years that depression and anxiety both likely affect vocal&#xD;
      acoustic properties. In 1921, Emil Kraepelin, characterized depressed patient's voices as&#xD;
      having a lower pitch, lower volume, lower rate of speech, more monotony of prosody as well as&#xD;
      more hesitations, stuttering, and whispering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanistically, it is possible that the neural circuitry involved in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      mood and anxiety disorders impinge upon the neural circuit involved in speech production,&#xD;
      affecting qualities that include rate, prosody, speech latency and other paralinguistic&#xD;
      features. Thus, acoustic features of speech may be one of the more readily accessible&#xD;
      biomarkers for these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this understanding, the investigators sought to develop a passive vocal biomarker&#xD;
      instrument for depression and anxiety screening that could markedly expand access as well as&#xD;
      standardize the quality of screening in primary care settings.&#xD;

        This study will enroll 225 men and women over the age of 18. 150 depressed participants&#xD;
        will be recruited via an email from their treating psychiatrists. The researchers are&#xD;
        collaborating with 2 psychiatric practices to recruit patients from.&#xD;
&#xD;
        75 non-depressed participants will be recruited from the general population via Craigslist&#xD;
        ads. Participants will go through a clinical evaluation with a mental health professional&#xD;
        to rule out current episode of depression.&#xD;
