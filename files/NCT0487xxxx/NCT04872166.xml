  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, nonrandomized, sequential dose escalation/cohort&#xD;
      expansion, multiple dose study designed to evaluate the safety, toxicity, and PK as well as&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of BTX-A51 in subjects with advanced solid tumors and NHL. The study&#xD;
      will be done in two phases, described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1a (Dose Escalation Phase):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 1a portion is designed to determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of orally administered BTX-A51.&#xD;
      BTX-A51 will be administered once daily on a weekly schedule of 5 days on/2 days off. Dose&#xD;
      escalation will proceed according to a modified 3+3 design. Each cycle will consist of 28&#xD;
      days (4 weeks), and the DLT observation period will be the first cycle (i.e., 28 days after&#xD;
      initiation of dosing). A DLT may be observed in no more than 0 out of 3 or 1 out of 6&#xD;
      subjects who have completed the DLT observation period before the next cohort initiates&#xD;
      accrual. Barring DLT, sequential dose escalation of BTX-A51 is planned with up to a total of&#xD;
      6 dose levels; on the basis of these an MTD will be identified. The MTD is defined as the&#xD;
      highest dose level with a subject incidence of DLTs of 0 or 1 out of 6 during the first 28&#xD;
      days of study drug dosing. A minimum of 6 subjects needs to be treated at a dose level before&#xD;
      this dose level can be deemed as the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b (Cohort Expansion Phase):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose expansion may begin when the RP2D has been determined. Up to 40 additional subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of BTX-A51 in subjects with&#xD;
      documented MYC genomic amplified/overexpressed tumors. Dosing in this phase of the study&#xD;
      consists of the first cycle of therapy (i.e., 28 days).&#xD;
