    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of a web-based intervention specifically designed for&#xD;
      patients with Binge Eating Disorder (BED) in a blinded randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a sign-up process, a diagnostic interview, and a baseline assessment, eligible&#xD;
      participants will be randomly allocated either to (1) an intervention group including the&#xD;
      online web-based intervention for BED or (2) a waitlist control group with delayed access to&#xD;
      the intervention (12 weeks). The program comprises six mandatory weekly sessions and six&#xD;
      modular specialization areas resulting in a treatment period of 12 weeks. Minimal guidance is&#xD;
      provided via a chat function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be conducted at pretreatment (study entrance), six weeks after baseline&#xD;
      (mid-treatment), and 12 weeks after baseline (post-treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the intervention group will show lower frequencies of binge&#xD;
      eating episodes as the primary outcome variable after the 12 weeks of treatment compared to a&#xD;
      waitlist control condition. Moreover, the investigators assume that there will be a higher&#xD;
      reduction in global eating disorder symptoms, comorbid psychopathology, and a higher increase&#xD;
      in well-being and self-esteem over 12 weeks in the intervention group compared to the&#xD;
      waitlist control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators expect that the intervention group will demonstrate a&#xD;
      significantly higher reduction in functional impairment, substantially better restoration of&#xD;
      work capacity, and an improved ability to regulate emotions after the 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is characterized by persistent episodes of&#xD;
      uncontrolled eating, associated with marked impairments in physical and mental health, social&#xD;
      integration, professional performance, and overall quality of life. Although&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapies are effective for Binge Eating Disorder, access to specialized&#xD;
      treatment in Germany is limited due to patient-related barriers and insufficient healthcare&#xD;
      resources. Internet-based interventions can overcome this treatment gap and reduce the burden&#xD;
      of BED for both patients and the healthcare system by making evidence-based interventions&#xD;
      more accessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: This study evaluates the effectiveness of a web-based intervention specifically&#xD;
      designed for patients with BED in a blinded randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: After a sign-up process, a structured diagnostic interview, and a baseline&#xD;
      assessment, eligible participants will be randomly allocated either to (1) an intervention&#xD;
      group including the online web-based intervention for BED or (2) a waitlist control group&#xD;
      with delayed access to the intervention (12 weeks). The program comprises six mandatory&#xD;
      weekly sessions covering topics related to eating behaviors, emotion regulation, and stress&#xD;
      management, followed by an optional set of up to six modular specialization areas based on&#xD;
      individual therapy goals. Moreover, minimal guidance is included, consisting of technical&#xD;
      support and answering questions via a chat function. Assessments will be conducted at&#xD;
      pretreatment (study entrance), six weeks after baseline (mid-treatment), and 12 weeks after&#xD;
      baseline (post-treatment). The primary outcome will be the number of binge eating episodes.&#xD;
      Secondary measures include global eating pathology, comorbid psychopathology, quality of&#xD;
      life, self-esteem, emotion regulation, work capacity, and functional impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses: An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed to examine differences&#xD;
      between the intervention and the control group in the change of eating disorder symptoms and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes from pre- to post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: The investigators expect that the intervention group will show lower frequencies&#xD;
      of binge eating episodes as the primary outcome variable after the 12 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      compared to a waitlist control condition. The investigators assume that there will be a&#xD;
      higher reduction in global eating disorder symptoms, comorbid psychopathology, and a higher&#xD;
      increase in well-being and self-esteem over 12 weeks in the intervention group compared to&#xD;
      the waitlist control group. Moreover, the investigators expect that the intervention group&#xD;
      will demonstrate a significantly higher reduction in functional impairment, substantially&#xD;
      better restoration of work capacity, and an improved ability to regulate negative emotions&#xD;
      after the 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants are blinded about the two conditions of the study and told that the assigned waiting time for the web-based intervention varies randomly. Therefore, participants in the control group do not know that the other group starts the intervention immediately. However, complete masking of participants is precluded as all subjects are aware of when they get access to the intervention.</masking_description>
