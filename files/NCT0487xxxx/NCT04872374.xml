  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with the loss of muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) and reduced tissue&#xD;
      regenerative capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eccentric exercise (ECC) is a model of RET that can be used with the elderly, due to the&#xD;
      ability of the muscle to combine high muscle strength production with low energy cost. ECC&#xD;
      contractions are significantly more damaging to the muscles and produce greater muscle&#xD;
      strength, for these reasons there is a greater risk of inducing muscle damage before the&#xD;
      muscle is able to adapt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parmigiano Reggiano (PR) has some peculiar bromatological characteristics. The proteins&#xD;
      contained in it, and in particular the potentially bioactive peptide sequences, can rapidly&#xD;
      provide the amino acids necessary to promote muscle growth and repair during exercise.&#xD;
      Furthermore, PR can be an important source of fatty acids, of which a significant amount of&#xD;
      short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) which are known to have important clinical effects on body&#xD;
      composition and metabolic health and can have a systemic anti-inflammatory effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the central hypothes is that PR consumed during RET can provide more energy&#xD;
      substrates and improve muscle recovery. To date, no studies have studied its function on&#xD;
      recovery from exercise nor in the elderly.&#xD;
