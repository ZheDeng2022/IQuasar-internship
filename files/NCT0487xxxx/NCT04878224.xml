  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The junctional zone (JZ) is an internal layer of the myometrium, with unique characteristics&#xD;
      that allow its visualization as a hypoechogenic structure in three-dimensional (3D)&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although traditionally evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, 3D reconstruction offers an&#xD;
      opportunity for reliable and easily accessible assessment. The only study that evaluated the&#xD;
      thickness of the JZ in 3D ultrasound in the context of assisted reproductive technology (ART)&#xD;
      found that the smaller the thickness of the JZ, the greater the rate of embryonic&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to evaluate the relationship between the characteristics of the ZJ in 3D&#xD;
      ultrasound, and the clinical outcomes of ART treatments, namely in vitro fertilization&#xD;
      cycles, intracytoplasmic sperm injection and frozen embryo transfer (FET). Additionally, the&#xD;
      intra and inter-observer variability of the characteristics of the JZ will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective and observational study with the inclusion of 200 cases, a 3D ultrasound&#xD;
      will be performed on the day on which the final oocyte maturation is triggered or, on FET, on&#xD;
      the day prior to the administration of progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The images will be evaluated independently by two observers. The principal investigator will&#xD;
      evaluate the images in two stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the quality of visualization of the JZ is classified, its thickness will be measured&#xD;
      and described as regular, irregular or interrupted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These characteristics will be related to the clinical outcomes of each cycle: clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy rate and abortion rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After explaining the study and obtaining written consent, a 3D ultrasound will be performed&#xD;
      for uterine evaluation, on the day of the final oocyte maturation trigger in cases of IVF /&#xD;
      ICSI. In cases of FET, the ultrasound evaluation will be carried out on the day before the&#xD;
      start of the luteal phase support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ultrasounds will be performed in a standardized manner by the same operator. With an&#xD;
      empty bladder, in a lithotomy position, a 2D transvaginal ultrasound will be performed using&#xD;
      a GE Voluson 730 Expert® ultrasound, with an endovaginal probe with a 4-8MHz frequency.&#xD;
      Identification of endometriosis lesions or acquired uterine abnormalities such as leiomyomas&#xD;
      or adenomyosis will be exclusion criteria. After evaluating the number and maximum dimension&#xD;
      of the ovarian follicles and the endometrial thickness, the three-dimensional volume box will&#xD;
      be placed to encompass the entire uterus in longitudinal section, with minimal inclusion of&#xD;
      para-uterine structures. A maximum acquisition angle of 90º and maximum quality will be used.&#xD;
      To minimize artifacts, during the acquisition both the probe and the woman must remain&#xD;
      immobile, being asked to hold their breath. Then, a three-dimensional volume will be&#xD;
      generated by automatic 360º rotation of the transducer. For each case, two volumes will&#xD;
      always be obtained.&#xD;
