  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is reported to be between 3.4 - 4.9 cases per&#xD;
      100,000 population. The estimated average incidence is 0.6 - 0.7 cases per 100,000 people per&#xD;
      year. Many patients are not diagnosed properly during their lifetime because of the&#xD;
      difficulty in differentiating MSA from other disorders. Approximately 29 - 33% of patients&#xD;
      with isolated late onset cerebellar ataxia and 8 - 10% of patients with parkinsonism will&#xD;
      develop MSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no therapies that can cure or stop the progression of the disease. The&#xD;
      current pharmacological therapy is only to relieve symptoms. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are&#xD;
      considered an efficient source of cells for therapy, because they can be safely harvested and&#xD;
      transplanted to donors or patients, have low immunogenicity, and have broad therapeutic&#xD;
      potential. Results from preliminary preclinical and clinical trials indicate the potential of&#xD;
      MSC-based treatment in meeting several key aspects of neurodegeneration. Stem cell-based&#xD;
      therapy for neurodegenerative diseases aims to stop clinical damage by regenerating and by&#xD;
      providing local support for damaged tissue, in addition after transplantation, MSCs have been&#xD;
      shown to be capable of penetrating the lesion area and thus have great potential use as a&#xD;
      means of administering therapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects of this study were patients who experienced possible MSA based on the consensus&#xD;
      clinical criteria for MSA. There will be three treatment groups with a total sample of 5&#xD;
      subjects each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receives MSC-Adipose Autologous with doses 2x50 million cells intratechally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will receives MSC-Umbilical Cord Allogeneic with doses 2x 50 million cells&#xD;
      intratechally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 will receives MSC-Umbilical Cord Allogeneic with doses 2x50 million cells&#xD;
      intratechally and 2x10cc secretome MSC from Adipose Intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical improvement will be evaluated using the UMSARS scale, PET-Scans, MRI, DaTScan,&#xD;
      IGF-1, BDNF, Sympathetic skin respons (SSR), EMG, Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS),&#xD;
      High definition-Optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT), ERG, VEP, Log MAR chart, Ishihara test&#xD;
      and side adverse effect on MSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided into six timeframes : Before an implantation, First Month after second&#xD;
      implantation, Third month after secondary implantation, Sixth month after second&#xD;
      implantation, Ninth month after second implantation and Twelve month after second&#xD;
      implantation. The differences between the test variables are then used as an indicator to&#xD;
      assess clinical improvement within the subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Before taking adipose tissue, each subject was screened including HbSAg, Anti HbS, Anti HCV, HIC, MCV and syphilis tests.&#xD;
Adipose tissue was taken through 5 grams of subcutaneous fat biopsy from the abdomen of each subject and put into a transport medium and then sent to the RSCM-FKUI cGMP IPT Stem Cells Laboratory for immediate isolation of mesenchymal stem cells.&#xD;
MSC that has been isolated will be cultured using the appropriate medium until it reaches the desired passage and the number of cells.&#xD;
The viability and proliferation ability of cultured cells were evaluated, then characterization of cell antigen expression was carried out using flow cytometry to confirm the success of MSC culture.&#xD;
The MSC to be injected into the subject will be prepared in 2cc physiological NaCl transport medium just before implantation.&#xD;
The adipose secretion used is prepared in whole form as much as 10cc in a 10cc syringe.</description>
