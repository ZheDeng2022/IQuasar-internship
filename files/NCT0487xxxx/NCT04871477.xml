  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how patients feel about having an audio recording of their visit to help&#xD;
      remember information given to them and share that information with family members and/or&#xD;
      caregivers not present during a clinic visit. Information from this study may help evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of using technology to help improve patient care by recording consultation&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the patient's perception of the usefulness of the audio recording in helping to&#xD;
      recall information given to him/her in the visit along with the perception of usefulness in&#xD;
      the dissemination of information to family member(s) and/or caregiver(s) not present at the&#xD;
      clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the number of times the recording is listened to. II. To assess the ease of use&#xD;
      of the technology. III. To assess the ability to share the information with the patient's&#xD;
      family member(s) and/or caregiver(s) if he or she chooses to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the patient perception of whether the audio recording caused any disruption to&#xD;
      the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate the participation rate of patients. VI. To explore association between&#xD;
      patient's perception of the usefulness of the audio recording and patient's&#xD;
      demographic/clinical characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To explore the association between age and sex of the caregiver and frequency of&#xD;
      caregiver's use of the audio recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To explore the association of the ease of use of the technology and the type of device&#xD;
      and application used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients audio record the recommendations and instructions given to them by the doctor record&#xD;
      as part of their clinic visit at the Supportive Care Center.&#xD;
