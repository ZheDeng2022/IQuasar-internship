  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the short- and long-term effects of multiple&#xD;
      sessions of 4 mA M1 tDCS on fatigue and brain activity in recovered COVID-19 patients using&#xD;
      established measures of perception of fatigue, performance fatigability, and cerebral glucose&#xD;
      uptake. Our central hypothesis is that tDCS will improve fatigue short- and long-term, and&#xD;
      thus will improve quality of life (QOL) in recovered COVID-19 patients and that these changes&#xD;
      will be associated with alterations in brain activity.&#xD;

      For survivors of severe COVID-19, overcoming the virus is just the beginning of an uncharted&#xD;
      recovery path. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases exceeds 27 million globally and 6&#xD;
      million in the US, the number of patients who experience persistent symptoms during recovery&#xD;
      is rapidly growing. In COVID-19 patients, common acute symptoms include cough, fever,&#xD;
      dyspnea, musculoskeletal symptoms (myalgia, joint pain, fatigue), gastrointestinal symptoms,&#xD;
      and anosmia/dysgeusia . Clinicians and researchers have focused on the acute phase of&#xD;
      COVID-19, but continued monitoring and treating of persistent symptoms is urgently needed.&#xD;
      Recent studies assessed persistent symptoms in patients who were discharged from the hospital&#xD;
      after recovering from COVID-19. None of the patients had a fever or any of the other signs or&#xD;
      symptoms associated with acute illness. Nevertheless, decreased quality of life was observed&#xD;
      in 44.1% and fatigue was reported by 53.1% and 71% of patients. Furthermore, persistent&#xD;
      fatigue following COVID-19 infection is common and independent of severity of initial&#xD;
      infection (hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients). In addition to the characteristic&#xD;
      laboratory findings and lung computed tomography (CT) abnormalities, it has been recently&#xD;
      reported that patients with COVID-19 also have neurological manifestations. Wu et al. [2020]&#xD;
      found that viral infections have detrimental impacts on neurological functions and can even&#xD;
      cause severe neurological damage. Their study showed that coronaviruses (CoV), especially&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibited neurotropic properties and&#xD;
      may cause neurological diseases with severe fatigue symptoms. Another recent case report has&#xD;
      also indicated reduced glucose uptake ([18F]flurodeoxyglucose (FDG); measured with positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET)) in diverse brain areas [9], which may contribute to these&#xD;
      neurological manifestations. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop inexpensive,&#xD;
      effective, and rapid treatments for the persistent fatigue experienced by recovered COVID-19&#xD;
      patients. Without such treatments, these patients will continue to experience fatiguing&#xD;
      symptoms that significantly reduce their quality of life. One possible treatment modality is&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) [10]. tDCS uses weak currents applied to the&#xD;
      scalp to alter the excitability of cortical neurons by changing their spontaneous firing&#xD;
      rate. It also has a favorable safety profile and only transient adverse side effects. Studies&#xD;
      in patients with neurological disorders have shown that tDCS over the primary motor and/or&#xD;
      sensory cortex (M1/S1) consistently and significantly improves fatigue. M1 tDCS represents an&#xD;
      easy, cost-effective candidate for treating persistent fatigue in recovered COVID-19&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
