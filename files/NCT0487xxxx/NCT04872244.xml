      it was planned to investigate the treatment effect of levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine&#xD;
      device in patient with isthmocele who were suffering from postmenstrual spotting bleeding and&#xD;
      who had no desire for fertility.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      isthmocele is an acquired diverticulum like defect of myometrium in the anterior isthmic part&#xD;
      of uterus due to previous cesarean section incision. It can be defined as thinning of the&#xD;
      incised site of uterus smaller than 50 % of its normal thickness. the real incidence is&#xD;
      unknown. due to low ability of contractility of the postmenstrual spotting bleeding.&#xD;
      Accumulation of blood in the isthmocele induces inflammation within the endometrium and&#xD;
      causes pain as well. Furthermore, this inflammation can be an absolute reason for secondary&#xD;
      infertility. As a result, accumulation of blood in the isthmocele seems to start up the&#xD;
      cascade of morbidities. When understanding the mechanism, preventing blood accumulation seems&#xD;
      to prevent symptoms other than infertility. Levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine devices can&#xD;
      be a way of thinning the endometrium hence, blood accumulation can be avoided. In the&#xD;
      literature, surgical correction of the isthmocele has been studied and medical treatment that&#xD;
      was mentioned in the literature was the oral contraceptives and only a preliminary report of&#xD;
      very small sample size, discussed the effect of levonorgestrel releasing device . in the&#xD;
      light of aforementioned clinical knowledge, we planned to investigate the treatment effect of&#xD;
      levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine device in patients with postmenstrual bleeding due to&#xD;
      isthmocele who were not willing to have baby. These patients will be called back at 6th, 12th&#xD;
      and 18th months after applying levonorgestrel releasing device to the uterus. Gynecological&#xD;
      examinations will be done and complainants will be questioned.&#xD;
