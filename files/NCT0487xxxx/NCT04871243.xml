  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human papilloma virus infection is the most frequent sexually transmitted infection&#xD;
      around the world. In the vast majority of cases, these are inapparent infections that&#xD;
      disappear spontaneously. In some cases, the HPV infection persists and can generate&#xD;
      anogenital warts or cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, the papillomavirus is responsible for 6000 new cases of cancer/year with several&#xD;
      possible localizations : cervical, anal, penile, oropharyngeal, vulvar or vaginal. Among&#xD;
      them, 4580 new cases of cancer/year occur in women, and half of them are diagnosis of&#xD;
      cervical cancer. A quarter of cancers caused by papillomavirus occur in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, the commercialization of anti-HPV vaccine in 2007 was addressed only to girls, in&#xD;
      order to gain a group immunity that would therefore protect the boys. This vaccination did&#xD;
      not achieve the cover immunization target that were announced: the objective was fixed at 60%&#xD;
      of vaccination coverage and at the end of 2018, only 24% was achieved on the complete&#xD;
      vaccination schedule. In December 2019, the French National Authority for Health recommended&#xD;
      the anti-HPV vaccinations in girls and boys.&#xD;

      This qualitative study evaluates parents' opinion regarding the vaccination and the HPV.&#xD;
      Parent's eligible to participate in this study are those with boys between 11 and 14 years&#xD;
      old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-HPV vaccination is perceived favorably in 38% of parents, but 42% of parents are&#xD;
      undecided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to evaluate qualitatively the opinions and the obstacles in this&#xD;
      vaccination, using interviews in parents of boys aged between 11 and 14 years old.&#xD;
