      To compare evaluating Clinical outcomes for patients treated with Tocilizumab for sever&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Cancer patients considered to be one of the least population that can be considered lucky&#xD;
      during COVID 19 pandemic attributed that to long term treatment with chemotherapy,&#xD;
      immunosuppression and multi comorbidities . Women with breast cancer are more likely to get&#xD;
      covid-19 infection rather than other type cancers . the co-existing of two diseases breast&#xD;
      cancer and Covid19 are very challengeable due to confusion and similarities found in clinical&#xD;
      biomarkers to evaluate both diseases as ferritin, D dimers and C-reactive protein and all&#xD;
      other immune response and cytokine storm syndrome especially including interleukin-6 (IL-6) .&#xD;
      using chemotherapy or any other cytotoxic drugs may exacerbate the severity of COVID -19&#xD;
      infection as well as poor clinical outcomes and even death are expected . The anti-human&#xD;
      IL-6R monoclonal antibody (Tocilizumab) was used first in China in patients with severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 and patients improved in different clinical outcome . In cancer patients&#xD;
      particularly the issue is debatable about the benefits of receiving Tocilizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies are going on such medication role in treatment of patients with severe covid&#xD;
      19 infection however, studies have not clearly addressed the role of Tocilizumab breast&#xD;
      cancer patient compared to non-cancer patients. This study aims to measure different clinical&#xD;
      outcomes after using Tocilizumab in sever covid 19 infection in breast cancer patients vs.&#xD;
      non cancer patients&#xD;
