  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a Single-Center, Open, Phase I/IIa Clinical Trial conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of SNK01 and GC +/- Cetuximab administered in&#xD;
      combination to Locally advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients who have&#xD;
      failed prior Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) therapy at least once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the start of the clinical trial, the first 3 subjects complete the enrollment in Cohort&#xD;
      1 in serial order and then 3 subjects are enrolled in Cohort 2 in serial order. After this,&#xD;
      Cohorts 1, 3 and Cohorts 2, 4 are independently processed and subjects are enrolled in serial&#xD;
      order when new cohorts start and/or replacement subjects are required. For the subjects who&#xD;
      are additionally enrolled after the DLT evaluation and the MTD is determined in each dose&#xD;
      cohort, no DLT evaluation is conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects allotted to each cohort are administered with the SNK01 manufactured from&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells total 8 times over a period of about 10 weeks. Combined&#xD;
      administration of SNK01 starts from the Cycle 2 (Week 4) of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy and SNK01&#xD;
      is administered at an interval of 1 week starting from the day after the administration of&#xD;
      Cytotoxic Chemotherapy and/or Cetuximab (Visit 5-1, D23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When no disease progression is confirmed at EOT (End of Treatment), disease progression is&#xD;
      checked until the clinical trial is over. The adverse events which have occurred during the&#xD;
      study period are monitored until the date when the investigator judges that no monitoring is&#xD;
      required as the symptom has disappeared or there is no further change in the symptom or the&#xD;
      30th day (±3 d) from the latest date of the administration among Gemcitabine, Carboplatin and&#xD;
      Cetuximab after the EOT, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the subjects enrolled in the present clinical trial, safety is checked in accordance&#xD;
      with CTCAE V5.0 and effectiveness is checked in accordance with RECIST V1.1 through the vital&#xD;
      signs, laboratory test, adverse events, etc. during the study period.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  histologically or cytologically diagnosed with Locally advanced or Metastatic&#xD;
             Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (TNM 8th edition). However, recurrent Non-small Cell Lung&#xD;
             Cancer is also allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  one or more gene mutations among EGFR, ALK, and ROS1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TKI treated for EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 gene mutation at least once or whose progressive&#xD;
             disease is confirmed during or after completion of the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  platinum based chemotherapy (excluding Gemcitabine), other chemotherapy or&#xD;
             immunotherapy besides TKI treatment before. (Those who have undergone neoadjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy are also allowed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  remaining toxicity resulting from previous anti-cancer therapy is grade 1 or lower in&#xD;
             accordance with CTCAE V5.0. However, those who suffer from alopecia not lower than&#xD;
             grade 2 or neuropathy of grade 2 related to previous platinum based chemotherapy are&#xD;
             allowed to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  voluntarily decided to participate in the present clinical trial and put their&#xD;
             signature on a subject's consent form before start of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  20 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  at least one lesion measurable by RECIST v1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  life expectancy is 3 months or longer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status is 0 or 1 when screened&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  adequate blood and terminal organ functions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For fertile women: Those who have agreed to maintain abstinence (refraining from&#xD;
             sextual intercourses with men) or use a contraceptive measure of which the annual&#xD;
             failure rate is lower than 1 % during the treatment period and for minimum 6 months&#xD;
             (180 days) after the last administration of SNK01, GC, or Cetuximab. Women who have&#xD;
             had their first menstrual period, not yet reached a post-menopausal state (amenorrhea&#xD;
             for longer than 12 months in succession without cause other than menopause) and have&#xD;
             not undergone surgical sterilization (ovariectomy or hysterectomy) and under the age&#xD;
             of 55 with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels of less than 40 mIU/mL are&#xD;
             considered as fertile women. However, women who have already confirmed menopause are&#xD;
             excluded. The examples of the contraceptive measures of which the failure rate is&#xD;
             lower than 1 % include the following: Bilateral Tubal Ligatio, male sterilization,&#xD;
             established and appropriate use of hormonal contraception that inhibits ovulation,&#xD;
             hormone releasing IUD (IntraUterine Device) and copper IUD. The reliability of&#xD;
             abstinence should be evaluated based on the clinical trial period and the daily&#xD;
             life-style preferred by the patient. Periodic abstinence (example: calendar method,&#xD;
             ovulation, and post-ovulation body temperature measurement method) and coitus&#xD;
             interrupts are not acceptable contraceptive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men: Those who have agreed to maintain abstinence (refraining from sextual&#xD;
             intercourses with women) as defined below, use contractiptive measures, and abstain&#xD;
             from sperm donation. Men with a fertile spouse should maintain abstinence or use of&#xD;
             condoms and additional contraceptive measures during the treatment period and for&#xD;
             minimum 4 months (120 days) after the last administration of SNK01, GC or Cetuximab so&#xD;
             that the annual failure rate is lower than 1 %. Men should abstain from sperm donation&#xD;
             during this period. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated based on&#xD;
             the study period and the normal life-style preferred by the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (example: calendar method, ovulation, and post-ovulation body temperature&#xD;
             measurement method) and coitus interrupts are not acceptable contraceptive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
