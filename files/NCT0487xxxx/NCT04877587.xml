    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if a high dose of ascorbate (Vitamin C), in&#xD;
      combination with the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine, is safe and effective in adolescents with&#xD;
      locally advanced unresectable or metastatic soft tissue and bone sarcomas&#xD;

      The primary objective of the expansion cohort of this pilot study is to evaluate preliminary&#xD;
      evidence of anti-tumor activity of intravenous ascorbate in combination with gemcitabine as&#xD;
      assessed by overall response rate to inform a subsequent Phase II trial.&#xD;

A patient-individualized pharmacokinetically-guided dose escalation design will be used for Ascorbate. Gemcitabine is administered following standard fixed dose infusion practice adopted at The University of Iowa Hospitals &amp; Clinics. Ascorbate is infused prior to gemcitabine. Cycles are 28 days. Patients will be treated for a total of 6 cycles and assessed every 2 cycles for disease response.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received chemotherapy or any investigational drug &lt; 2 weeks prior to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known positivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); baseline&#xD;
             testing for HIV is not required. High-dose ascorbate acid is a known CYP450 3A4&#xD;
             inducer, which results in lower serum levels of antiretroviral drugs.37&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any significant history of non-compliance to medical regimens or with&#xD;
