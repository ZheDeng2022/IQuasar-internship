  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term goal is to transform rural residents' management of T2DM. This study's&#xD;
      objective is to determine the effectiveness of an intervention that is scalable and&#xD;
      sustainable and promotes patient adherence by mitigating rural food insecure participants'&#xD;
      difficulties associated with completing existing interventions. Our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the effectiveness of the Healthy Food Delivery Intervention (HFDI) plus standard&#xD;
           care and standard care alone to improve diabetes-related outcomes among rural food&#xD;
           insecure patients with T2DM. Hypothesis: Compared with standard care alone, patients&#xD;
           receiving the HFDI plus standard care will demonstrate improved: H1 glycemic control as&#xD;
           measured by HbA1c; H2 cardio-metabolic risk factors: blood pressure, fasting glucose,&#xD;
           fasting lipids, and BMI; H3 self-management: self-efficacy, adherence to self-management&#xD;
           behaviors, and medication adherence; H4 patient-centered outcomes: diabetes-related&#xD;
           distress, diabetes-related quality of life, and diabetes-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the effectiveness of the HFDI plus standard care and standard care alone to&#xD;
           improve diet quality among rural food insecure patients with T2DM. Hypothesis: Compared&#xD;
           with standard care alone, patients receiving the HFDI plus standard care will&#xD;
           demonstrate improved: H1 Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015) scores; H2 fruit and&#xD;
           vegetable consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare cost-effectiveness to understand HFDI plus standard care costs in relationship&#xD;
           to outcomes in relation to standard care alone. Hypothesis: The HFDI will be&#xD;
           cost-effective based on traditional cost per additional quality-adjusted life year&#xD;
           gained.&#xD;

    <description>Each weekly food box will include ~9,000 calories of food, equivalent to the amount the average household receives prorated per week from an average Arkansas food pantry. The boxes will be designed by a registered dietitian. The boxes will follow ADA's Create Your Plate method consistent with the meal pattern promoted in the American College of Physicians (ACP) DSMES. The foods will also reflect Feeding America's Detailed Foods to Encourage framework, developed by nutrition experts and food bank staff to represent USDA dietary guidelines with healthy food that can be made available by food banks.</description>
