    <textblock>
      Background: Malaria by P falciparum is a public health problem in more than 100&#xD;
      municipalities of Colombia. The country is using the artemether+lumefantrine (AM+L) fixed&#xD;
      combination for uncomplicated P falciparum malaria but it is ideal to have different types of&#xD;
      formulations with similar efficacy that may be used in diverse circumstances. One alternative&#xD;
      of treatment is using preparations containing artesunate and amodiaquine (AS+AQ) in fixed&#xD;
      combination, which can be given in a simpler dosing regimen. In order to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      of that combination in an area with suspected risk of resistance to amodiaquine an open&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial was carried out in Colombia. Methods: The study was done in Choco,&#xD;
      a high endemic area for malaria by P falciparum, from August 2008 and September 2009.&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria (n=210) malaria were randomized in two arms,&#xD;
      one receiving AS+AQ and the other AM+L. The main clinical results was parasitological cure,&#xD;
      i.e. a negative blood smears, that was assessed, for both groups, at days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21&#xD;
      and 28 after the onset of treatment. Results: There were no losses at follow up. The mean age&#xD;
      of the enrolled study subjects was of 37.5 years without differences between study arms. Both&#xD;
      therapies were very well tolerated in general. The efficacy for AS+AQ was 100%, and 99% for&#xD;
      AM+L (p&gt;0.1). In average, patients in the AS+AQ arm became negative for P falciparum&#xD;
      parasites and gametocytes earlier than those at the AM+L arm. Blood smears became negative&#xD;
      after one day of treatment with AS+AQ and after two days of treatment with AM+L. Gametocytes&#xD;
      disappeared after 2 days of treatment in the AS+AQ arm compared to 4 days in the AM+L arm.&#xD;
      Conclusions: In this study, the efficacy of the AS+AQ combination was similar to that of the&#xD;
      AM+L. This finding do not support the hypothesis that there is a level of resistance to&#xD;
      amodiaquine that prevents its use combined with artemisinin derived.&#xD;

      Design: An open-labeled, randomized and controlled clinical trial with follow-up in days 1,&#xD;
      2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 was carried out in adult patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum&#xD;
      malaria. This type of study has been validated by PAHO and has been used by the Amazon&#xD;
      Network for the Surveillance of Antimalarial Drug (RAVREDA) to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      antimalarial treatment in the Americas region. This study is a simplified version with&#xD;
      monthly follow-up by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the status of therapeutic&#xD;
      failures to assure that the study progress does not result unethical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study area: The study area was in Department of Chocó, which is located west in the Pacific&#xD;
      region of the country, has an approximate extension of 47,000 Km2, equivalent to 4% of the&#xD;
      country's total extension. Chocó has 31 Municipalities for a total of 454,030 inhabitants,&#xD;
      according to the 2005 Survey. From this population, 90% is black, 6% mulatto or white, and&#xD;
      the remaining 4% natives. The great part of the population has its settling in the river and&#xD;
      sea zones, which constitutes an important aspect to consider in communications, culture and&#xD;
      socioeconomic development of the region. The temperature ranges between 26º and 30ºC.&#xD;
      Patients were recruited from two municipalities, Quibdo and Tado.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria. Age &gt; 18 years, fever (axillary temperature &gt;37.5º C) or history of fever&#xD;
      during the prior 48 hours in absence of another obvious cause (such as pneumonia, otitis&#xD;
      media), a non-mixed P. falciparum infection with 250 and 100,000 asexual parasites/µl to be&#xD;
      determined by a thick film or thick film and blood smear microscopic test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria. Not being able to drink, vomiting (more than twice within the prior 24&#xD;
      hours), recent history of seizures (1 or more in the previous 24 hours), alteration of the&#xD;
      consciousness level, not being able to seat or stand up, signs of serious malaria (World&#xD;
      Health Organization criteria), other chronic or severe diseases (i.e., cardiac, renal and&#xD;
      hepatic diseases, HIV/AIDS, severe malnutrition), history of hypersensibility to any of the&#xD;
      study drugs or drugs used as alternative treatment (i.e. mefloquine, artesunate, quinine or&#xD;
      tetracycline/clindamycin), and suspicion of pregnancy or pregnancy (based on a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arms and treatments. Two study arms were considered: Group 1 received the combination&#xD;
      AQ+AS (COARSUCAM®) which was administered orally at an initial dose of 2 tablets (200 mg&#xD;
      AQ/540 mg AS) followed by 2 additional doses of 2 tablets at 24 and 48 hours (6 tablets in 48&#xD;
      hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 received the combination Artemeter+lumefantrina (COARTEM®) administered orally at an&#xD;
      initial dose of 4 tablets (80 mg artemeter/480 mg lumefantrina) followed by 5 additional&#xD;
      doses of 4 tablets at 8, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours (24 tablets in 60 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. The sample size was estimated based on the expected proportion of failures for&#xD;
      each one of the treatments in this population. Assuming a similar efficacy for both&#xD;
      treatments (7) and considering a proportion of failures to treatment of 5% (range 1-11%) in a&#xD;
      population of infinite size, a 5% significance level and a maximum tolerable error of +4%, a&#xD;
      total of 100 study subjects are required to be included in each group. If 5% of the study&#xD;
      subjects are lost in a 28 days study, a total of 105 will be needed in each group. All&#xD;
      included subjects signed the Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. The assignment of treatments was made through a negative coordinated type&#xD;
      sampling scheme (7) which consists in generating a list of randomized numbers from a normal&#xD;
      distribution [0,1] and order the study subjects regarding this new list. These ordered study&#xD;
      subjects were systematically chosen (in this case applying a ½ sampling fraction, i.e., 1 of&#xD;
      every two for each treatment arm, since there were two arms) with an initial number randomly&#xD;
      generated through a Bernoulli distribution. This process ensures a balanced allocation to the&#xD;
      study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcomes. failure to take the drug on any of the first three days, parasitemia on day 2&#xD;
      greater than that on day 0, presence of parasitemia on day 7, diagnosis of severe malaria at&#xD;
      any point after day 0, recurrent parasitemia after day 7 up to day 28 (8-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis. Data were double-entered, and validated using Epi info© 2000 and the analysis was&#xD;
      done using Stata™ 10.0. Per protocol analysis included patients who were properly randomised,&#xD;
      had received the study drugs according to the protocol, and for whom data were available on&#xD;
      the primary end point. All statistical tests were two-sided and an α-level &lt;0.05 was&#xD;
      considered a statistically significant result. For comparisons of continuous variables&#xD;
      between groups, the t-test was used and for comparisons between more than two groups, one-way&#xD;
      analysis of variance was used after assuring normality and homogeneity of variances&#xD;
      assumptions were satisfied. For comparison of categorical variables, the chi-square test was&#xD;
      used with the exact extension invoked when there were small numbers in the cells. The end&#xD;
      points were any of the following: failure to take the drug on any of the first three days,&#xD;
      parasitaemia on day 2 greater than that on day 0, presence of parasitaemia on day 7,&#xD;
      diagnosis of severe malaria at any point after day 0, recurrent parasitaemia after day 7 up&#xD;
      to day 28.&#xD;
