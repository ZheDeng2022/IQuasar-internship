  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the likelihood of COVID-19 remaining an endemic disease among high-risk populations,&#xD;
      establishing effective mitigation interventions will be critical to stemming community&#xD;
      transmission. Criminal justice-involved individuals are extremely important to reducing&#xD;
      community-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to their increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      while incarcerated and their likelihood of living in congregate settings after incarceration.&#xD;
      We will evaluate an onsite Point-of-Care SARS-CoV-2 testing and education strategy in a&#xD;
      corrections-focused community-based organization and its impact on improving testing uptake,&#xD;
      mitigation behaviors(e.g. mask wearing, hand hygiene, social distancing, vaccine uptake when&#xD;
      available), and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The United States(U.S.) has experienced higher mortality than any other nation due to&#xD;
      COVID-19 with nearly 13.5 million cases and over 268,103 deaths. Due to the limited ability&#xD;
      to socially distance, poor ventilation, and limited hygiene supplies, U.S. prisons and jails&#xD;
      have observed explosive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 accounting for the 10 largest U.S.&#xD;
      outbreaks. Because 95% of criminal justice-involved individuals reenter societyCOVID-19&#xD;
      transmission extends beyond those who are currently incarcerated. As justice-involved&#xD;
      individuals reenter the community, they face high rates of homelessness, and many others live&#xD;
      in other congregate settings such as converted hotels and halfway houses. The increased risk&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 while incarcerated coupled with the likelihood of living in congregate settings&#xD;
      after incarceration, create conditions ripe for rapid COVID-19 transmission that will be&#xD;
      critical to address in order to gain control of COVID-19 in the U.S. The goal of this study&#xD;
      is to test the impact and cost-effectiveness of an intervention to mitigate SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      transmission among justice-involved individuals recently released from incarceration. We will&#xD;
      conduct a randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of an onsite Point-of-Care SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      testing and education intervention with community health workers (CHWs) as a central&#xD;
      component compared to the standard of care at a community-based organization (CBO) that&#xD;
      provides services to justice-involved individuals in New York City. We will measure costs of&#xD;
      testing, education, and navigation, and explore the cost-effectiveness of the onsite&#xD;
      Point-of-Care intervention compared to the standard of care. Our specific aims are to:1) Test&#xD;
      the effectiveness of an onsite PoC SARS-CoV-2 intervention in a corrections-focused CBO; 2)&#xD;
      Model the cost-effectiveness of an onsite PoC SARS-CoV-2 intervention among CJIs compared to&#xD;
      SoC. Because testing, education, and navigation will be provided by CHWs in a&#xD;
      culturally-sensitive environment and test results will be received in minutes (rather than&#xD;
      days), we hypothesize that O-PoC will be associated with improved testing uptake and receipt&#xD;
      of test results, mitigation behaviors (mask wearing, hand hygiene, social distancing), and&#xD;
      those who attend more O-PoC sessions will have better adherence to mitigation behaviors.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>We will conduct a randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of an onsite Point-of-Care testing and education intervention (O-PoC) compared to standard of care (SoC) at The Fortune Society (Fortune). The current SoC includes a referral to offsite community testing. Guided by Social Cognitive Theory, in O-PoC we will employ CHWs with lived experience of incarceration to provide: 1) COVID-19 education; 2) SARS-CoV-2 testing with Cepheid XpertXpress PCR tests at Fortune facilities; 3) Needs assessments and facilitated access to masks and hygiene supplies; 4) Navigation to vaccination sites (when available) and single-room housing at Fortune's supportive housing sites and partnering shelters, or alternative strategies that will maximize the ability to socially distance for those who test PCR positive; 5) Supportive counseling.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Testing uptake will be defined as the number and proportion of tests performed and will be determined using Program logs and healthcare record extraction. For all participants, the proportion of tests will be calculated from the total possible denominator of 5 tests (at times 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Receipt of test results will be defined as the number and proportion of test received and will be determined by self-report</description>

    <measure>Mitigation measures</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>For mitigation measures, participants will be asked: Which of the following have you done in the last 14 days to keep yourself safe from coronavirus? Worn a mask or other face covering; Washed your hands with soap or used hand sanitizer; Avoided contact with people who could be high-risk; Avoided public spaces, gatherings, or crowds.For answers to which the answer is yes: We will ask questions about mitigation measures on a sliding Likert scale regarding the last 14 days that will be programmed into Ethica software. Likert scales will include a legend with both numbers (1 day-14 days). We will assign a score with higher adherence to mitigation measures as higher scores (from 1 to 14) and create a composite score averaging 2-week questionnaire conducted over the course of the 3 months following PoC intervention visits for each mitigation measure.</description>

    <description>CHWs will reach out to participants to schedule O-PoC visits. At O-PoC visits, CHWs will provide: 1. COVID-19 education; 2. PoC Cepheid XpertXpressSARS-CoV-2PCR tests; 3. Needs assessments and facilitated access to masks and hygiene supplies; 4. Navigation to vaccination sites (when available) and single-room housing at Fortune's supportive housing sites and partnering shelters or alternative strategies that will maximize the ability to socially distance for those who test PCR positive; 5. Supportive counseling. Due to SCT's emphasis on social influence, external and internal social reinforcement, we propose our O-PoC intervention delivered by CHWs onsite at Fortune locations over a 12-month period will lead to increased uptake of mitigation behaviors.</description>

    <description>he current standard of care (SoC) for SARS-CoV-2 testing for Fortune clients is referral to offsite community testing sites and informal, unstructured education. In the SoC arm, Fortune staff will provide clients with a list of offsite SARS-CoV-2 testing locations, which are published online and available to all NYC residents. Those without insurance are not subject to a copay.Participants in SoC will continue to receive Fortune's suite of services as they are delivered (remote and/or in-person) at the time of study participation.</description>
