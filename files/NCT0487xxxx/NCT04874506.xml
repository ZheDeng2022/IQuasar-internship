  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MBM-02 (Tempol) is an HIF-1 and HIF-2 inhibitor that is being tested as an addition to&#xD;
      standard of care treatment that includes radiotherapy and TMZ. MBM-02's ability to increase&#xD;
      progression free survival and decrease side effects of TMZ and radiotherapy treatment will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MBM-02 is an HIF-1 and HIF-2 inhibitor that has shown in animal models to turn back on the&#xD;
      apoptosis process (cell death) in cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxia is well documented in most solid tumors (Vaupel et al., 1991). Acute, intermittent,&#xD;
      and cycling hypoxia are associated with inadequate blood flow, whereas chronic hypoxia is the&#xD;
      consequence of increased oxygen diffusion distance resulting from tumor expansion (Dewhirst&#xD;
      et al., 2008). A study by Chen and colleagues (2015) showed that cycling hypoxia and chronic&#xD;
      hypoxia are important tumor microenvironment phenomena that limit tumor response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy in GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In hypoxic conditions observed in solid state tumors, the hypoxia inducible factors, HIF-1α&#xD;
      and HIF-2α, are upregulated and transcribe a panel of genes associated with cancer survival&#xD;
      and progression, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet&#xD;
      derived growth factor (PDGF), and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). These factors are essential&#xD;
      for tumor survival, thereby increasing tumor progression and decreasing apoptosis. Without&#xD;
      the functions of the HIF family of genes, solid-state tumors could not progress and would not&#xD;
      survive. In both Chen et al. (2015) and Sourbier et al. (2012), researchers established that&#xD;
      the active compound in MBM-02 is an inhibitor of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label multisite trial that will assess MBM-02's ability to increase progress&#xD;
      free survival in patients receiving standard of care for glioblastoma.&#xD;
