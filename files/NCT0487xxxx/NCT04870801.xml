  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The availability of oxygen is a crucial prognostic indicator for outcomes pertinent to many&#xD;
      chronic diseases. Accordingly, interventions that might increase oxygen availability have&#xD;
      obvious beneficial clinical application. In this regard, Respirogen Micro-Oxygen (RMO)&#xD;
      technology holds considerable promise. Data from experimental animal models of lung injury&#xD;
      suggest administration of RMO is a feasible method to deliver oxygen in a manner independent&#xD;
      of pulmonary function. Our ultimate long-term goal is to provide a product that can be used&#xD;
      to deliver oxygen to humans experiencing respiratory distress and pulmonary dysfunction In&#xD;
      this first exploratory study, our goal is to begin to understand the physiological responses&#xD;
      to enteral (rectal) delivery of RMO in low-oxygen environments in healthy adults at rest.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Following screening, six healthy adults will report to the Human Performance Clinical Research Laboratory on two separate occasions, each separated by ~7-14 days. During each visit, study participants will undergo physiological monitoring prior to and during inhalation of hypoxic (FiO2=0.15) gas mixtures. During one of these visits, following initiation of hypoxic gas breathing, colon administration of RMO will commence.</intervention_model_description>
