  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to conduct a prospective evaluation of a smartwatch technology&#xD;
      and an associated application (developed by Awake Labs) in a clinical cohort from CAMH Adult&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental Services (ANS) and adults with developmental disabilities in the community&#xD;
      who have received a watch.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tools that help predict the onset of anxiety and agitation can not only help a person learn&#xD;
      to self-monitor their emotions, but can may also help others feel more efficacious in&#xD;
      understanding the internal state of the person they are supporting (especially if not able to&#xD;
      communicate), and help them respond in a way that keeps the individual and others safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to conduct a prospective evaluation of the smartwatch technology&#xD;
      with modifications recommended by the researchers (based on a previous retrospective study)&#xD;
      in a clinical cohort at CAMH Adult Neurodevelopmental Services (ANS) and in adults with&#xD;
      developmental disabilities in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, this study seeks to evaluate the utility and validity of the smartwatch and&#xD;
      associated mobile application as a clinical tool by gathering behavioral data when the&#xD;
      applications gives a notification. The person wearing the watch or those in their environment&#xD;
      will be asked to report the following in the application after the smartwatch gives a&#xD;
      notification: 1) the valence of the emotion of the person wearing the smartwatch, 2) what&#xD;
      events were occurring prior to notification (e.g., potential triggers for behaviours that&#xD;
      challenge), and 3) what happened after the notification (e.g., how the person or others in&#xD;
      their environment responded to the notification).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be used to inform future iterations of the technology and make recommendations&#xD;
      for clinical use.&#xD;

    <description>What is the person's perceived emotion? The person with the ipod (clinician, support worker) will receive a real-time notification when the smartwatch indicates the individual wearing the watch is experiencing strong emotions. The person with the ipod is to indicate which emotion they are experiencing (e.g., anxiety, happiness)</description>

    <description>What was happening before the notification? The person with the ipod (clinician, support worker) will receive a real-time notification when the smartwatch indicates the individual wearing the watch is experiencing strong emotions. The person with the ipod is to indicate what the person who is wearing the smartwatch was doing before immediately before the notification.</description>

    <description>What happened after the notification?The person with the ipod (clinician, support worker) will receive a real-time notification when the smartwatch indicates the individual wearing the watch is experiencing strong emotions. The person with the ipod is to indicate what happened once they received the notification (e.g., deep breathing)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>How accurate is the smartwatch at indicating anxiety? The emotion variable will be used to calculate accuracy of the smartwatch indicating anxiety. This will be calculated by dividing the number of times the smartwatch accurately indicated anxiety (using the number of times the person with the ipod indicated the person wearing the smartwatch was experiencing anxiety) divided by the number of total notifications x100</description>
