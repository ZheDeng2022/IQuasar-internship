  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are publications showing a decrease in Antithrombin III levels of continuous flow and&#xD;
      routine heparin therapy in adult patients undergoing Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation&#xD;
      (ECMO) however, there is not enough data. One of the multifactorial causes affecting bleeding&#xD;
      / thrombosis complications and ACT levels may be acquired Antithrombin III deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Antithrombin III activity test results from the patients to be included in the study&#xD;
      during the study will be recorded immediately after ECMO run, at the 24th hour before the&#xD;
      heparin infusion start and at the 48th, 72nd and 96th hours following the follow-up. The&#xD;
      results will be analyzed to figure out a relationship between decreasing Antithrombin 3&#xD;
      values and thrombotic events.&#xD;

      ECMO is applied in patients with acute severe heart or lung failure. The treatment protocol&#xD;
      of patients undergoing ECMO is carefully arranged against the risk of bleeding / thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the general protocol, heparin infusion therapy is started at the 24th hour after&#xD;
      ECMO application. The risk of bleeding / thrombosis is avoided by adjusting the heparin&#xD;
      infusion dose with Activated Clotting Time (ACT) control. However, over time,&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia and fluctuations in ACT level are observed in patients. It may be necessary&#xD;
      to increase the dose of heparin given during the prolonged period. One of the multifactorial&#xD;
      causes affecting bleeding / thrombosis complications and ACT levels may be acquired&#xD;
      Antithrombin III deficiency. There are publications reporting a decrease in Antithrombin III&#xD;
      levels of continuous flow and routine heparin therapy in adult patients undergoing ECMO;&#xD;
      however, there is not enough data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Antithrombin III activity test results from the patients to be included in the study&#xD;

      heparin infusion start and at the 48th, 72nd and 96th hours following the follow-up. The&#xD;
      results will be analyzed to figure out a relationship between decreasing Antithrombin 3&#xD;
      values and thrombotic events.&#xD;
