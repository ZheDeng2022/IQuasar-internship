      This study will be conducted in the Department of physical therapy, College of Applied&#xD;
      Medical Sciences,Jazan University, to Effects of Pilates Exercises on core stability after&#xD;
      Recovery from COVID - 19&#xD;

      Thirty female students who had infected with covid 19 with age 19 to 26 years old, will be&#xD;
      recruited from the College of Applied Medical Sciences, Jazan University. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to pilates and home exercises (PAH) group or a control group who will&#xD;
      perform only home exercises (COH)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four core endurance tests will be performed to assess the core stability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilates exercise program will be composed of Pilates mat exercise program for a period of 12&#xD;
      weeks and three sessions every week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session took one hour. Every session started with 10 minutes of simple stretching&#xD;
      movements to warm-up followed by the main part of the exercise plan for 40 min, followed by&#xD;
      10 minutes, some cool-down stretching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the 12-week study period will over, the core stability will be assessed by the endurance&#xD;
      tests&#xD;
