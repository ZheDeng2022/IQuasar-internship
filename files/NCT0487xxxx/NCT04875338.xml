    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of injection techniques in the treatment&#xD;
      of elbow lateral epicondylitis. The functional and pain levels of the patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated with scores such as DASH, VAS, PRTEE. At the same time, USG imaging will be&#xD;
      evaluated before injection and in the third month after injection. The study was planned as a&#xD;
      randomized controlled prospective study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with epicondylitis in our outpatient clinic will be divided into 3 groups,&#xD;
      and patients who will receive saline in 1 group and betamethasone sodium in a group will be&#xD;
      selected in accordance with the specified conditions and their treatment will be started, and&#xD;
      the treatment will be started, which patient will receive which treatment will be determined&#xD;
      by the computerized randomization program. ), 1ml prp (plate-rich plasma to be prepared with&#xD;
      the blood taken from the patient on the day of injection), 1 ml saline (0.9 NACI), while the&#xD;
      patient is in the supine position, the affected elbow is 90 flexion and neutral rotation, The&#xD;
      non-dominant thumb will be placed at the sensitive point in the lateral epicondyle. The&#xD;
      injection will be applied to the point with a 23 g needle. After the injection, the subjects&#xD;
      will be taught a stretching exercise of the joint extensors of the wrist and fingers.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to do this exercise five times in one session, two sessions a&#xD;
      day.Examination and functional scores to be applied to the patients during follow-up: VAS,&#xD;
      DASH and PRTEE scores will be checked in the 1st 6th week, 3rd month, 6th month and 12th&#xD;
      month VAS: Visual Analog Scale DASH: The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand PRTEE:&#xD;
      The Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation 2. It will be evaluated by USG in the 3rd month.&#xD;

    <description>The Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) is designed to evaluate pain and disability in subjects with lateral elbow tendinopathy. This questionnaire is available in Swedish, Italian, and some other languages. A Persian language version of the questionnaire is needed for both research and clinical purposes. The higher the score, the greater the pain, and we expect it to decrease after the process.</description>
