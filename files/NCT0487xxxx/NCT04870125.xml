    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, partially double-blind, and placebo-controlled&#xD;
      Phase Ib clinical trial of inhaled CO (iCO) for the treatment of sepsis-induced acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      accuracy of a Coburn-Forster-Kane (CFK) equation-based personalized iCO dosing algorithm to&#xD;
      achieve a target carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level of 6-8% in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS.&#xD;
      We will also examine the biologic readouts of low dose iCO therapy in patients with&#xD;
      sepsis-induced ARDS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ARDS is a syndrome of severe acute lung inflammation and hypoxemic respiratory failure with&#xD;
      an incidence of 180,000 cases annually in the United States. Despite recent advances in&#xD;
      critical care management and lung protective ventilation strategies, ARDS morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality remain unacceptably high. Furthermore, no specific effective pharmacologic&#xD;
      therapies currently exist. Sepsis, life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a&#xD;
      dysregulated host response to infection, represents a major risk for the development of ARDS&#xD;
      and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). In recent years, the number of patients with&#xD;
      severe sepsis has risen to 750,000 per year in the U.S., which bears an alarming forecast for&#xD;
      critically ill patients in the intensive care unit with significant risk for the development&#xD;
      of ARDS. The lack of specific effective therapies for ARDS indicates a need for new&#xD;
      treatments that target novel pathways. Carbon monoxide (CO) represents a novel therapeutic&#xD;
      modality in sepsis-induced ARDS based on data obtained in experimental models of sepsis and&#xD;
      ARDS over the past decade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CO has been shown to be protective in experimental models of acute lung injury (ALI) and&#xD;
      sepsis. Furthermore, multiple human studies have demonstrated that experimental&#xD;
      administration of several different concentrations of CO is well-tolerated and that low dose&#xD;
      inhaled CO can be safely administered to subjects in a controlled research environment. The&#xD;
      investigators have previously conducted a Phase I trial of low dose iCO in sepsis-induced&#xD;
      ARDS which demonstrated that precise administration of low dose iCO (100 and 200 ppm) is&#xD;
      feasible, well-tolerated, and safe in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and accuracy of a CFK equation-based iCO&#xD;
      personalized dosing algorithm of inhaled carbon monoxide (iCO) to achieve a target COHb level&#xD;
      of 6-8% in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis-induced ARDS.&#xD;

    <measure>Lung injury score (LIS) on days 1-5 and day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Lung Injury Score (LIS) is a composite 4-point scoring system including the PaO2/FiO2, PEEP, quasi-static respiratory compliance, and the extent of infiltrates on the chest X-ray. Each of the four components is categorized from 0 to 4, where a higher number is worse. The total Lung Injury Score is obtained by dividing the aggregate sum by the number of components used. Previous randomized clinical trials in ARDS have shown that a decreased LIS correlates with improvement in lung physiology as well as important clinical outcomes including mortality and ventilator-free days (VFDs).</description>

    <description>Organ failure will be assessed using the SOFA score. SOFA scores will be assessed daily on days 1-5, and thereafter on days 7, 14, and 28, as the SOFA score has been shown to be a reliable prognostic indicator of outcomes in critically ill patients. To calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, each of the six components (Respiratory, Coagulation, Liver, Cardiovascular, Central Nervous System, Renal) is categorized from 0-4, where a higher number is worse. The SOFA score (0-24) will be calculated by summing all six components.</description>
