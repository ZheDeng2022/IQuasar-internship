  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on recent data, COVID (COV) vaccination in cancer patients (pts) is strictly&#xD;
      recommended. For oncologic pts,2 types of m-RNA vaccines have been approved: BNT162b2&#xD;
      (Pfizer, Biontech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna, NIAID). In immunocompetent population, the&#xD;
      administration of 2 doses confers 95% protection against COV. However, protection conferred&#xD;
      by vaccines, adverse events (AEs) and correlations with antiblastic treatments are unknown in&#xD;
      cancer pts.&#xD;

      Trial Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocentric observational study conducted by the Oncology Unit of Cremona (CR)&#xD;
      Hospital, enrolling pts from Oncology, Hematology, Radiotherapy and Palliative Care of Cr&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to prospectively and retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of mRNA&#xD;
      vaccines [BNT162b2 (Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna)], the quantization of the antibodies&#xD;
      (Abs) response and the onset of AEs in a consecutive population of 300 cancer pts, undergoing&#xD;
      antiblastic treatment, starting from March 26Th,2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From March, 2021 a vaccination point was set up by Cr Hospital, specific for cancer pts.&#xD;
      Vaccine is administered at least 5 days after the last dose of intravenous or oral&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment; the next course of therapy is not administered within the next 3&#xD;
      days. Target therapy and immunotherapy doesn't need interruptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Primary endpoint: Evaluating the protection conferred by vaccination, by detecting the&#xD;
      number of symptomatic pts affected by COV, diagnosed 7-60 days after the 2nddose of vaccine.&#xD;
      Confirmed of COV infection is defined according to the Food and Drug Administration criteria&#xD;
      combined with a nasopharyngeal swab, positive for SARS-Cov-2, obtained during the symptomatic&#xD;
      period or within 4 days before or after it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Secondary endpoints: Measuring Abs variation at different timepoints compared to baseline.&#xD;
      LIAISON SARS-Cov-2 TrimericS IgG and Elecsys anti-SARS-Cov-2 tests will be adopted. The level&#xD;
      of Abs will be evaluated at baseline and 30(±7), 180(±7),365(±7)days after the 2nd dose of&#xD;
      vaccine;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describing AEs; Evaluating the interference between vaccine and cancer treatments; Analysis&#xD;
      of the Abs subtypes; Duration of abs, up to 12 months after 2nd dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic Analysis The hypothesis of vaccine inferiority in the trial population is rejected&#xD;
      if a rate of protection conferred by the vaccine is observed in 89% of the sample size. The&#xD;
      null hypothesis will be rejected if out of a sample size of 300 patients at least 261 are&#xD;
      &quot;protected&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observed proportion of patients with protection will be described by absolute and&#xD;
      relative frequency, with Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals. The primary objective will be&#xD;
      tested by non-inferiority one-single proportion test, compared with the historical value of&#xD;
      95%. In order to describe the trend of antibody changes in the multiple detections, the ANOVA&#xD;
      test for repeated measurements will be used.&#xD;
