  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The axons of the retinal ganglion cells combine to form the optic nerve. The optic nerve&#xD;
      transmits electrical signals to the visual cortex by various synapses. Optic nerve axons are&#xD;
      more sensitive to toxins than retina because they are outside the blood retinal barrier.&#xD;
      Methanol, various solvents and heavy metals, carbon dioxide, antiarrhythmic, antiepileptic,&#xD;
      antibiotics and some vasoactive drugs can cause toxic optic neuropathy. There is a different&#xD;
      pathophysiology for each toxin. Methanol is easily accessible alcohol in all types of&#xD;
      disinfectants. Methanol is converted into formaldehyde and formic acid while metabolized in&#xD;
      the liver. Formaldehyde disrupts ATP synthesis by blocking mitochondrial function and&#xD;
      oxidative phosphorylation. Formic acid causes demyelination as a result of metabolic&#xD;
      acidosis. Neuroinflammation occurs when denatured proteins block axoplasmic flow. All these&#xD;
      processes can lead to apoptosis and permanent vision loss. Sildenafil is a vasoactive drug&#xD;
      used in erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil decreases optic nerve head blood flow.&#xD;
      Neuroinflammation develops secondary to the cessation of axoplasmic flow after hypoxia. If&#xD;
      hypoxia and neuroinflammatiom persists, apoptosis and permanent vision loss develop.&#xD;
      Amiodarone is an ion channel blocker used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Long-term&#xD;
      use may cause disruption of ion channel balance in the optic nerve. This condition leads to&#xD;
      asymmetric neuroinflammation and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSC) can increase mitochondrial ATP&#xD;
      synthesis with paracrine effects and suppress neuroinflammation with immunomodulatory&#xD;
      effects. Repetitive electromagnetic stimulation (rEMS) can rearrange ion channel balances and&#xD;
      axoplasmic flow. The aim of this prospective phase-3 clinical study is to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of WJ-MSC and rEMS combination in the therapy of toxic optic neuropathies. This&#xD;
      combination is the first study in the literature for the therapy of toxic optic neuropathies.&#xD;

      This prospective, open-label clinical phase-3 study was conducted at Ankara University&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology between April 2019 and April 2021.&#xD;
      Thirty-six eyes of 18 patients with toxic optic neuropathy were included in the study. The&#xD;
      primary toxic optic neuropathy (TON) diagnosis was made in emergency or intensive care&#xD;
      clinics. Patients who admitted within 3 months after the first intervention were included in&#xD;
      the study. All patients enrolled underwent a complete routine ophthalmic examination,&#xD;
      including the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurement with the early treatment of&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart (Topcon CC 100 XP, Japan). The patients were further&#xD;
      evaluated with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) from RTVue XR (Avanti,&#xD;
      Optovue, Fremont, CA, USA) to analyse and measure the changes in the ganglion cell complex&#xD;
      (GCC) layer that provided a typical co-registered en-face and cross-sectional multimodal&#xD;
      imaging platform. Functional evaluation of optic nerve was followed by Compass 24/2 visual&#xD;
      field (VF) test (Compass, CenterVue, Padova, Italy) and 120' pattern visual evoked potential&#xD;
      (pVEP) test (Mon 2018F, Metrovision, Perenchies, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Thirty-six eyes of 18 TON patients were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria consisted of several parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cases poisoned with a toxic agent within 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with BCVA better than 35 letters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any degree of visual field loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients over 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria consisted of several parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cases poisoned with a toxic agent more than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with BCVA less than 35 letters: to perform the visual field test correctly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological sequelae that cannot be cooperated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same treatment protocol was applied to all patients with methanol intoxication before&#xD;
      admission to our clinic. Hemodialysis, bicarbonate and ethanol were administered to all&#xD;
      patients. The cases were divided into 3 groups according to similar demographic&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Consists of 12 eyes of 12 patients treated with WJ-MSC and rEMS combination in one&#xD;
      eye. WJ-MSC was applied only one time before rEMS applications. rEMS application was started&#xD;
      10 days after WJ-MSC application.The rEMS was applied with a custom-designed helmet for 30&#xD;
      minutes after the WJ-MSC application. rEMS applications were repeated 10 times with a 1-week&#xD;
      interval. The course was evaluated by comparing the BCVA, FPDI, GCC thickness, pVEP-p100&#xD;
      latency and amplitude parameters before and 3rd month of aplications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Consists of 12 eyes of 12 patients treated with only rEMS in one eye. The rEMS was&#xD;
      applied with a custom-designed helmet for 30 minutes. rEMS applications were repeated 10&#xD;
      times with a 1-week interval. The course was evaluated by comparing the BCVA, FPDI, GCC&#xD;
      thickness, pVEP-p100 latency and amplitude parameters before and 3rd month of aplications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Consists of 12 eyes of 6 patients treated with only WJ-MSC in two eyes. WJ-MSC was&#xD;
      applied only one time for both eyes. The course was evaluated by comparing the BCVA, FPDI,&#xD;
      GCC thickness, pVEP-p100 latency and amplitude parameters before and 3rd month of&#xD;
      aplications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells preparation The mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells used in this study were isolated from Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord that&#xD;
      was collected allogenicly from a single donor with the mother's consent. The umbilical cord&#xD;
      sample was treated following several steps. Briefly, cord tissue was washed twice with&#xD;
      phosphate-buffered saline (Lonza, Switzerland) and the Wharton's jelly part was minced using&#xD;
      forceps and a scalpel. Minced pieces were cultivated in a cell culture dish (Greiner Bio-One,&#xD;
      Germany) with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F12 (DMEM)-low glucose with no L-glutamine&#xD;
      (Bilogical Industries, Israel) and 10% human AB serum (Capricorn, Germany), 1% 10.000 U/mL&#xD;
      penicillin, and 10.000 Î¼g/mL streptomycin (Gibco,USA). All cell preparations and cultivation&#xD;
      procedures were conducted in a current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) accredited&#xD;
      laboratory (Onkim Stem Cell Technologies, Turkey). The culture-expanded cells were&#xD;
      cryopreserved at P3 using standard cryopreservation protocols until used in the following&#xD;
      experiment. CryoSure-DEX40 (WAK-Chemie Medical, Germany) containing 55% Dimethyl Sulfoxide&#xD;
      and 5% Dextran 40 was used as cryopreservant. The cells were characterized at the time of&#xD;
      cryopreservation using flow cytometric analysis to determine the expression of the positive&#xD;
      cluster of differentiation (CD) surface markers, CD90, CD105, CD73, CD44, CD29, and negative&#xD;
      for CD34, CD45, and CD11b. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), the expressions&#xD;
      of several genes, such as tumor necrosis alpha (TNF alpha) and vimentin (VIM) were analyzed.&#xD;
      Additionally, quality control analyses, such as mycoplasma and endotoxin analyses (using the&#xD;
      PCR and LAL test combined with sterility analysis, respectively) were also completed. Cells&#xD;
      were solubilized from cryopreservation before being prepared for injection. Average cell&#xD;
      viability for each treatment was over 90.0%, and each patient received 2-6 x 106 cells in a&#xD;
      1.5 ml saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection of umbilical cord WJ-MSCs The WJ-MSCs suspension from the culture was delivered to&#xD;
      the operating room by cold chain and used within 24 hours. A total of 1.5 ml of the WJ-MSC&#xD;
      suspension was immediately injected into the subtenon space of each eye. The procedure was&#xD;
      conducted under topical anesthesia with proparacaine hydrochloride drops (Alcaine, Alcon,&#xD;
      USA) and sterile conditions. 5/0 atraumatic traction suture was applied to the limbus for&#xD;
      easy access and manuplation to application area. Postoperatively, loteprednol and tobramycin&#xD;
      combination eye drops were given four times per day for one week, and oral amoxicillin&#xD;
      clavulonate (1 gr) was given twice a day for five days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinal repetitive electromagnetic stimulation (rEMS) The rEMS helmet (MagnovisionTM,&#xD;
      Bioretina Biotechnology, Ankara, Turkey) stimulated the retina and visual pathways with an&#xD;
      electromagnetic field strength of 2000 miligauss, frequency of 42 hertz, and duration 30&#xD;
      minutes. These values were previously determined to be effective for other clinical and&#xD;
      preclinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeframe&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were evaluated at several study timepoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T0 (baseline): immediately before the applications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T1: 1rst month of applications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2: 3rd month of applications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure â¢ ETDRS visual acuity: The visual acuity scores obtained from the T0&#xD;
      and T2 examinations were analyzed and compared using statistical tests to determine&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      â¢ Visual field sensitivity: Fundus perimetry deviation index (FPDI, %) FPDI was examined in&#xD;
      the 24/2 visual field of the computerized perimetry records. The FPDI offers data explaining&#xD;
      how many of the 100 flashing points and what percentage of the visual field could be&#xD;
      correctly seen by the patient. For VF analysis, in order to avoid mistakes during the test,&#xD;
      practice rounds were carried out three times before applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â¢ Ganglion cell complex thickness (GCC thickness, Âµm): GCC is the thickness from the internal&#xD;
      limiting membrane to the inner plexiform layer in the 3x3 mm of foveal area. The measurement&#xD;
      done automatically by the OCTA device. GCC is the total thickness of the ganglion cells and&#xD;
      retinal nerve fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â¢ Pattern visual evoked potential (pVEP) pVEP is a objective test that measures the&#xD;
      electrical activity of the optical pathway in response to a light stimulus. The 120' patterns&#xD;
      reveals responses from the all retinal quadrants. The measurements were taken according to&#xD;
      the ISCEV standarts for both eyes. We used the 120'pattern VEP protocol, which combines p100&#xD;
      implicit time and amplitude, to create a numerical result.&#xD;
