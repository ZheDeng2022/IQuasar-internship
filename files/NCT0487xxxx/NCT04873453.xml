  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study designed to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of full spectrum CBD and broad spectrum CBD, compared to a placebo control (PC), to&#xD;
      reduce drinking in participants with moderate alcohol use disorder according to the DSM-V. If&#xD;
      eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized to receive one of the conditions for 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will directly test the hypothesis that a moderate dose of CBD leads to a&#xD;
      reduction in alcohol consumption, alcohol craving, peripheral markers of inflammation, and&#xD;
      anxiety. It is further hypothesized that CBD will lead to increased sleep duration and&#xD;
      quality among individuals with AUD who want to quit or reduce their drinking. The study will&#xD;
      also determine whether the small amount of THC found in full spectrum hemp-derived CBD&#xD;
      products produces any negative effects. The hypotheses are grounded in previous studies&#xD;
      suggesting that CBD reduces the reinforcing properties of alcohol and decreases drinking&#xD;
      motivation and consumption (Viudez-Martínez, García-Gutiérrez, Fraguas-Sánchez, et al.,&#xD;
      2018). Further, CBD has shown clinical promise for tobacco, cannabis, and opioid use&#xD;
      disorders (Hurd, 2017; Hurd et al., 2015; Prud'homme et al., 2015), and evidence indicates&#xD;
      that these effects may be due to the ability of CBD to reduce cue-induced craving and anxiety&#xD;
      (Gonzalez-Cuevas et al., 2018; Hurd et al., 2019). The hypotheses are also grounded in the&#xD;
      pre-clinical literature suggesting that CBD may modulate the immune system and have&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects which also helps to reduce harm associated with alcohol and may&#xD;
      have a positive effect on those attempting to quit. Other potential mechanisms that might&#xD;
      underlie the effects of CBD include a reduction in the severity of acute withdrawal, a&#xD;
      reduction in protracted withdrawal, and the neuroprotective effects of CBD. Given the&#xD;
      background literature with respect to CBD and AUDs, a logical next step is for human studies&#xD;
      to address these questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the effects of hemp-derived CBD with and without a small amount of THC,&#xD;
      the investigators propose a Phase II randomized clinical trial (RCT) to examine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and clinical effects of Full Spectrum CBD (fsCBD, contains less than 0.3% THC)&#xD;
      vs. Broad Spectrum CBD (bsCBD, does not contain THC), vs. a matching placebo in a population&#xD;
      of AUD subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study designed to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of fsCBD and bsCBD, compared to a placebo control (PC), to reduce drinking in&#xD;
      participants with moderate alcohol use disorder according to the DSM-V. If eligible for the&#xD;
      study, subjects will be randomized to receive one of the conditions for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize risk of COVID transmission, the investigators will utilize Zoom for weekly&#xD;
      subject check-ins and our Mobile Pharmacology Lab (MPL) for the collection of blood samples&#xD;
      and clinical data for the majority of in-person visits. The initial Week 0 / Baseline visit&#xD;
      will take place at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. There will be MPL&#xD;
      follow-up visits at Weeks 1, 4, and 8. Participants will be contacted by Zoom each remaining&#xD;
      week during the 8-week period. A follow up Zoom interview will occur in Week 16 approximately&#xD;
      8 weeks after the end of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the clinical study is expected to take 1-2 years to complete enrollment and data&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
