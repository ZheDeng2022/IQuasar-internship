    <measure>Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via heart rate variability; Data will be collected with a wearable tracking device (Oura Ring). Heart rate variability (HRV) measures the specific changes in time (or variability) between successive heart beats. The time between beats is measured in milliseconds (ms) and is called an &quot;R-R interval&quot; or &quot;inter-beat interval (IBI).</description>

    <measure>Self Reported Perceived Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); The 19 self-rated items are combined to form seven &quot;component&quot; scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points. In all cases, a score of &quot;0&quot; indicates no difficulty, while a score of &quot;3&quot; indicates severe difficulty. The seven component scores are then added to yield one &quot;global&quot; score, with a range of 0-21 points, &quot;0&quot; indicating no difficulty and &quot;21&quot; indicating severe difficulties in all areas.</description>

    <measure>Sleep Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via a wearable health tracking device (Oura Ring). Sleep score consists of: Total sleep time, time in bed, sleep efficiency, and resting heart rate.</description>

    <measure>Appetite and food craving</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Food Cravings Questionnaire-State; he Food Cravings Questionnaire-State (FCQ-S) measures the intensity of momentary food craving. The questionnaire has 15 items and response categories range from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree</description>

    <measure>Reward-related eating</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Perceived physical and mental health over time</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Reported via the Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) survey; A multi-dimensional concept that includes domains related to physical, mental, emotional, and social functioning. It goes beyond direct measures of population health, life expectancy, and causes of death, and focuses on the impact health status has on quality of life.&#xD;
85 = Very good quality of life. 70 = Good quality of life. 57.5 = Moderately good quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Depression and anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS); The DASS is a 42-item self report instrument designed to measure the three related negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and tension/stress.&#xD;

    <description>Behavioral: Noom Healthy Weight; mobile behavior change program for weight loss with 1:1 coaching The intervention consists of a curriculum, provided through daily articles that users are encouraged to read; logging features for weight, meals, and physical activity; in-app groups; and a virtual coach, who will communicate with participants via in-app messaging. During the first week of the study, participants will be introduced to the program, the Noom app, and their coach. Coaches will use a secure dashboard to monitor patient progress, which is used to increase engagement and motivation. Participants are encouraged to log their weight and physical activity on a weekly basis, and meals daily.</description>
