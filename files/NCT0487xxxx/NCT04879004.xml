      The aim of the trial is to study the efficacy of continuous bilateral Erector Spinae Plane&#xD;
      Block (ESPB) in managing perioperative pain in patients who undergo elective laparoscopic&#xD;
      colectomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic colectomy is a common surgery performed by general surgeons for a variety of&#xD;
      reasons, such as colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple precancerous colon&#xD;
      polyps. Nowadays, due to the evolution of laraposcopic techniques, laparoscopic colectomies&#xD;
      are performed with minimally invasive procedures. However, most patients complain for&#xD;
      moderate to severe post-operative pain, which requires the application of multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia recipes and the administration of large doses of opioids perioperatively, in order&#xD;
      to be relieved. Due to the opioid crisis observed in the U.S. and in many european countries&#xD;
      and due to the variety of adverse effects observed after the administration of opioids&#xD;
      (respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, delayed mobilization of gastrointestinal system&#xD;
      and the patient), which augment not only the hospitalization time but also the&#xD;
      hospitilization cost of the patients, anesthesiologists tend to limit their administration,&#xD;
      especially in colectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) is an innovating trunk block, which was first described in&#xD;
      2016 by Forrero et. al in order to relieve neuropathic pain. Since then, it was embraced by&#xD;
      modern anesthesia practices and is currently effectively performed for chronic pain, acute&#xD;
      post-traumatic and acute post-operative pain, in various surgical procedures. Specifically,&#xD;
      ESPB has been performed for the treatment of thoracic neuropathic pain, of acute&#xD;
      post-operative pain after thoracotomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, total hip arthroplasty,&#xD;
      modified radical mastectomy, emergent laparotomy and after various surgical procedures of the&#xD;
      spine, with good results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no clinical trials that study the effectiveness of continuous bilateral Erector&#xD;
      Spinae Plane Block in laparoscopic colectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a randomized, controlled, double - blind, prospective trial, predominantly&#xD;
      aiming at evaluating the effectiveness of continuous bilateral Erector Spinae Plane Block&#xD;
      (ESPB) in managing perioperative pain in patients who undergo elective laparoscopic&#xD;
      colectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will recruit 40 patients (men and women), aged 18 to 85 years old who will undergo&#xD;
      laparoscopic colectomy, performed by the same experienced, surgical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into two groups, Group B (Block Group - Ropivacaine 0,375%) and&#xD;
      Group C (Control group - N/S 0,9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESPB will be performed bilaterally, accompanied with the placement of catheters for&#xD;
      continuous solution infusion, by the same, experienced in regional anesthesia&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, before the induction of general anesthesia. The solutions administered&#xD;
      during the performance of ESPB, will be prepared by an independent anesthesiology nurse. The&#xD;
      quality of the ultrasound image and the pain intensity during the performance of ESPB, as&#xD;
      well as the dermotomes blocked by ESPB and the complications that may arise after the&#xD;
      performance of the block, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The age, sex, Body Mass Index and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification&#xD;
      of the participants, will be recorded. Preoperative standard laboratory tests, as well as&#xD;
      TNF-a, Interleukine-1 and Interleukine-6 levels will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the induction of general anesthesia [propofol (2,5 mg/kg), fentanyl (1 γ/kg),&#xD;
      rocuronium (0,6 mg/kg)], general anesthesia will be maintained with desflurane titration,&#xD;
      guided by BIS Monitor readings. In all patients, remifentanil infusion will be titrated in&#xD;
      order to achieve intraoperative analgesia, guided by Nociception Monitoring (NOL Monitor). In&#xD;
      all patients Magnesium Sulphate 50 mg/kg and Pantoprazole 40 mg will be administered at the&#xD;
      start of the surgical procedure. Paracetamol 1000 mg, Tramadol 100 mg, Droperidol 1,25 mg and&#xD;
      Ondansetron 4 mg will be also administered to all patients 30 minutes before the end of&#xD;
      surgery. During surgery, vital signs, BIS and NOL readings, Cardiac Output, Stroke Volume&#xD;
      Variation, Glucose and Lactate levels will be recorded. Total fluids, desflurane and&#xD;
      remifentanyl administration, urine output, as well as the administration of other drugs will&#xD;
      also be recorded. At the end of surgery, Train of Four stimulation will be performed and in&#xD;
      the presence of remaining neuromuscular blockade, sugammadex will be administered in the&#xD;
      proper doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, post - operative analgesia will include administration of Paracetamol 1000&#xD;
      mg every 6 hours. Tramadol 50 mg will be offered as rescue analgesia, if NRS pain score of&#xD;
      the patient is &gt; 4. 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after the performance of ESPB, Ropivacaine 0,375%&#xD;
      (patients randomized in Group B) or N/S 0,9% (patients randomized in Group C) will be infused&#xD;
      through the ESPB catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of stay of the patient in Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), the Aldrete Score&#xD;
      and the vital signs the moment the patient leaves the PACU, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post - operative observation of the patient will include recording of NRS pain score at rest&#xD;
      and activity, Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting Score, tramadol consumption, vital signs,&#xD;
      12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 hours after the end of surgery. Quality of Recovery Score&#xD;
      of the patient will be recorded 72 hours after the end of surgery. Mobilization time of the&#xD;
      patient and of the gastrointestinal tract, the time of removal of bladder catheter and&#xD;
      drainages, the time of start of oral fluids and enteral nutrition, the discharge time and the&#xD;
      total cost, will also be recorded. The satisfaction score of the patient in a scale from 1 to&#xD;
      6, 96 hours after the end of surgery will be recorded. Standard laboratory tests of the&#xD;
      first, second and third post-operative days will be recorded, as well as the TNF-a,&#xD;
      Interleukine-1 and Interleukine-6 levels the first and the fourth post-operative day.&#xD;
