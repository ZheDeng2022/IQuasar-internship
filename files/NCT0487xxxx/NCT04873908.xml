  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, it was aimed to compare the proprioception training applied in addition&#xD;
      to conventional treatment and Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy treatment in&#xD;
      patients with chronic strokes and to investigate the effects on proprioception, spasticity,&#xD;
      functional motor skills and daily living activities in the upper extremity.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fugl-Meyer assessment test</measure>
    <time_frame>Score change after 6 weeks of intervention compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based upper extremity function. The maximum available score is 66 and The minimum available score is zero.The higher total score means better motor function in the arm</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Action Research arm test</measure>
    <time_frame>Score change after 6 weeks of intervention compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is a 19 item observational measure used by physical therapists and other health care professionals to assess upper extremity performance. The maximum available score from the 19 items was 57. The higher total score means better motor function in the arm</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Activity Log</measure>
    <time_frame>Score change after 6 weeks of intervention compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Daily use of the affected upper extremity was assessed using Motor Activity Log. It is a self-statement questionnaire to determine the frequency and quality of movement in the upper extremity. Score range is 0-5, The higher total score means better motor function in the arm</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Score change after 6 weeks of intervention compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Ashworth Scale was measure muscle spasticity. It is among the most commonly used scales for clinical and research purposes. The resistance against passive movement is evaluated on a scale of 0-4 points.The lower total score means better spasticity in the arm</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>thumb localizing test</measure>
    <time_frame>Score change after 6 weeks of intervention compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A proprioception examination, called the 'thumb localizing test' (TLT), is described as a technique for testing 'limb localization'. With the patient's eyes closed, the examiner positions one of the patient's upper limbs (fixed limb) and asks him to pinch the thumb of that limb with the opposite thumb and index finger (reaching limb).It is evaluated on a 0-3 point scale. The lower the total score, the better the proprioceptive in the arm.</description>
