  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of adolescent severe obesity is at an all-time high in the United States and&#xD;
      the refractory nature of this disease has led to a serious and challenging conundrum in terms&#xD;
      of how to provide effective, safe, scalable, and durable treatments without placing undue&#xD;
      strain on the healthcare system. Clinical practice guidelines recommend behavioral&#xD;
      interventions as the primary strategy for all ages and classes of obesity - moderate to&#xD;
      severe. In 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released updated screening&#xD;
      recommendations concluding that comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions with a&#xD;
      total of ≥26 contact hours over a period of 2-12 months resulted in weight loss in youth with&#xD;
      obesity, with ≥52 contact hours leading to even greater weight loss and improvements in some&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the practicality of delivering these types of intensive behavioral services to the&#xD;
      millions of youth with severe obesity in the U.S. is debatable not only because of the&#xD;
      treatment-resistant nature of severe obesity, but also due to the time-commitment,&#xD;
      acceptability, and sustainability of this approach for adolescent patients and their families&#xD;
      along with the extensive resources required to provide these interventions. Indeed, fewer&#xD;
      than 50% of pediatric patients referred for weight management services enroll in treatment,&#xD;
      and high attrition rates of up to 50% have been reported in behavioral-based clinical trials&#xD;
      and in the clinical setting. Moreover, adherence to behavioral counseling significantly&#xD;
      diminishes over time, which too often erodes early weight loss success and ultimately derails&#xD;
      durability. The reality of what most patients/families are able to do and the unique&#xD;
      physiological and psychosocial features of severe obesity in adolescence do not seem to align&#xD;
      well with the degree of intensity of behavioral interventions shown to be effective by the&#xD;
      USPSTF. Therefore, a critical appraisal of the feasibility, effectiveness, and sustainability&#xD;
      of the USPSTF recommendations among adolescents with severe obesity is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While behavior change is an indispensable component of any effective weight loss approach,&#xD;
      adjunctive strategies such as pharmacotherapy may enhance outcomes in adolescents with severe&#xD;
      obesity. Many maladaptive behaviors attributed to obesity are driven by underlying biological&#xD;
      forces, such as increased appetite and food palatability, that are largely beyond the control&#xD;
      of the individual. Pharmacotherapy can help facilitate behavior change by disrupting core&#xD;
      pathophysiological processes and restoring homeostasis to the energy regulatory system,&#xD;
      therein enabling individuals to sustain healthy behavior change. Though under-explored as a&#xD;
      treatment for adolescent obesity, pharmacotherapy along with relatively low-intensity&#xD;
      behavioral counseling (&lt;26 contact hours) represents a potentially effective, durable, and&#xD;
      safe treatment strategy. This approach may be more practical and feasible to implement on a&#xD;
      broad scale, be preferred by patients/families, utilize fewer healthcare resources, and cost&#xD;
      less to deliver compared to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions.&#xD;

      This is a two-arm, randomized clinical trial in adolescents with severe obesity evaluating 52&#xD;
      weeks of intensive behavioral counseling, aligned with USPSTF recommendations (52 contact&#xD;
      hours), vs. 52 weeks of medical management with semaglutide (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor&#xD;
      agonist) plus relatively low-intensity behavioral counseling (12 contact hours).&#xD;
