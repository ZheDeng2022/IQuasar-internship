  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTI) are commonly encountered in children, with 7% diagnosed with&#xD;
      at least one UTI by the age of 19 years. The evidence for treatment of uncomplicated UTI is&#xD;
      clear; oral antibiotics are as good as intravenous (IV) antibiotics, usually for a total of 7&#xD;
      days. Complicated UTIs (cUTIs) on the other hand, are common reasons for hospital admissions&#xD;
      for IV antibiotics and constitute a major burden for healthcare systems. There is&#xD;
      considerable variation in care for children who present with UTI and have complicating&#xD;
      features such as vomiting, dehydration, urological abnormalities or have a previous history&#xD;
      of UTI. Australian and international guidelines lack clear, evidence-based recommendations to&#xD;
      guide treatment in this group. Without gold standard evidence, these children will continue&#xD;
      to receive unnecessary IV antibiotics, longer hospital stays and poorer health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicentre, non-inferiority randomised trial will investigate if a single dose of IV&#xD;
      antibiotics and switching early to oral antibiotics is as good as 3 days of IV antibiotics.&#xD;
      In other words, this study will compare if a single dose of IV antibiotics plus two days oral&#xD;
      antibiotics (Early Switch) is as clinically effective as 3 days IV antibiotics in resolving&#xD;
      UTI symptoms at 72 hours after the first dose of IV antibiotics, for complicated UTIs in&#xD;
      children presenting to the Emergency Department (ED). All participants will receive a total&#xD;
      of 7 days of antibiotics for the complicated urinary tract infection. If 1 dose and early&#xD;
      switch to oral antibiotics is found to be as good as 3 days, the duration of IV antibiotics&#xD;
      for complicated UTI can be reduced along with avoidance of the inherent risks of unnecessary&#xD;
      hospital admission by administering a single IV dose in an outpatient/ED setting. On the&#xD;
      other hand if a single IV dose results in prolonged symptoms or treatment failure, this will&#xD;
      inform practice for the proportion of children who have a single dose of IV antibiotics in&#xD;
      the ED and are sent home on oral antibiotics. Regardless of the outcome, this trial will&#xD;
      inform clinical practice for complicated UTI to improve health outcomes for this group.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open label, multi-centre, pragmatic, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will incorporate a two-arm, non-inferiority design with parallel groups and 1:1 allocation&#xD;
      of children with â‰¥3 complicated features of UTI presenting to the ED in whom clinicians deem&#xD;
      parenteral antibiotics are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare whether Early switch - single dose of IV&#xD;
      plus 2 days oral antibiotics is as clinically effective (non-inferior) in resolving UTI&#xD;
      symptoms at 72 hours after the first IV dose, as 3 days IV for complicated urinary tract&#xD;
      infections presenting to the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early switch: Single dose IV to cover Gram negative bacteria followed by 2 days oral&#xD;
      antibiotics with or without Single dose IV to cover Enterococcus spp followed by 2 days oral&#xD;
      antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-days IV: 3 days IV to cover Gram negative bacteria with or without 3 days IV antibiotics to&#xD;
      cover Enterococcus spp&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actual antibiotics used will be based on individual sites, local microbiology and antibiotic&#xD;
      susceptibility data and clinical context. Empiric antibiotics used will cover Gram negative&#xD;
      organisms with or without Enterococcus cover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this trial are to compare the following between the Early switch&#xD;
      and the 3-days IV arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Readmission rates due to persistent fever, vomiting, rigors, or clinical deterioration&#xD;
           (eg poor feeding, dehydration) within 14 days of the initial dose of IV antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Readmission rates due to persistent fever, vomiting, rigors, or clinical deterioration&#xD;
           (eg poor feeding, dehydration) within 1 month of the initial dose of IV antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transfer rate from Hospital in the Home (HITH)/ambulatory care to ward care during&#xD;
           admission within 72 hours of the initial dose of IV antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to resolution of fever, vomiting, rigors within 72 hours of the initial dose of IV&#xD;
           antibiotics as reported by parents/guardian&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement as determined by parents/guardian at 72 hours after the first IV dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antiemetic use for 72 hours from the initial IV antibiotic dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of IV antibiotics (actually received by patient) from the first dose of IV&#xD;
           antibiotics to last dose of IV antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of oral antibiotics (actually received by patient) from the first dose of oral&#xD;
           antibiotics (after IV antibiotics started) to last dose of IV antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total duration of antibiotics: sum of duration of IV antibiotics and oral antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrence of UTI within 14 days from the first dose of IV antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrence of UTI within 1 month from the first dose of IV antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications of UTI from the initial IV antibiotics dose to 14 days after the initial&#xD;
           dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events from the initial IV antibiotics dose to 14 days after the initial dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life (QoL) indicators on Day 1 of IV antibiotics (within 24 hours of initial&#xD;
           IV antibiotics) and after Day 4 (72 hours up to Day 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost-effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up microbiological urine culture after commencing IV antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are eligible for the study will be randomised to receive 1 dose of IV&#xD;
      antibiotics (and 2 days oral antibiotics) or 3 days of IV antibiotics. All participants will&#xD;
      receive a total of 7 days treatment with antibiotics for the complicated urinary tract&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment and randomisation: During ED assessment, clinicians will identify patients with a&#xD;
      suspected UTI and screen patients against eligibility criteria. The relevant clinical team at&#xD;
      each site will receive standardised, study specific education based on centrally developed&#xD;
      study education materials. Presence of the following symptoms/sign will be recorded at&#xD;
      baseline (fever, vomiting, rigors, tachycardia). Participants will be randomised to one of&#xD;
      the 2 arms after written informed consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose of the antibiotics will be commenced in the ED. Care of the patient will be as&#xD;
      per routine clinical care. Decision for admission to hospital and location of treatment&#xD;
      (ambulatory/Hospital-in-the-Home care) will be determined by the treating clinician as per&#xD;
      routine clinical care. Parents will be provided with a thermometer and a diary to record a&#xD;
      daily assessment of their child (fever, rigors, vomiting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Day 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      72 hours after the first dose of IV antibiotics, a research nurse will conduct an assessment&#xD;
      over phone or telehealth to obtain the primary outcome data: Persistence of baseline symptoms&#xD;
      (fever, vomiting, rigors) or development of these symptoms (if not previously present) since&#xD;
      baseline will be documented. Any ambiguity with regards to symptoms being attributable to UTI&#xD;
      will be judged by a blinded clinician external to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Day 14:&#xD;
&#xD;
      14 days after the first dose of IV antibiotics, a research nurse will conduct an assessment&#xD;
      over phone or telehealth for follow up data including whether General Practitioner (GP) or ED&#xD;
      visit or readmission occurred for UTI and total duration of antibiotics taken by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up 1 month:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 month after the first dose of IV antibiotics, a research nurse will conduct an assessment&#xD;
      over phone or telehealth for follow up data including whether GP or ED visit or readmission&#xD;
      occurred for UTI, total duration of antibiotics taken by the patient.&#xD;
