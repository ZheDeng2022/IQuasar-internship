      Military veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) suffer emotionally, physically,&#xD;
      and socially. They have higher rates of suicide,1 issues with anger/aggression,2 substance&#xD;
      use disorder,3 or other life difficulties (e.g., mental health disorders, marriage&#xD;
      instability, unemployment).4 However, current first-line treatments are only effective for&#xD;
      around half of patients receiving treatment.5,6 This is problematic given that PTSD is&#xD;
      relatively common with a lifetime prevalence in US veterans of 10 - 31%3,7 meaning that many&#xD;
      military veterans and their families are suffering for lack of effective treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms can be categorized into four clusters: re-experiencing, avoidance, cognitive or&#xD;
      mood disturbances, and hyperarousal/reactivity.8 Symptoms may occur during the day or at&#xD;
      night, thus disrupting sleep. Many symptoms are thought to be mediated through noradrenergic&#xD;
      pathways. Specifically, noradrenergic overactivity may directly or indirectly affect&#xD;
      irritability/aggression, hypervigilance, ability to concentrate, startle reactions, and sleep&#xD;
      or other nighttime symptoms.9 These nighttime disruptions are especially problematic given&#xD;
      that lack of sleep can exacerbate other PTSD symptoms directly or through associations with&#xD;
      increased depression, heightened anxiety, and unstable mood/affect.10-12 Selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are a first-line pharmacotherapy for PTSD, yet SSRIs do not target&#xD;
      noradrenergic pathways, have reduced efficacy in veterans,13 and only weakly impact nighttime&#xD;
      symptoms.11,14,15&#xD;
&#xD;
      To directly address hyperarousal and sleep, previous studies have tested medications&#xD;
      targeting the noradrenergic pathway or sleep interventions, resulting in promising outcomes&#xD;
      for a subpopulation of veterans with PTSD.16-27 Studies on prazosin, an antagonist of&#xD;
      post-synaptic α1 noradrenergic receptors, have shown promise for veterans with PTSD.16,18&#xD;
      Clonidine is similar to prazosin and is proposed to have similar effects on PTSD; however,&#xD;
      whereas prazosin and blocks the effects of norepinephrine, clonidine decreases norepinephrine&#xD;
      release 28 and could therefore have greater effects on hyperarousal. Retrospective,&#xD;
      open-label studies have suggested that clonidine use is associated with improvement in&#xD;
      PTSD.16,17 However, no prospective studies have been published testing the effects of&#xD;
      clonidine on PTSD, either in veterans or any other population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Veterans prescribed clonidine will demonstrate improvements in PTSD symptoms,&#xD;
      including daytime, nighttime, and sleep-related behaviors.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in PTSD Checklist-Military Version (PCL-5) at 6 weeks into phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 of Current Phase</time_frame>
    <description>Includes 20 items with a severity score range 0-80. Includes the ability to treat each item rated as 2 = &quot;Moderately&quot; or higher as a symptom endorsed, which allows following the DSM-5 diagnostic rule which requires at least: 1 Criterion B item (questions 1-5), 1 Criterion C item (questions 6-7), 2 Criterion D items (questions 8-14), 2 Criterion E items (questions 15-20). In general, use of a cutoff score tends to produce more reliable results than the DSM-5 diagnostic rule.</description>

    <description>The study will use a flexible-dose adjustment schedule to identify the minimum dose needed to alleviate symptoms while also ensuring acceptable adverse effects. In other words, all subjects will start at the minimum dose (0.1 mg/night). Near the end of every week, each subject will be assessed for symptom alleviation and adverse events by asking the patient two questions from the CAPS-5 (questions B2 and E6. At baseline, each patient will have scored a ≥3 on each of these questions. If one or both scores remain at ≥3 and if any reported adverse events are marked acceptable by both the clinician and subject, then the dosage for the following week will be increased one level according to the titration chart. However, if both scores for these questions are ≤2 and any current adverse events are acceptable, then the dosage will remain the same. Finally, if any adverse events are deemed unacceptable, the clonidine dosage will be reduced to the lowest acceptable daily dosage.</description>
