  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      severe coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread which&#xD;
      poses a serious threat to public health. While 80% of the patients are asymptomatic or have a&#xD;
      mild illness, 20% develop a serious illness. Predominant symptoms include fever, cough, and&#xD;
      myalgias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most children have one mild or asymptomatic disease that can be resolved without medical&#xD;
      attention and that, exceptionally, may progress to pneumonia and respiratory failure&#xD;
      requiring hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schools have started the course with strict protocols to prevent the transmission of&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2 among the members of the educational communities and thus avoid an&#xD;
      uncontrollability of the epidemic. These protocols include scaled entrances in the centers&#xD;
      and differentiated circulation to optimize compliance with social distance. They also include&#xD;
      the creation of coexistence groups, the Ventilation of the spaces, hand washing, disinfection&#xD;
      of furniture, and wearing a face mask. One key point in the prevention of infection is the&#xD;
      rapid detection of infected individuals, their isolation immediate and quarantine, and&#xD;
      screening of coexistence groups of positive cases. The diagnosis of Suspicious cases from&#xD;
      both schools and other settings is done with a PCR, mostly in Primary Care Centers (PCC).&#xD;
      This is causing an increased considerable volume of work for primary care centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the overload of the PCCs, the waiting time between sampling and PCR means that&#xD;
      the person must remain at home until the result is obtained, with the negative impact that&#xD;
      this means on the daily lives of students, teachers, and families. The use of a quick test&#xD;
      performed on the own schools and with staff from the center itself trained to do this first&#xD;
      screening would have three very relevant consequences for the system:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Speed up the diagnosis and minimize the waiting time between the presentation of&#xD;
           symptoms and quarantine of the whole group (if positive)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Avoid a waiting time at home with the alteration - often unnecessary - of the day of&#xD;
           students, their families, and school staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Decongest the PCCs, receiving only the cases that need confirmation&#xD;
