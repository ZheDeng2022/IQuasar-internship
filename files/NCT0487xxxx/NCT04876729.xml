  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls and fall-related injuries are major health risks in American Indian elders. The data&#xD;
      showed 52 percent of Zuni elders reporting a fall during the past year, which is&#xD;
      significantly higher than the US national average of one out of three adults older then 65&#xD;
      years. In partnership with Zuni Pueblo leadership and community stake holders, the&#xD;
      feasibility will be reviewed in hopes of implementing Community Health Representative&#xD;
      delivered fall risk screening and evidence-based Otago Exercise Program with physical&#xD;
      therapist consultation to address lack of access to home delivered physical therapy and&#xD;
      health disparity, as well as empower the participants to address fall risk, avert injury, and&#xD;
      preserve aging in place within their community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Native elders are essential to preserving the culture and history of tribal communities, but&#xD;
      fall related injuries can jeopardize their ability to age in place. The Zuni Pueblo is&#xD;
      geographically isolated with limited access to rehabilitative and supportive services. Home&#xD;
      health physical therapy services are unavailable at the Pueblo. Therefore, Zuni elders must&#xD;
      choose between leaving their community and social network for rehabilitative care or remain&#xD;
      in the community with unmet needs, and increased risk of not regaining their prior level of&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to culturally tailor the traditional Physical Therapy delivered Otago&#xD;
      Exercise Program, to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing falls risk and to empower elders&#xD;
      and their families to engage in preventing falls in their community. Native Zuni CHRs will&#xD;
      deliver OEP using novel consultation and telehealth with a Physical Therapist. The CHRs offer&#xD;
      important advantage of speaking Zuni tribal language and understanding Zuni traditions,&#xD;
      family structures, and elders' preferences for receiving health information. The&#xD;
      investigators overall objective is to compare the effectiveness of a CHR delivered,&#xD;
      culturally adapted OEP fall prevention program to the standard of care education based fall&#xD;
      risk management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators disparity driven aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To compare the effectiveness of the adapted OEP to an education-based fall risk&#xD;
      management usual care program in improving strength and balance and reducing falls risk.&#xD;
      Approach: Screen 400 Zuni elders, aged 65yrs and older, to identify 200 elders with elevated&#xD;
      fall risk. Randomize 200 Zuni elders at risk for falls into a 6-month OEP intervention versus&#xD;
      education-based control; Aim: To compare the effectiveness of the adapted OEP to an&#xD;
      education-based fall risk management program in improving overall health status,&#xD;
      self-management of daily activities, and social engagement. Approach: The SF12 Health Survey&#xD;
      and Short Form PROMIS measures Self-Efficacy for Managing Daily Activities and Ability to&#xD;
      Participate in Social Roles and Activities will be administered to all randomized&#xD;
      participants, at baseline and 6 months, and during the final follow up visit at 12 months.&#xD;
