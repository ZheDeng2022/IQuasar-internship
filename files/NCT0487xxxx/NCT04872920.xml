  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, prospective, multinational, multicentre, observational study,&#xD;
      in which data collected are those derived from routine clinical practice via an European&#xD;
      registry on CS: ERCUSYN.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to further document the safety and efficacy of Ketoconazole HRA administered in&#xD;
      routine clinical practice in patients with CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study operates under real clinical practice conditions, i.e. there is no treatment&#xD;
      protocol thus.&#xD;

    <description>self-administered questionnaire of Health-Related Quality of Life to evaluate current health regarding mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, and the perceived health status of the patient.&#xD;
The answers given can be converted into utility scores anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfect health. The questionnaire also includes a Vi-sual Analog Scale (VAS), by which respondents can reporttheir perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0(the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possiblehealth status).</description>

Answers are rated on a scale of 1-5, where '1' corresponds to 'Always' or 'Very much' and '5' to 'Never' or 'Not at all'. Therefore, the lower the score, the greater the impact on Health-Related Quality of Life.</description>
