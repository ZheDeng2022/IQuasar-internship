      This prospective observational study will investigate the correlation of frailty in relation&#xD;
      to serious outcomes. Serious outcomes are defined as: mortality within 30 days, admission to&#xD;
      hospital, length of stay in the Emergency Department(ED), in hospital length of stay and&#xD;
      revisits to the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exposure, frailty, will be assessed according to Clinical Frailty Scale. ED patients &gt;65&#xD;
      years of age in a Swedish regional health care system (Region Östergötland, Sweden)&#xD;
      comprising three EDs in Linköping, Norrköping and Motala. The outcomes will be compared&#xD;
      according to the degree of frailty and censored over 7, 30 and 90 days respectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a common clinical syndrome in older adults that carries an increased risk for poor&#xD;
      health outcomes including falls, incident disability, hospitalization, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical frailty scale (CFS) is a measure of frailty based on clinical judgement in a 9&#xD;
      level scale, categorized as &quot;vulnerable&quot; (1-4), &quot;mildly frail&quot; (5), moderatly frail (6) and&#xD;
      severely and very severely frail (7-8).&quot;. A validation study of the CFS in community-dwelling&#xD;
      older people showed that it performed better than measures of cognition, function or&#xD;
      comorbidity in assessing risk for death. In a prospective observational study including&#xD;
      consecutive ED patients aged 65 years or older The Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated a good&#xD;
      agreement between predicted probability and observed frequency of 30-day mortality and ICU&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study will be to investigate if the fraily, assessed according to CFS, is&#xD;
      associated with increased 30-day mortality. in a Swedish Emergency Care context. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes included 7-and 90-day mortality, ED length of stay, hospital admission, hospital&#xD;
      length of stay, subsequent falls and medication changes. Additionally, we collect data on&#xD;
      morbidity and comorbidities to assess the association with the level of frailty. Since this&#xD;
      is a multicenter study, possible geographic differences will be studied as well. Based on the&#xD;
      results of this study, possible interventions could be identified to improve the care of the&#xD;
      frail geriatric patients presenting at the ED.&#xD;
