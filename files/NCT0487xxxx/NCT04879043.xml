  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and the therapeutic&#xD;
      potential of HDP-101 in patients with plasma cell disorders including multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study will consists of two parts: a Part 1 dose escalation phase and a Part 2a expansion&#xD;
      phase for safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and clinical activity testing. The study will enroll&#xD;
      subjects with relapsed/refractory MM or other plasma cell disorders expressing BCMA. An&#xD;
      adaptive 2-parameter Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) for dose-escalation with&#xD;
      overdose control will be used in the dose-escalation phase for determination of the MTD or&#xD;
      the RP2D. Dose-expansion phase of the study aims to collect preliminary evidence of antitumor&#xD;
      activity and to confirm the safety of the HDP-101 as a monotherapy.&#xD;
