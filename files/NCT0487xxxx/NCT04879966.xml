  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first-line treatment strategy of moderate to severe UC was a important question at issue.&#xD;
      The biological agents had potentiality to alter the disease course of UC. The AGA clinical&#xD;
      guidelines had conditional recommend that IFX and other biological agene migtht be first-line&#xD;
      therapy for high-risk UC patints but only had low grade evidence.We launched this multicenter&#xD;
      prospective cohort trial to compare the efficacy and safety of infliximab (IFX) and&#xD;
      corticosteroids(CS) when they was used as first-line therapy in UC patients.&#xD;
