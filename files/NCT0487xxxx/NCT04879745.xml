  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot trial to assess feasibility and acceptability of MyVoice vs. a patient&#xD;
      pamphlet among female patients ages 18-44 (n=50) who receive rheumatology care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Hypothesis: MyVoice will be feasible and acceptable to patients who receive rheumatology&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot will demonstrate if the MyVoice decision aid can be feasibly and acceptably&#xD;
      implemented into the rheumatology context and inform operational procedures for a future&#xD;
      hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial. Women in the intervention arm will receive the&#xD;
      MyVoice decision aid (n=38). Women in the control arm (n=12) will receive a widely-accessible&#xD;
      paper-based pamphlet about pregnancy, which, similarly to MyVoice, targets women with a broad&#xD;
      range of rheumatic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rheumatologists will have no obligatory actions; however, if one or more of their patients&#xD;
      completed the study, they will be emailed an anonymous survey about their experiences with&#xD;
      the study and related patient encounters. This will occur 2 weeks after the final patient&#xD;
      participant completes the study. Rheumatologists will not be informed by study personnel&#xD;
      which of their patients participated in the study.&#xD;
