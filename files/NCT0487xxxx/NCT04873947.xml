  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a comparative, single-center, non-randomized study conducted to evaluate the&#xD;
      SpO2 accuracy per standards and guidelines identified above for SpO2 accuracy for pulse&#xD;
      oximetry equipment over the range of 70-100% SaO2 under non-motion conditions. Arterial blood&#xD;
      sampling measured by functional SaO2 CO-Oximetry, was used as the basis for comparison.&#xD;
      Testing was conducted under normal office environment conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulse oximetry monitoring is considered a standard physiological measurement and is used by&#xD;
      clinicians in everyday situations to estimate arterial oxygen saturation. A pulse oximeter is&#xD;
      a device that measures the oxygen saturation of arterial blood non-invasively. In general,&#xD;
      pulse oximeters use two wavelength absorption spectrophotometry to measure oxygen saturation&#xD;
      based on the amount of reflected or scattered radiation. The wavelengths are selected to&#xD;
      provide the best separation of absorbencies of oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxy-hemoglobin&#xD;
      (HHb) states. The ratio of the two absorbencies is used to calculate the oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (SpO2) value. Because an arterial sample of blood is not required to make the measurement,&#xD;
      the pulse oximeter can provide non-invasive real time information. The clinical use of pulse&#xD;
      oximeters has reduced the frequency and necessity of invasive arterial blood sampling, and&#xD;
      has helped to improve patient safety by providing information to clinicians about patients'&#xD;
      oxygenation status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the SpO2 accuracy performance of the Belun Ring&#xD;
      Oximeter placed on the index fingers during non-motion conditions over the range of 70-100%&#xD;
      SaO2 to arterial blood samples assessed by CO-Oximetry for an SpO2 validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal, was to show the SpO2 accuracy performance for the investigational device&#xD;
      below. As a secondary goal, the pulse rate accuracy performance for the Belun ring was&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was expected that the Accuracy Root Mean Square (ARMS) performance would meet the required&#xD;
      specification of ARMS 3.5% or lower in non-motion conditions for the range of 70 - 100% SaO2&#xD;
      thereby demonstrating an acceptable SpO2 accuracy performance specification. For the pulse&#xD;
      rate accuracy, the desired goal was to have an accuracy performance of an ARMS of 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No risks or adverse device effects were expected. There were no contraindications for use in&#xD;
      the proposed study / study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in accordance to the code of federal regulations for non-significant&#xD;
      medical device studies and applicable ISO 14155 (2nd edition 2011-02-01), applicable sections&#xD;
      of ISO 80601-2-61, second edition 2017-12, Corrected version 2018-02, and Pulse Oximeters -&#xD;

    <description>Subjects were given medical grade mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen to induce stable plateaus across the range of 100% to 70%. The goal was to have an equal distribution of data by decade. The stable plateaus allowed data collection in the following SaO2 ranges 95-100, 90-95, 85-90, 80-85, 75-80, 70-75. In general, 4 to 8 discrete points were collected at each of the levels.</description>
