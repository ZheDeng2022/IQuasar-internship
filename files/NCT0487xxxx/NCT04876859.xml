    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, multi-center, double-blinded, randomized study designed to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of Conventional Radiofrequency (CRF) and the anesthetic block of the&#xD;
      anterior sensory branches to the hip to control pain and improve function related to hip&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective, double-blinded (participant and outcome assessor) clinical trial was&#xD;
      designed to investigate the results of the intervention Continuous Radiofrequency (CRF) in&#xD;
      the treatment of participants with chronic hip pain secondary to hip osteoarthritis.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized in a 2-arm, parallel groups. The intervention group will be&#xD;
      submitted to an anesthetic block of the sensory branches of femoral and obturator nerves to&#xD;
      the hip, with 1 ml of 1% lidocaine with 1ml of steroid (Betamethasone Dipropionate 5 mg/ml +&#xD;
      Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate 2 mg/ml) for each branch, followed by denervation with CRF&#xD;
      (22¬gauge 5¬mm active tip cannula, 10cm in length) with the tip temperature set at 90° C in a&#xD;
      single cycle of 90 min. The sham group will be submitted to the same anesthetic block,&#xD;
      followed by a simulation of CRF use. The surgeon performing the procedures will only be&#xD;
      informed of the randomization after completing the anesthetic block on the participants to&#xD;
      avoid bias at its accuracy. Participants will be evaluated at four follow-up: before&#xD;
      intervention and after 1, 12, and 24 weeks, to access the Western Ontario and McMaster&#xD;
      Universities score (WOMAC) as the primary outcome.&#xD;

    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) is a self-administered health status measure and consists of 24 items divided into three domains, which are pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), and physical function (17 questions), validated to patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis, available in a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 96 points.This questionnaire is translated and validated in portuguese.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 12 weeks ± 1 week and 24 weeks ± 1 week.</time_frame>
    <description>The pain visual analogue scale (VAS) is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity, in a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line, 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme, &quot;no pain&quot; (score 0) and &quot; worst pain ever&quot; (score 100).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 12 weeks ± 1 week and 24 weeks ± 1 week.</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score (HHS) is a joint-specific measure, and it consists of two sections: questions and a physical examination, including a range of motion and deformity items. The score has a maximum of 100 points with a maximum of 44 points for pain, 47 for function, 4 points for absence of deformity, and 5 points for a range of motion. The highest score of 100 points indicates the best function and no pain.</description>
