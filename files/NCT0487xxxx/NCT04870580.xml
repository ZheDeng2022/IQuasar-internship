      [18F]fluorodopa (3, 4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine/ FDOPA) is an amino acid PET&#xD;
      tracer originally developed for brain imaging in patients with movement disorders but has&#xD;
      been found to be useful in brain tumour imaging. [18F]fluorodopa has been demonstrated to be&#xD;
      predominantly transported by the L-type amino acid transporter without significant uptake&#xD;
      into surrounding normal brain parenchyma with the exception of the basal ganglia. Assessing&#xD;
      the feasibility of performing PET guided histopathology in a single and multi-site setting&#xD;
      will be crucial in order to use PET as a planning tool for brain biopsy to detect high-grade&#xD;
      transformation in low-grade gliomas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioma is a cancer of unmet need, where survival trends have not significantly changed for&#xD;
      decades. The distinction between high-grade (HGG) and low-grade glioma (LGG) is important as&#xD;
      both entities confer different prognoses and management strategies. This distinction is&#xD;
      normally made on biopsy sampling and conventional imaging. However, sampling errors are not&#xD;
      uncommon due to the heterogeneous nature of glioma. Case series have described under-grading&#xD;
      of gliomas on biopsy in 28% to 63% of cases. Furthermore, up to one third of high-grade&#xD;
      gliomas may not display the typical imaging characteristics (enhancement) of a high-grade&#xD;
      glioma. Therefore, more accurate imaging may help to make this distinction and guide biopsy&#xD;
      and clinical management decisions at the outset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been growing interest in the use of amino acid PET in glioma imaging. Transport of&#xD;
      amino acids across the blood brain barrier and low physiological levels of tracer uptake&#xD;
      within the brain allow for good tumour visualisation. The most frequently used amino acid PET&#xD;
      tracers described in clinical literature are [11C]methionine, [18F]fluoroethyltyrosine and&#xD;
      [18F]fluorodopa, which predominantly reflect leucine transport, being mainly transported by&#xD;
      LAT1, a high affinity leucine transporter. Alongside depiction of tumour volume, described&#xD;
      roles of amino acid PET include differentiation of true disease progression from pseudo&#xD;
      progression, detection of residual disease in the post-surgical patient, biopsy guidance and&#xD;
      prognostication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale The primary objective of the study will be to establish the feasibility of&#xD;
      performing [18F]fluorodopa PET guided histopathology in a single and multi-site setting.&#xD;
      Basic tumour characterisation (for example Ki67 expression and detection of IDH mutations)&#xD;
      will be undertaken.&#xD;
