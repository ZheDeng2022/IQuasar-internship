    <textblock>
      This study aims to verify the clinical value of thyroid ultrasound with microvascular flow&#xD;
      imaging in thyrotoxic patients for differential diagnosis between hyperthyroidism and&#xD;
      thyroiditis. We intend to use the RS85 Ultrasound device manufactured by Samsung Medison.&#xD;
      Graves' disease and painless thyroiditis/subacute thyroiditis are the main cause of&#xD;
      thyrotoxicosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precise discrimination between Graves' disease and painless thyroiditis/subacute thyroiditis&#xD;
      is clinically very important in determining treatment methods, such as the prescription of&#xD;
      antithyroid drugs. Primary endpoint was to verify the value of vascularity index, defined by&#xD;
      Blood pixel in range of image / Total pixel in range of image .Seondary endpoint was to&#xD;
      verify the superiority value of Microvascular flow imaging to discriminate thyrotoxicosis&#xD;
      patients compared with Color doppler/ Power doppler ultrasound imaging and conventional&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging.&#xD;

      Thyrotoxicosis refers to the appearance of various clinical symptoms or signs due to and&#xD;
      excessive increase of thyroid hormone in the body. Graves' disease, which causes&#xD;
      thyrotoxicosis, is one of the most common autoimmune diseases and is known to account for&#xD;
      0.5% of the population. Precise discrimination between Graves' disease and painless&#xD;
      thyroiditis/subacute thyroiditis is clinically very important in determining treatment&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Microvascular flow imaging technology is expected to show higher sensitivity and accuracy&#xD;
      than conventional color Doppler images in differentiating patients between Graves' disease&#xD;
      and painless thyroiditis/subacute thyroiditis. We enrolled thyrotoxicosis patients in their&#xD;
      initial presentation and used RS85 Ultrasound device manufactured by Samsung Medison to&#xD;
      discriminate Graves' disease and painless thyroiditis/subacute thyroiditis. Power / Color&#xD;
      doppler ultrasound imaging and conventional ultrasound imaging were used. Tranverse and&#xD;
      longitudinal plane of the dominant lobe were selected for imaging. Doppler Adler's method was&#xD;
      used to asscess vascularization. To assess the vascularity index, which is defined by Blood&#xD;
      pixel in range of image / Total pixel in range of image, we selected the total tranverse&#xD;
      plane of the thyroid as range of image.&#xD;
