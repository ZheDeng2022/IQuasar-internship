  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Triple P program is a comprehensive system of parenting and family support of multilevel&#xD;
      preventive intervention, developed for families with members up to 16 years of age, whose&#xD;
      objective is to improve parenting skills and prevent or modify dysfunctional parenting&#xD;
      practices, thus reducing Family risk factors that affect both child abuse, behavioral&#xD;
      problems and emotional problems.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Based on the importance that evidence-based parental interventions have acquired and the need&#xD;
      from the health field to provide innovative alternatives that facilitate access to this type&#xD;
      of services, parental support programs given through the web emerge. There is evidence that&#xD;
      supports the idea that parenting programs taught through the web have an influence on&#xD;
      reducing disruptive behaviors in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triple P Online (TPOL) is an adaptation of the Positive Parenting Program, Triple P, a&#xD;
      program that has been empirically tested. This adaptation is a parental intervention through&#xD;
      the web with self-directed modality, which is based on Level 4 of the Triple P parental&#xD;
      program and is configured in 8 interactive sessions with online modules. The topics covered&#xD;
      are: 1) What is Positive Parenting, 2) Reinforcing the behavior we want, 3) Teaching new&#xD;
      skills, 4) Managing negative behaviors, 5) Managing disobedience, 6) Preventing problems&#xD;
      through planning, 7) Making fun outings, 8) Raising confident and competent children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main results observed in the implementation of the online Triple P program are (Sanders&#xD;
      et al, 2012): reduction of problem child behavior, dysfunctional parenting styles, increasing&#xD;
      parents' confidence in their parenting role, and reduction of parental anger.&#xD;

    <measure>Acceptability of the program by parents/main caregivers using the Acceptability Scale (AS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Inmediately Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire exploring the acceptability of the program will be answered by parents/main caregivers of students attending Grade 1 to Grade 4, Primary school, who will participate in the intervention. This questionnaire asks about the parents´opinions about the content of the intervention, strategies used, materials, and performance of the health professional helping in the intervention.The latter is only applicable for parents participating in &quot;Group Triple-p online with professional support&quot;. The questionnaire also asks about satisfaction and the helpfulness of the program to improve parenting management. For each statement, the answers can go from 1=Strongly disagree to 5=Strongly agree. A high score means higher acceptably and satisfacción with the program. This is a questionnaire created by the research team.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of the program using the Feasibility Inventory (FI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A register will be used to determine the number of schools initially contacted and the number of schools that accepted to participate; number of parents/main caregivers contacted and that consented and assented to participate in the study at baseline and at follow-up; the number of sessions completed by parents in the platform, the number of telephone contacts delivered by the health professionals, the number of meeting over the phone conducted with parents. This Feasibility Inventory (FI) was created by the research team. This registry will not produce a score, rather it will provide indicators to achievements for several areas of the implementation of the program.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parenting Scale (PS)</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>This 30-item questionnaire measures three dysfunctional discipline styles: Laxness (permissive discipline), Over-reactivity (authoritarian discipline, anger, meanness and irritability) and Verbosity (long reprimands or reliance on talking). The scale has good test-retest reliability (r = .83, .82, and .79, respectively) and has been found to discriminate between parents of clinic and nonclinic children; and to correlate with observational measures of dysfunctional discipline. Each item is answered in a scale of 7 points, according to what are the typical behavior parent perform under each scenario. A total score is computed, ranging from 30 to 210. A high score means parents are choosing more effective strategies to deal with different scenarios.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parenting Task Checklist (PTC)</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>This checklist assesses parents' confidence in successfully dealing with 14 difficult child behaviors like whining and temper tantrums (Behavior Self-efficacy), and in dealing with difficult behavior in 14 different settings such as shopping and having visitors (Setting Self-efficacy).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>The APQ measures five dimensions of parenting that are relevant to the etiology and treatment of child externalizing problems: (1) positive involvement with children, (2) supervision and monitoring, (3) use of positive discipline techniques, (4) consistency in the use of such discipline and (5) use of corporal punishment. The project will use the dimensions (1), (3), and (4)., and it will not use the dimension of &quot;(2) supervision and monitoring&quot; because it is not relevant for the target population; and &quot;(5) use of corporal punishment&quot; because it is not the focus of the intervention. The parent form will be used. This questionnaire has 22 items. Each statement is answered from 1= Never to 4 = Often. The score ranges from 22 to 44. a High scores means better parenting skills.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 25-item SDQ measures perceptions of prosocial and difficult behaviors in children aged 3-16 years. It has good test-retest reliability (r = .85) and has been found to discriminate well between low-risk and high-risk samples. Five scale scores are computed: Emotional Symptoms, Conduct Problems, Inattention/Hyperactivity, Peer Problems, and Prosocial Behavior. The first four sub-scales are included into one scleras of &quot;Total Difficulties&quot;.&#xD;
Each item is answered from 0=Not true to 2=Certainly true. The score of each sub-scale ranges from 0 to 10. In the case of the Total Difficulties scale, Emotional symptoms sub-scale, Conduct Problems sub-scale, Inattention/Hyperactivity sub-scale, and Peer Problems sub-scale, a high score means more symptoms. In the cae of the Prosocial Behavior scale, a high score means stronger prosocial skills.</description>

The follow-up and contact with the families will be carried out by phone and through a weekly email-type messaging system, implemented within the same platform on which the program material is found</description>
