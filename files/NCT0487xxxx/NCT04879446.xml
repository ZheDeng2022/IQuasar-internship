  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, concentrated growth factor obtained by centrifuging the patient's own blood&#xD;
      and advanced platelet-rich fibrin liquids were applied to the implant cavity and surface.&#xD;
      Thus, it was aimed to ensure that the osseointegration process would start earlier by&#xD;
      ensuring a faster arrival of growth factor and healing mediators in the region, and thus, the&#xD;
      time waited for the osseointegration process and the loading of the superstructure would be&#xD;
      shortened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this split-mouth study, a total of 32 patients including two separate study groups in&#xD;
      different patients and a control group were included. While the CGF liquid was applied to the&#xD;
      implant cavities and surfaces prepared in the study group of 16 patients, A-PRF liquid was&#xD;
      applied to the study group of the other 16 patients. Conventional implant application was&#xD;
      performed in the control groups of both groups. The torque values during the implantation&#xD;
      were also recorded, and Resonance Frequency measurements were performed immediately after&#xD;
      implantation with the Penguin RFA device and at postoperative weeks 2, 4, 6 and 12.&#xD;

      This study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration on 32 patients who&#xD;
      applied to Hatay Mustafa Kemal University Faculty of Dentistry Department of Oral and&#xD;
      Maxillofacial Surgery to have dental implants in order to fix their missing teeth. 2 implants&#xD;
      with appropriate sizes and diameters were applied to each patient according to the condition&#xD;
      of the recipient bone in order to ensure standardization. It was aimed to ensure that the&#xD;
      primary stabilization of the implant would not be affected locally by applying implants to&#xD;
      the sites with similar bone density. The implants were placed symmetrically to the right and&#xD;
      left of the midline by the same physician provided that they were in the same jaw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some conditions were required for the inclusion of patients in the study, which were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having no systemic disorder,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not being pregnant or breastfeeding,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having no smoking habit,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of continuous drug use due to chronic disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No infection in the implant site and adjacent teeth,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No previous implant or any augmentation procedure in the implant site,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate bone height and thickness of the implant site,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient's acceptance and signing the informed consent form specific to study&#xD;
           describing the aim, duration, advantages and possible complications of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the inclusion criteria in the study, no distinction was made between men and women, and&#xD;
      the patients without these criteria were not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluating the effects of advanced platelet-rich fibrin and concentrated growth&#xD;
      factor liquids on dental implant osseointegration was planned as a randomized, clinical&#xD;
      controlled and prospective study. A total of 32 patients included in this study were divided&#xD;
      into two groups of 16. It was planned to apply 2 implants to each patient and to evaluate&#xD;
      each patient as one side as the control and the other as the study group. In other words,&#xD;
      while there was a study group and a control group in the CGF group, there was also a study&#xD;
      group and a control group in the A-PRF group. In the first group, it was planned to wash the&#xD;
      surface of one of the implants to be applied and the inside of the socket where the implant&#xD;
      would be placed with the CGF liquid obtained by centrifuging the patient's own blood, and to&#xD;
      apply a standard implant procedure without any application to the socket and surface of the&#xD;
      other implant to be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second group, the surface of the implant in the study group the inside of the socket&#xD;
      where the implant would be placed were washed with the A-PRF liquid obtained by centrifuging&#xD;
      the patient's own blood, and standard conventional implant procedure was applied without any&#xD;
      application to the implant socket and surface in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining the CGF Liquid:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sterile, single use, anticoagulant-free tube (Vacutest®, Arzergrande-Italy), syringe sets for&#xD;
      taking blood, skin disinfectant, centrifuge device produced suitable for tubes (MEDIFUGE,&#xD;
      Italy), and a special sterile container for obtaining the serum part of the concentrated&#xD;
      growth factor were used for the preparation of the concentrated growth factor. 2 x 9 cc.&#xD;
      venous blood samples taken intravenously from the patients were placed in the centrifuge&#xD;
      machine in tubes without shaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By operating the centrifuge in CGF mode, the device accelerated with an acceleration of 30&#xD;
      seconds and was centrifuged for 2 minutes at 2700 rpm, 4 minutes at 2400 rpm, 4 minutes at&#xD;
      2700 rpm and 3 minutes at 3000 rpm, and then the device stopped with an acceleration of 36&#xD;
      seconds. The process and periods of change of all this turnover rate are automatically&#xD;
      adjusted by the device. After the centrifugation process, 3 layers occur in the tube. These&#xD;
      layers were platelet-poor plasma layer at the top, red blood cell layer at the bottom, and&#xD;
      concentrated growth factor layer in the middle, respectively. The concentrated growth factor&#xD;
      formed was separated from the red blood cell layer in the lower layer with the help of&#xD;
      scissors by holding it with the help of a hemostat. However, during the separation process,&#xD;
      the part containing CD34+ stem cells was kept below the concentrated growth factor. Then, the&#xD;
      CGF was placed in a special sterile perforated container, pressed in the container and turned&#xD;
      into a membrane. Thus, the serum part of CGF was obtained by means of the holes in the&#xD;
      container.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining the A-PRF Liquid:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sterile, single use, anticoagulant-free A-PRF tube, centrifuge device Duo centrifuge (Process&#xD;
      for PRF, France) produced suitable for these tubes, and a special sterile container for&#xD;
      obtaining the serum part of the A-PRF were used for the preparation of the A-PRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2x10 cc. venous blood samples taken intravenously from the patients were placed in the&#xD;
      centrifuge device without shaking, and centrifugation was set at 1300 rpm for 14 minutes.&#xD;
      While the A-PRF clot formed after the centrifugation was separated from the lower red blood&#xD;
      cell layer with the help of a hemostat, attention was paid not to remove this layer&#xD;
      completely. Then, this fibrin clot was pressed in a special sterile perforated contained and&#xD;
      A-PRF liquid was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgical procedures were performed as a double-blind study by the same surgical team.&#xD;
      After providing local anesthesia in the region, a crestal incision was made in the area to be&#xD;
      implanted using a scalpel number 15, and then, full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was&#xD;
      removed. After the study and control groups were randomly determined, the implant socket was&#xD;
      prepared in appropriate size and diameter according to the surgical kit of the implant system&#xD;
      (Nucleoss T6, Turkey). In the study group of the concentrated growth factor, the surface of&#xD;
      the implant and the socket where the implant would be placed were washed with the CGF liquid&#xD;
      and placed in the implant socket without deterioration of sterility (Figure 2). The implant&#xD;
      in the control group was placed in its socket with the standard implant procedure without any&#xD;
      procedure. Similarly, the implants were placed in their sockets as stated above in the study&#xD;
      and control groups of the advanced platelet-rich fibrin. After all the implants in the study&#xD;
      and control groups were placed in the socket, the adjustable ratchet torque on the carrying&#xD;
      piece on it placed in 1 mm subcrestal position with a wrench in the buccal and&#xD;
      lingual/palatinal area. Thus, torque values were also recorded. The ratchet wrench measuring&#xD;
      torque values in the range of 10-50 N specially produced by Nucleoss company was used for&#xD;
      this study. After the implant application, a suitable healing cap was placed on all implants&#xD;
      and the wound edges were sutured with mucoperiosteal flap 3-0 silk suture so that the healing&#xD;
      caps would not be covered. The patients were recommended to apply a cold compress after the&#xD;
      surgical procedure. After the operation, Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid 1 g (Augmentin) one&#xD;
      tablet twice a day for 7 days, Analgesic and anti-inflammatory Dexketoprofen 25 mg (Arveles)&#xD;
      one tablet twice a day for 5 days, and 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash (Kloroben) 3 times a day&#xD;
      were prescribed. The patients were informed about the points to be considered after the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resonance Frequency Analysis Measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Penguin Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA) (Integration Diagnostics Sweden AB) device and&#xD;
      MulTipeg, a transducer suitable for the implant the investigators would place, were used to&#xD;
      obtain the Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ) values of the implants by resonance frequency&#xD;
      analysis and to evaluate their stability. With the help of a MulTipeg carrier, it was&#xD;
      tightened and placed on the implant until resistance was encountered (manual tightening&#xD;
      torque of approximately 3-5 Ncm). During the use of Penguin, measurement is made without&#xD;
      touching the tip of the probe to the MulTipeg, therefore, it does not require any contact.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is completely non-invasive and the patient does not feel anything during the&#xD;
      measurement, which takes a few seconds. The stability is indicated on the implant by the ISQ&#xD;
      value. RFA values were measured for a total of 5 times, namely immediately after implantation&#xD;
      and at postoperative weeks 2, 4, 6 and 12. In order to obtain the ISQ value, the arithmetic&#xD;
      mean of the numerical values obtained by measuring the mesio-distal and bucco-lingual total&#xD;
      five times in two directions perpendicular to each other was recorded as ISQ unit.&#xD;
