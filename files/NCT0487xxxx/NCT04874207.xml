  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regorafenib has demonstrated a significant benefit in overall survival in metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. However, more than 50% of patients had severe adverse&#xD;
      events (grade 3-4), leading to temporary or definitive discontinuation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RePERSO study proposes to adapt the regorafenib dose regimen taking into account firstly&#xD;
      the measurement of sum of metabolites M-2 and M-5 and secondly the occurrence of toxicity&#xD;
      during treatment. This treatment personalization through therapeutic drug monitoring&#xD;
      pharmacological dosing optimization strategy aims at validating the proof of concept of&#xD;
      regorafenib therapeutic drug monitoring and at improving the benefit in OS in patients, using&#xD;
      the previously defined Csum therapeutic range.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regorafenib has demonstrated in two multicenter phase III randomized clinical trials a&#xD;
      significant benefit in overall survival (OS) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients&#xD;
      treated with regorafenib at 160mg/day 3 weeks/4 (3w/4). However, more than 50% of patients&#xD;
      had severe adverse events (grade 3-4), leading to temporary or definitive discontinuation of&#xD;
      treatment in 2/3 of the patients and a reduction of the dosing in 20% of them. Thus, a part&#xD;
      of the therapeutic failures could be explained by an insufficient exposure to regorafenib&#xD;
      because of an early toxicity potentially linked to an initial overexposure. The recent&#xD;
      randomized phase II ReDOS study has shown that a gradual increase in the dose of regorafenib&#xD;
      (from 80 mg to 160 mg/day 3w/4) led to a significantly greater proportion of patients&#xD;
      starting a third cycle of regorafenib and showed a trend toward improvement in overall&#xD;
      survival of patients when compared to the standard administration schedule (160 mg/day 3&#xD;
      w/4). These results favored the dose-escalation strategy. However, due to the low correlation&#xD;
      between dose and concentration, a concentration-controlled study might be of better&#xD;
      relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regorafenib pharmacokinetics is characterized by a hepatic metabolism leading to the&#xD;
      production of two main pharmacologically active metabolites (M-2 and M-5) that may induce&#xD;
      therapeutic and adverse effects. The production of these metabolites shows a large&#xD;
      inter-individual variability. Pharmacokinetic data from phase III studies have suggested the&#xD;
      existence of a relationship between exposure to regorafenib and its metabolites and the&#xD;
      occurrence of some therapeutic and adverse effects. In an ancillary pharmacokinetic study of&#xD;
      the phase II prospective TEXCAN study in which regorafenib was evaluated in its mCRC&#xD;
      indication, it was shown a major benefit in OS in patients with an accumulation of M-2&#xD;
      between the first (C1) and the second (C2) cycle of regorafenib (M2 C2/C1). A significant&#xD;
      correlation between M-2 C2/C1 ratio and the sum of trough concentrations of regorafenib, M-2&#xD;
      and M-5 measured at D15C1 (C Sum (Rego+M-2+M-5)) was found, which could be a pharmacological&#xD;
      marker of efficacy, earlier than the M-2 C2/C1 ratio. The assessment of the relationship&#xD;
      between C Sum and in OS according to a Restricted Cubic Spline analysis showed that the&#xD;
      benefit is optimal for a concentration between 2.5 mg/L and 5.5 mg/L (median OS of 10.6&#xD;
      months versus 3.3 and 4.0 months in patients with a concentration &lt;2.5 mg/L and ≥5.5 mg/L,&#xD;
      respectively). The rate of serious adverse events was also lower in the group in the range&#xD;
      [≥2.5; &lt;5.5 mg/L] (0% vs 43% and 20% respectively). This interval seems to allow limiting the&#xD;
      severe toxicities that cause treatment discontinuations and/or early progressions that could&#xD;
      explain the over-risk of death when the concentrations are outside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RePERSO study proposes to adapt the regorafenib dose regimen taking into account firstly&#xD;
      the measurement of Csum and secondly the occurrence of toxicity during treatment. This&#xD;
      treatment personalization through therapeutic drug monitoring pharmacological dosing&#xD;
      optimization strategy aims at validating the proof of concept of regorafenib therapeutic drug&#xD;
      monitoring and at improving the benefit in OS in patients, using the previously defined Csum&#xD;
      therapeutic range.&#xD;
