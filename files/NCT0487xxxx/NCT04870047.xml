          2. Subject has a saccular, unruptured or recanalized intracranial aneurysm. The subject&#xD;
             may also have a previous ruptured aneurysm, provided rupture of this aneurysm 30 days&#xD;
             from the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is intended to be treated for only one target aneurysm during the index&#xD;
             procedure except for segmental disease (multiple aneurysms located on the same&#xD;
             arterial segment aimed to be treated with one investigational device or&#xD;
             investigational telescopic devices).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has already been selected for flow diversion therapy as the appropriate&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a target intracranial aneurysm (IA) that has a parent vessel with diameter&#xD;
             1.5-5.0 mm distal/proximal to the target IA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has a mRS ≤ 2 before the procedure, as determined by a certified assessor&#xD;
             independent of the index procedure.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Subject with target aneurysm previously treated with a stent or flow diverter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is expected to be treated for another aneurysm during the 30 days following&#xD;
             the index procedure.&#xD;

             in accordance with device IFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject who has undergone stenting of the ipsilateral carotid artery within 3 months&#xD;
             of the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Known serious sensitivity to radiographic contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Known sensitivity to nickel, titanium metals, or their alloys.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject already enrolled in other clinical trials (including COATING study) that would&#xD;
             interfere with study endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Known renal failure as defined by a serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl (or 220 μmol/l) or&#xD;
             glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject who has a contraindication to MRI or angiography for whatever reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject with a comorbid disease or condition that would confound the neurological and&#xD;
             functional evaluations or compromise survival or ability to complete follow-up&#xD;
             assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject with any known allergy to heparin, ASA or other antiplatelet medications.&#xD;
