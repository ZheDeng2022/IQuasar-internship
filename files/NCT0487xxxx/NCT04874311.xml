      This is a two multicenter, prospective, open-labeled, 2-arm, non-comparative randomized (2:1)&#xD;
      phase II trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients satisfying eligibility criteria will first be stratified into 2 strata / subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients with an inflamed tumor (i.e. TLS+, defined as&#xD;
           presence of mature tertiary lymphoid structures, as per IHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Soft-tissue sarcoma patients with a cold tumor (i.e. TLS-, defined as absence of mature&#xD;
           tertiary lymphoid structures, as per IHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Note: TLS+ and TLS- account for 20% and 80% of STS patients, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STS patients with TLS+ will be randomized between arm A (bintrafusp alfa combined with&#xD;
      doxorubicin for 6 cycles, followed by bintrafusp alfa maintenance) and arm B (doxorubicin for&#xD;
      6 cycles) with two patients randomized in arm A for one patient randomized in arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STS patients with TLS- will be randomized between arm C (bintrafusp alfa combined with&#xD;
      doxorubicin for 6 cycles, followed by bintrafusp alfa maintenance) and arm D (doxorubicin for&#xD;
      6 cycles) with two patients randomized in arm C for one patient randomized in arm D.&#xD;
