  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to &quot;demographic change&quot;, the composition of the population in Germany is changing. The&#xD;
      consequence of this change is a population that is getting older on average. A key challenge&#xD;
      is the appropriate nursing and medical care of older people in senior residences and care&#xD;
      facilities. The increasing workload for nursing staff and doctors in the outpatient sector&#xD;
      means that timely care for patients, e.g. in the form of GP visits, cannot always be&#xD;
      guaranteed in a timely manner. The results are unnecessary or premature hospital admissions&#xD;
      as well as ambulance and emergency care interventions, even though in many cases it is not an&#xD;
      acute or even life-threatening event. Furthermore, it has been scientifically proven that&#xD;
      hospital admissions can increase the risk of patients becoming confused. The aim of this&#xD;
      project is to avoid unnecessary hospital admissions and to enable patients to remain in their&#xD;
      familiar surroundings as far as this appears medically justifiable. At the same time, the&#xD;
      study aims to improve the medical care of nursing home residents through better networking of&#xD;
      medical areas, the use of tele-consultations and an early warning system.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Optimal@NRW project represents a new cross-sectoral approach to the acute care and&#xD;
      support of geriatric people in need of care through the implementation of an early warning&#xD;
      system and the integration of a telemedical consultation system in 25 nursing homes in the&#xD;
      region of Aachen in Germany. The project focuses on restructuring emergency care in nursing&#xD;
      homes and improving cooperation between the actors involved (emergency service, emergency&#xD;
      department, general practitioners, nursing staff, etc.). Accordingly, a central emergency&#xD;
      number of the statutory health insurance funds is to act as a virtual hub for the care of&#xD;
      geriatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concrete approach of the project is that the participating nursing homes first contact&#xD;
      the medical call centre (116 117) in case of a medical problem. The call centre is then&#xD;
      responsible for an initial medical assessment and decides whether the respective GP can be&#xD;
      called in or whether a teleconsultation with the &quot;virtual digital desk&quot; (i.e. the medical&#xD;
      experts from the emergency department of the University Hospital RWTH Aachen) should be&#xD;
      carried out. In addition, mobile nursing assistants (NÄPÄ (Z)) will be introduced as part of&#xD;
      the project, who can also support the nursing staff and provide services that can be&#xD;
      delegated by doctors - especially if the general practitioner is not available at the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a standardised early warning system is to be established in the nursing homes&#xD;
      and its benefits evaluated. This will enable potentially dangerous changes in the state of&#xD;
      health of nursing home residents to be detected earlier.&#xD;

In addition, an early warning system will be introduced and, within the framework of the teleconsultation, a trained medical assistant can be sent to the care facility if necessary, who can carry out medical activities on site under a physician's delegated instructions. In addition, an electronic patient file will be introduced which can be accessed by the telemedicine physician and the general practitioner.</description>
