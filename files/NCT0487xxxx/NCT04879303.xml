  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop and test a Robotic Intervention Framework for Children with ASD in&#xD;
      the real context. The first part of this study will focus on the identification and initial&#xD;
      testing of core elements of effective robotic intervention programs to form a practice&#xD;
      framework. Pat II will use a randomized control trial to test the efficacy of the robotic&#xD;
      intervention programs that incorporated all elements of the framework. Part III will use a&#xD;
      qualitative approach to examine the qualitative outcomes of the program with reference to the&#xD;
      elements of the practice framework. With a framework that is built upon evidence and tested&#xD;
      sufficiently, practice guidelines and intervention protocol will be delineated to ensure&#xD;
      success of robotic intervention programs.&#xD;

    <measure>The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week before the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is a play-based standardized protocol for observing interaction, communication, repetitive behavior and play. It has a standardized algorithm score on communication and reciprocal social interaction domains that can contribute to diagnosis and to measure change in autistic symptoms during treatment. The ADOS creates an interactive play environment in which the children's social behaviors, use of speech and gestures in social situations can be observed. It is individual-based and will take 30-45 minutes for administering.</description>

    <measure>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week before the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is a validated tool for measuring outcomes of intervention programs on activity participation. It will collect both quantitative and qualitative data. The performance score and satisfaction score on participation of activities will be collected both before and after the intervention to reveal the change of the client throughout the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Short sensory profile</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week before the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Sensory Profile is a validated assessment tool to capture sensory processing behaviors that indicate a low or high threshold to sensory experiences resulting in interference with the performance of daily living tasks. This parent-reported measure is scored on six sensory systems and two behavioral category subscales, namely auditory processing, visual processing, taste and smell processing, body position, movement, touch processing, activity level, and social and emotional responses. Item scores can be calculated and aggregated into the seven factor scores: emotionally reactive, sensory sensitivity, low registration, sensory seeking, sensory defensiveness, oral sensory seeking, and low endurance.</description>
