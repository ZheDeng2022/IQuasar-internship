      This study evaluates the long-term safety and efficacy of the Hong Kong follow up protocol in&#xD;
      patients who will undergo drainage of the gallbladder under endoultrasonography (EUS)&#xD;
      guidance in patients with acute cholecistitis not suitable for surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute cholecystitis is a common surgical condition. However, in elderly patients or patients&#xD;
      with significant comorbidity, emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be associated with&#xD;
      significant risk of morbidities. Thus, in these patients, percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC)&#xD;
      could be employed for drainage of the gallbladder. However, complications including&#xD;
      intrahepatic hemorrhage, pneumothorax, biliary peritonitis and pneumonia have been reported&#xD;
      in a mean of 6.2% of patients (range 0-25%). Furthermore, PC has several other disadvantages&#xD;
      including risk of bile leakage, recurrent cholecystitis, inadvertent tube removal and&#xD;
      migration (0-25%), necessitating repeated procedures. In order to avoid nuisances associated&#xD;
      with PC, studies looking at potential ways to achieve endoscopic gallbladder drainage have&#xD;
      been performed. On the other hand, EUS-guided transmural drainage procedures are increasingly&#xD;
      performed for management of a variety of conditions and has also been described for drainage&#xD;
      of the gallbladder in patients that are not fit for surgery since 2007. Recently, a&#xD;
      lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) has become available which allows easier deployement of the&#xD;
      stent. A 9.8mm gastroscope or a 5mm ultrathin nasal endoscope can pass through the lumen of&#xD;
      the stent and enter the gallbladder for stone removal or other interventions A recent study&#xD;
      group from Hong Kong promoted a specific follow up for EUS guided gallbaldder drainage&#xD;
      patients who underwent a follow-up cholecystoscopy after the procedure to check for clearance&#xD;
      of stones. In patients with stones that were too large to pass out spontaneously, basket&#xD;
      mechanical lithotripsy was employed to break down the stones, followed by laser lithotripsy&#xD;
      if the latter was not successful. No data on the safety and efficacy of the Hong Kong follow&#xD;
      up protocol in patients who underwent EGBD using LAMS coming from countries other than Asian&#xD;
      are available, in which differences in etiological and pathogenic factors might not required&#xD;
      such an intensive follow up protocol. To explore this important question we have designed a&#xD;
      study aimed at evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of the Hong Kong follow up&#xD;
      protocol in patients undergoing EGBD performed using LAMS.&#xD;
