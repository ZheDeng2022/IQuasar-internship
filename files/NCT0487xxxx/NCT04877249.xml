    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to optimize the delivery of a combined strength and aerobic&#xD;
      training regimen to individuals with post stroke hemiparesis and reduce overuse and&#xD;
      inefficiencies associated with the nonparetic leg during walking. This study proposes to use&#xD;
      1) split-belt treadmill and 2) single belt treadmill walking using split belt simulation&#xD;
      software for enhancing symmetrical walking patterns for people with stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include twenty stroke survivors and twenty healthy adults (total 40&#xD;
      participants) who are 20 years or older. Both groups (stroke vs healthy) will be screened and&#xD;
      recruited from a UTMB Stroke Support Group and local community in Galveston or Harris County&#xD;
      for one year (2021-22). Healthy individuals will also participate in gait training compared&#xD;
      to stroke participants. The focus of this gait training is to optimize the delivery of a&#xD;
      combined strength and aerobic training regimen to older adults with post stroke hemiparesis&#xD;
      and reduce overuse and inefficiencies associated with the nonparetic leg during walking.&#xD;
      Investigators propose to use a combination of neuromechanical and biobehavioral approaches to&#xD;
      enhance bilateral symmetry of limb propulsion using specialized split-belt, force-plate&#xD;
      instrumented treadmill that uses backward directed resistance forces. With neuromechanics&#xD;
      investigators will measure joint torque output, EMG muscle activity patterns, and trailing&#xD;
      limb angle, while a person is walking under normal treadmill belt conditions versus the&#xD;
      split-belt conditions at different levels of resistance. Electromyography (EMG) detects&#xD;
      electrical activity during muscle contraction while the single or the split-belt treadmill&#xD;
      walking. The joint torque output and trailing limb angle can be obtained by using the Vicon&#xD;
      Motion System (Vicon, Oxford, UK) in conjunction with the Bertec split-belt, force plates&#xD;
      instrumented treadmill (Bertec Corp., Columbus, OH). In addition, in terms of biobehavioral&#xD;
      metrics, investigators will measure the extent to which people maintain improved paretic limb&#xD;
      propulsion contributions immediately after the split-belt environment is restored to a single&#xD;
      belt condition (i.e. aftereffects), and the ability of individuals to consciously alter their&#xD;
      walking pattern so as to reduce compensatory walking patterns when they are not engaged with&#xD;
      the specialized treadmill setup.&#xD;
