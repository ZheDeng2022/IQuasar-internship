  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Simulation based learning practice is limited in Sub-Saharan Africa. Experiences gained from&#xD;
      our prior implementation in Phase I of this program show that simulation is feasible and&#xD;
      significantly contributes to learning. However, the growth and sustainability of simulation&#xD;
      methodologies in health training and service delivery institutions is subject to variability&#xD;
      and institution specific factors. These factors may include but are not limited to ease of&#xD;
      adoption of new technologies, human resources, space and institutional culture. These factors&#xD;
      are likely to vary widely in Sub-Saharan Africa across countries and institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's not known how institutional factors will influence the introduction, adoption and&#xD;
      sustainability of simulation methodologies in East and West African health training and&#xD;
      service delivery institutions. We have partnered with four institutions in East and West&#xD;
      Africa (in Uganda, Tanzania, and Nigeria) to learn about the process of introduction and&#xD;
      scaling of simulation based learning in new frontiers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators in this proposal have partnered and propose to expand Simulation Based&#xD;
      Learning to Lira University in northern Uganda, Busitema University in Eastern Uganda, the&#xD;
      Catholic University of Health and Allied Sciences (CUHAS), Tanzania and University of Jos in&#xD;
      Nigeria. All these health training and service institutions serve large rural and peri-urban&#xD;
      populations with poor access to health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will engage the partners in the co-design of implementation plans to design&#xD;
      solutions for the barriers to implementation that are anticipated, and ensure appropriate&#xD;
      tailoring to the local context. The investigators will use a Train of trainers (ToT) Faculty&#xD;
      development model and this will include web-based debrief mentorship using recorded&#xD;
      debriefing sessions from real simulations at partner sites. These videos will be loaded onto&#xD;
      a centralization server to facilitate peer-to-peer feedback using a quality of debriefing&#xD;
      framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the investigators' learning experience from Phase I of implementation, the team aims&#xD;
      to develop two categories of simulation facilitators: 1) Simulation implementation faculty&#xD;
      (SiF) and 2) Lead simulation faculty. Lead simulation faculty (LsF) will be trained at the&#xD;
      Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) simulation center of excellence and will&#xD;
      receive support in assessing their sites' barriers and facilitators regarding the Sim&#xD;
      intervention. The faculty trainees will undergo an intensive 1.5-day faculty development&#xD;
      course followed by a 2-day placement at MUST sim center for mentored scenario execution&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
