  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSA) is a kind of sleep disorder. The symptoms&#xD;
      are intermittent, partial or complete upper airway collapse, seriously impacting oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and oxidative stress. Some patients choose to do upper airway surgeries, but the&#xD;
      success rate is only 60-70%. The symptoms might relapse because of aging and gaining weights.&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is to compare the effect of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and&#xD;
      oropharyngeal rehabilitation (OPR) on patients after TORS. Methods: Participants above 20&#xD;
      years old who are newly diagnosed with mild to severe OSA (Apnea-hypopnea Index &gt;5/h), and&#xD;
      the physician will explain the treatment programs to every subject in clinic. Expected&#xD;
      results: The hypothesis of this study is the success rate of surgery will be enhance by&#xD;
      increasing tongue and jaw-opening muscle strength after OPR. The biomarkers of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease may decrease and both the collapse of upper airway and sleep quality may be improved&#xD;
      after TORS and OPR.&#xD;

      The participants above 20 years old who are newly diagnosed with mild to severe OSA&#xD;
      (Apnea-hypopnea Index &gt;5/h), and the physician will explain the treatment programs to every&#xD;
      subject. By their willingness to choose the therapeutic method, the participants who select&#xD;
      the surgery interventions will be assign to TORS or TORS+OPR group. The matched controls as&#xD;
      well as age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched OSA participants will be selected from the&#xD;
      patients who are waiting for oral appliance, losing weight and using continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure. Before surgery, 6 week and 18 week after surgery, the investiagters will&#xD;
      compare the polysomnography data, questionnaires of sleep quality, drug-induced sleep&#xD;
      endoscopy and computed tomography as primary outcomes. The investigators will also compare&#xD;
      the tongue and jaw-opening muscle strength and biomarkers of oxidative stress, anti-oxidative&#xD;
      stress, inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases 9 as secondary outcomes. The OPR&#xD;
      would begin at 6 week after surgery, and participants will undergo three months of the&#xD;
      home-based oropharyngeal myofunctional therapeutic training. During the training intervention&#xD;
      period, participants will be interviewed one time per week for adjusting the treatment&#xD;
      intensity.&#xD;

    <description>DISE was carried out by an experienced ENT surgeon in a semi-dark and quiet operating room with the patient supine lying on a hospital bed. Artificial sleep was induced by intravenous injection of propofol and midazolam (bolus injection of 1.5 mg) through a target-controlled infusion system (1.5 to 3.0 lg/mL), intending to the transition to unconsciousness with beginning of snoring and with the examiner evaluating decreased muscle reflexes of the eyelid. The severity of collapse in the upper airway was assessed by the surgeon.</description>
