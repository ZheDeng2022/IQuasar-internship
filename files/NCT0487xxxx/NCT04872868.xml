  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the long-term effect of a lozenge containing&#xD;
      beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), iron, retinoic acid, zinc and polyphenols (holo-BLG) in people with&#xD;
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis caused by house dust mites and the associated symptoms (symptom&#xD;
      type and severity) during exposure to house dust mites in an Allergen Exposure Chamber (AEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the study aims to evaluate whether the improvements in symptoms of house dust&#xD;
      mite-induced rhinoconjunctivitis observed after 3 months of supplementation with holo-BLG can&#xD;
      still be detected 7 to 8 months after the last intake.&#xD;

    <description>Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) in response to HDM exposure in an AEC at V1 (baseline AEC exposure) versus V5 (follow-up AEC exposure). The TNSS is the sum of 4 nose symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and blocked nose) on a scale of 0 to 3 (no symptoms, mild symptoms, moderate symptoms, and severe symptoms), leading to a maximum TNSS of 12.</description>

    <description>Total Symptom Score in response to HDM exposure in an AEC at V1 (baseline AEC exposure) versus V5 (follow-up AEC exposure). The TSS is the sum of 4 nose symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and blocked nose), 3 eye symptoms (itchy eyes, watery eyes, and gritty feeling), 4 bronchial symptoms (wheezing, cough, breathlessness, and asthma), and 2 other symptoms (itchy palate, and itchy skin) on a scale of 0 to 3 (no symptoms, mild symptoms, moderate symptoms, and severe symptoms), leading to a maximum TSS of 39.</description>
