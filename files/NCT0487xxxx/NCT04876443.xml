  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lockdown consequent to Coronavirus outbreak has had a differential impact on the drinking&#xD;
      behaviour on the general population. The impact is unknown on the people with underlying&#xD;
      chronic liver disease related to alcohol as some of them may have complex psychosocial&#xD;
      background. The alcohol consumption in people with Alcohol-related Liver Disease (ArLD) is&#xD;
      either due to alcohol dependence or related to their lifestyle. Alcohol dependence is a&#xD;
      chronic relapsing remitting condition and this is associated with 60% mortality at 5 years in&#xD;
      people who continue drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery from alcohol-use disorder (AUD) has been made more difficult during lock-down&#xD;
      because peer support meetings such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) have no longer been taking&#xD;
      placeÍ¾ a majority of the residential rehabilitation centres have closed or are no longer&#xD;
      accepting admissions (PHE, 2020) and the single detoxification unit in London has been&#xD;
      requisitioned as a COVID-19 step-down facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to understand the influence of lockdown on the craving of alcohol and&#xD;
      severity of alcohol dependence in patients with ArLD. The results from the study will enable&#xD;
      us to identify the factors influencing the drinking behaviour during lockdown and a&#xD;
      subsequent impact on episodes of decompensation and mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ICoLD, is a collaborative study between the King's College Hospital and SLaM. This is an&#xD;
      observational self-report questionnaire study. The study population will comprise of people&#xD;
      with alcohol-related chronic liver disease attending the Liver Outpatients and those admitted&#xD;
      to the King's College Hospital. The study groups will be people who were abstinent of alcohol&#xD;
      and people who have had history of alcohol consumption prior to lockdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will ascertain drinking behaviour prior to lock down and during lock down/COVID&#xD;
      restrictions. The study uses the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ) to&#xD;
      ascertain the severity of physiological dependence and the Obsessive compulsive Drinking&#xD;
      Scale (OCDS) to characterise craving. The SADQ, OCDS and detailed Alcohol history is usually&#xD;
      collected as a standard of care in patients with AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also investigate factors that could influence drinking behaviour during&#xD;
      lockdown such as access to alcohol, affordability, pub closure/less socialising, boredom,&#xD;
      time to reflect on health and psycho-social factors. Data on drinking behaviour, SADQ score&#xD;
      and OCDS will be collected at any future lockdowns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with ArLD will be identified from the Liver outpatients or approached during their&#xD;
      Hospital admission. Approximately, 700 patients with ArLD are followed in the Liver&#xD;
      outpatients. 200 patients will be enrolled during the lockdown period, considering drop outs&#xD;
      and a proportion of patients not willing to participate in the study. The study population&#xD;
      will be followed up for a year after the final lockdown/COVID restrictions are lifted. No&#xD;
      statisticians were involved in planning this study as it is a pilot study to generate&#xD;
      hypotheses regarding the drivers of changes in drinking in this population during lockdown.&#xD;
