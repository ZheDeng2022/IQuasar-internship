  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Open-label Extension trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABP-450 for the&#xD;
      treatment of cervical dystonia in adults. The study will enroll 60 patients across&#xD;
      approximately 42 sites in the United States from Phase 2 (ABP-19000) and Phase 3 (ABP-19001)&#xD;
      trials and 29 sites in Europe from Phase 3 (ABP-19001) trial. Study subjects who had their&#xD;
      initial dose of study drug in Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial studies, irrespective of treatment&#xD;
      allocation, will be eligible to enroll in this OLE study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Qualified for and had their initial dose of study drug in the ABP-19000 or ABP-19001&#xD;
             studies and for whom 8 weeks have elapsed between last treatment in the double-blind&#xD;

             for focal dystonia treatment (eg, anticholinergics and benzodiazepines) for ≥3months&#xD;

             investigator's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Viral or other active infection or any medical condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
