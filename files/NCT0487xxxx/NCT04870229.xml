      The hypothesis is that oral supplementation of L-carnosine will inhibit PHDs, increase&#xD;
      HIF1-translocation and angiogenesis and thus improve the functioning of lower extremities in&#xD;
      PAD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Compare the effect of carnosine and placebo supplementation on the 6MWT in PAD patients&#xD;
      with and without claudication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether carnosine supplementation improves the pain-free treadmill walking&#xD;
           ability of the subjects supplemented with carnosine compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the levels of carnosine, VEGF, HIF-1α, and PHDs activity in the skeletal muscle&#xD;
           before and after placebo and carnosine supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the levels of EPCs (CD34+/CD133+), inflammatory markers (serum amyloid A, hsCRP)&#xD;
           and thrombotic markers (fibrinogen, homocysteine) as cardiovascular risk markers in&#xD;
           these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Explore the effects of race and gender on VEG, carnosine, and HIF-1α levels in both&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;

      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is caused by atherosclerotic occlusion of the lower&#xD;
      extremities that reduces blood flow and leads to intermittent claudication and critical limb&#xD;
      ischemia. PAD is diagnosed by calculating the ratio of blood pressure at the ankle to that of&#xD;
      the arm (the ankle-brachial index [ABI]). An ABI of &lt;0.90 is indicative of atherosclerosis in&#xD;
      the leg. Recent data from developed and developing countries have estimated that &gt;200 million&#xD;
      people worldwide and approximately 12 million people in United States have PAD. Both&#xD;
      symptomatic and asymptomatic PAD patients have an increased risk of mortality, morbidity, and&#xD;
      a lower quality of life. With the increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a rising&#xD;
      aging population, the number of PAD patients is likely to increase. Because PAD is an&#xD;
      under-recognized disease, currently few medications are available to improve the functional&#xD;
      performance of these patients. Although surgical revascularization is an available treatment,&#xD;
      grafts can fail and the stenosis can reoccur in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To adequately compensate the loss of tissue due to occlusion, the current emphasis is to&#xD;
      increase the therapeutic angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in the ischemic limb that could&#xD;
      improve the walking ability and the quality of life in PAD patients. Pre-clinical studies&#xD;
      have shown that supplementation of carnosine (500 mg/day) in heart failure patients for 6&#xD;
      months improves their performance on the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) compared with&#xD;
      placebo-treated patients. Similarly supplementation of carnosine (2g/day) for 12 weeks has&#xD;
      been shown to normalize glucose intolerance and reduce insulin levels in obese individuals.&#xD;
      No side effects were reported at these doses. Carnosine (β-alanine-histidine) is a histidyl&#xD;
      dipeptide present in high concentration in the skeletal muscle, brain, and heart. It is a&#xD;
      food constituent that is present in red meat, chicken, and turkey. This dipeptide is&#xD;
      synthesized by the ATP grasp enzyme carnosine synthetase6 and hydrolyzed to β-alanine and&#xD;
      histidine by the serum and kidney carnosinase. Carnosine has the abilities to quench reactive&#xD;
      aldehydes, bind metals, and buffer intracellular pH. Numerous studies have shown that the&#xD;
      supplementation of -alanine increases the levels of carnosine in the skeletal muscle and&#xD;
      improves the exercise performance in humans. Our preliminary studies with the mice model of&#xD;
      hind limb ischemia (HLI) shows that both the pretreatment and the supplementation of&#xD;
      carnosine after femoral artery ligation increases blood flow in the ischemic limb compared&#xD;
      with the non-treated mice. Mechanistic studies show that the supplementation of carnosine&#xD;
      increases angiogenic factor VEGF and endothelial progenitor cells mobilization in the&#xD;
      carnosine treated HLI mice. Similarly the stabilization of HIF-1α, the master regulator of&#xD;
      angiogenesis and angiogenic factor VEGF, is increased in the hypoxic C2C12 cells (murine&#xD;
      myoblasts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these pre-clinical studies and our initial observations the Investigator will&#xD;
      examine whether supplementation of carnosine (1 g/day) to PAD patients for 6 months will&#xD;
      improve walking performance compared with the placebo-treated patients. Further, the&#xD;
      Investigator will examine whether the supplementation of carnosine increases the capacity of&#xD;
      pain-free treadmill walking time and levels of VEGF, HIF-1α, and carnosine in the skeletal&#xD;
      muscle of PAD patients.&#xD;
