  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have reported a disparity in medication adherence among epileptic patients. In&#xD;
      this population, Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) is an index of medication adherence. MPR&#xD;
      is defined as the ratio of the number of days of treatment delivered to the number of days in&#xD;
      the period of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No-adherents patients are defined by a MPR of less than 80% , in whom an increase in seizures&#xD;
      and the rate of hospitalization can be observed. A pharmacist-led intervention and medication&#xD;
      information to epileptic patients could improve patient medication adherence to antiepileptic&#xD;
      drugs, and possibly decrease the frequency of seizures, hospitalizations and the health costs&#xD;
      generated by these hospitalizations. This intervention could also improve patient knowledge&#xD;
      about their medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a pharmacist-led intervention on&#xD;
      medication adherence of epileptic patients with the MPR. Secondary objectives include the&#xD;
      comparison of medication adherence with health insurance score, the evaluation of patients&#xD;
      knowledges about their medications, community pharmacists' satisfaction about community&#xD;
      hospital network, the comparison of the seizure free patient rate and the comparison of the&#xD;
      rate of patient in whom seizure have decreased by 50%&#xD;

    <description>In the intervention arm, the patient meets with the pharmacist. Pharmaceutical intervention (H1) about anti-epileptic drugs prescribed will be done: information on when to take the medication, what to do if you forget to take it or vomit, and an explanation of adverse events. The aim is to improve medication adherence and patient knowledge. A report will be sent to the community pharmacist.&#xD;
An assessment of medication adherence to antiepileptic drug by MPR at H1 3 months and 6 months (phone call to community pharmacist) will be done. The health insurance score will also be done.&#xD;
An assessment of patient knowledge by a self-made knowledge questionnaire (10 items) at H1 in pre- post interview -, 3 and 6 months (phone call to patient) will be done.&#xD;
An assessment of pharmacists' satisfaction about community hospital network by a satisfaction questionnaire will be done.</description>
