  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in substantial global&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality including in Oklahoma and caused unprecedented interruptions in&#xD;
      nearly all aspects of our lives. The population of the state of Oklahoma is at particular&#xD;
      risk to SARS-CoV-2 due to its large rural population, strained healthcare system, and poor&#xD;
      overall health. The Community-Engaged Approaches to Testing in Community and Healthcare&#xD;
      Settings for Underserved Populations (CATCH-UP) program will involve both practice-based and&#xD;
      community-based approaches to maximize the reach of the RADx-UP consortium, broaden the&#xD;
      potential perspectives that could be captured, and compare the effectiveness of strategies.&#xD;
      The interventions will be pragmatic to allow CATCH-UP to respond to changing attitudes,&#xD;
      barriers, and environments as the pandemic progresses as well as expected technology&#xD;
      developments to produce more effective viral testing that can provide rapid results to&#xD;
      patients. The investigators will assist 50 small primary care practices to implement&#xD;
      guidelines-based testing and patient education about COVID-19 and risk mitigation strategies.&#xD;
      The project's community-based approach is designed to rapidly respond to community testing&#xD;
      needs by deploying mobile testing sites that will provide operational support to increase the&#xD;
      efficiency and the existing capacity for state-wide testing by Oklahoma's public health&#xD;
      authorities. Together, the investigators estimate that the CATCH-UP program will result in at&#xD;
      least 105,000 SARS-CoV-2 tests performed during the first year of implementation. A&#xD;
      comprehensive, ongoing evaluation will be performed to analyze patient and provider&#xD;
      attitudes, barriers and facilitators of viral testing, identified health disparities caused&#xD;
      by COVID-19, effectiveness of the intervention in both settings, and to allow robust&#xD;
      collaboration with other RADx-UP consortium sites.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The broad RADx-UP initiative aims to understand the factors associated with COVID-19&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality disparities and to lay the foundation to reduce disparities for&#xD;
      underserved and vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by the pandemic through&#xD;
      efforts to increase access and effectiveness of diagnostic methods. The approach used in this&#xD;
      project will leverage the investigators' experiences in designing and implementing&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions in primary care settings, partnerships with Native American and&#xD;
      Latino communities, investments in the development of community- driven and responsive&#xD;
      organizations developed primarily in rural counties, and the capacity and needs of Oklahoma's&#xD;
      government testing and contact tracing infrastructure to develop, test, and evaluate a&#xD;
      culturally- responsive SARS-CoV-2 testing intervention, collection of additional data on&#xD;
      COVID-19 related health disparities, and identification of additional attitudes,&#xD;
      facilitators, and barriers to testing and eventual vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have designed an approach that not only allows for collecting essential&#xD;
      information about community, provider, and patient-relevant impediments to viral testing but&#xD;
      also meeting the critical need to increase testing in testing deserts in Oklahoma as rapidly&#xD;
      as possible. The investigators believe that a singular focus on one testing strategy will be&#xD;
      ineffective in truly understanding the barriers to testing. No one strategy would be&#xD;
      effective in reaching all of the population, due to issues such as lack of access to a&#xD;
      primary care provider, lack of insurance, transportation, available time, or&#xD;
      individual/community perceptions on testing itself (e.g., safety, necessity, availability,&#xD;
      trust). Thus, the investigators have chosen to develop the Community-engaged Approaches to&#xD;
      Testing in Community and Healthcare settings for Underserved Populations (CATCH-UP) program&#xD;
      with practice-based and community-based approaches to maximize the reach of the RADx-UP&#xD;
      consortium, broaden the potential perspectives that could be captured, and compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of strategies. Rather than developing an inflexible practice-based intervention&#xD;
      a priori, the investigators believe that the ever-changing barriers, attitudes and conditions&#xD;
      in the pandemic, as well as the development and deployment of more effective diagnostic&#xD;
      technologies over the next few months, necessitate a pragmatic approach in which increased&#xD;
      testing is initiated quickly while simultaneously collaborating with stakeholders and&#xD;
      collecting participant survey data in real-time, which will allow the intervention to evolve&#xD;
      to changing needs, and provide rapid-cycle evaluation of effectiveness of these activities to&#xD;
      provide timely feedback to the partners and other RADx-UP initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the CATCH-UP Project are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Provide technical support to a minimum of 50 Oklahoma primary care practices to&#xD;
           implement a person-centered approach to SARS-CoV-2 testing based on best available&#xD;
           evidence and current guidelines. The implementation approach will include 1) development&#xD;
           of implementation support resources for COVID-19 testing and risk mitigation strategies&#xD;
           to meet the needs of vulnerable populations through continuous adaption to changing&#xD;
           guidelines, testing protocols and availability, and information learned from the&#xD;
           project's provider network and the broader RADx-UP community, 2) support practices to&#xD;
           integrate tailored, guideline- based SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols and resources into the&#xD;
           workflows through proven methodologies of academic detailing from peer-physician&#xD;
           experts, practice change facilitation through quality improvement implementation&#xD;
           professionals, and health information technology support. Based on the average number of&#xD;
           providers and daily caseload in rural Oklahoma practices the investigators estimate this&#xD;
           will result in approximately 60,000 viral tests performed in the first year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rapidly respond to community testing needs by deploying mobile testing units in&#xD;
           community settings that will provide operational support to increase the efficiency and&#xD;
           the existing capacity for statewide testing by Oklahoma's public health authorities. The&#xD;
           model used by the Chickasaw Nation in deploying a high-efficiency community testing&#xD;
           system will be combined with ongoing observation and analysis to identify facilitators&#xD;
           and barriers to implementing community testing sites to accelerate convergence on&#xD;
           effective and replicable methods to increase access and acceptance of testing. The&#xD;
           investigators will adapt to ongoing disease outbreaks and community needs, but&#xD;
           anticipate that this aim will result in more than 250 testing events at sites throughout&#xD;
           the state and 45,000 viral tests performed in the first year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the CATCH-UP program, collaborate&#xD;
           closely with other RADx-UP projects in sharing data and adapting processes, and&#xD;
           continuously communicate with our community partners to assess effectiveness and&#xD;
           disseminate research findings. This evaluation will include measurement and&#xD;
           dissemination of data related to 1) Provider-level Outcomes that include knowledge and&#xD;
           attitudes of disease prevalence, clinical characteristics including typical and atypical&#xD;
           symptoms and disease severity, testing importance and strategies, vaccination,&#xD;
           importance and use of personal protective equipment, availability of testing and delays&#xD;
           in return of results, and provider observations of patient attitudes and other reported&#xD;
           barriers, 2) Care Process Outcomes such as testing, test positivity, and test refusal&#xD;
           rates, influenza, pneumococcal, and zoster vaccination rates, 3) Community-level&#xD;
           Outcomes that include the number of tests conducted by mobile testing units and the&#xD;
           resulting test positivity rate, 4) Patient-level Outcomes such as knowledge and&#xD;
           attitudes of disease prevalence, disease characteristics including severity and acute&#xD;
           and chronic symptoms, risk perspective and preferences, importance and use of personal&#xD;
           protective equipment, patient acceptance of various testing options, and facilitators&#xD;
           and barriers to participating in testing and future vaccination programs, 5) Patient&#xD;
           Factors such as demographics, social determinants of health, and clinical&#xD;
           characteristics that may be associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality disparities&#xD;
           or reach of each testing modality, and 6) Qualitative Outcomes including perceptions of&#xD;
           facilitators and barriers to testing and the utility, effectiveness, and&#xD;
           generalizability of the program, explored through key informant interviews, exit&#xD;
           interviews, and in-depth program implementation process observations.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Practices:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Primary care practices located in Oklahoma.&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Practices routinely using a certified electronic health record (EHR) will be&#xD;
                  eligible to participate, as practices that are still using paper records are&#xD;
                  either planning to close due to clinician retirement or will likely be&#xD;
                  implementing an EHR during the project, which would compromise their ability to&#xD;
                  participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Practice-wide participation will be encouraged, but participation of all members&#xD;
                  within a practice (both clinicians and staff members) will not be required. The&#xD;
                  minimum acceptable level of participation will be one clinician and nurse/medical&#xD;
                  assistant dyad plus anyone else who would have to be involved to make changes in&#xD;
                  the processes of care (e.g. clinic manager) for that unit of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Clinicians and staff members 18 years of age and older at the time of enrollment&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Patients (or their caregivers) who are 18 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Practices:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Practices that are uninterested in reducing missed opportunities for&#xD;
                  guidelines-based testing for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Solo practices with a clinician planning to retire within 12 months of enrollment&#xD;
                  will not be eligible for participation.&#xD;
