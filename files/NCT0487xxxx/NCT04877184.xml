  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the main treatment method for Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) is medication or&#xD;
      surgery. However, the effectiveness of medicines is moderate and there are several side&#xD;
      effects. In this clinical trial, we would like to enhance the protein levels of brain derived&#xD;
      neurotrophic factor in the brain by the transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS). By this&#xD;
      technology, the symptoms of ICH could be alleviated and the side effects of medicines might&#xD;
      be avoided. Preclinical trials have also shown that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound can&#xD;
      alleviate the degree of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and significantly improve motor&#xD;
      and cognitive deficits after brain injury. The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and feasibility of TUS for the treatment of patients with hypertensive&#xD;
      intracerebral hemorrhage. The primary safety assessment indexes are brain magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) and brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The secondary safety assessment&#xD;
      indexes include weight, vital signs, electrocardiogram, general blood biochemical tests,&#xD;
      adverse reaction events, and concurrent drug tracking. The feasibility assessment includes&#xD;
      blood specific biomarker expression and neurological function &amp; quality of life scales.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is an objective scale for neurologic impairment of stoke. This scale includes 13 categories, with highest score of 3 or 4 and lowest score is 0, quantifying level of consciousness, best gaze, visual filed, facial palsy, motor function, limb ataxia, sensory function, language function, dysarthria, extinction/inattention. The maximum score is 42, which signifies severe stroke, while the minimum score is 0, meaning a normal exam.</description>

It is composed of 30 items, measuring the upper limb voluntary movement, lower limb voluntary movements and basic mobility. A 3 point original scale (0~2) is used for upper and lower limb voluntary movement, and a 4 point original scale (0~3) is used for basic mobility. Higher scales means better motor performance.</description>

    <description>It is a 17-item measure used to quantify upper extremity functional limitations. It is comprised of 2 strength items and 15 timed task performance items, and the investigators choose the 15 timed task performance items for this study. The test yields 3 scores: a functional ability (FA) score, which quantifies quality of performance; a timed (time) score, quantifying speed of performance in seconds; and a grip strength (strength) score. The FA score uses a 6-point ordinal scale to rate movement quality on 15 items, where 0 indicates no attempt to use the more affected upper extremity and 5 indicates that movement of the affected upper extremity appears to be normal. The time score is the mean time to complete the same 15 items; scores were truncated at 120 seconds.</description>

    <description>The Barthel Index measures a person's performance in activities of daily living (ADL). Ten variables describing ADL and mobility are scored, a higher number being a reflection of greater ability to function independently. The Barthel Index consists of 10 items of mobility and self care ADL.</description>

Each individual item of the WHOQOL-BREF is scored from 1 to 5 on a response scale, which is stipulated as a five-point ordinal scale. The scores are then transformed linearly to a 0-100-scale. The higher scores equals better quality of life.</description>
