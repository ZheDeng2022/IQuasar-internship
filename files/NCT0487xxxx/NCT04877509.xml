  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, age was clearly the major factor of mortality.&#xD;
      Increasing age was strongly associated with this risk, with the upper 80 years age group&#xD;
      having more than 12-fold increased risk compared with those aged 50-59 years. Male gender was&#xD;
      also associated with a doubling of risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elderly subject is particularly exposed to global denutrition with risk of micronutrients&#xD;
      deficiencies such as vitamins and trace elements. Those deficits expose to lower immunity. In&#xD;
      addition, viral infection as COVID-19 can also worsen these deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, low levels or intakes of micronutrients such as Zn, Se and vitamin A have been&#xD;
      associated with adverse clinical outcomes during viral infections. This notion has been&#xD;
      confirmed in a recent review proposing that besides vitamins A and D also B vitamins, vitamin&#xD;
      C, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as selenium, zinc and iron should be&#xD;
      considered in the assessment of micronutrients in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the MicroCovAging study will evaluate copper, zinc and selenium, vitamin A,&#xD;
      D and E status in elderly subjects affected by COVID- 19 and to correlate this status with&#xD;
      prognosis of this disease.&#xD;
