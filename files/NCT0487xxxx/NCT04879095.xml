      Aim of study is to translate a clinical validate of Urdu version of D-12 in COPDs patients.&#xD;
      The study will measure reliability &amp; validity of dyspnea in Urdu version. No study has been&#xD;
      conducted in our region to translate D-12 follow the proper cross culture adaptation.&#xD;
      Therefor the instrument will translate in our language adapting proper cross culture&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;

    <measure>Six minute Walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>It is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. The distance covered over a time of 6 minutes is used as outcome by which to compare changes in performance capacity. 30-metre stretch of unimpeded walkway is used and patient is instructed to walk as far as possible for 6 minutes. Test retest reliability of 6MWT showed good internal consistency (ICC=0.9) in patients with heart failure patients</description>

    <measure>Rate Perceived Exertion</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is used to monitor and guide exercise intensity and help in measure how hard your body is working when you exercise. It gives estimate of your heart rate and exercise intensity zone. The scale ranges from 6 -20. 6 indicate no exertion and 20 denotes maximum exertion, it is simple numerical list.</description>
