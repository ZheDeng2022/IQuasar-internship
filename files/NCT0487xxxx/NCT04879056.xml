      This study is designed to evaluate the instrument precision of the device for its proposed&#xD;
      intended use in sub-studies: intra-system and inter-system. The precision within a system&#xD;
      will be evaluated on three systems by three pathologists at one site. Specific features will&#xD;
      be selected on glass slides, which will then be scanned. On the whole slide images field of&#xD;
      views will be created including the features. In the reading phase three pathologists will&#xD;
      read the field of views and record which features they observe.&#xD;

      This study is designed to evaluate the instrument precision of the device for its proposed&#xD;
      intended use in three sub-studies: intra-system, inter-system and inter-site. Each sub-study&#xD;
      will have three phases: enrollment, preparation and reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per sub-study the precision of the device will be based on three reading pathologists'&#xD;
      assessments and identification of specific clinically relevant histopathologic &quot;features&quot;&#xD;
      that are encountered in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)&#xD;
      slides. Examples of these features are eosinophils, plasma cells, goblet cells, foreign body&#xD;
      giant cells, etc. Three magnifications are used in this study: 10x, 20x and 40x. These&#xD;
      magnifications represent the magnifications typically used in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
      There will be seven different study features per magnification. In total twenty-one features&#xD;
      will be selected, with each feature selected from at least three different organs, to ensure&#xD;
      that multiple tissue types are investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precision will be assessed in three sub-studies: intra-system, inter-system and inter-site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the intra-system study the precision within a system will be evaluated on three&#xD;
           systems by three pathologists at one site;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the inter-system study the precision between systems will be evaluated on three&#xD;
           systems by three pathologists at one site;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In the inter-site study the reproducibility between systems located at different sites&#xD;
           will be evaluated at three sites on three systems by three pathologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment The enrollment process (case selection, slide selection, feature selection, and&#xD;
      field of view (FOV) selection) will be performed by an enrollment pathologist (EP), a&#xD;
      validating enrollment pathologist (VEP) and a study technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases will be selected from the laboratory information system (LIS) by the EP. For each&#xD;
      pre-specified study feature and organ, consecutive cases will be selected per feature. From&#xD;
      these cases, slides will be selected containing the pre-specified study feature(s) for which&#xD;
      the EP is searching at that moment. The study feature(s) on the chosen slide is/are then&#xD;
      called the &quot;selected feature(s)&quot;. The VEP confirms if the selected feature(s) is/are present&#xD;
      on the glass slide. The validated slides are scanned by a study technician for enrollment.&#xD;
      The EP reviews the whole slide image (WSI) of the slide and defines an area (bookmark)&#xD;
      containing the selected feature(s) at the appropriate magnification. The sponsor will create&#xD;
      a static full resolution extraction image of the bookmark, which will then be defined as the&#xD;
      FOV. The VEP confirms if the feature(s) is/are present on the FOV. Note that the precise flow&#xD;
      may be adapted according site preference with the pre-requisite that all slides and FOVs are&#xD;
      selected and validated before enrolment. After confirmation, the FOV is considered enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scanning and reading After enrollment the slides are scanned by the study technician for the&#xD;
      reading sessions. The sponsor extracts the FOV(s) from each image, identical to the&#xD;
      enrollment FOV. Scanning and reading will be different per sub-study, see below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reading pathologists in this study will be blinded to certain details in the protocol&#xD;
      e.g. the study features. In order to preserve this blind, these details will be further&#xD;
      explained in a Protocol Addendum on Features and Field of Views [Protocol Addendum].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reading pathologist will review the FOV as a snapshot with no panning or zooming&#xD;
      capabilities. The reading pathologist will assess the presence of each of the features on a&#xD;
      feature checklist appropriate for that particular magnification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scanning and reading intra-system study The study slide set will be equally (n=133 slides per&#xD;
      system) and randomly divided over three systems at one site. On each system the slides are&#xD;
      scanned three times with at least six hours of system downtime (ensuring full cool down)&#xD;
      between scanning iterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three separate reading sessions will be performed by each of three reading pathologists, with&#xD;
      a washout period of at least two weeks between individual sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each reading pathologist will read all study FOVs from all three iterations and all three&#xD;
      systems in a randomized way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scanning and reading inter-system study The complete study slide set (n=399) will be scanned&#xD;
      once on each of the three systems at one site. Three separate reading sessions will be&#xD;
      performed by each of the three pathologists with a washout period of at least two weeks&#xD;
      between individual sessions. Each reading pathologist will read all study FOVs in a&#xD;
      randomized way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scanning and reading inter-site study For the inter-site study a different system and a&#xD;
      different study technician will be involved per site. The same slide set (n=399) is scanned&#xD;
      once at each site, resulting in three WSI sets. There will be a different reading pathologist&#xD;
      at each site who will read the FOVs of his site in one reading session in a randomized way.&#xD;
