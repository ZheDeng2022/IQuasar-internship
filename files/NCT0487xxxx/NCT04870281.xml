  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the BIO-AffectDX Study is to prospectively evaluate improvement from baseline&#xD;
      in heart failure subjects with atrial fibrillation (AF) implanted with a two-lead CRT-DX&#xD;
      system, with emphasis on a comparison of patient outcomes between AF subtypes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for more evidence about the benefits of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy&#xD;
      (CRT) in a patient population with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The BIO-AffectDX&#xD;
      Study will gather information about adults with heart failure and atrial fibrillation who are&#xD;
      treated with a CRT-DX device from many locations across the United States. The BIO-AffectDX&#xD;
      Study will look at the results of treatment in participants with the primary goal to evaluate&#xD;
      the improvement in overall health prior to device implant through 12 months. Overall health&#xD;
      will be measured by your study doctor for AF improvement, physical fitness, and general&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
