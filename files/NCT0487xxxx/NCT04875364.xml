  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate why some people have Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and how the&#xD;
      underlying cause may relate to OSA manifestations (including sleepiness and high blood&#xD;
      pressure) and response to different therapeutic approaches (ie CPAP, eszopiclone, and&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen). Understanding why someone has OSA could affect how best to treat that&#xD;
      individual, but may also have an impact on what problems the disease might cause.&#xD;

    <measure>Psychomotor Vigilance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-minutes, computerized reaction test asking subject to press a button every time a prompt appears. Faster times indicate better reactions and higher alertness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Endothelial Dysfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Using a device called EndoPAT for a non-invasive bloodflow measure before, during, and after 5-minutes of occlusion to one arm. Differences in EndoPAT results will be compared between treatments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurocognitive Assessment: NIH Toolbox</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This battery yields three composite scores: overall cognitive function, crystallized cognition and fluid cognition. The two tests of &quot;crystallized cognition&quot; are less sensitive to acquired brain dysfunction and reflect past learning experiences (Oral Reading Recognition and Picture Vocabulary). The five tests of &quot;fluid cognition&quot; assess multiple cognitive domains that are vulnerable to acquired brain dysfunction (i.e., Picture Sequence Memory Task = episodic memory, Dimensional Change Card Sort Task = executive function/flexibility, Pattern Comparison Task = processing speed, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Task = executive function/inhibitory control, and List Sorting Task = working memory).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person's average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their 'daytime sleepiness'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 19-item, self-rated questionnaire designed to measure sleep quality and disturbance over the past month. The sleep component scores are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 21 with the higher total score (referred to as global score) indicating worse sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-item self-report form to assess insomnia severity. Total score categories: 0-7 = No clinically significant insomnia, 8-14 = Subthreshold insomnia, 15-21 = Clinical insomnia (moderate severity), 22-28 = Clinical insomnia (severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Richard's Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A five-item self-report questionnaire that is used in order to assess perceived sleep depth, sleep latency (time to fall asleep), and number of awakenings, as well as sleep efficiency and quality. Each item is scored on a visual analog scale ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm, with higher scores representing better sleep. The mean score of the five items is known as the total score and represents the overall perception of sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 40-item questionnaire to assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. The score ranges from 0 to 160 with greater values indicating better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Index-II</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire assesses mental health (i.e. depression). Each of the 21 items are given weighted values corresponding to a symptom of depression and summed to give a single score. Total score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-36 Item Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A set of 36 generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. Scoring consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 9 item self-administered questionnaire used to evaluate the severity of a patient's pain and the impact of this pain on the patient's daily functioning. The patient is asked to rate their worst, least, average, and current pain intensity, list current treatments and their perceived effectiveness, and rate the degree that pain interferes with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other persons, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a 10 point scale with 10 being the most pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) pain intensity</measure>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A subjective measure of cognitive function that asks participants to rate how often they experience difficulty in four areas: memory, language/communication, sensory-motor ability, and executive function with response options from 0 (&quot;almost never&quot;) to 5 (&quot;almost always&quot;).</description>
