      Reaction of the immune system and the body to a Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) vaccination is so&#xD;
      different and ultimately unpredictable has not yet been clarified. It is also not yet known&#xD;
      why people who have been vaccinated react to a vaccination with sometimes serious side&#xD;
      effects. Using high-throughput dissecting (analytical) methods with the suffix OMICS&#xD;
      (&quot;Multi-OMICS&quot; methods, collective characterization and quantification of pools of biological&#xD;
      molecules) used in this study on the basis of blood tests, data from several molecular levels&#xD;
      can be recorded and a holistic picture can be created from this, which can depict the&#xD;
      connections between these levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Various vaccines against COVID-19 (&quot;CORONA&quot;) have now been approved in Germany. How and why&#xD;
      the reaction of the immune system and the body to a COVID-19 vaccination is so different and&#xD;
      ultimately unpredictable has not yet been clarified. It is also not yet known why people who&#xD;
      have been vaccinated react to a vaccination with sometimes serious side effects. There are&#xD;
      now initial indications that genetic prerequisites can play a role in the development of the&#xD;
      immune response. Furthermore, we want to examine the long-term protection against Severe&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through vaccination and&#xD;
      learn to understand it better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using high-throughput dissecting (analytical) methods with the suffix OMICS (&quot;Multi-OMICS&quot;&#xD;
      method) used in this study on the basis of blood tests, data from several molecular levels&#xD;
      can be recorded and a holistic picture can be created from this, which can depict the&#xD;
      connections between these levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected results can help to gain a better understanding of the underlying reactions to a&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination and the functioning of the body (pathophysiology) in the future, which&#xD;
      could enable the basis for the development of causal therapeutic approaches and improved&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;
