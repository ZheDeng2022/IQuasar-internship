  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reference intervals (RIs) of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) are&#xD;
      age, assay and population specific. Currently, the age and assay-specific RIs for TSH are not&#xD;
      available for children under two years of age. This study aimed to establish reference&#xD;
      intervals for serum concentrations of TSH and FT4 in healthy children aged 1-24 months as per&#xD;
      CLSI C28-A3 guidelines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Section of Chemical Pathology,&#xD;
      Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, AKUH Karachi Pakistan, from August 2018 to&#xD;
      March 2019 after approval from The Aga Khan University Ethics Review Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy children from 1 to 24 months visiting the clinical lab for serum vitamin D testing&#xD;
      were invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their health status was determined by asking questions related to their medical medical&#xD;
      history after informed consent from their parents/guardian. Children with recent abnormal&#xD;
      total leucocyte or neutrophil count in the medical record or positive microbial cultures,&#xD;
      history of any diagnosed disease or infection, history of hospitalization during the previous&#xD;
      four weeks, congenital hypothyroidism or transient congenital hypothyroidism, history of&#xD;
      maternal thyroid illness, or any medications with potential influences on the thyroid&#xD;
      function, such as amiodarone, anti-epileptic drugs, glucocorticoids were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RIs were established using the CLSI, C28-A3 guidelines, using a sample size of at least&#xD;
      120 specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum TSH and FT4 were measured on ADVIA Centaur (Siemens Diagnostics, US), using&#xD;
      chemiluminescence immunoassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EP evaluator version 10 and SPSS version 21 were used for data analysis.&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test assessed the normality of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RIs based on central 95% of the population were established. The median age of subjects,&#xD;
      TSH and FT4 levels were calculated. For assessing differences in the male and female gender,&#xD;
      Students' t' test was applied, taking p-value &lt;0.050 as significant. Spearman's test computed&#xD;
      the correlation between age, TSH and FT4 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 132 children were included in the study; one subject with confirmed congenital&#xD;
      hypothyroidism (CH) was excluded from the study, shown in figure 1. The TSH and FT4 values of&#xD;
      131 subjects were included to establish the RIs. The median (IQR) age of the study subjects&#xD;
      was 12 (11) months, and 78 (59.5%) were male.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference interval based on central 95% of the population for TSH is 0.73-4.94 ÂµIU/mL and for&#xD;
      FT4 is 0.81-1.51 ng/dL.&#xD;
