  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The loss of the ability to walk and the associated restriction of mobility presents a major&#xD;
      challenge to people with spinal cord injury in an everyday environment designed for&#xD;
      pedestrians. Exoskeletal technology has the potential to help people with impaired leg&#xD;
      function to regain ambulation and thus improve their independence. This technology is not&#xD;
      completely new, but due to their high access price (~120kâ‚¬/unit), high size and weight (~25&#xD;
      kg), and need for trained physiotherapist supervision, commercially available exoskeletons&#xD;
      are only found in large hospitals and only in very few cases get into patients' homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The company ABLE Human Motion S.L. (Barcelona, Spain) has developed a novel exoskeleton to&#xD;
      overcome these disadvantages, which is more compact, lighter (9 kg) and easier to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety, feasibility and usability of&#xD;
      the ABLE exoskeleton device in people with spinal cord injury during a four to six weeks gait&#xD;
      training in clinical settings. Furthermore, potential effects of the training on walking,&#xD;
      general health status, user satisfaction, and quality of life will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, feasibility, and usability of&#xD;
      using the ABLE Exoskeleton for patients with SCI in a hospital setting during a 4-6 week&#xD;
      training programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the impact of ABLE Exoskeleton training on gait and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the effect on the perceived rate of exertion for patients using the ABLE&#xD;
           Exoskeleton.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the level of user satisfaction from participants and therapists of the ABLE&#xD;
           Exoskeleton.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the psychosocial impact of the ABLE Exoskeleton for participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who match inclusion and exclusion criteria and pass pre-study screening will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Following the screening, baseline assessments will be conducted&#xD;
      without the device. Participants will undergo a training programme with the ABLE Exoskeleton&#xD;
      three times a week for four weeks for a total of 12 sessions. Standardized clinical&#xD;
      assessments with the device will be performed during the first and the last training&#xD;
      sessions. During the training period, several safety and usability measurements will be&#xD;
      taken. After the last training session, baseline assessments without the exoskeleton will be&#xD;
      repeated during a post-study assessment. Four weeks after the final training session a&#xD;
      follow-up assessment will be conducted with participants. At the end of the study, the&#xD;
      participating therapists will be asked to fill out a satisfaction questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study investigating the use of the ABLE Exoskeleton, therefore the primary&#xD;
      hypothesis of this study is that the ABLE Exoskeleton is safe, feasible, and usable for the&#xD;
      intended patient population with SCI in a hospital setting. The secondary hypothesis is that&#xD;
      the device will have a positive impact on the perceived rate of exertion, mobility, and&#xD;
      psychosocial health of the study participants with SCI.&#xD;

    <measure>Time and Level of Assistance (LoA) to don/doff the device</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Level of Assistance (LoA) and time taken to don/doff the device will be measured in every session. LoA will be measured using a 6 item scale, from Total assistance to Independence. Different assistance levels are defined taking into account the degree of participation of both the patient and the therapist on performing the activity.&#xD;
This outcome measure will be used to assess the device's usability.</description>

Different assistance levels are defined taking into account the degree of participation of both the patient and the therapist in performing the activity.&#xD;
