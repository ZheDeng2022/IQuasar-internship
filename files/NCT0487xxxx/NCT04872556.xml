  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospectively randomized and double-blinded clinical study. Cancer patients were&#xD;
      suffered from the taxanes-induced joint pain, and would be advised to receive laser&#xD;
      acupuncture in specific points to relieve pain. Clinical effects of analgesic changes would&#xD;
      be evaluated before and after the intervention. The inflammation associated indices would be&#xD;
      further analyzed to reveal the therapeutic mechanism of laser acupuncture. The laser&#xD;
      acupuncture was expected to relief taxanes-induced adverse effects in patients and also can&#xD;
      improve patients' life quality.&#xD;

      The current clinical study is prospectively randomized and double-blinded, and practice in&#xD;
      Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Linkou, TaoYuan and Taipei branches. All 90 participants&#xD;
      suffered from taxanes-induced myalgia and Arthralgia, and will be randomly assigned into the&#xD;
      experimental groups (45 participants) and the control group (45 participants). The experiment&#xD;
      group would arrange laser acupuncture on day1 and day3 after Taxanes treatment, besides the&#xD;
      control group arrange pseudo-laser acupuncture. In the mean while, blood tests were performed&#xD;
      with the C-Reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Interleukin-6 for each&#xD;
      participants. Evaluation would be records on day1, day3, and day 8 after Taxanes treatment.&#xD;
