  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pterygium is a common ocular surface disease in Malaysia. Without treatment, it can lead to&#xD;
      severe visual impairment. Recurrence is the commonest complication and novel treatment&#xD;
      approaches are crucial to prevent vision loss. The biological processes underlying the&#xD;
      formation of pterygium are complex, but central to its pathogenesis is the angiogenic&#xD;
      cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is upregulated under conditions of&#xD;
      increased oxidative stress, which plays an integral role in pterygium development&#xD;
      (Cardenas-Cantu et al., 2016, Karaman, 2018, Norrby, 1998, Rossino et al., 2020, Shibunya,&#xD;
      2011).Various biomarkers on pterygium have been identified and are useful to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of new modality treatment for pterygium. These markers can be identified via&#xD;
      histopathological stain such as Masson Trichrome to observe changes of collagen fibres. Other&#xD;
      identifiable markers include the use of special immunohistochemical stain such as anti CD34&#xD;
      antibody for microvascular density and anti-8-OHdG antibody for oxidative changes in the&#xD;
      pterygium tissue. By analyzing the changes with or without Ranibizumab injection in addition&#xD;
      to observation of clinical recurrence rate of pterygium, we are able to conclude the&#xD;
      effectiveness of anti-VEGF on pterygium recurrence. The aim of the study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      association between collagen fibres changes, microvascular density changes and inflammation&#xD;
      resultant from oxidative stress with the clinical recurrence of pterygium following&#xD;
      intralesional Ranibizumab injection in comparison to control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective interventional study conducted from May 2018 to April 2020. Patients&#xD;
      with primary pterygium who attended eye clinic Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM)&#xD;
      Kubang Kerian, Kelantan and fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited as&#xD;
      participants of this study. Convenient sampling method was applied for participants'&#xD;
      recruitment where all patients will be given thorough explanation in regards to the study and&#xD;
      subsequently divided into interventional and control group. Intervention group participants&#xD;
      were given intralesional Ranibizumab (0.5mg/ 0.05mL) 2 weeks prior to pterygium excision&#xD;
      surgery. Both groups of participants undergo pterygium excision with autologous conjunctival&#xD;
      graft surgery thereafter. Excised pterygium tissues were sent to the laboratory for slide&#xD;
      preparation and staining with specific reagents including Masson Trichrome for collagen&#xD;
      fibers, anti CD34 antibody for microvascular density and anti-8 OHdG antibody for oxidative&#xD;
      stress changes. Slides were then analysed by the pathologist and statistical analysis of the&#xD;
      results were carried out with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version&#xD;
      26.0. All participants had intralesional Ranibizumab injection and pterygium excision with&#xD;
      autologous conjunctival graft surgery in May 2018. They were scheduled for follow-up visits&#xD;
      for the next 24 months to observe for complications of intralesional Ranibizumab injection,&#xD;
      pterygium excision and conjunctival autograft surgery and any signs of recurrence.&#xD;

    <description>MVD is a reflection of angiogenesis (Norrby, 1998). The effects of anti-VEGF on MVD of the excised tissue were assessed using anti-CD34 antibody (50 µg at 1 mg/ml at dilution of 1:50-1:100, QBEnd/10, Mouse anti-Human, Dako, North America).</description>
