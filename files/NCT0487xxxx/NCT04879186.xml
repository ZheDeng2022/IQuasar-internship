  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) is an iatrogenic renal injury following intravascular&#xD;
      administration of radio-opaque contrast media (CM) in susceptible individuals. As the third&#xD;
      leading cause of hospital acquired renal failure, it is associated with increased mortality,&#xD;
      morbidity and prolonged hospital stay. Endovascular procedures have gained greater popularity&#xD;
      in the past decade due to the advance in technology. This has also led to the increased&#xD;
      incidence of CIN after vascular surgeries. We are conducting a retrospective cohort study in&#xD;
      Singapore General Hospital using our perioperative database collected in the past five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be extracting relevant patient perioperative information including both clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis and lab values. Our primary aim is to establish the incidence of CIN among vascular&#xD;
      patients with or without pre-existing chronic renal impairment undergoing elective peripheral&#xD;
      endovascular angioplasty. Our secondary aims are to establish the risk factors and protective&#xD;
      factors that lead to the development of CIN in vascular patients after peripheral&#xD;
      endovascular angioplasty. We will also be looking at the long-term outcome of patients who&#xD;
      have developed CIN after vascular endovascular angioplasty. The results of the study will&#xD;
      enable us to identify patients at high risk of development of CIN, thus appropriate measures&#xD;
      can be initiated early and help with their recovery process.&#xD;

      We propose a retrospective single-center cohort study conducted in Singapore general&#xD;
      hospital. Data would be extracted in patients who have undergone peripheral endovascular&#xD;
      angioplasty from 01/01/2015 to 01/01/2020. The data will be extracted from the eHINTs&#xD;
      Perioperative Subject Area without any direct identifiers. The subject area has been&#xD;
      previously curated as part of the SingHealth ODySSEy (On-prem Research Data Science and&#xD;
      Systems Explorer) System. There will be no patient identifier collected and the data&#xD;
      collection administration will not have any access to patient identifier. Waiver of consent&#xD;
      is sought and no patient interaction would be required for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters to be extracted would include preoperative data such as patient demographics&#xD;
      (age, gender, race, BMI), baseline comorbidities including but not limited to: hypertension,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, anemia, heart diseases (previous heart&#xD;
      attack/history of congestive heart failure), preoperative renal function (measured by&#xD;
      baseline Urea, creatinine, electrolytes level Na, K, Cl), preoperative long-term medication&#xD;
      use including ACE inhibitor, ARB, beta-blocker, statin and diuretics and NSAIDS.&#xD;
      Intraoperative data including types of anaesthesia used, operative duration, presence of&#xD;
      intraoperative hypotension. Postoperative parameters such as mortality, length of stay in&#xD;
      hospital and ICU, postoperative renal function measured by urea and creatinine level within 3&#xD;
      days and one month postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed to study the risk factors for CIN in patients&#xD;
      undergoing peripheral endovascular angioplasty.&#xD;
