  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Starting from December 2019, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a&#xD;
      tremendous economic loss and unprecedented health crisis across the globe. Discovering an&#xD;
      effective and safe drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 and its associated symptoms&#xD;
      became a global urgent demand especially due to limited data that have been released&#xD;
      regarding the vaccine efficacy and safety in humans. Reviewing the recent research, Olive&#xD;
      leaf was selected as a potential co-therapy supplement for the treatment and the improvement&#xD;
      of clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients. Olive leaves reported to be rich in phenolic&#xD;
      compounds such as oleuropein, hydroxy tyrosol, verbascoside, apigenin-7-glucoside and&#xD;
      luteolin-7-glucoside which has been reported as anti-SARS-CoV-2 metabolites in recent In&#xD;
      silico, computational and in vitro studies. In addition, olive leaf extract was previously&#xD;
      reported in several in vivo studies for its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic,&#xD;
      immunomodulatory and anti-thrombotic activities which is of a great benefit in the control of&#xD;
      associated inflammatory cytokine storm and disseminated intravascular coagulation in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial at Fayoum University Hospital in Egypt will&#xD;
      be conducted. RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 adults showing mild to moderate disease will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Patients presenting with multi-organ failure, ventilator support, and&#xD;
      chronic diseases (except diabetes mellitus and hypertension) were excluded. Patients were&#xD;
      randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to receive standardized olive leaves capsules (containing&#xD;
      20-50% oleuropein) or placebo up-to 10 days along with standard care. The expected outcomes&#xD;
      included symptom alleviation, viral clearance, improvement of analysis (CBC, CRP, LDH, ESR,&#xD;
      Ferritin, D-dimer, creatinine, ALT and AST) and a 30-day mortality in intention-to-treat&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate the efficacy of standardized olive leaf capsules as additive therapy to the&#xD;
      standard therapeutic regimen (for a period 10 days) on clinical symptoms, viral clearance,&#xD;
      improvement of analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete blood count (CBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. C-Reactive Protein (CRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Erythrocyte Sedimentation rate (ESR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Serum Ferritin&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. D-dimer&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Serum creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT) and Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Also, a 30-day mortality in patients with confirmed COVID-19, who are mild to moderately&#xD;
           ill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a&#xD;
      parallel-group design conducted at Fayoum university Hospital, Fayoum, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan and Methodology 1-Complete patient history will be recorded (other diseases,&#xD;
      current medications, age, sex, etc.) 2-Clinical investigation of patients by the physicians&#xD;
      at Chest Department, Fayoum University Hospital including measurements such as Temperature&#xD;
      and Oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-Patients will be tested for infection by PCR and all patients to be enrolled at the study&#xD;
      should show positive PCR result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4-The following analysis will be carried out for all the patients included in the study; CBC,&#xD;
      CRP, LDH, ESR, Ferritin, D-dimer, creatinine, ALT and AST before treatment and for follow up&#xD;
      every five days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5- A computerized tomography (CT) scan could be performed on chest before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outpatients admitted to Chest Diseases Departments of Fayoum university Hospital, will be&#xD;
      screened for the following criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (positive polymerase chain reaction by nasopharyngeal&#xD;
           swab).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mild to Moderate COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. No history of the current use of olive leaf capsules supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Severe and critical COVID-19 patients who need hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients need ventilatory support or showing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
           (COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Patients who have multiorgan failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Use of alcohol, other investigational medicines, and illegal drugs (during the last 30&#xD;
      days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and comparator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients randomized into two groups (30 in each group). The patients will be&#xD;
      divided into 2 groups Intervention group: All patients receive the standard treatment regimen&#xD;
      for COVID-19, according to the Egyptian Ministry of Health protocol, along with 2-3&#xD;
      capsules/day of standardized olive leaf containing 20-50% oleuropein (500-750 mg oleuropein&#xD;
      daily) for a period of ten days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: The standard therapeutic regimen for COVID-19 along with placebo capsules&#xD;
      daily for a period of ten days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcomes are the improvement of clinical symptoms, as well as oxygen saturation,&#xD;
      viral clearance, improvement of analysis (CBC, CRP, LDH, ESR, Ferritin, D-dimer, creatinine,&#xD;
      ALT and AST) within 10 days of randomization in patients with confirmed COVID-19, who are&#xD;
      mild to moderately ill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be allocated to one of the study arms using block randomization in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio (each block consists of 10 patients). This randomization method ensures a balanced&#xD;
      allocation between the arms during the study. A web-based system will generate random numbers&#xD;
      for the allocation sequence and concealment of participants. Each number relates to one of&#xD;
      the study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations All participants should Sign informed consent and show willingness to&#xD;
      accept randomization to any assigned treatment arm.&#xD;
