    <textblock>
      The tape will be applied on the lumbar area bilateralemten to the spine without creating any&#xD;
      tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible variation in the range of motion in hip flexion is measured with the KInovea&#xD;
      program. A kinesiology tape was used as a placebo tape and the magnetic tape was used in a&#xD;
      randomized experimental way.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A triple-blind cross-sectional observational study is designed where subjects with low back&#xD;
      pain will be selected and blinded to receive the Magnetic Tape® (tape with magnetic effects&#xD;
      of less than 2 Gauss) or placebo Tape. Likewise, the evaluator who puts the Magnetic Tape®&#xD;
      does not know what material he is using, as it is supplied by another researcher. The patient&#xD;
      does not know what tape will be placed on him.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommendations of the &quot;Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology&quot; (STROBE) will&#xD;
      be followed. All participants will receive a participant information sheet and sign informed&#xD;
      consent. Patients aged 18 to 65 years with low back pain will be recruited from different&#xD;
      private clinics in the city of Valencia, Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that when Magnetic Tape® comes into contact with electromagnetic fields&#xD;
      such as those generated by living beings, due to the movement of electrical charges (ions),&#xD;
      as defined by Ampere's Law, the domains of the tape are oriented or aligned in parallel with&#xD;
      the external magnetic field creating a magnetic flux with a north pole and a south pole. This&#xD;
      generated field in turn produces a magnetic induction proportional to the variation of the&#xD;
      magnetic flux, as defined by the Faraday Law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This electric potential produces a redistribution of the electric charge (ions) generating a&#xD;
      magnetic field due to the orientation of the tape domains, then exerting a force on the&#xD;
      moving charges within the electrolyte.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological, Lorentz's Law, regulating Magnetic Tape® aberrant electromagnetic fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol for data collection will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent and data protection, the groups with low back pain will be&#xD;
      formed that will receive the application of both Magnetic Tape® and the intervention of a&#xD;
      placebo tape. To avoid that the order of the intervention influences the results of the&#xD;
      study, the subjects will be randomized into two different groups, Group A and Group B. Group&#xD;
      A will receive Magnetic tape® and Group B will do the opposite. The next day the other tape&#xD;
      will be applied Passive joint flexion of both hips is assessed by placing the patient in a&#xD;
      supine position. The video camera is located paralelar to the hip to make recordings and&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tapes will be placed on the paravertebral skin from L1 to L5 without creating tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, both hips are assessed again, performing hip flexion again and recording the&#xD;
      degrees of range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be your control since one day a tape will be placed and the next day the&#xD;
      other.&#xD;
