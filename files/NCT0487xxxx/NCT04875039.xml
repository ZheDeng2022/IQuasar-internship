    <textblock>
      This study will compare perineural dexamethasone 2mg and perineural mixture of dexamethasone&#xD;
      2mg plus dexmedetomidine 50mcg DX plus DXD as adjuvants to local anesthetics for&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks (ICBs). The protocol is designed as&#xD;
      a superiority trial and hypothesizes that the mixture of both drugs results in longer block&#xD;
      duration. Furthermore, since analgesic and sensory duration can be influenced by the intake&#xD;
      of pain medications and surgical trauma to small cutaneous nerves, respectively, motor block&#xD;
      duration was selected as the main outcome to better target the action of both adjuvants on&#xD;
      the brachial plexus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the approval of Ethics Committee of the Hospital Clínico Universidad de Chile, a total&#xD;
      of 50 patients undergoing upper extremity surgery (elbow and below) will be recruited.&#xD;
      Recruitment will be carried out by an investigator not involved in patient care in the&#xD;
      preoperative clinic or during routine preoperative visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ICBs will be supervised by one of the coauthors and conducted preoperatively in an&#xD;
      induction room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After skin disinfection and draping, the ICB will be performed with a previously described&#xD;
      technique. In both groups, a proven 90% effective volume of 35 mL of local anesthetic&#xD;
      solution will be injected. As LA solution, it will be used a mixture of lidocaine&#xD;
      1.0%-bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 5 µ/mL. The injectate will be slowly injected through&#xD;
      the block needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive the study drug, either PN 2 mg dexamethasone or a&#xD;
      combination of PN 2 mg dexamethasone with 50 ug dexmedetomidine, mixed with the&#xD;
      above-mentioned LA solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research assistant (licensed anesthesiologist) will prepare the local anesthetic solutions&#xD;
      and will add the study drug following the randomization order. The operator, patient and&#xD;
      investigator assessing the block will be blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the duration of the motor block (defined as the temporal interval&#xD;
      between the end of LA injection through the block needle and the return of movement to the&#xD;
      hand and fingers) for patients with successful ICBs. Patients will be provided with a data&#xD;
      sheet and asked to record the time at which motor function returns. An investigator blinded&#xD;
      to group allocation will collect this data sheet in person (inpatients) or by phone&#xD;
      (outpatients) on postoperative day 1.&#xD;
