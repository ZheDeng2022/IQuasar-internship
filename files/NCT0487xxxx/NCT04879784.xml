  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMV is the most common congenital infection (an infection acquired before birth) in the UK.&#xD;
      It is the leading non-genetic cause of sensorineural (inner ear) hearing loss and a common&#xD;
      cause of neuro-disability. Congenital CMV is associated with an estimated cost of £732&#xD;
      million each year in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of acquiring CMV in pregnancy may be reduced by making simple adaptions to&#xD;
      behaviours to avoid direct contact with saliva and urine of young children. There are&#xD;
      currently no national policies that recommend CMV risk reduction measures in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of project is to establish and build effective partnerships with policy&#xD;
      makers and stakeholders to identify policy priorities and to gather the essential evidence&#xD;
      required to fully inform policies to reduce the risk of CMV infection in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective of this element of the overall project is to determine the proportion&#xD;
      of women at risk of primary CMV infection in pregnancy and the rates of primary CMV infection&#xD;
      in the first trimester of pregnancy by testing blood samples routinely collected at antenatal&#xD;
      booking at representative sites in England.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In partnership with University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust Specialist Virology&#xD;
      Laboratory, investigators will carry out a CMV serosurvey using stored antenatal serum from&#xD;
      pregnant women across England. Investigators will test these samples at the point at which&#xD;
      they would otherwise be destroyed. This will enable investigators to determine the proportion&#xD;
      of women who are seronegative, as this is the group that will be enrolled in future&#xD;
      intervention studies (both educational and also vaccine studies). This information is&#xD;
      required to accurately inform the power calculation for large efficacy studies. This will&#xD;
      also allow investigators to determine the proportion of women who acquire CMV in the first&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy - thus demonstrating the consequences of policy inaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten children are born every day in the UK with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.&#xD;
      Over half of infants who have symptoms or signs of CMV at birth have moderate to severe&#xD;
      long-term impairments such as hearing loss or neurodisability; of those infants who appear&#xD;
      well at birth, nearly 1 in 5 have long-term adverse sequalae. The impact on these families is&#xD;
      immense, even for those families whose child has normal hearing and development, as the&#xD;
      outcomes are often unpredictable at birth. The cost of CMV in the UK is around £732 million&#xD;
      each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV infection in healthy individuals is often asymptomatic or associated with mild flu-like&#xD;
      symptoms and therefore the infection may not be diagnosed in pregnancy. If a woman has a&#xD;
      primary CMV infection (i.e. never had CMV infection before, termed 'seronegative'), the risk&#xD;
      of transmission to the infant is around 32%; the risk is lower in those women who had had CMV&#xD;
      infection previously (CMV IgG antibodies present, termed 'seropositive'), in the order of 1%.&#xD;
      Acquisition of CMV infection in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with the&#xD;
      highest risk of adverse outcomes for the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of acquiring CMV in pregnancy can be reduced by making simple adaptions to&#xD;
      behaviours to avoid direct contact with saliva and urine of young children - who are the most&#xD;
      common transmitters of CMV infection to pregnant women. For example: tasting food first and&#xD;
      not eating a young child's left-over food; or kissing on the forehead instead of on the lips;&#xD;
      handwashing after nappy changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite CMV being the most common congenital infection and the leading infectious cause of&#xD;
      sensorineural hearing loss and neurodisability, it is much less well known than other&#xD;
      conditions that occur at a lower frequency, such as Down's Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the majority of antenatal care providers do not include information about CMV to&#xD;
      women alongside information about how to prevent other, much less common conditions, such as&#xD;
      toxoplasmosis. There are currently no national policies that recommend CMV risk reduction&#xD;
      measures in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are working with policy makers and other key stakeholders to identify gaps&#xD;
      which need to be addressed in future trials of interventions in pregnancy to reduce the risk&#xD;
      of CMV in pregnancy and therefore the number of infants born with congenital CMV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to inform these discussions and future research studies, investigators need accurate&#xD;
      information about the proportion of women in the UK who are seronegative - that have not had&#xD;
      CMV before. This is because future studies will enrol seronegative women in order to&#xD;
      determine if an intervention (educational intervention or vaccine) is effective. Efficacy&#xD;
      would be measured by comparing the proportion of women who seroconvert in comparison groups&#xD;
      (that is the proportion of women who become seropositive during the study). It is not&#xD;
      possible to determine acquisition of infection by a different strain (re-infection) of CMV or&#xD;
      reactivation of CMV in seropositive women using currently available techniques. Such&#xD;
      intervention studies will need to enrol thousands of women and will be therefore require&#xD;
      large amounts of resourcing, so being able to accurately power these studies is essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited data on the seroprevalence of CMV amongst women of childbearing age in the&#xD;
      UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will test stored antenatal serum from pregnant women from six sites across&#xD;
      England. Investigators will test these samples at the point at which they would otherwise be&#xD;
      destroyed, these samples would therefore not be utilised as part of clinical care.&#xD;
      Investigators will not seek consent for testing of these samples from individuals and no&#xD;
      results of blood tests will be provided to individuals. All pregnancies will be completed and&#xD;
      therefore the result would have no impact on the antenatal care. There is no routine&#xD;
      antenatal or postnatal screening done for CMV antibodies (to determine past of present&#xD;
      infection) in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be fully anonymised within the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trust Specialist Virology Laboratory and tested in using routinely performed clinical&#xD;
      procedures by NHS staff. No research staff will be involved in the transportation, receipt or&#xD;
      testing of the samples. Results will be provided by NHS laboratory staff to researchers in&#xD;
      fully anonymised form. Therefore at no time will researchers have access to patient&#xD;
      identifiers on patient samples.&#xD;
