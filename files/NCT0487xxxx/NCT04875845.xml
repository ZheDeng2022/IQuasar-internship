      Preoperative fasting was a common practice to decrease perioperative aspiration risk.&#xD;
      Duration of fasting was proportional to gastric volume. Short fasting duration may increase&#xD;
      aspiration risk. However, prolonged perioperative fasting duration may lead to dehydration&#xD;
      and hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to analyze gastric volume after 6-hour and 8-hour duration of&#xD;
      fasting after consumption of solid meal on patients scheduled for elective surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a cohort study recruiting 37 subjects from January to February 2019. Subjects were&#xD;
      patients scheduled for elective non-digestive surgery in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital,&#xD;
      Jakarta, Indonesia. Before fasting, all subjects consumed standard Cipto Mangunkusumo meal&#xD;
      and was later assessed for gastric volume using ultrasound at 6 and 8 hour after meal was&#xD;
      consumed.&#xD;

      Background. Preoperative fasting was a common practice to decrease perioperative aspiration&#xD;
      risk. Duration of fasting was proportional to gastric volume. Short fasting duration may&#xD;
      increase aspiration risk. However, prolonged perioperative fasting duration may lead to&#xD;
      dehydration and hypoglycemia. The protocols of 8 hours preoperative fasting was recommended&#xD;
      by American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) after a full meal. The meal recognized by ASA&#xD;
      to make this guidelines were Western diet that contains more fat. South East Asian (SEA)&#xD;
      standard solid meal mainly contains rice and less protein and fats. We hypothesized 6-hours&#xD;
      compared with 8-hours fasting was sufficient to provide ideal gastric volume for preoperative&#xD;
      fasting after SEA standard solid meal. The objective of this study was to analyze gastric&#xD;
      volume after 6-hour and 8-hour of fasting after consumption of SEA standard solid meal on&#xD;
      patients scheduled for elective surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This was a cohort study recruiting 37 subjects from January to February 2019.&#xD;
      Subjects were patients scheduled for elective non-digestive surgery in Cipto Mangunkusumo&#xD;
      Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Inclusion criteria were age between 18 to 60 years old, have no&#xD;
      nutritional status disorder, and ASA physical status of 1 or 2. The exclusion criteria were&#xD;
      patients with diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, abdominal distention, history of dyspepsia, and&#xD;
      intestinal motility disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects agreed to take part in the research, will be initial examined for obtaining&#xD;
      demographic data: age, weight and height, type of surgery to be performed, and preoperative&#xD;
      examinations. The subject will start 8 hours of fasting before the surgical planning time.&#xD;
      Before fasting, the subjects were given Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital food standardized&#xD;
      nutritional levels. Subjects were given 1 hour to consume the food. Six hours after the&#xD;
      standard meal is consumed, an ultrasound examination will be performed in the right lateral&#xD;
      decubitus position to obtain ultrasound imaging of the antrum. After that, the subject&#xD;
      continued fasting until 8 hours after meal and ultrasound examination was performed using the&#xD;
      same technique to obtain images of ultrasound imaging of the antrum. Imaging pictures are&#xD;
      taken at the time relaxation of the antrum, between two contractions. The results of this&#xD;
      imaging are stored and assessments of antrum craniocaudal (CC) and anteroposterior (AP)&#xD;
      diameters were performed by research assistants who don't know when the image was taken.&#xD;
      These measurements were used to calculate Cross Sectional Area (CSA) using the formula of&#xD;
      CSA=(π×CC×AP)/4. The Gastric Volume (GV) was then calculated with the formula&#xD;
      GV=27.0+(14.6×CSA)-(1.28×age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary data obtained was the result of repeated examinations. The analysis was adjusted&#xD;
      using the Bonferonni correction factor. Categorical data was analyzed using the McNemar test.&#xD;
      The results of data processing are displayed in tabular form. The gastric volume was grouped&#xD;
      into sufficient and insufficient with a border value of 1.5ml/kg.&#xD;
