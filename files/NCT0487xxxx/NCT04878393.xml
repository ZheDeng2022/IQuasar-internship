  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect information on how Rybelsus® works in people with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes and to see if Rybelsus® can lower their blood sugar levels, and to get&#xD;
      side-effects information. Participants will get Rybelsus® as prescribed to them by the study&#xD;
      doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for about 8-10 months. Participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire about how they take their Rybelsus® tablets. Participants will complete this&#xD;
      questionnaire during their normally scheduled visit with the study doctor.&#xD;
