      The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate maternal-fetal tissue light scattering&#xD;
      properties. The objectives of the study are: (i) integrate established mathematical&#xD;
      principles of oxygen saturation to model with increasing accuracy the &quot;body in a body&quot;&#xD;
      problem of fetus in mother; similar to existing pulse oximeters, the calculations will be&#xD;
      integrated into software in the final commercial product; (ii) obtain human measurements&#xD;
      against which both computational models and animal data can be compared.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, observational, non-significant risk study. The study involves using&#xD;
      non-invasive devices that measure fetal depth and tissue light scattering on the maternal&#xD;
      abdomen. Ultrasound assessment will be performed, and five images taken at the locations&#xD;
      indicated on Figure 1. Depth to fetus will be recorded along with measurement of all&#xD;
      distinctive layers. All images will be captured with minimal probe pressure applied to allow&#xD;
      accurate ascertainment of depth. Images will be anonymized, and all study data will be coded&#xD;
      with a unique identifier. Key maternal descriptive statistics will be recorded from the&#xD;
      medical record including BMI, height, weight (kg), parity, age and gestational age. The ISS&#xD;
      device is a customized commercial frequency domain oximeter (Imagent, ISS Inc.;&#xD;
      http://www.iss.com/biomedical/instruments/imagent.html) with multiple laser sources and&#xD;
      multiple detectors. This instrument is safe, uses non-ionizing radiation. The Raydiant&#xD;
      Oximetry Sensing System (ROSS) device is a non-invasive fetal pulse oximeter that measures&#xD;
      fetal arterial oxygen saturation using safe, non-invasive, transabdominal near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy. The combination of these two devices makes up the Raydiant Oximetry GEN 3&#xD;
      device. This GEN 3 device will be positioned on the maternal abdomen of women volunteers in&#xD;
      the late 3rd trimester. This sensor will measure light scattering and absorption for a period&#xD;
      of about 10-20 minutes. A second measurement may be obtained for an additional site on the&#xD;
      maternal abdomen. The Sponsor anticipates this study will require about 6-12 months to enroll&#xD;
      all study subjects at all study sites, and another month to complete primary analyses.&#xD;
