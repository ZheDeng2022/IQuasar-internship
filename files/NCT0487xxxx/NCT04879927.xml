  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to understand how screening for patient resource needs&#xD;
      followed by customized resource matching can improve outcomes for adults with breast, lung or&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research study is an intervention assessment; this is the first-time investigators are&#xD;
      examining the impact of screening for resource needs followed by customized resource matching&#xD;
      at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research study procedures include screening for social determinants of health&#xD;
           (resource) needs and, depending on study group, resource matching.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomized into one of two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Usual Care or Usual Care with customized resource matching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 125 participants will take part in this research study.&#xD;
