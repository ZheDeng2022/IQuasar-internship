  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity presents a substantial economic burden in Jordan. Binge eating disorder (BED) and&#xD;
      food addiction (FA) are the most common eating disorders associated with obesity. BED and FA&#xD;
      most therapeutic approach is cognitive-behavioral therapy. Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT)&#xD;
      the major neurotransmitter responsible for FA and BED. Daily calorie restriction (CR) and&#xD;
      intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) are two forms of diet therapy that can help weight&#xD;
      loss. Prolong fasting increases lipolysis and elevates ketones bodies' levels in the brain&#xD;
      led to a significant increase in the DA and 5HT. No prior human research has examined the&#xD;
      effect of ICR (model 8:16) on DA and 5HT levels and weight reduction on obese with BED and&#xD;
      FA. Therefore, A Randomized, controlled trial of 6 weeks follow-up will be used. A sample of&#xD;
      100 obese women will be selected to be randomly assigned to daily CR or ICR, or control group&#xD;
      without FA or BED for a period of 6 weeks. Participants will be undergoing nutrition&#xD;
      assessment, Anthropometrics assessment, food Addiction assessment (YFAS), binge eating&#xD;
      assessment (BEDS-7), and hormonal level (DA&amp;5HT) at baseline and after 6 weeks. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipated that CR and ICR (model8:16) will significantly induce DA&amp;5HT level&#xD;
      changes and that ICR (model8:16) will be significantly more effective than CR in reducing BED&#xD;
      &amp; FA.&#xD;

      This study will be conduct at nutritional and counseling center. This center is located at&#xD;
      the south area of the city: Irbid- Jordan. It is licensed by the ministry of the health as a&#xD;
      private nutritional center. This study has approval by Research Ethics Committee at the&#xD;
      University of Jordan and by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Jordan University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is composed of 2 phases. In phase one random sample of two hundred (500)&#xD;
      obese women aged 20-40 years will be selected initially to estimate the occurrence of binge&#xD;
      eating disorder and food addiction. Phase two will be conducted on a nested sample of 100&#xD;
      obese women who selected to compare the effectiveness of dietary restriction versus&#xD;
      intermittent fasting diet on weight reduction, hormonal changes among binge eaters and food&#xD;
      addict women. These two groups will be compared with a control group (20 obese women without&#xD;
      FA or BED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria will be as follows: subjects who get pregnant during the period of&#xD;
      study, subjects with certain diseases such as chronic renal failure, chronic liver diseases,&#xD;
      renal calculus, depression, subjects who were taking antidepressant drugs and any woman&#xD;
      follows special diet Participants' information will be treated confidentially. However, only&#xD;
      the researcher (PhD student) will know participants' names and she is the only one who will&#xD;
      give them identification (ID) number The personal questionnaire will contain questions&#xD;
      related to age, gender, education, employment, family income/month, residency area, smoking&#xD;
      status, family history of FA, BED, depression, medications, previous and current health&#xD;
      problems. As well as, questions about certain eating habits will be asked&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase One:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenient sample of two 500 obese women aged 20-40 years who meets the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and agree to participate in the present study will be recruited in the present study. All&#xD;
      selected sample will be assessed for BED and FA using the food Addiction assessment tool&#xD;
      (YFAS), binge eating assessment (QEWP-5) .Also physical activity level will be assessed by&#xD;
      GPPAQ (General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire). Each subject will signed a consent&#xD;
      form will be given an information sheet explaining the general background of the study&#xD;
      regarding the research objectives Phase Two&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Randomized, controlled trial of 6 weeks follow up will be conducted at the nutritional&#xD;
      counseling center, Irbid, Jordan. A nested sample of 100 obese women will be selected to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of dietary restriction versus intermittent fasting diet on weight&#xD;
      reduction and hormonal changes among binge eaters and food addict women. After the completion&#xD;
      of baseline measurement of anthropometric and biochemical data, subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to daily calorie restriction (CR) or intermittent calorie restriction (ICR),or&#xD;
      control group without FA or BED for a period of 6 weeks. All Subjects will follow the&#xD;
      standard regimen that includes restricted calories diet, detailed individualized balanced&#xD;
      menu (either regular diet or time restricted diet) based on the subject's baseline body&#xD;
      weight and height. Macronutrient distribution of the assigned diets will provide carbohydrate&#xD;
      (55-60%), protein (15-20%), fat (&lt;30%). Instructions and counseling will be provided to all&#xD;
      subjects individually; and they will be monitored every two weeks by the researcher. Each&#xD;
      participant will be evaluated and monitored separately, and all information obtained will be&#xD;
      confidential. Daily calorie requirements will be calculated using the Harris benedict&#xD;
      equation for each subject, taking into consideration the activity level. About 1100 kcal/day&#xD;
      deficit from initial energy body needs will be applied for each woman, and the expected&#xD;
      calories content of the weight-reducing diets, which will be between 1200-1500 kcal/ day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women: (REE= 447.593 + 3.098 x (Ht cm) + 9.247 x (Wt kg) - 4.330 x (Age)) To monitor and&#xD;
      evaluated the adherence of participants to their diet, they will be provide daily food record&#xD;
      sheet, these sheet will be reviewed and discussed with the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overnight fasting blood samples will be withdrawn from all groups before and after 6 weeks of&#xD;
      the dietary intervention trial. Each time, a licensed Phlebotomist will collect about 20 mL&#xD;
      of blood from each woman in tubes containing EDTA as anticoagulant. Samples then will be&#xD;
      centrifuged immediately for 20 minutes at 2500 g at 4°C and plasma will be collected in 1.5&#xD;
      mL micro tubes and stored at -80°C until they were analyzed. Blood sample preparation and&#xD;
      centrifugation will be performed by a specialist at the nutritional counseling center, Irbid,&#xD;
      Jordan. The blood samples then will be transported and stored at -20°C until analyses in a&#xD;
      private laboratory. Plasma samples will be assayed for dopamine and serotonin levels using&#xD;
      sensitive ELISA kits for the quantification of Dopamine and serotonin.&#xD;

    <description>by the diagnostic tool for food addiction - Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS), The content will be translated and the content validity will be assessed at both baseline and 6 weeks of follow-up. YFAS contains a 25-item self-report measure that includes mixed response categories (dichotomous and Likert-type format). The YFAS includes two scoring options: 1) a &quot;symptom count&quot; ranging from 0 to 7 that reflects the number of addiction-like criteria endorsed and 2) a dichotomous &quot;diagnosis&quot; that indicates whether a threshold of three or more &quot;symptoms&quot; plus clinically significant impairment or distress has been met. Food addiction can be &quot;diagnosed&quot; when three symptoms and clinically significant impairment or distress are present.</description>
