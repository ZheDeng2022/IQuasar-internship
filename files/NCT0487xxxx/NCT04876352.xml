  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of 8-week physiotherapy training using&#xD;
      immersive virtual reality (VR-training) compared to a physiotherapy training performed in a&#xD;
      real setting (RS-training) on handwriting and touch screen technology-based activities, brain&#xD;
      functional activity and cognition in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Both groups will&#xD;
      perform upper limb exercises focused at improving movement amplitude and speed during several&#xD;
      activities such as writing and using touch screen-technology. Participants randomized to&#xD;
      VR-training (N=20) will perform exercises under the augmented visual feedback induced by the&#xD;
      VR aimed at stimulating movement amplitude and speed. Participants randomized to RS-training&#xD;
      (N=20) will perform exercises in a real setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before training, after training (8 weeks) and at 3-month follow-up (20 weeks), subjects with&#xD;
      PD will undergo clinical evaluations (neurological, physiotherapy and neuropsychological)&#xD;
      while taking their regular anti-parkinsonian drugs (on-medication state). MRI scans will be&#xD;
      acquired at each time-point to assess brain activity reorganization during off state (MRI&#xD;
      scans will be acquired at least 12 hours after the regular evening dopaminergic therapy&#xD;
      administration to mitigate the pharmacological effects on neural activity). A sample of&#xD;
      matched healthy subjects (N=15) will undergo clinical, physiotherapy, neuropsychological and&#xD;
      MRI assessments only at study entry as a benchmark.&#xD;

    <measure>Systematic Screening of Handwriting Difficulties test (SOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 8 weeks of training and after 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Systematic Screening of Handwriting Difficulties test assesses handwriting quality on a paper sheet. Patients copy 5 sentences. Handwriting quality is evaluated using five items: (i) fluency in letter formation; (ii) connections between letters; (iii) regularity of letter size; (iv) space between words; and (v) straightness of the sentence. Each item is evaluated with a score ranging from zero to two. A score of zero is given when the handwriting problem does not occur or is only present in one sentence. A score of one is given if the problem appears in two or three sentences and a score of two when the problem occurs in more than three sentences. The total SOS-score is the sum of the scores on the five criteria with a range from 0 to 10, with higher scores reflecting worse quality of handwriting. Assessment during ON medication phase.</description>

    <description>Progressively difficult multimodal physiotherapy under the augmented visual feedback induced by the VR. Participants will wear a head-mounted display and their upper limb movements during the training will be captured by a motion tracker. Patients will perform: repetition of movements of upper limb single joints (shoulder, elbow and wrist) under the augmented visual feedback provided by the use of VR in increasingly wide range of movement; active upper limb multi-joints movements under the augmented visual feedback provided by the use of VR (following trajectories designed in the virtual space - movement involving shoulder, elbow and wrist joints) and handwriting tasks and touch screen technology usage in VR context on a tablet and a smartphone.&#xD;
