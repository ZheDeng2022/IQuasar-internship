    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label study to investigate the absorption,&#xD;
      metabolism, and excretion of BTZ-043 after a single oral administration of 500 mg BTZ-043&#xD;
      containing 3.7 MBq of [14C]BTZ-043 in 4 healthy adult male subjects&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 4 evaluable subjects completing all procedures are required. Six (6) subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the cohort in order to have 4 evaluable subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening period (Day -21 to -2), a baseline period (Day -1), a&#xD;
      single dose treatment on Day 1 with a minimum of 96 hours (=4 days) post dose in-house&#xD;
      observation period (Days -1 up to afternoon Day 5), and a follow-up visit 30 days (±2 days)&#xD;
      after the [14C]BTZ-043 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be administered a single 500 mg [14C]BTZ-043 dose as drinking suspension.&#xD;
      Subjects will be confined to the clinical site for at least 96 hours following drug&#xD;
      administration (ie, afternoon of Day 5). During this time, blood, feces, and urine samples&#xD;
      for measurement of [14C]BTZ-043 and metabolites will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be released from the clinic approximately 96 hours to 168 hours after dose&#xD;
      administration and upon satisfactory recovery of radioactivity (at least 90%) approved by the&#xD;
      Sponsor's scientific advisor after consulation of the Sponsor.&#xD;
