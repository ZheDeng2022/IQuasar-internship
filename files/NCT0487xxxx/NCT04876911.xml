  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that persons with a diagnosis of dementia can experience distress associated with&#xD;
      the condition. There are different ways that distress is expressed between these persons, but&#xD;
      some common occurrences include physical or verbal aggression, tearfulness, upset, confusion&#xD;
      and asking repetitive questions. Medications have typically dominated management of symptoms&#xD;
      of distress in dementia, and whilst effective, can result in other problems, such as&#xD;
      dependency and reduced effectiveness over time. Non-medical interventions may help to reduce&#xD;
      distress without the pitfalls of medications. One such intervention is Simulated Presence&#xD;
      Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulated Presence Therapy involves playing an audio and/or visual recording with a&#xD;
      comforting message from a loved one to a person with dementia to reduce distress. At present,&#xD;
      there are few studies examining its effectiveness, with some indication that Simulated&#xD;
      Presence Therapy can benefit some people, but this outcome is not consistent. One reason for&#xD;
      this may be due to the focus on diagnosis and symptoms in previous studies rather than&#xD;
      'formulation'. Formulation is an approach to healthcare that attempts to arrive at an&#xD;
      understanding of a patient's concern(s), taking into account the views of the patient, their&#xD;
      loved ones and other healthcare professionals, as well as psychological theory and research&#xD;
      evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine if Simulated Presence Therapy delivered via an iPad, when used&#xD;
      within a formulation, reduces distress in patients with moderate to severe dementia admitted&#xD;
      for long-term care in a care home or inpatient hospital ward. This study will also examine&#xD;
      how user-friendly and helpful Simulated Presence Therapy was for healthcare professionals who&#xD;
      administer it. Participants may not have the ability to provide consent; therefore, this will&#xD;
      be obtained from the legal guardian or next of kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have received a formulation that identifies Simulated Presence Therapy&#xD;
      as the preferred intervention. Their occurrence will be counted on a chart and tallied each&#xD;
      day before and after the intervention is introduced. The healthcare staff who administer&#xD;
      Simulated Presence Therapy will complete a questionnaire to evaluate their opinions on its&#xD;
      user-friendliness and effectiveness. It is hoped that this study may enable service providers&#xD;
      to better understand how to integrate Simulated Presence Therapy into healthcare services for&#xD;
      persons with a diagnosis of dementia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Persons with dementia (PwD) often present with a cluster of signs or symptoms of&#xD;
      distorted perceptions, thoughts, mood and behaviours, commonly referred to as the behavioural&#xD;
      and psychological symptoms of dementia. Psychosocial conceptualisations posit that these&#xD;
      symptoms manifest as a result of distress arising from an unmet need; thus, the term&#xD;
      'stressed and distressed behaviours' (SDB) may more accurately represent the aetiology of&#xD;
      these symptoms. This ethos has been aggregated into the Newcastle model, first conceptualised&#xD;
      by Dr Ian James and his colleagues, which emphasises a formulation-based approach to dementia&#xD;
      care. Formulation refers to the process of collaboratively developing a hypothesis regarding&#xD;
      an individual's difficulties by incorporating psychological theory and evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although formulation-based approaches are become more widespread, prescribing practices for&#xD;
      medical treatments remains suboptimal across dementia care settings. Considering the&#xD;
      personal, societal and economic burdens of SDB in PwD, coupled with the disadvantages of&#xD;
      pharmacological interventions, there remains a real need to develop effective&#xD;
      non-pharmacological, psychosocial alternatives. One such intervention is Simulated Presence&#xD;
      Therapy (SPT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPT is an intervention that involves playing a video and/or audio recording of a loved one to&#xD;
      a PwD with a reassuring message when they present with SDB. Studies examining the efficacy of&#xD;
      SPT are sparse; however, what little research that has been conducted has highlighted its&#xD;
      effectiveness in some instances. Thus far, studies have not explored SPT when it has been&#xD;
      identified as a way of addressing an unmet need through a formulation-driven assessment&#xD;
      process. Instead, it has been applied to participants within specific care settings with a&#xD;
      symptom rather than formulation-based approach. Hence, this study will explore the efficacy&#xD;
      of SPT as part of a formulation-driven approach, grounded in the Newcastle model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim/objectives (s): The present study will aim to investigate the efficacy of SPT for SDB in&#xD;
      PwD when it has been specifically identified via a Newcastle formulation as the preferred&#xD;
      intervention within care homes and hospital wards operated by the National Health Service of&#xD;
      Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) and their associated Health and Social Care Partnerships&#xD;
      (HSCP). The research is being conducted to fulfil part of the requirements of the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator's Doctorate in Clinical Psychology Qualification at the University of Glasgow,&#xD;
      and the University will therefore be an additional collaborating organisation. In terms of&#xD;
      objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objective - Introduction of SPT will significantly reduce SDB during day-to-day&#xD;
           activities when compared to activities without SPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objective - What is the acceptability of SPT amongst healthcare professionals&#xD;
           that administer it?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study will employ a randomised single case experimental design (SCED) of two&#xD;
      phases (i.e. AB) with multiple baselines. This which would involve randomly allocating PwD to&#xD;
      a staggered baseline period (A), followed by the intervention phase (B), which would last as&#xD;
      long as the corresponding baseline phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: Owing to the fact that, whilst the PwD are the participants that will form the key&#xD;
      group to answer the research question, from a technical perspective, the sample consists of&#xD;
      multiple categories of persons. For clarity, the following terms are employed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 'Participants' will refer to the PwD recruited to receive SPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 'Informants' will refer to the person who complete the two attachment/relationship&#xD;
           questionnaires for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 'Recorders' will refer to non-healthcare professionals, such as family members or&#xD;
           friends, who agree to be filmed for the SPT video.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 'Professionals' will refer to the care staff involved in the PwD's care who complete the&#xD;
           staff user-experience questionnaire within this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 'Sample' will refer to all persons participating in the study (i.e. Participants,&#xD;
           Informants, Recorders and Professionals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated minimum sample size is 13, consisting of participants (N = 6),&#xD;
      informants/recorders (N = 6) and professional(s) (N = 1). Recruitment will be from identified&#xD;
      care homes and hospital wards that receive input from NHSGGC's Older Person Psychology&#xD;
      Service (OPPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dementia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS) - This is a validated multiple-choice,&#xD;
           informant-based questionnaire, designed to categorise the severity of a patient's&#xD;
           dementia. These categories are 'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure of Attachment Adapted (MOA) - This is a measure of attachment that has been&#xD;
           adapted by the Principal Investigator for use in the present study and to be answered by&#xD;
           informants. Informants are asked to read three paragraphs and asked to tick which one&#xD;
           they feel best describes the patient. There are two sections of the measure: (1) One for&#xD;
           if the informant has known the patient before they received their diagnosis of dementia,&#xD;
           and (2) another for if the informant knew the patient ONLY after they received a&#xD;
           diagnosis. The informant needs to only complete one of these sections. Attachment style&#xD;
           can then be categorised as 'secure', 'avoidant' or 'anxious/ambivalent'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure of Attachment Qualities Adapted (MAQ) - This is a multiple-choice, Likert-scale&#xD;
           measure of attachment that has been adapted by the Principal Investigator for use in the&#xD;
           present study and to be answered by informants. There are two sections of the measure:&#xD;
           (1) One for if the informant has known the patient before they received their diagnosis&#xD;
           of dementia, and (2) another for if the informant knew the patient ONLY after they&#xD;
           received a diagnosis. The informant needs to only complete one of these sections.&#xD;
           Attachment style can then be categorised as 'secure', 'avoidant', 'ambivalent-worry' or&#xD;
           'ambivalent-merger'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAT)-informed Questionnaire - This&#xD;
           is a self-report, Likert scale questionnaire developed by the Principal Investigator&#xD;
           based on the UTAT. The measure consists of a series of statements pertaining to the&#xD;
           usefulness and effectiveness of SPT with respondents who administered SPT selecting how&#xD;
           strongly they agree/disagree with each. Higher scores are indicative of greater&#xD;
           usefulness, acceptability and/or effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency Chart - This is a chart which is used to tally the number of dSDB exhibited by&#xD;
           patients within a specific time period and day. These recordings are made by healthcare&#xD;
           staff who work directly with a patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: The process for recruitment is as follows: where capacity to consent is retained,&#xD;
      this will be sought from the participant; where the participant is deemed to not have&#xD;
      capacity to consent, informed consent for will be obtained from the relevant legal&#xD;
      guardian/next of kin; informed consent for those persons who are not healthcare&#xD;
      professionals, but complete questionnaires and record videos for the participants, will also&#xD;
      be obtained with regard to inclusion of their responses within the present study. Informed&#xD;
      consent for the staff UTAT-informed questionnaire will also be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the recruitment process, arrangements to obtain recordings and complete the MOA and&#xD;
      MAQ will be established collaboratively between the person recorded and NHSGGC OPPS. All&#xD;
      participants will have already received a Newcastle formulation as part of routine care and&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to randomly allocated to a 14, 17 or 21-day baseline period where&#xD;
      dSDB is tallied. Immediately once the baseline phase has concluded, the intervention phase&#xD;
      will commence, which will last indefinitely for the participants for whom SPT is an effective&#xD;
      intervention, although the data that will be extracted at intervention stage will be at least&#xD;
      the length of the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UTAT-informed questionnaire would be disseminated to professionals near the conclusion of&#xD;
      the data collection stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Data analysis for evaluating intervention effects in SCEDs encompasses visual&#xD;
      inspection and statistical analysis. Visual analysis involves examining level, trend,&#xD;
      variability, immediacy of effect, overlap, and consistency of data patterns within and&#xD;
      between phases. Statistical analysis will involve calculation of a Baseline Corrected Tau&#xD;
      (BC-Tau) to measure data non-overlap between the two phases (A and B). Non-overlapping data&#xD;
      as an indicator of performance difference between phases is included in standards for&#xD;
      evaluating SCEDs. Additionally, BC-Tau is useful in aggregating data across phases to produce&#xD;
      an overall effect size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the secondary objective will involve calculating the average score across&#xD;
      participants on the UTAT informed questionnaire, with a higher score indicative of greater&#xD;
      acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and safety: A number of safeguards are in place regarding sample and researcher safety&#xD;
      with relevant policies and legislation consulted in the construction of this project. These&#xD;
      are detailed in full within the uploaded research protocol. Applications/approvals will be&#xD;
      sought by an Ethics committee and NHSGGC's Research and Innovation department. Approval to&#xD;
      proceed to ethics for this project has been obtained from the University of Glasgow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timetable:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  May/June 2021: Ethics submission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  June/July 2021 - December 2021: Recruitment and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  January 2022: End of data collection, data analysis and write-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  February-April 2022: Final report article generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination/application: The results of this study will provide insight into the efficacy&#xD;
      of SPT when used as part of a formulation-driven approach to dementia care. It is anticipated&#xD;
      that this information will enable service providers to understand how to integrate SPT in&#xD;
      services and care pathways for PwD. Dissemination will occur once the final research article&#xD;
      has been generated by the Principal Investigator, which will be made available on the&#xD;
      University of Glasgow's Enlighten thesis repository for public domain access in PDF format,&#xD;
      and possibly in a paper that will be submitted for publication.&#xD;

        For participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A resident within a care home or hospital ward setting operated by NHS Greater Glasgow&#xD;
             and Clyde and/or Glasgow City HSCP, Inverclyde HSCP and/or Renfrewshire HSCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons aged ≥ 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First language must be English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of any form of dementia within the moderate to severe stages, defined as a&#xD;
             score of at least '19' on the validated Dementia Severity Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Present with SDB as confirmed by a Newcastle formulation constructed by a psychologist&#xD;
             with multidisciplinary input.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having retained the relevant cognitive faculties required to engage with audio-video&#xD;
             technologies, including attention, recognition and communication as confirmed by a&#xD;
             Newcastle formulation constructed by a clinical psychologist with multidisciplinary&#xD;
             input.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For informants, inclusion requires proficiency in the English language and having known the&#xD;
        participant before and/or after the participants diagnosis of dementia, as well as having&#xD;
        interacted with the participant in any capacity over the previous year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For recorders, inclusion criteria involved proficiency in English language and ongoing&#xD;
        contact/interaction with the participant for whom the recording is being made. This would&#xD;
        be made clear through consultation with the care team and the Newcastle formulation that&#xD;
        will have been made as part of routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Finally, regarding professionals, inclusion involves proficiency in English language and&#xD;
        being employed by NHSGGC and having worked directly on a regular basis with the participant&#xD;
        at point of recruitment (i.e. once over the previous 3-month period).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No relative/friend/caregiver available to be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant vision and/or hearing impairments that cannot be corrected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing neurological or severe psychiatric disorder (e.g. psychosis, bi-polar&#xD;
             disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed or suspected intellectual and developmental disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For informants, the main exclusion criteria include being unable to understand English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the recorders, exclusion criteria involve possible speech deficits or issues that may&#xD;
        impact the quality of the recording and/or having a full face covering that prevents a&#xD;
        recognition of a person on video. Additionally, if someone does not have a close&#xD;
        relationship or has a contentious relationship with the participant, they would not be&#xD;
        eligible to be recorded. This would be made clear through consultation with the care team&#xD;
        and the Newcastle formulation that will have been made by the team as part of routine&#xD;
        practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Finally, regarding professionals, the main exclusion criteria would be not having been&#xD;
        familiarised with the SPT procedure.&#xD;
