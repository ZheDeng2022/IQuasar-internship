      The investigators propose to prospectively conduct a neurodevelopmental evaluation of SGA and&#xD;
      late preterm neonates who underwent risk-based screening for hypoglycemia at newborn nursery&#xD;
      during the first 24 hours of life based on AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) hypoglycemia&#xD;
      guidelines at 18 to 24 months of age. As per internal neonatal unit protocol (reflecting AAP&#xD;
      guidelines), all neonates at risk of hypoglycemia (all preterm infants, term infants who are&#xD;
      SGA or LGA and IDM) are routinely screened for hypoglycemia during the first 24 hours of life&#xD;
      via bedside point of care glucose devices (see attached Weiler NICU hypoglycemia screening&#xD;
      protocol) . The investigators will compare neurodevelopmental outcomes of those who were and&#xD;
      were not hypoglycemic in the newborn nursery based on electronic health record data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic problem in neonates and a preventable&#xD;
      cause of brain injury in infancy. Key risk factors for neonatal hypoglycemia include being&#xD;
      born preterm, small for gestational age (SGA), large for gestational age (LGA), and being an&#xD;
      infant of a diabetic mother (IDM) (1). Approximately 30% of all neonates are considered at&#xD;
      risk, of whom approximately 50% develop hypoglycemia (2). Neonatal hypoglycemia is tightly&#xD;
      related to adverse neurodevelopmental and brain injury outcomes, particularly among preterm&#xD;
      infants who are SGA (3). Screening is recommended for babies with known risk factors (4).&#xD;
      Glucose is an essential molecule that supplies energy for brain consumption. Neurons and&#xD;
      glial cells in the brain are sensitive to hypoglycemia. Neonatal hypoglycemia has been&#xD;
      recognized as a cause of long-term severe neurologic and neurodevelopmental morbidity due to&#xD;
      damage to these cells (5). Neonatal hypoglycemia is a common finding associated with brain&#xD;
      injury, neurodevelopmental delay, visual impairment, and behavioral problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of hypoglycemia in the newborn period is highly variable among institutions, and&#xD;
      recommendations from different professional societies vary. In 2011, the American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Fetus and Newborn published a clinical report suggesting&#xD;
      management guidelines for late-preterm and term infants with associated risk factors,&#xD;
      targeting infants of IDM, LGA and SGA neonates (2). Of note, AAP clinical report provides&#xD;
      guidelines only for the initial 24 hours of life and recommends screening of IDM and LGA&#xD;
      infants for 12 hours and screening of SGA and late preterm infants for 24 hours. Canadian&#xD;
      Paediatric Society in their updated position statement recommends a similar screening&#xD;
      algorithm based on risk factors, stressing the importance of adequate feeding in SGA and late&#xD;
      preterm infants. The Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES) issued the recommendations for&#xD;
      evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants and children beyond&#xD;
      the initial 24 hours of life. The 2011 AAP guidelines define neonatal hypoglycemia as blood&#xD;
      glucose &lt;47 mg/dL and recommend maintaining blood glucose &gt;40 mg/dL in the first 4 hours and&#xD;
      &gt;45 mg/dl between hours 4-24 (6). The PES has an even stricter threshold of &gt;50 mg/dL. The&#xD;
      AAP guidance, however, applies only to the first 24 hours of life, and the PES strategy&#xD;
      focuses on infants beyond 48 hours of life with persistent hypoglycemia (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to poor correlation between blood glucose concentrations, clinical manifestations and&#xD;
      controversial treatment thresholds, it is difficult to define a safe blood glucose level.&#xD;
      Several studies have analyzed the effects of various ranges of hypoglycemia on&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome. However, variable results regarding the effect of hypoglycemia on&#xD;
      the neurodevelopmental outcome have been reported without any clear conclusion (5,8-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study investigators propose to prospectively conduct a neurodevelopmental evaluation&#xD;
      of SGA and late preterm neonates who underwent risk-based screening for hypoglycemia at&#xD;
      newborn nursery during the first 24 hours of life based on AAP hypoglycemia guidelines at 18&#xD;
      to 24 months of age. As per neonatal unit protocol (reflecting AAP guidelines), all neonates&#xD;
      at risk of hypoglycemia (all preterm infants, term infants who are SGA or LGA and IDM) are&#xD;
      routinely screened for hypoglycemia during the first 24 hours of life via bedside point of&#xD;
      care glucose devices (see attached Weiler NICU hypoglycemia screening protocol) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare cognitive and motor development assessed with the Bayley-4 scoring system&#xD;
           between the normoglycemic and hypoglycemic at-risk SGA/late preterm neonates&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess language development, social-emotional and adaptive behavior in the&#xD;
           normoglycemic and hypoglycemic at-risk neonates&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare Bayley-4 scores between the cohort of neonates needing intravenous (IV)&#xD;
           dextrose administration/neonatal intensive care admission to those with hypoglycemia&#xD;
           managed in the newborn nursery as well as to those neonates who remained normoglycemic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that SGA and late preterm hypoglycemic neonates admitted to&#xD;
      newborn nursery will have inferior neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 to 24 months age when&#xD;
      compared to SGA and late preterm infants with normoglycemia.&#xD;
