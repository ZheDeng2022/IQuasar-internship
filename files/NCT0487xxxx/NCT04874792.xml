    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of patients who died from COVID-19&#xD;
      in the largest hospital in Bangladesh to understand the risk associated with COVID-19 related&#xD;
      mortality in this region. This is a retrospective study where a review of hospital records of&#xD;
      patients will be done who died from COVID-19 in Dhaka Medical College Hospital from 3rd May&#xD;
      to 31 August 2020. All available demographic, clinical, laboratory information, radiological&#xD;
      feature, and patients' management will be retrieved from the record section to be analyzed&#xD;
      and described.&#xD;

      In this retrospective observational study, every consecutive patient who died and tested&#xD;
      positive for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Dhaka Medical&#xD;
      College Hospital from 2nd May 2020 to 31 August 2020 were included. The paper files of&#xD;
      patients were retrieved from the record section of the hospital as only a paper-based&#xD;
      recording is maintained in the hospital. Patients with suspected COVID-19 were excluded from&#xD;
      the study who tested negative for Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT PCR for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preformed case record form (CRF) was used to collect all available demographic, clinical&#xD;
      information including presentation, investigation, and treatment from hospital paper file&#xD;
      from the record section. The severity of disease for COVID-19 was classified according to&#xD;
      National Guidelines on Clinical Management of COVID-19 Version 8.0, 5 November 2020. The mild&#xD;
      disease was defined as an individual with COVID-19 with prodromal symptoms without dyspnea&#xD;
      and radiological abnormality. The moderate disease was defined as abnormal chest imaging with&#xD;
      the saturation of oxygen â‰¥ 90% and severe disease was denied as saturation of oxygen less&#xD;
      than 90%. All data were summarized, analyzed with SPPS 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT PCR for SARS-CoV-2 assay is done in the virology department of Dhaka Medical College to&#xD;
      detect SARS-Cov-2 RNA from samples taken from suspected patients. Nasopharyngeal swabs and&#xD;
      the oropharyngeal swab were taken from patients. Biochemical, hematological investigations&#xD;
      are done in the clinical pathology department of the hospital and paper reports are sent to&#xD;
      respective patients' files. Laboratory measurements were collected for analysis which is&#xD;
      available in the file of deceased patients in the record section.&#xD;
