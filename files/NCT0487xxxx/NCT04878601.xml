  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men in Sub-Saharan Africa are less likely to test for HIV, initiate ART, and more likely to&#xD;
      initiate ART at later stages of disease. Two overarching barriers keep HIV-positive men from&#xD;
      accessing ART services: 1) Lack of male-friendly services, and 2) harmful gender norms.&#xD;
      Home-based ART may improve ART initiation and retention among male partners who test&#xD;
      HIV-positive through Index HIV self-testing (HIVST). We will pilot an intervention that&#xD;
      provides home-based ART initiation and home-based continuation for 3-months, followed by&#xD;
      assisted linkage to facility-based care at 4-months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Men in Sub-Saharan Africa are less likely to test for HIV, initiate ART, and more likely to&#xD;
      initiate ART at later stages of disease. Achieving epidemic control requires immediate,&#xD;
      concentrated effort to engage this largely unreached population. Index partner testing,&#xD;
      whereby partners of HIV-positive clients are refereed for HIV testing, is critical to&#xD;
      identifying undiagnosed men and has been adopted as a national policy by the Malawi Ministry&#xD;
      of Health because of its high acceptability and its dramatic increase on HIV testing uptake.&#xD;
      Two overarching barriers keep HIV-positive men from accessing ART services: 1) Lack of&#xD;
      male-friendly services, and 2) harmful gender norms. Home-based ART may improve ART&#xD;
      initiation and retention among male partners who test HIV-positive through Index HIVST. We&#xD;
      will pilot an intervention that provides home-based ART initiation and home-based&#xD;
      continuation for male partners identified as HIV-positive through Index HIVST for 3-months,&#xD;
      followed by assisted linkage to facility-based care at 4-months. This intervention offers&#xD;
      opt-out ART and in-depth, male-specific counseling for 3-months before linking men to&#xD;
      facility based care. We will directly compare home-based ART to facility-based ART, whereby a&#xD;
      health care worker will conduct a home-visit with HIV+ male partners to provide confirmatory&#xD;
      HIV testing and immediate assisted linkage to a nearby facility for facility-based ART&#xD;
      initiation and continuation.&#xD;

Providers will conduct a home visit with HIV+ partners to provide confirmatory HIV testing and ART initiation with a 30-day supply. Monthly home-based ART follow-up visits with male-specific messaging and 30-day supply distribution will take place for 3-months. At 4-months providers will provide assisted linkage to a nearby facility to join the facility-based ART program. Additional counseling will be provided.</description>
