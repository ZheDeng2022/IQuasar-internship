  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure and dyspnea are common in spinal cord injury (SCI), and in acute&#xD;
      situations, any spinal cord lesion above T11 can cause abnormal respiratory function and&#xD;
      impair the airway clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although surgical decompression is one of the key early neuroprotective therapies, surgery&#xD;
      and general anesthesia disrupt many aspects of respiratory function and may cause a series of&#xD;
      postoperative pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endotracheal suction is important to reduce the risk of lung consolidation and atelectasis.&#xD;
      But for patients with respiratory insufficiency such as SCI, ordinary suction is not enough&#xD;
      to clear secretions in the deeper airways. And repeated intratracheal suction may even cause&#xD;
      some serious complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy can generally penetrate into the bronchus of grade 3-4, and fully attract the&#xD;
      secretions in it under visual conditions. Its curative effect on pneumonia and atelectasis in&#xD;
      the ICU has been affirmed, but no one has yet explored the application in the postoperative&#xD;
      care unit .&#xD;

      All patients admitted to PACU with tracheal tube after operation will be recruited, and than&#xD;
      be randomly divided into two groups during resuscitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. one group receives routine ordinary sputum suction ; the other group receives routine&#xD;
           ordinary sputum suction with bronchoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After entering the PACU, both groups will receive two lung ultrasound examinations and&#xD;
           record the lung ultrasound scores: when entering PACU and when leaving PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After returning to the ward, the doctor in charge will make medical decisions and treatments&#xD;
      based on the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up for pulmonary complications (respiratory tract infection, respiratory failure,&#xD;
      bronchospasm, atelectasis, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism, aspiration pneumonia) within 7 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up 30 days and 90 days after operation.&#xD;
