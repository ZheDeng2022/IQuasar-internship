  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) are important examinations for screening, diagnosing, and&#xD;
      treating a variety of gastrointestinal diseases. Specifically, endoscopy is one of the best&#xD;
      surveillance tools for early detection of several cancers, GIE is increasingly being used&#xD;
      because of government support for cancer screening and growing interest in preventive&#xD;
      medicine. But some patients refuse endoscopic examinations because of fear and anxiety of&#xD;
      discomfort during the procedure. Sedatives is increasingly used in GIE these years to reduce&#xD;
      the anxiety and discomfort of patients and increase patient satisfaction. Sedatives also&#xD;
      minimize the risk of patient injury during GIE and provide ideal working conditions for&#xD;
      endoscopists to improve patients' satisfaction with surgery. Sedation can be divided into&#xD;
      four levels: minimal sedation (anxiolysis), conscious sedation, deep sedation, and general&#xD;
      anesthesia. A combination of benzodiazepines and opiates (midazolam and fentanyl), the&#xD;
      medications used most commonly by gastroenterologists for procedural sedation, provides&#xD;
      adequate analgesia and sedation during colonoscopy. Besides above, propofol is an&#xD;
      intravenously administered hypnotic drug used for induction and maintenance of general&#xD;
      anaesthesia and is also used in procedural sedation. Nowadays, propofol sedation is preferred&#xD;
      by more and more endoscopists for colonoscopy procedures with its perceived benefits of rapid&#xD;
      postprocedure drug clearance, improved patient comfort and rapid recovery/discharge when&#xD;
      compared to conventional sedation. And propofol provided more rapid recovery than midazolam,&#xD;
      it has the merit of post-procedure neuropsychologic function over midazolam. Previous studies&#xD;
      have found that general anesthesia, as an independent risk factor, may lead to&#xD;
      desynchronization of the circadian rhythm, which could result in postoperative sleep&#xD;
      disorders characterized by reduced rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep (SWS).&#xD;
      Postoperative sleep disorders could cause serious adverse effects on postoperative outcomes,&#xD;
      such as postoperative fatigue, severe anxiety and depression, emotional detachment and&#xD;
      delirium, and even increased pain sensitivity or postoperative pain in patients. Previous&#xD;
      studies have found that general anesthesia, as an independent risk factor, may lead to&#xD;
      desynchronization of the circadian rhythm, which could result in postoperative sleep&#xD;
      disorders characterized by reduced rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep (SWS).&#xD;
      Postoperative sleep disorders could cause serious adverse effects on postoperative outcomes,&#xD;
      such as postoperative fatigue, severe anxiety and depression, emotional detachment and&#xD;
      delirium, and even increased pain sensitivity or postoperative pain in patients. At present,&#xD;
      there are few studies that have assessed the effect of circadian rhythm during different&#xD;
      timings of gastrointestinal endoscopy on postoperative sleep quality, and pain under general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these considerations, we sought to answer the questions in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the impact of morning operation and evening operation on the intraoperative&#xD;
           anesthetic requirement under general anesthesia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the effects of different timings of surgery on the postoperative sleep quality&#xD;
           and pain under general anesthesia?&#xD;
