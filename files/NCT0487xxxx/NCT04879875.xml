      This is a prospective, single arm, open, single centre clinical investigation designed to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility and safety of the IscAlert™ device in patients scheduled for limb&#xD;
      (arm/leg) surgery with tourniquet. IscAlert is measuring CO2 in muscular and subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue. IscAlert is inserted into normal muscle and subcutaneous tissue in ischemic (operated&#xD;
      limb with a tourniquet) and non-ischemic limb (non-operated limb).After the tourniquet is&#xD;
      inflated, ischemia develops in the muscles and subcutaneous tissue. This will result in an&#xD;
      increase in CO2, which will be detected by the sensors on the operated extremity, while the&#xD;
      sensors on the non-operated will show normal values. After releasing the tourniquet cuff, the&#xD;
      muscle will be reperfused and the CO2 level is expected to decrease into normal levels. 50&#xD;
      number of patients will be enrolled to undergo the procedures. The IscAlert will be removed&#xD;
      from the patient before the patient is discharged from the operating room, but in 25 of the&#xD;
      patients, IscAlert™ will be inserted for 72 hours in the operated extremity after the end of&#xD;
      surgery. After this, the sensors are removed. 250 Devices is planned to be used in this&#xD;
      clinical study.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, single arm, open, single centre clinical investigation designed to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility and safety of the IscAlert™ device in patients scheduled for limb&#xD;
      (arm/leg) surgery with tourniquet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 number of patients will be enrolled to undergo the procedures detailed in this clinical&#xD;
      investigational plan using 250 devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IscAlert is 0.8 mm in diameter and in vitro testing, shows stable and accurate measurements&#xD;
      of pCO2. More than 100 animal experiments have been done with the sensor. The experiments&#xD;
      have shown that the sensor detects ischemia (Increased CO2-measurements) in real time in the&#xD;
      following organs and tissues: Brain, heart, liver, kidneys, pancreas, intestines, musculature&#xD;
      and subcutaneous tissue. Sensitivity and specificity are close to 100%. The sensors are&#xD;
      inserted into tissue by a split needle technique. The split needle is the size of a 3-gauge&#xD;
      peripheral venous catheter. In animal studies, no complications have been detected when using&#xD;
      the sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IscAlert catheters are connected to an electronics unit that is fixed to the skin with an&#xD;
      adhesive plaster outside the sterile area. The electrical signals are redirected to a PC&#xD;
      approved for clinical use which continuously records tissue pressures of CO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IscAlert sensors (3 - three) are inserted into normal muscle and subcutaneous tissue proximal&#xD;
      on the limb to be operated. The insertion is distal to the blood cuff, and far away from the&#xD;
      surgery field. The insertion is done under sterile conditions in accordance with standard&#xD;
      sterility criteria at the hospital. No pain during insertion will occur because of insertion&#xD;
      is performed after anesthesia induction. Also, the insertion can be compared to an&#xD;
      intramuscular injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two identical IscAlert sensors are also inserted in the opposite extremity that is not to be&#xD;
      operated and serves as a reference value. After the tourniquet is inflated, ischemia develops&#xD;
      in the muscles and subcutaneous tissue. This will result in an increase in CO2, which will be&#xD;
      detected by the sensors on the operated extremity, while the sensors on the non-operated will&#xD;
      show normal values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After releasing the tourniquet cuff, the muscle will be reperfused and the CO2 level is&#xD;
      expected to decrease into normal levels within 15 - 45 minutes. In 25 patients, the&#xD;
      biosensors will be removed from the patient before the patient is discharged from the&#xD;
      operating room, but in 25 of the patients, IscAlert will be inserted for 72 hours in the&#xD;
      operated extremity after the end of surgery to identify drifting of the sensors. After this,&#xD;
      the sensors are removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the ability of the IscAlert device to measure CO2-levels&#xD;
      in ischemic and non-ischemic limb musculature and subcutaneous tissue in patients who&#xD;
      experience orthopedic surgery with limb tourniquet and to assess the safety/efficacy using&#xD;
      device IscAlert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IscAlert device will be able to detect the presence of ischemia in muscle and&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue, whereby CO2 levels, measured by IscAlert, will be higher in ischemic&#xD;
      musculature than non-ischemic musculature in patients undergoing orthopedic limb surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No clinically significant bleeding or infection will occur using IscAlert in this clinical&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
