    <textblock>
      This is a Pilot study for evaluating the feasibility, security and efficacy of the use of&#xD;
      Cypropheptadine, an antihistaminic and antiserotonin drug, as an adjunct of the standardized&#xD;
      treatment in a population of patient who are hospitalized and requiring oxygen therapy for&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;

      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical studies have revealed a significant increase in plasma serotonin levels in&#xD;
      patients suffering from COVID-19 multi-organ disease, which appears to be a consequence of&#xD;
      platelet hyperreactivity and dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the several potential therapeutic pathways available to modulate this serotonin&#xD;
      dysregulation is the use of cyproheptadine, an Anti-serotonergic antihistamine that can&#xD;
      potentially improve organ dysfunction related to elevated plasma serotonin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that treatment with cyproheptadine will improve clinical course&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the clinical course according to the WHO ordinal severity score for COVID-19, between&#xD;
      a retrospective and a prospective interventional cohort of patient hospitalized in the same&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the safety of the use of the cyproheptadine hospitalized patients presenting COVID&#xD;
      19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the study in term of Feasibility Recruitment rate and Study completion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the outcome in term of Death, Needs of Non-invasive and/or invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and Total Length of hospitalization Evaluate the evolution of clinical indicators&#xD;
      of oxygenation and blood parameters of inflammation, renal function, hepatic cytolysis and&#xD;
      platelet count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot trial is a non-blinded clinical designed to access the feasibility, the security&#xD;
      and the efficacy of the use of Cyproheptadine in patient hospitalized in a single center for&#xD;
      Covid-19 with comparison between:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective cohort study of patient and treated by standard care according to WHO&#xD;
      international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study of a cohort of patients hospitalized for covid 19 taking oral&#xD;
      Cyproheptadine during 10 days in addition to standard care according to WHO international&#xD;
      guidelines. The prospective study will be divided into two different phases in which two&#xD;
      different doses of cyproheptadine will be administered.&#xD;
