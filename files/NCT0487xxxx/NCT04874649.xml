      Thirty school-age children with asthma aged 7 - 12 years old who were admitted at the&#xD;
      outpatient examination room, Phramongkutklao Hospital, divided into 2 groups. The first group&#xD;
      was 15 individuals trained with sustained maximal inspiration (SMI) breathing exercise while&#xD;
      the second group was 15 individuals training with balloon-blowing breathing exercise.&#xD;
      Participants were required to complete breathing exercise 5 times per week for 8 weeks. Five&#xD;
      breathing exercises were taken for 8 weeks before and after the experiment. Physiological&#xD;
      characteristics data, pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, and asthma symptoms&#xD;
      variables were comparatively analyzed before and after training. The mean values of variables&#xD;
      before and after the experiment of each group were analyzed using paired t-test.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Thirty school-age children with asthma aged 7 - 12 years old who were admitted at the outpatient examination room, Phramongkutklao Hospital, divided into 2 groups. The first group was 15 individuals trained with sustained maximal inspiration (SMI) breathing exercise while the second group was 15 individuals training with balloon-blowing breathing exercise. Participants were required to complete breathing exercise 5 times per week for 8 weeks. Physiological characteristics data and pulmonary function variables were comparatively analyzed before and after training. The dependent variables between pre-test and post-test were analyzed by a paired t-test. Independent t-test was used to compare the variables between groups. Differences were considered to be significant at p &lt; .05.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory muscle strength change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline respiratory muscle strength at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory muscle strength was assessed by measuring Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) and Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP) in cmH2O. The participants were in a sitting position using a portable handheld mouth pressure meter (i.e., MicroRPM) with a nose clip. For the MIP measurement, the participants were asked to exhale until they felt no air remaining in their lungs (starting with the functional residual capacity [FRC] point), then held the device on their mouth and inhaled forcefully for 1-2 seconds. For the MEP measurement, the participants were asked to inhale until their lungs were completely filled with air (starting with the total lung capacity [TLC] point), then they kept the device on their mouth and exhaled forcefully for 1-2 seconds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma control change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Asthma control at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma control was measured by Childhood Asthma Control Test (C - ACT) questionnaire. The range of C-ACT scores is 0 to 27 (27 = totally controlled, 20-26 = well controlled, &lt;26 = insufficiently controlled)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Force Vital Capacity (FVC) change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Force Vital Capacity at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>FVC is the total volume of air that can be exhaled during a maximal forced expiration effort. The participants were asked to wear a nose clip while sitting on a chair, and the researcher gave the participants the step-by-step protocol to prevent an incorrect maneuver. For the FVC maneuver, three cycles of slow normal breathing were performed before demonstrating forced inspiration and expiration. FVC is measured in liters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Forced expiratory volume in 1 second at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the volume of air exhaled in the first second under force after a maximal inhalation. The participants were asked to wear a nose clip while sitting on a chair, and the researcher gave the participants the step-by-step protocol to prevent an incorrect maneuver. For the FVC maneuver, three cycles of slow normal breathing were performed before demonstrating forced inspiration and expiration. FEV1 was showed in liters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline The ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>It represents the proportion of a person's vital capacity that they are able to expire in the first second of forced expiration (FEV1) to the full, forced vital capacity (FVC). The participants were asked to wear a nose clip while sitting on a chair, and the researcher gave the participants the step-by-step protocol to prevent an incorrect maneuver. For the FVC maneuver, three cycles of slow normal breathing were performed before demonstrating forced inspiration and expiration. FEV1/FVC was showed in percentage.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Peak Expiratory Flow at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is the amount and rate of air that can be forcefully breathed out of the lungs. The participants were asked to wear a nose clip while sitting on a chair, and the researcher gave the participants the step-by-step protocol to prevent an incorrect maneuver. For the FVC maneuver, three cycles of slow normal breathing were performed before demonstrating forced inspiration and expiration. PEF is measured in liters/seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Expiratory Flow from 25% to 75% of vital capacity (FEF25-75%) change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Forced Expiratory Flow from 25% to 75% of vital capacity (FEF25-75%) at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>FEF25-75% is the average flow from the point at which 25 percent of the FVC has been exhaled to the point at which 75 percent of the FVC has been exhaled. The participants were asked to wear a nose clip while sitting on a chair, and the researcher gave the participants the step-by-step protocol to prevent an incorrect maneuver. For the FVC maneuver, three cycles of slow normal breathing were performed before demonstrating forced inspiration and expiration. FEF25-75% is forced expiratory flow over the middle one half of the FVC; the average flow from the point at which 25 percent of the FVC has been exhaled to the point at which 75 percent of the FVC has been exhaled. FEF25-75% is measured in liters/seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (MVV) change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Maximum Voluntary Ventilation at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The participants were asked to inhale and exhale quickly and forcefully for 10 seconds. Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (MVV) were measured in liters/minutes.</description>

    <description>Start by measuring the vital capacity using a balloon to determine. The width of the balloon diameter for each blow and used the value to make a balloon size control device to give to the sample group and parents to use it for home training.&#xD;
Participant sit on a chair. Inhale fully through their nose and hold for a full 3 second inhalation, then exhale through their mouth into the balloon fully. By having the balloon inflate until their touch the balloon size control device and hold the exhalation period for 1 second, cover the balloon immediately with your fingers count as 1 breath cycle, then replace the balloon immediately. Do this for 3 consecutive rounds, counted as 1 set, in each training, do a total of 3 sets, rest between sets for 1 minute, which takes about 15 minutes, 5 times per week for 8 weeks</description>
