    <textblock>
      Psychological distress commonly occurs among women during perinatal period. maternal&#xD;
      psychological distress can also bring negative influence on neonatal outcomes, such as infant&#xD;
      health, child development or mother-child interaction. Hence, developing interventions to&#xD;
      improve mental wellbeing during this period is vital. Mindfulness based intervention (MBI)&#xD;
      was found effective in reducing psychological distress. Most currently, delivering MBIs via&#xD;
      internet, which is more accessible and inexpensive, shows promising positive effect in&#xD;
      reducing psychological distress. However, randomized control trial with sufficient power is&#xD;
      await to further confirm the positive effect among pregnant women. Moreover, the positive&#xD;
      effects of MBIs was found associated with the heart rate variability biofeedback. However,&#xD;
      the efficacy of MBI on HRV is rarely studied among pregnant women. Also, the potential&#xD;
      association of HRV between MBI and psychological wellbeing needs further examination. This&#xD;
      research aims to test the effectiveness of the Guided-Mobile Based Perinatal Mindfulness&#xD;
      Intervention (GMBPMI) among pregnant women experiencing psychological distress during the pre&#xD;
      and post-natal period, as well as examining the efficacy of GMBPMI on HRV.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Being pregnant, giving birth and turning into a mother are three closely&#xD;
      intertwined major life transitions that a woman would experience within a short period of&#xD;
      time. This period is often clouded by intense distress due to dramatic physical and&#xD;
      psychosocial changes. In Hong Kong, a highly competitive and work-intense society, women face&#xD;
      pressures on all fronts. Hong Kong ranks among the fifth with the oldest first-time mother in&#xD;
      the world. Pregnancy at an older age is a known risk factor for antenatal depression. Women's&#xD;
      labor force participation rate in Hong Kong is high - 84.1% in the 20-39 age group. The&#xD;
      difficulty of balancing work and life is amplified when a woman is pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adverse consequences of stress are broad and far-reaching, shaping obstetric and neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes, including increased analgesic use and unplanned cesarean delivery, preterm&#xD;
      delivery, low birth weight and Apgar scores, smaller head circumference and major congenital&#xD;
      anomalies. Research started to reveal that the disrupting maternal cardiovascular system in&#xD;
      pregnant women with elevated psychological distress, indexed by low heart rate variability&#xD;
      (HRV), might be a mechanism for the worsening of birth outcomes. However, the finding is not&#xD;
      conclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recent decade, empirical research supporting the efficacy of prenatal&#xD;
      mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) has emerged. MBI cultivates abilities that are&#xD;
      important to pregnant women and new mothers, such as savoring, self-acceptance and&#xD;
      psychological flexibility. In Hong Kong, the investigators developed and evaluated a&#xD;
      cultural-sensitive MBI - Eastern-Based Meditation Intervention (EBMI) for pregnant women. The&#xD;
      intervention not only showed significantly positive effects on prenatal distress coping and&#xD;
      salivary cortisol reduction, but also associated with positive infant outcomes, including a&#xD;
      higher cord blood cortisol level at birth and a less difficult temperament. Higher cord blood&#xD;
      cortisol levels are believed to protect against the development of neonatal health&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the efficacy of prenatal MBI has been revealed in the past decade, the availability and&#xD;
      usage of the programme remain low for various practical reasons. Moreover, providing only a&#xD;
      limited number of lessons, mostly in the second trimester, seems insufficient. It is highly&#xD;
      desirable to provide extended support so as to ensure continued mindfulness practice in both&#xD;
      pre and postnatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the predicaments of pregnant woman/new mother, a guided mobile-based MBI appears&#xD;
      to be more feasible than the traditional face-to-face mode. Grounded on EBMI, the&#xD;
      investigators developed and satisfactorily piloted a guided mobile-based perinatal&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention (GMBPMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE and DESIGN The project aims to rigorously evaluate GMBPMI. The research adopts a&#xD;
      parallel-armed, randomized controlled trial design. To control for confounding effects, such&#xD;
      as attention and placebo effect, the trial will utilize an active control group. Participants&#xD;
      in the control group will receive psychoeducation on perinatal care mimic the schedule and&#xD;
      level of support of the experimental group.The target sample size is 198.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women in the second trimester will be recruited to the program. With the support of&#xD;
      a trained research assistant (RA), participants can take the 6 weekly EBMI lessons online&#xD;
      flexibly at home. The RA will provide continued prompt and support for mindfulness practice&#xD;
      to each participant till 5 weeks postpartum. The RA is backed up by the PI and co-I's who are&#xD;
      experienced mental health practitioners and mindfulness teachers. One of them is an&#xD;
      experienced obstetrics and gynaecology specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED OUTCOME In Hong Kong, around 50,000 newborn babies are delivered each year. To meet&#xD;
      the service needs of this scale, it is imperative for us to develop a cost-effective,&#xD;
      accessible and acceptable intervention, tailored to the predicaments of women during the&#xD;
      perinatal period. To address the barrier and cost issues, a guided mobile-based perinatal&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention appears to be a good choice. If the model is shown to be effective,&#xD;
      it can be a practical solution to a large scale mental health issue - benefiting women&#xD;
      significantly during pregnancy, as well as enhancing the subsequent mental health outcomes of&#xD;
      these women and the well-being of their babies.&#xD;
