  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Truvada®, an oral pill comprised of two anti-retroviral compounds, emtricitabine (FTC) and&#xD;
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), is currently the only drug combination approved for&#xD;
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in women exposed to high HIV risk through vaginal&#xD;
      acquisition. Adherence to the one pill per day regimen is crucial for its effectiveness in&#xD;
      reducing the risk of acquiring HIV. Currently, there is no available point of care diagnostic&#xD;
      test to quickly measure blood levels of tenofovir in the clinic. This study will determine&#xD;
      whether a tenofovir (TFV) aptamer-based biosensor (aptasensor) can detect TFV in biological&#xD;
      fluids from women randomized to different dosing regimens representing high and low&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project ADHERE is a pilot, prospective, randomized study which will screen approximately 20&#xD;
      healthy, non-pregnant, HIV negative, premenopausal women (aged 18-50) at Eastern Virginia&#xD;
      Medical School (EVMS) who are not at risk of pregnancy and are at low risk for sexually&#xD;
      transmitted infections (STIs) in order to have approximately 14 women complete all study&#xD;
      visits. The women will be randomized to one of two different dosing regimens of Truvada for&#xD;
      up to 14 days. The low adherence cohort will take a total of 3 Truvada pills per week while&#xD;
      the high adherence cohort will be assigned to take daily dosing, 7 pills per week. At&#xD;
      screening (visit 1), we will screen women for HIV-1 and perform STI tests and serum screening&#xD;
      for HepB and creatinine clearance prior to commencing oral PrEP, consistent with oral PrEP&#xD;
      initiation guidelines. After screening labs return, they will come to the clinic for visit 2&#xD;
      when baseline blood, urine, and vaginal fluid will be collected, randomize participants to&#xD;
      the dosing regimen, watch the participants ingest the first dose, and then direct to them to&#xD;
      take subsequent doses in their homes. Reminder text messages will be sent to the participants&#xD;
      to facilitate doses being taken at the same time of day upon which they will text message the&#xD;
      coordinator after ingesting the pill. Participants will return 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days&#xD;
      after visit 2 for pre-dose collection of blood, urine, and vaginal fluid samples (visits 3,&#xD;
      4, and 5, respectively). For all visits, participants will not to take the next prescribed&#xD;
      dose before coming to the clinic. Once samples are collected, participants will ingest the&#xD;
      next scheduled pill. However, for the high adherence regimen, the women will take their last&#xD;
      dose on day 14 and then come to the clinic 24 hours later on day 15 for collection of&#xD;
      samples. Regardless of regimen, sample collection will take place no earlier than 24 hours&#xD;
      after last dosing to prevent white coat effects. Samples will be brought to the laboratory&#xD;
      for processing and eventual measurement of TFV levels by the TFV aptasensor. Aliquots of&#xD;
      plasma and urine will also be analyzed by LC-MS/MS so sensitivity and specificity of the&#xD;
      aptasensor can be determined. The ability of the TFV aptasensor to distinguish levels&#xD;
      associated with high and low adherence will also be assessed.&#xD;
