  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of larotrectinib in treating patients with NTRK gene&#xD;
      amplification positive solid tumors that have spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes&#xD;
      (locally advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic). Larotrectinib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine overall response rate (ORR) to larotrectinib sulfate (larotrectinib) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors harboring NTRK amplification and pan-TRK expression by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC), calculated as the proportion of subjects with confirmed complete&#xD;
      (CR) or partial response (PR) as best response and as assessed by Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 and Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology&#xD;
      (RANO) criteria in primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the duration of response (DOR) in subjects with CR or PR as best response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the proportion of subjects with any tumor regression as best response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the growth modulation index (GMI) following initiation of larotrectinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) following initiation of&#xD;
      larotrectinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR) based on the proportion of subjects with best&#xD;
      response of CR, PR, or stable disease lasting &gt;= 16 weeks following initiation of&#xD;
      larotrectinib safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess the safety profile and tolerability of larotrectinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 amplification by next-generation sequencing of&#xD;
      tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC signaling in fresh pre-treatment tumor biopsies,&#xD;
      with the aim of elucidating TRK biology and modifiers of response to larotrectinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize concurrently activated oncogenic pathways in fresh pre-treatment tumor&#xD;
      biopsies, with the aim of elucidating TRK biology and modifiers of response to larotrectinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive larotrectinib sulfate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients who experience disease&#xD;
      progression and are deriving clinical benefit from larotrectinib may continue treatment per&#xD;
      physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks (after the final dose of the last cycle of treatment (between 21 and 35 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs, and electrocardiogram results. Overall safety profiles will be provided along with tumor-specific profiles. Treatment-emergent adverse events, defined as adverse events that start on or after the first administration of study drug, will be summarized based on the number and percentage of subjects experiencing the event, as defined by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system organ class and preferred term. In the event a subject experiences repeat episodes of the same adverse event, then the event with the highest severity grade and strongest causal relationship to study drug will be used for purposes of incidence tabulations.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Locally-advanced or metastatic malignancy with an NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 gene&#xD;
             amplification identified through molecular assays (such as any next-generation&#xD;
             sequencing [NGS] platform, reference lab NGS, or in house NGS platform) as routinely&#xD;
             performed at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center or other&#xD;
             similarly-certified laboratories. The minimum level of amplification is 7 copies. This&#xD;
             rationale of amplification level is based on data from MOCLIA at The University of&#xD;
             Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have received prior standard therapy appropriate for tumor type and stage of&#xD;

             clinically meaningful benefit from appropriate standard of care therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST v1.1. Subjects with&#xD;
             primary CNS tumors should meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must have received prior treatment including radiation and/or chemotherapy, with&#xD;
                  radiation completed &gt; 12 weeks prior to cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1) of therapy, as&#xD;
                  recommended or appropriate for the tumor type&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must have &gt;= 1 site of bi-dimensionally measurable disease (confirmed by magnetic&#xD;

                  the measurable lesions &gt;= 1 cm in each dimension&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must have imaging study within 28 days before enrollment. If on steroid therapy,&#xD;
                  the dose must be stable for at least five days immediately before and during the&#xD;
                  imaging study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score =&lt; 3. If enrolled with primary CNS&#xD;
             tumor to be assessed by RANO, Karnofsky performance score (KPS) &gt;= 70 %&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Archived tumor tissue. If archival tissue is unavailable, an on-study tumor biopsy&#xD;
