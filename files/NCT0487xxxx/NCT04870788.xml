  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial develops effective and appropriate mindfulness-based interventions that&#xD;
      help meet the needs of Latino cancer patients and their family caregivers. Mindfulness-based&#xD;
      interventions focus on building awareness of thoughts, emotions/feelings, and the sensations.&#xD;
      This study may help improve mental well-being and reduce stress and anxiety associated with&#xD;
      having cancer or with a family member's cancer diagnosis.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Systematically and culturally adapt a mindfulness-based intervention to improve&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing in Latino patients with advanced cancer and their family caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the feasibility of the adapted mindfulness-based intervention and overall study&#xD;
      procedures in Latino patient-family caregiver dyads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the effects of the adapted mindfulness-based intervention on the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes of patient and caregiver psychological distress, quality of life (QOL), and patient&#xD;
      cancer symptoms, compared to a waitlist control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients and their partners are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients and their partners participate in mindfulness program over 60 minutes&#xD;
      consisting of meeting with a mindfulness coach to build awareness of thoughts, emotions,&#xD;
      feelings, and sensations 1 time per week (QW) for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients and their partners participate in mindfulness program as in Group I&#xD;
      beginning 12 weeks after starting the study.&#xD;
