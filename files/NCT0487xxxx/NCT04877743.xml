  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV real-world, observational, non-interventional, prospective cohort study of&#xD;
      adults vaccinated with AZD1222. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of AZD1222 in adults vaccinated in real-world settings.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use an innovative digital platform (study app and web portal) as well as a&#xD;
      traditional call centre to collect participant responses to a series of health and well-being&#xD;
      questionnaires over an 18-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research coordinators at vaccination sites will invite vaccinated adults to join the study.&#xD;
      Participants can enrol at the vaccination site with assistance from a research coordinator or&#xD;
      can take home a study information brochure and enrol within 28 days after the first dose of&#xD;
      AZD1222. Research coordinators and the study call centre will be available to assist with&#xD;
      enrolment and informed consent, as needed. Electronic consent using the study app will be an&#xD;
      option where permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants using the digital platform will set up a secure account, complete the enrolment&#xD;
      questionnaires, and provide details of their vaccination to confirm eligibility. Non-digital&#xD;
      participants will complete the enrolment questionnaires and confirm eligibility at a&#xD;
      vaccination site or by a telephone call to the call centre. After enrolment, participants&#xD;
      will be contacted to complete follow-up questionnaires at timed intervals over an 18-month&#xD;
      period after their first AZD1222 dose. Digital participants will receive push notifications&#xD;
      or emails and non-digital participants will receive phone calls. Participants can also submit&#xD;
      unscheduled adverse event (AE) reports through the digital platform and call centre.&#xD;
