  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the to analyze the patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      complication rates under controlled conditions of the increasingly popular prepectoral&#xD;
      technique for implant-based breast reconstruction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial involving adult women&#xD;
      undergoing two-stage implant-based breast reconstruction for either breast cancer or breast&#xD;
      cancer risk reduction. The aim is to generate high quality evidence before establishing the&#xD;
      prepectoral technique as routine care. A favorable safety and patient satisfaction profile&#xD;
      will bring high quality evidence supporting the adoption of a technique that has shown&#xD;
      similar complication rates while eliminating animation deformity and its associated pain and&#xD;
      discomfort in retrospective and non-randomized studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mastectomy flap perfusion will be assessed clinically and using SPY fluorescence imaging.&#xD;
      Immediately following mastectomy, participants will be randomized to one of two treatment&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will be composed of participants who will undergo prepectoral reconstruction with&#xD;
      Acellular Dermal Matrix (ADM) by means of the anterior tenting technique. In this technique,&#xD;
      two sheets of contour, fenestrated ADM sutured together are trimmed in accordance with the&#xD;
      measurement of the expander/implant and fixed to the pectoralis major muscle covering the&#xD;
      entire anterior surface of the device&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (current standard of care (SOC)) will be composed of participants who will undergo&#xD;
      partial subpectoral reconstruction with ADM by means of the sling technique. In this&#xD;
      technique the leading edge of the pectoral muscle is elevated and a subpectoral pocket is&#xD;
      fashioned. The lower medial origin muscle fibers are released for anatomical expander&#xD;
      seating. An ADM sling is sutured from the leading edge of the pectoralis muscle to the&#xD;
      inframammary fold (over the expander) and laterally to close the expander pocket.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient satisfaction as measured by BREAST-Q-scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be assessed using BREAST-Q-scores. BREAST-Q is a patient-reported outcome instrument used to assess the outcomes of different breast surgeries among women. Modules selected will be &quot;Psychosocial Well-Being, Physical Well-Being: Chest and Satisfaction with Breasts&quot; within the Reconstruction (Preoperative) module and &quot;Psychosocial Well-Being, Physical Well-Being: Chest, Satisfaction with Breasts and Satisfaction with Implants&quot; within the Reconstruction (Postoperative) module&#xD;
For each BRESAT-Q scale, items are summed and transformed to a score with range from 0 to 100, and with greater values representing more satisfaction and higher levels of breast related quality of life.&#xD;
A two-sample T-test will be used to assess the changes in mean scores of satisfaction between two arms</description>
