  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study asks: &quot;what behavioral strategies are needed to help socially disconnected&#xD;
      Hispanic/Latino caregivers with significant barriers to increasing connectedness?&quot; This study&#xD;
      uses a mixed methods approach to adapt a brief behavioral intervention-Social Engage&#xD;
      psychotherapy-for use with socially disconnected Hispanic/Latino caregivers. This study is a&#xD;
      single-arm clinical trial of Social Engage psychotherapy. We propose to enroll 30&#xD;
      participants for up to 8 weekly individual Social Engage psychotherapy sessions, over up to 3&#xD;
      months. Subjects will be aged 50 and older, and be caregivers for a community-dwelling family&#xD;
      member with ADRD, living with (or in close proximity to) the family member with dementia,&#xD;
      experiencing elevated caregiving distress and social disconnectedness.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction at Post Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scales (BPNSFS) will be used. The BPNSFS consists of 24 items assessing both satisfaction and frustration in the need for competence, autonomy, and relatedness, as posited by Self-Determination Theory. We will report changes in the three BPNSFS subscales measuring satisfaction in: autonomy, relatedness and competence. Items are scored on a 1-5 Likert scale with each subscale score ranging from 4-20. Higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. Mean change in subscale scores (change = post intervention scores - baseline scores) will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Loneliness at Post Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3 will be used to assess self-reported loneliness. 20 items, rated as to how often the participant has felt a certain way in the prior month (e.g., &quot;How often do you feel alone?&quot;) -- &quot;never&quot; (1), &quot;rarely&quot; (2), &quot;sometimes&quot; (3), or &quot;often&quot; (4). Higher scores indicate greater loneliness. However, some individual items must be reverse-coded so that higher total scores reflect greater loneliness (i.e., 1=4, 2=3, 3=2, 4=1). These items (e.g., &quot;How often do you feel there are people you can turn to?&quot;) are items 1,5,6,9,10,15,16,19,20. Total scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores representing a worse outcome (i.e., greater loneliness). Mean change in total scores (change = post intervention scores - baseline scores) will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Social Functioning at Post Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities (PROMIS) is a computerized adaptive test (CAT). It produces T scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Greater scores indicate better outcomes (i.e., greater satisfaction with social role and activities). Mean change in T scores (change = post intervention scores - baseline scores) will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Quality of Life at Post Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF is a 36-item measure of several domains (physical health, psychological health, social relationships, environment) of health related quality of life. Higher scores denote higher quality of life. Items are scored on a 1-5 Likert scale with each domain score ranging from 3-40. Mean change in domain scores (change = post intervention scores - baseline scores) will be reported.</description>

    <description>Engage Coaching helps caregivers bolster motivation for increasing connectedness, teaches problem solving skills, and provides behavioral practice with social engagement. Up to 8 brief sessions (typically 30 minutes) are provided weekly over no more than three months.</description>

    <intervention_name>Engage coaching</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will complete up to 8 weekly individual Social Engage psychotherapy sessions. Participants will be allotted up to 3 months to complete all sessions, a time-frame that allows for two weeks without meeting to address life stressors such as illnesses that may pop up. All sessions are provided via phone or videocall (Zoom). The first and last session are longer - up to 60 minutes if needed. Middle sessions are shorter (20-45 minutes). Engage is a stepped care psychotherapy in that the simplest strategy is taught first-action planning (a derivative of problem solving therapy)-and &quot;barrier strategies&quot; are added only if needed. Action plans are designed to address loneliness and social isolation in the context of caregiving demands.</description>
