  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breathing is one of the body's vital functions that occur under normal conditions using the&#xD;
      nose. When humans breathe primarily through the mouth instead of the nose, this is referred&#xD;
      to as mouth breathing. Snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occur frequently in mouth&#xD;
      breathers. Mouth breathing impairs oral health, reduces quantity and quality of saliva, and&#xD;
      increases dry mouth, risk of developing dental caries, gingival inflammation, bad breath and&#xD;
      dry lips. Serious health conditions associated with an obstructed upper airway in those who&#xD;
      snore include hypertension, cardiovascular disease and mild cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral appliances (OAs) that bring the lower jaw (mandible) forward have been shown to be&#xD;
      highly effective in reducing snoring and interruptions in breathing (respiratory events) that&#xD;
      occur in those who snore and/or have OSA. The myTAP™ OA (AMI, Dallas, TX) includes an&#xD;
      optional mouth shield (MS) that is anticipated to promote nasal breathing. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the effects of oral appliance plus mouth shield therapy on sleep&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory dynamics (breathing and heart activity) and their effect on improving OSA&#xD;
      and oral health, especially of the periodontal tissues, in confirmed mouth breathers who&#xD;
      snore and/or have OSA. As many as 70 adults at least 18 years old will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will wear the OA during sleep for 8 weeks (Phase 1). Half of the&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to wear the OA only for the first 4 weeks; all will&#xD;
      wear both the OA and MS for the last 4 weeks. Participants will wear an easy-to-use home&#xD;
      sleep recording system (NOX T3) for 2 nights at the start of the study and again at 4 weeks&#xD;
      and 8 weeks. Based on the investigators' experience, some participants will not have achieved&#xD;
      maximal benefit from the OA at 8 weeks, and will require addition adjustment. These&#xD;
      participants will enter a second phase of the study where they will have 1 or more sleep&#xD;
      studies done at 2 week intervals, and will further adjust their OAs (that is, advance the&#xD;
      mandible) to eliminate snoring.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Respiration is one of the body's vital functions that occurs under normal&#xD;
      conditions using the nose. When nasal breathing is supplemented by or supplanted through the&#xD;
      mouth, this is referred to as mouth breathing. Primary snoring and obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
      (OSA) are frequent findings in mouth breathers, regardless of age. In children, mouth&#xD;
      breathing is often associated with enlarged adenoids and tonsils, changes in body posture,&#xD;
      hyperactivity, attention deficit and impaired learning. In all ages, mouth breathing impairs&#xD;
      oral health, reduces quantity and quality of saliva, and increases dry mouth, risk of&#xD;
      developing dental caries, gingival inflammation, bad breath and dry lips. Symptoms associated&#xD;
      with an obstructed upper airway in those who snore include hypertension, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and mild cognitive impairment. There are currently no data on the effects of oral&#xD;
      appliance plus mouth shield therapy on sleep cardio-respiratory dynamics and their effect on&#xD;
      improving OSA and oral health, especially periodontal health, in mouth breathers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Evaluation of the effects of the FDA cleared MyTAP midline traction type oral&#xD;
      appliance (OA; AMI, Dallas, TX) in combination with its FDA-cleared mouth shield (MS) in&#xD;
      treating confirmed mouth breathers who snore and/or have OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis: Sample size (n=40) is based on a-posteriori power of 80% observed in the&#xD;
      investigative team's recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two OA&#xD;
      designs. As many as 70 participants will be enrolled to account for drop-outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Single center, prospective randomized clinical trial using a parallel group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Using an online randomizer software, half of the subjects will be assigned to&#xD;
      Group &quot;OA plus MS 8wk&quot;, OA use with MS for 8-weeks and group &quot;OA Alone 4wk&quot; (no MS) for first&#xD;
      4-weeks. The OA Alone 4wk group will add MS use after 4-weeks and continue to use the&#xD;
      combination for subsequent 4-weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically standard periodontal exams will be performed at baseline (T0), after 4-weeks (T2)&#xD;
      and after 8 weeks (T3). The dentist-fitted OA will be applied chair-side and adjusted to a&#xD;
      starting position of 60% of the lower jaw's maximum comfortable protrusion. All participants&#xD;
      will wear the OA nightly during sleep for 8-consecutive weeks. Subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
      advance the jaw up to 0.5 mm every 2 nights (less frequently if needed to minimize transient&#xD;
      discomfort). Subjects will use the EverSleep Wearable Sleep Tracker app (Somno Health Inc.,&#xD;
      Golden CO) on their smart phones to monitor their own snoring nightly, and self-titrate their&#xD;
      OAs until no snore detection is reported by the software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the investigators' recently completed study (IRB2017-0390) and another study&#xD;
      published on this kind of appliance, some participants will not have achieved maximal benefit&#xD;
      from the OA, and will require addition adjustment. These participants will enter Phase 2 of&#xD;
      the study where they will have 1 or 2 more sleep studies done at 2 week intervals, and will&#xD;
      further adjust their OAs (that is, advance their lower jaws) to eliminate snoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate differences in sleep respiration events, snoring and other&#xD;
      measures at all time points except T1. Periodontal exams (gums and supporting tissues) will&#xD;
      be performed at T1-T3 and T5. Comparison will be done between and within group (that is, with&#xD;
      and without the MS) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of collecting sleep data with OA use is to determine its success in promoting&#xD;
      stable respiration during sleep and reducing the number of events in which breathing stops&#xD;
      (apneas) or diminished (hypopneas) and the amount of oxygen in the blood is low (oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sleep recorder (NOX T3, Nox Medical , Reykjavík, Iceland) is a Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) cleared and certified for sale within the European Economic area (CE&#xD;
      marked). The midline traction oral appliance (myTAP, AMI Inc., Dallas Texas) is currently&#xD;
      marketed as a medical device to treat snoring and obstructive sleep apnea and is FDA cleared&#xD;
      and CE marked. The EverSleep device (Somnohealth, Golden Colorado) is a wearable sleep&#xD;
      coaching device and is not an FDA 510(k) cleared medical device.&#xD;

REI is reported instead of Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI), as it is a more appropriate measure for home sleep testing. Apneas are scored when there is a 90% drop in the flow signal between 10 and 120 seconds. Hypopneas are scored when there is a 30% drop in flow signal between 10 and 120 seconds followed by either a drop in oxygen saturation or an arousal.</description>
