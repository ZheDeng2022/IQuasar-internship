  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is concern that wearing a face mask during COVID will affect oxygen uptake, especially&#xD;
      during intense exercise. COVID transmission is especially prevalent in sports such as hockey,&#xD;
      where there is close contact between players and arena ventilation is poor. This study will&#xD;
      assess the effect of wearing a surgical face mask on simulated hockey performance and blood&#xD;
      and muscle oxygenation during cycling exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sport of ice hockey involves close contact between players in poorly ventilated arenas.&#xD;
      This increases susceptibility for transmission of viruses, such as COVID-19. Face masks can&#xD;
      reduce the risk of virus transmission; however, there is concern that wearing a face mask&#xD;
      during exercise will reduce oxygen uptake or increase carbon dioxide re-breathing, which can&#xD;
      result in low blood oxygen levels, reduced oxygen delivery to muscle and reduced exercise&#xD;
      capacity. The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of wearing a surgical face mask&#xD;
      during exercise that simulates ice hockey play on exercise performance and blood and muscle&#xD;
      oxygenation in boys and girls. Twelve boys and twelve girls (age 9-14y) who are experienced&#xD;
      playing hockey, will take part in this randomized cross-over study that will assess exercise&#xD;
      performance, blood oxygenation (i.e. pulse oximetry) and muscle oxygenation (with near&#xD;
      infrared spectroscopy) during an exercise test on a cycle ergometer with workloads and work&#xD;
      to rest intervals that simulates hockey performance. Participants will also be tested for&#xD;
      repeated-sprint performance on ice while wearing full hockey equipment. The conditions&#xD;
      include no mask (a &quot;sham&quot; mask) and a surgical mask. Outcome variables include power output&#xD;
      during the cycle ergometer testing, skating distance during the on-ice test, rating of&#xD;
      perceived exertion, blood oxygen saturation levels, and oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total&#xD;
      hemoglobin at the quadriceps muscle.&#xD;
