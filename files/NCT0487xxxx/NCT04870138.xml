  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, interventional, non-randomized, experimental infection model study in&#xD;
      healthy adult males (N=up to 25) between the ages of 18-35 at study enrollment. The study is&#xD;
      designed to test the requirements of predicted N. gonorrhoeae virulence determinants for&#xD;
      gonococcal infection in the male urethra through infection with engineered mutants of N.&#xD;
      gonorrhoeae. We predict that mutations abolishing expression of N. gonorrhoeae virulence&#xD;
      determinants will eliminate or significantly reduce gonococcal infectivity or the ability to&#xD;
      induce inflammation in an infected individual, thus identifying potential vaccine candidates.&#xD;
      Study duration will be 1 year, and the duration for all participants will be about 3 weeks.&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to compare the ability of different engineered mutants&#xD;
      of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to cause a clinical infection (signs or symptoms of urethritis such&#xD;
      as discomfort during urination, urethral discharge, etc.) in the male urethra.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1, interventional, non-randomized, experimental infection model study in&#xD;
      healthy adult males (N=up to 25) between the ages of 18-35 at study enrollment. The study is&#xD;
      designed to test the requirements of predicted N. gonorrhoeae virulence determinants for&#xD;
      gonococcal infection in the male urethra through infection with engineered mutants of N.&#xD;
      gonorrhoeae. We hypothesize that key virulence determinants involved in N. gonorrhoeae&#xD;
      adherence and resistance to innate immunity are essential for infection in the male urethra.&#xD;
      We predict that mutations abolishing expression of these virulence determinants will&#xD;
      eliminate or significantly reduce gonococcal infectivity or the ability to induce&#xD;
      inflammation in an infected individual, thus identifying potential vaccine candidates. For&#xD;
      each mutant to be investigated under this protocol, initial trials will be conducted in which&#xD;
      subjects receive a bacterial inoculum containing a mixture of equivalent numbers of two&#xD;
      isogenic strains, differing in expression of one or more genes. A competitive advantage for&#xD;
      one strain during urethral infection will be manifest by recovery of that strain in a&#xD;
      statistically significantly higher proportion of isolates recovered from infected subjects&#xD;
      than in the inoculum. Following infections with mixed inocula, infectivity of the mutant in&#xD;
      single-strain infections will be compared to that of the wild-type in single-strain&#xD;
      infections. In addition, the proportion of infected subjects that develop signs or symptoms&#xD;
      of urethritis with mutant and wild- type inocula will be compared. The Mixed FA7527/FA1090&#xD;
      group (n = up to 25 ) will receive a bacterial inoculum containing a mixture of equivalent&#xD;
      numbers of the isogenic mutant and WT strains. In single-strain infections, the Mutant FA7527&#xD;
      group (n = up to 8) will receive a bacterial inoculum containing only the isogenic mutant N.&#xD;
      gonorrhoeae strain, and the Wild-type FA1090 group (n = up to 8) will receive a bacterial&#xD;
      inoculum containing only the wild-type (WT) N. gonorrhoeae strain. All subjects will be&#xD;
      examined daily for symptoms of infection and receive antibiotic treatment at the end of the&#xD;
      inpatient portion of the trial. Study duration will be 1 year, and the duration for all&#xD;
      participants will be about 3 weeks. The primary objective of the study is to compare the&#xD;
      ability of different engineered mutants of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to cause a clinical&#xD;
      infection (signs or symptoms of urethritis such as discomfort during urination, urethral&#xD;
      discharge, etc.) in the male urethra. The study secondary objectives are to: (1) characterize&#xD;
      host immune responses to infection by measuring cytokines and other mediators in specimens&#xD;
      including serum, peripheral blood lymphocytes and urine obtained from subjects before, during&#xD;
      and after experimental gonococcal infection, and (2) characterize bacterial gene expression&#xD;
      during experimental infection.&#xD;
