  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate whether Behavioral Activation for depression&#xD;
      delivered via home based telehealth (BA-HT) is effective in improving social and role&#xD;
      functioning in Veterans recently discharged from Cardiovascular disease (CVD-related)&#xD;
      inpatient care. Eligible participants will receive either (1) twelve sessions of BA-HT or (2)&#xD;
      standard best practices post CVD hospitalization care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be 132 Veterans discharged from the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical&#xD;
      Center inpatient care facilities with CVD diagnoses corresponding to ICD 10 codes I20-I25&#xD;
      (120 unstable angina, stable angina; 121 NSTEMI, STEMI, initial encounter; 122 NSTEMI, STEMI,&#xD;
      subsequent encounter; 124 acute coronary syndrome; 125 coronary arteriosclerosis with&#xD;
      angina). They will be male or female, age 21 and above, and with approximately 40-50%&#xD;
      minority representation. There will be assessment at baseline, 1 week post treatment, as well&#xD;
      as 3 and 9-months post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict that BA-HT will more effectively increase social role and activity&#xD;
      functioning, activity, mood and reduce 9-month re-hospitalization compared to current&#xD;
      best-practices post-discharge care among patients scoring at least moderately depressed on&#xD;
      the PROMIS Depression scale one week following hospital discharge for a CVD event.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following hospital discharge, risk of depression is significantly increased in&#xD;
      cardio-vascular disease (CVD) patients. Moreover, CVD patients with depression face reduced&#xD;
      functioning, increased morbidity and mortality, and diminished quality of life.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, most depressed CVD patients do not receive appropriate evidence-based care for&#xD;
      their depression, often because they are unable to, or fearful of travelling to providers for&#xD;
      the regimen of 8-12 weekly visits of evidence-based psychotherapy such as Behavioral&#xD;
      Activation (BA). The group developed, evaluated and subsequently implemented in VA clinics,&#xD;
      the first VA program to use home based telehealth to deliver BA for depression to elderly&#xD;
      Veterans. The investigators now propose to evaluate the ability of this evidence based&#xD;
      treatment and delivery model (BA for depression via home-telehealth) to reduce functional&#xD;
      impairment and improve recovery in depressed Veterans who have experienced a CVD&#xD;
      event-related hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare effectiveness of Behavioral Activation for depression delivered via&#xD;
           Home-based Telehealth- to standard post-CVD hospital discharge best-practices care in a&#xD;
           2x4 (treatment by time) repeated measures RCT crossover design (baseline,&#xD;
           post-treatment, 3 &amp; 9-month follow-up; crossover for standard treatment group at 9&#xD;
           months) with 132 CVD Veteran patients evincing depression in terms of central outcomes&#xD;
           of functioning (PROMIS Functioning and Global Health scales) and emotional symptoms&#xD;
           (PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scales) and secondary objective outcomes related to&#xD;
           activity (actigraphy data). At the 9 month point, the comparison group will have the&#xD;
           option of receiving the intervention (thus complementing the RCT with a crossover&#xD;
           phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To repeat these comparisons with sex and age as independent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate BA-HT with respect to its effects on exploratory outcomes, including&#xD;
           re-hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict that evidence-based psychotherapy for depression (i.e., Behavioral&#xD;
      Activation) delivered via home based telehealth will more effectively increase social role&#xD;
      and activity functioning, activity, mood and reduce 6-month re-hospitalization (exploratory&#xD;
      hypothesis), compared to current best-practices post-discharge care among patients scoring at&#xD;
      least moderately depressed on the PROMIS Depression scale one week following hospital&#xD;
      discharge for a CVD event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If effective, this innovative treatment and delivery strategy will enhance global&#xD;
      functioning, improve quality of life, and reduce costs to Veterans and the VA. Importantly,&#xD;
      the proposed strategy leverages existing VA infrastructure and capabilities so that BA-HT&#xD;
      could be immediately offered throughout VA as a preventative measure to enhance resiliency.&#xD;

    <measure>PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure of functioning assesses one's perceived ability to perform usual social roles and activities. Items are worded negatively in terms of perceived limitations and are reverse-coded with higher scores represent fewer limitations. Each of the 8 items are scored 1 to 5 and totaled raw scores are used to derive T-scores, scaled to US general population estimates. In addition to PROMIS general validation efforts, evidence for reliability, construct validity, and sensitivity to change with cardiovascular surgery patients was provided by Flynn et al. (2015).</description>

    <measure>PROMIS Satisfaction with Participation in Social Roles</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 8-item measure (items rated 1 to 5, higher scores corresponding to higher satisfaction), assesses satisfaction related to one's ability and performance of work, routine activities, and family activities and is responsive to change over time (Hahn et al., 2016). Thus, this measure complements purely functional assessment of capabilities with assessment of participant's impression of the quality their functioning.</description>

    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 11-item measure (high scores correspond to better mobility) is rated 1 to 5 (unable to do to &quot;without any difficulty&quot;) and assesses self-report regarding many basic physical aspects of Activities of Daily Living. Both upper and lower extremity functioning is assessed, as well as instrumental activities.</description>
