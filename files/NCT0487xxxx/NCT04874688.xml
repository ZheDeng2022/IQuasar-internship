    <textblock>
      CHAIN is an open-label, individually randomized trial of improved infant and young child&#xD;
      feeding (IYCF) versus &quot;IYCF-plus&quot; among 192 infants enrolled between 5-6 months of age in&#xD;
      Shurugwi district, rural Zimbabwe. Interventions comprise sequential behaviour-change&#xD;
      interventions delivered by village health workers together with food supplements. In the IYCF&#xD;
      arm, infants will receive white maize and small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement&#xD;
      (SQ-LNS) daily from 6 months of age. In the IYCF-plus arm, infants will receive orange&#xD;
      pro-vitamin A-biofortified maize, and SQ-LNS, plus powdered sugar beans, moringa and whole&#xD;
      egg powder. The primary outcome will be the proportion of infants in each trial arm reaching&#xD;
      daily energy requirements at 9 months of age (visit window 9-11 months of age). Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are other nutrient intake, anthropometry and haemoglobin. Tertiary outcomes are&#xD;
      laboratory measures of microbiome composition, environmental enteric dysfunction,&#xD;
      inflammation, innate immune function, circulating choline and essential amino acids, and&#xD;
      urinary metabolic profile. Two qualitative substudies will explore i) the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the IYCF-plus intervention; and ii) the influence of migration on household&#xD;
      food consumption and production.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Linear growth failure (stunting) in childhood is the most prevalent form of undernutrition&#xD;
      globally. Diets in rural sub-Saharan Africa have low dietary diversity and a reliance on&#xD;
      white maize, which is high in starch and low in other nutrients. Improving infant and young&#xD;
      child feeding (IYCF) during the period of complementary feeding from 6-24 months of age,&#xD;
      including use of daily small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS), has a modest&#xD;
      impact on linear growth. However, despite intensive IYCF interventions, infants often still&#xD;
      have nutrient gaps. Furthermore, three key biological barriers (environmental enteric&#xD;
      dysfunction, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, and systemic inflammation) limit nutrient&#xD;
      uptake and utilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this trial is to fill key nutrient gaps among infants in rural&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa through an improved IYCF intervention using locally available foods that&#xD;
      can ultimately be self-sustaining through agriculture. Addressing intake, uptake and&#xD;
      utilization of nutrients in tandem, through use of 'functional foods' could ultimately&#xD;
      improve growth and development in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHAIN is an open-label, individually randomized trial of improved infant and young child&#xD;
      feeding (IYCF) versus &quot;IYCF-plus&quot; among 192 infants enrolled between 5-6 months of age in&#xD;
      Shurugwi district, rural Zimbabwe. Interventions comprise sequential behaviour-change&#xD;
      interventions delivered by village health workers together with food supplements. In the IYCF&#xD;
      arm, infants will receive white maize and small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement&#xD;
      (SQ-LNS) daily from 6 months of age. In the IYCF-plus arm, infants will receive orange&#xD;
      pro-vitamin A-biofortified maize, and daily SQ-LNS, plus additional foods that are&#xD;
      nutrient-rich, culturally acceptable and locally sustainable: NUA-45 biofortified sugar&#xD;
      beans, moringa leaf powder and whole egg powder. For the duration of the trial, these foods&#xD;
      will be provided as dried powders, which can be added to infant porridge as point-of-use&#xD;
      fortificants. Together, these food supplements have the added plausible benefit of improving&#xD;
      the microbiota and gut barrier function and reducing intestinal and systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the proportion of infants in each trial arm reaching daily energy&#xD;
      requirements at 9 months of age (visit window 9-11 months of age). Secondary outcomes are&#xD;
      intake of protein, iron, zinc and folate; height-for-age Z score, weight-for-age Z-score, and&#xD;
      weight-for-height Z-score; and haemoglobin. Tertiary outcomes are laboratory measures of&#xD;
      microbiome composition, environmental enteric dysfunction, inflammation, innate immune&#xD;
      function, circulating choline and essential amino acids, and urinary metabolic profile. Two&#xD;
      qualitative substudies will explore i) the feasibility and acceptability of the IYCF-plus&#xD;
      intervention; and ii) the influence of migration on household food consumption and&#xD;
      production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained research nurses will collect baseline data on maternal and infant demographics,&#xD;
      nutritional status and household characteristics. Infants will have anthropometry&#xD;
      measurements undertaken, and baseline infant stool, urine and blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      by the research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All interventions are delivered by trained village health workers, each of whom has an&#xD;
      allocated catchment area as part of their regular duties. VHW will provide regular&#xD;
      interactive education modules for the IYCF and IYCF-plus arms, and deliver monthly supplies&#xD;
      of food supplements from enrolment until 12 months of infant age. VHW will be overseen by a&#xD;
      cadre of intervention nurses, who will provide supportive supervision, conduct spot checks,&#xD;
      and hold meetings with the VHWs they supervise to ensure consistency in delivering the trial&#xD;
      messages. In this way, the cadre delivering the interventions (VHW, supervised by&#xD;
      intervention nurses) will be separated from the cadre measuring the trial outcomes (research&#xD;
      nurses), to avoid courtesy bias among participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the endline home visit at 9 months of infant age (window: 9-11 months) a research nurse&#xD;
      will collect data by maternal recall on use of the IYCF or IYCF-plus supplements and on&#xD;
      infant dietary intake by multi-pass 24-hour dietary recall. Infants will have repeat&#xD;
      anthropometry undertaken, and urine, stool and blood samples collected, with point-of-care&#xD;
      measurement of haemoglobin. A further visit will be undertaken 1 week later in 50% of&#xD;
      households to repeat the 24-hour diet recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analyses will include measures of environmental enteric dysfunction; microbiome&#xD;
      composition; innate immune function; systemic inflammation; circulating choline and essential&#xD;
      amino acids; and urinary metabolic profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the feasibility and acceptability of the IYCF-plus intervention, one qualitative&#xD;
      substudy will collect information from study households, the village health workers who&#xD;
      support them, and key community stakeholders. Research findings will inform how this&#xD;
      intervention can be rolled out at scale. Up to 20 households will be purposively sampled&#xD;
      after the baseline survey. In-depth interviews will be conducted by a trained social&#xD;
      scientist when the infant is 7-9 months old after the households have been introduced to all&#xD;
      the nutrients (SQ-LNS and food powders), focused on household feeding practices and norms,&#xD;
      household farming practices and related livelihood strategies, and the acceptability of the&#xD;
      new supplements. Attention will also be focused on the influence of gendered norms and social&#xD;
      relations on household decision-making practices in these areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the influence of migration on household food consumption and production, a second&#xD;
      qualitative substudy will enrol up to 30 participating households identified from the&#xD;
      baseline questionnaire survey as having at least one family member who has migrated. In&#xD;
      addition to exploring the impact of migration on household food consumption and production&#xD;
      practices, the in-depth interviews conducted for this sub-study aim to investigate possible&#xD;
      interactions between migration and household participation in the CHAIN intervention.&#xD;
