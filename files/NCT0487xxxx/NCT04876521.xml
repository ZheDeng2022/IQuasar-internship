  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-Schizophrenic Depression (PSD) increases the morbidity and mortality of Schizophrenic&#xD;
      patients. Hence, it warrants early assessment and intervention. But, clinical trials on PSD&#xD;
      are very few. However, an Antipsychotic with an adjunctive Antidepressant (like&#xD;
      Olanzapine-Fluoxetine Combination) is the commonly prescribed treatment in PSD. Low dose&#xD;
      Amisulpride (&lt;400 mg/day) which is effective against the negative symptoms of Schizophrenia&#xD;
      has also proved efficacious in treating depression in non-psychotic conditions, but its&#xD;
      antidepressant property has never been studied in PSD. This is an 8-week, randomized,&#xD;
      parallel-group study that will explore the efficacy and safety of low-dose Amisulpride versus&#xD;
      Olanzapine-Fluoxetine Combination in the treatment of PSD. Our hypothesis is that low dose&#xD;
      Amisulpride has better efficacy and safety versus Olanzapine-Fluoxetine Combination in PSD,&#xD;
      after 8-weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study would be an 8-week, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial&#xD;
      which will be conducted at the Inpatient and Outpatient settings of the Department of&#xD;
      Psychiatry, AIIMS, Bhubaneswar. Patients with the diagnosis of Post Schizophrenic Depression&#xD;
      according to the ICD 10 (DCR) and meeting all the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria would be&#xD;
      selected for the study. At first, the patients and their family members/ guardians would be&#xD;
      explained about the study procedure along with its possible risks and benefits using a&#xD;
      Patient Information Sheet (in their local language). After obtaining a written Informed&#xD;
      Consent from the Legally Authorised Relative, the patients would be finally recruited for the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recruited patients would be randomized using computer-generated random numbers into two&#xD;
      treatment groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The sociodemographic and clinical data of&#xD;
      the patients would be collected as per the designed sheets. Then at baseline, the CDSS and&#xD;
      CGI ratings would be assessed, and the serum BDNF would be tested for each patient. The study&#xD;
      would be rater-blinded. The experimental group would receive Amisulpride at a low dosage of&#xD;
      100-300 mg/day and the control group would receive a combination of Olanzapine at 5mg or 10&#xD;
      mg/day and Fluoxetine at 20mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups would be followed for 8 weeks, at the completion of which all the patients&#xD;
      would be reassessed. The follow-up assessment would involve a re-evaluation of the CDSS and&#xD;
      the CGI scores and the Serum BDNF levels to see for any change. The data thus collected would&#xD;
      be analyzed, compared within and in between the study groups and statistical tests would be&#xD;
      applied for drawing conclusions. The missing values will be analyzed by an intention-to-treat&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
