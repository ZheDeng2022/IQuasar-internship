  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 12 million Americans with COVID-19 Long Hauler Symptoms, including&#xD;
      athletes. The symptoms include hypoxemia (low SaO2), fatigue, coughing/sneezing, dyspnea,&#xD;
      trouble breathing, body aches, headaches. This chronic disease is referred to as COVID-19&#xD;
      Long Haulers. 7-10% of COVID-19 long haulers are also at serious risk of developing Pulmonary&#xD;
      Fibrosis. Conversely, patients with Pulmonary Fibrosis have an increased risk and&#xD;
      susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, which can reach a mortality rate of 50%. In a Phase III&#xD;
      Clinical Trial in patients in Pulmonary Fibrosis and Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the&#xD;
      inhalation of the sodium pyruvate nasal spray demonstrated a statistically and clinically&#xD;
      significant improvement in all lung functions, compared to baseline, including an increase in&#xD;
      FEV-1, SaO2, FVC, FEV-1/FVC ratios (from 52% to 86%) and a reduction in coughing and fatigue.&#xD;
      EmphyCorp/Cellular Sciences Inc. has submitted over 17 human clinicals (Phase I, II, III&#xD;
      including animal safety data) to the FDA, demonstrating that the inhalation of sodium&#xD;
      pyruvate, significantly reduced respiratory and nasal Inflammation, including oxygen radicals&#xD;
      and inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, that causes the so-called cytokine storm COVID-19&#xD;
      patients. Thousands of patients treated with inhaled sodium pyruvate including patients with&#xD;
      COPD, Pulmonary Fibrosis, CF, Allergic Rhinitis, Chronic Rhinitis, Sinusitis, and Flu,&#xD;
      demonstrated statistically and clinically significant improvement in lung functions with no&#xD;
      adverse events reported. This study will examine the effects of N115 (Sodium pyruvate nasal&#xD;
      spray) treatment on the symptoms associated with COVID-19 Long Haulers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In numerous human clinical trials (17, phase I, II, III clinical trials) submitted to the&#xD;
      FDA, for COPD, Pulmonary Fibrosis, CF, Allergic Rhinitis, Chronic Rhinitis, Sinusitis, and&#xD;
      Flu patients, inhaled sodium pyruvate reduced nasal and lung inflammation and congestion by&#xD;
      reducing inflammatory cytokines including the IL-6 cytokine that causes the so-called&#xD;
      cytokine storm with no known adverse reactions. Cellular Sciences received Orphan Drug&#xD;
      Designations for Pulmonary Fibrosis and Cystic Fibrosis. Mice studies conducted by Dr. Lupfer&#xD;
      at Missouri State University substantiated our finding by testing nebulized sodium pyruvate&#xD;
      in flu (influenza A H1N1 virus) infected mice that decreased morbidity, weight loss,&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines, and decreased viral titers (virus numbers) compared to the Saline&#xD;
      Placebo Control. Additionally, treated mice consumed more chow during infection indicating&#xD;
      improved symptoms (same results reported in a pilot mice COVID-19 study). There were notable&#xD;
      improvements in pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-1Î²) and lower virus titers (viral&#xD;
      numbers) on days 7 post infection in mice treated with Sodium pyruvate compared to the Saline&#xD;
      Placebo Control animals. As pyruvate acts on the host immune response, metabolic pathways and&#xD;
      not directly on the virus, our data demonstrate that sodium pyruvate is a promising treatment&#xD;
      option that is safe, effective, and unlikely to elicit antiviral resistance. Furthermore, we&#xD;
      have preliminary data that suggest it may work similarly during other respiratory virus&#xD;
      infections including COVID19/SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a Phase III Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Patients,&#xD;
      inhaled sodium pyruvate, a Non-Steroidal Nasal Spray (N115) demonstrated a statistically and&#xD;
      clinically significant increase in FEV-1, SaO2, FVC, FEV-1/FVC ratios (from 52% to 86%), and&#xD;
      a statistically and clinically significant reduction in coughing, hypoxemia and a reduction&#xD;
      in nasal and lung inflammation. Inhaled sodium pyruvate alleviated the symptoms associated&#xD;
      with the COVID-19 infections in Patients with COPD and Pulmonary Fibrosis. Nasal Nitric Oxide&#xD;
      reduces the rate, duration and severity of viral infections in healthy young children and in&#xD;
      healthy adults from the Flu, Rhinovirus and Coronavirus. The literature has reported that&#xD;
      Nitric Oxide is elicited and inhibits viral replication in pigs infected with porcine&#xD;
      respiratory coronavirus. Additionally Nasal Nitric Oxide levels decreases from normal levels&#xD;
      found in healthy adults, in patients with asthma (87%), COPD (73%) CF (44%) and Primary&#xD;
      Ciliary Dyskinesia (7%). The rate of infections increases with decreasing levels of nasal&#xD;
      nitric oxide. Young children, 6-17 years of age, produce (142%) more nitric oxide than&#xD;
      healthy adults, which may explain their resistance to COVID-19. Recently, researchers&#xD;
      announced that a high percentage of COVID-19 infected patients that were hospitalized were&#xD;
      Diabetics or were Pre-Diabetic. The literature has reported that elevated levels of glucose&#xD;
      in patients with diabetes mellitus cause a deficiency in the production of nitric oxide by&#xD;
      blunting nitric oxide synthesis, which may explain their susceptibility to COVID-19. Sodium&#xD;
      pyruvate increases nitric oxide and is safe for use by Patients with Diabetes. The inhalation&#xD;
      of nasal sodium pyruvate increased the synthesis of nasal nitric oxide to normal levels in&#xD;
      patients with low levels of nitric oxide to increase all lung functions and decrease the rate&#xD;
      of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical survey of 367 patients who took a nasal spray similar to EmphyCorp' s N115&#xD;
      formula, over a two-year period demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the&#xD;
      number, symptoms, and severity of seasonal flu respiratory tract infections. The number of&#xD;
      flu or colds was reduced by 70% in Children and approximately 52% in Pregnant Women, Patients&#xD;
      with Allergic Rhinitis, Diabetes, and Pulmonary Fibrosis. It has been used successfully by&#xD;
      over 3.5 million patients globally in over 200 hospitals during the past 8 years to treat&#xD;
      nasal and lung inflammation, congestion in Patients with COPD, Allergic Rhinitis, Pulmonary&#xD;
      Fibrosis, sinusitis, the flu and Cystic Fibrosis, with no adverse events reported. It has&#xD;
      been used by Children, Diabetics, and Hypertensives, with efficacy and with no known side&#xD;
      effects. It has even been shown to be safe for use by Pregnant Women, for whom steroids are&#xD;
      contraindicated as they increase the risk of low birth-weight babies.&#xD;

    <description>A patient log was used to measure body ache, headache, chills, coughing/sneezing, sore throat, congestion, trouble breathing and other (patient supplied). The patients used a Likert scale from 0 to 10 to assess symptoms with 10 representing the most severe symptom and zero no symptom. The score for each individual symptom was combined into one overall symptom score for the 7 days of baseline (days 1-7) and a separate score for the 7 days of treatment (days 8-14). Therefore, a maximum 7-day score was 70 and a minimum of 0 was possible.</description>

After recording baseline symptoms for one week without any treatment, all subjects will then use N115 20mM sodium pyruvate nasal spray 3x daily for an additional week and continue to log their symptoms. Vital signs (Blood pressure, temperature, Pulse and SaO2) will be recorded on day 7 after the first treatment and on day 14.</description>

        <title>Change in the Symptoms of Long COVID-19 Patients</title>
        <description>A patient log was used to measure body ache, headache, chills, coughing/sneezing, sore throat, congestion, trouble breathing and other (patient supplied). The patients used a Likert scale from 0 to 10 to assess symptoms with 10 representing the most severe symptom and zero no symptom. The score for each individual symptom was combined into one overall symptom score for the 7 days of baseline (days 1-7) and a separate score for the 7 days of treatment (days 8-14). Therefore, a maximum 7-day score was 70 and a minimum of 0 was possible.</description>
        <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
        <population>Patient scores for baseline days 1-7 of the study when the patients received no treatment were summed into one baseline score (range 0-70). Patient scores for day 8-14 of the study when the patients received 3x daily treatment with 20mM sodium pyruvate were summed into a second score (range 0-70). A Mann-Whitney test was then used to assess statistical difference between baseline and treatment.</population>

          <title>Long COVID-19, Treatment With 20mM Sodium Pyruvate Nasal Spray</title>
          <description>After recording baseline symptoms for one week (days 1-7) without any treatment, all subjects then used N115 20mM sodium pyruvate nasal spray 3x daily for an additional week (days 8-14) and continued to log their symptoms. Vital signs (Blood pressure, temperature, Pulse and SaO2) were recorded on day 7 after the first treatment and on day 14.</description>

          <title>Long COVID-19, No Treatment (Baseline)</title>
          <description>All subjects were provided a log for monitoring baseline symptoms associated with Long COVID and asked to record symptom severity using a Likert scale (0-10 with 10 being the most severe) for one week with no treatment (day 1-7). Vital signs (Blood pressure, Pulse, and SaO2) were recorded on day 1 and 7 prior to treatment and body temperature recorded twice daily from day 1 to day 7.</description>
