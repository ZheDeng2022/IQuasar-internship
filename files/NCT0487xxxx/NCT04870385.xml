  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has increased mental health concerns worldwide, and young adults are at&#xD;
      higher risk of experiencing increased psychological distress due to the pandemic. University&#xD;
      students face compounding stressors during the pandemic, such as online and remote learning,&#xD;
      economic insecurity, and uncertain career prospects. This study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an online modular prevention program featuring integrated elements of&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Islamic spirituality in reducing the&#xD;
      psychological distress and increasing the psychological flexibility, self-compassion, and&#xD;
      resilience of Muslim university students in Malaysia.&#xD;
