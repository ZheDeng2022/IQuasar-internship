  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PEBBLE is an open-label, international, multicentre, window of opportunity phase II trial&#xD;
      that aims to evaluate the effects of short-term preoperative therapy with bintrafusp alfa in&#xD;
      patients with histologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma requiring radical surgery with&#xD;
      bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Eligible patients will receive 4 doses of bintrafusp&#xD;
      alfa (1200mg flat dose) at 14 day intervals before undergoing radical surgery. Patients will&#xD;
      attend study visits at 6, 12 and 24 weeks following their surgery. After the 24-week&#xD;
      post-surgical visit, patients will enter a follow up phase during which they will be&#xD;
      contacted annually for 2 years after their surgery to collect survival and disease status&#xD;
      data. The efficacy of bintrafusp alfa will be assessed on CT/MRI scan images and tumour&#xD;
      tissue samples collected at baseline and after treatment with bintrafusp alfa.&#xD;
