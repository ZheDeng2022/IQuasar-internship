  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with treatment history of rituximab since 01.01.2019 and immunocompetent volunteers&#xD;
      will be contacted to give a blood sample after their COVID19 vaccination, and in a subset&#xD;
      also before vaccination. Immune responses of antibodies and SARS-CoV2-specific T-cells to the&#xD;
      vaccination will be quantified and the rituximab effect on COVID19 vaccine-induced immune&#xD;
      responses is analyzed.&#xD;
