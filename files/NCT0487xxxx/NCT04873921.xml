  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is a surgical tissue graft replacement of&#xD;
      the anterior cruciate ligament, located in the knee, to restore its function after an injury.&#xD;
      ACLR is used as the gold standard in coping with pain, deformity, and instability for the&#xD;
      patients. The most important factors affecting the success of both surgery and postoperative&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs are edema, joint movement limitation and pain around the knee in the&#xD;
      early postoperative period. If these parameters are managed well in the postoperative period,&#xD;
      the quality of life of the patient increases much earlier. In this respect, kinesio taping&#xD;
      treatment, which is practical, comfortable, and safe for the patient, is one of the&#xD;
      complementary treatment modalities with positive clinical results. No researchers have&#xD;
      studied the effects of Sterile Kinesio Tape applied during ACL reconstruction on edema, pain&#xD;
      and range of motion in immediate care postoperatively. The purpose of our study Ä°S to assess&#xD;
      effects of Sterile Kinesio Tape application on postoperative edema, pain and range of motion&#xD;
      after ACLR within 72 hours. Thirty-seven patients who have undergone ACLR will be recruited&#xD;
      to our study. Patients will be randomized into 2 groups; Group 1: Sterile Kinesio tape&#xD;
      application, Group 2: Control group. All patients will be assessed for pain intensity (with&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale-VAS), edema (with tape measurement) and range of motion (with goniometric&#xD;
      measurement-knee flexion/extension). Assessments will be done every day for 3 days (a total&#xD;
      of 3 measurements). Group 1 will receive Sterile Kinesio Taping application within 72 hours&#xD;
      applied with Sterile Web Cut Kinesio Tape without tension additional to standard during ACLR&#xD;
      postoperative care. Group 2 will receive only standard postoperative care.&#xD;

    <measure>Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be assessed (every day for 3 days) with Visual Analog Scale (VAS). VAS is a 10-cm line with no marks along it, anchored with the words &quot;no pain&quot; on one hand, and &quot;the most severe pain&quot; on the other. Patients will be simply instructed to place a mark along the line at a level representing the intensity of their pain during activity</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Edema Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Edema will be assessed (every day for 3 days) with circumferential measurements in centimeters using basic tape measurement for ACLR knees at 5 levels: incision level, upper part of incision (5 cm above and 10 cm above) and lower part of incision (5 cm below and 10 cm below)</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Range of motion measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion measurement will be done (every day for 3 days) with universal goniometry for knee flexion and extension. Knee flexion and extension movements will be measured in the supine position for both knees. The measurements will be recorded in degrees</description>
