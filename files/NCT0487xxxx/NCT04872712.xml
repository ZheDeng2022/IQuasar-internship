      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of manual acupuncture between press&#xD;
      needles and filiform needles for subsiding insomnia symptoms based on changes in the&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire score and examination of Melatonin in&#xD;
      blood. If the press needles proven to be superior, this method would also be more beneficial&#xD;
      during this pandemic as this can shorten the time and/or frequency of the therapy sessions,&#xD;
      hence reducing interaction and risk of COVID-19 transmission.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks (4 times measurement : Before the treatment and every 2 weeks until week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Questionnaire used have 19 questions related to sleep quality and disturbances, grouped into seven-component scores. The seven components of the score were then summed to produce the global PSQI score, which has a range from 0 as minimum and 21 as maximum score. Higher Total PSQI score indicates poorer sleep quality.&#xD;
The PSQI score was measured at 4 time points per subject (Before the treatment and every 2 weeks until week 6) to understand the change and impact before and after the treatment as well as the lasting effect within 4 weeks of treatment was finished.</description>

    <measure>Change in Melatonin Level via Blood Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks ( 2 times measurement : Before the treatment and after the treatment is completed (treatment duration: 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Melatonin Level was measured through blood sampling and test to determine the level of melatonin (in pg/mL) in the human serum. The higher the Melatonin Level indicates better outcome.&#xD;
The Melatonin Level was measured 2 times for all subjects (Before and after the treatment which is in span of 2 weeks) to understand the change and impact before and after the treatment.</description>
