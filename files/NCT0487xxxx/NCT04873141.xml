    <textblock>
      Tocilizumab (TCZ), interleukin-6 (IL-6), newly appeared as treatment of cytokine release&#xD;
      syndrome (CRS) in patients with severe covid-19 associated pneumonia. In the present study,&#xD;
      we aimed to discuss the treatment response of TCZ therapy in COVID-19 infected patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational study was designed just to visualize the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Tocilizumab, an antibody anti-IL-6 receptor in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 with&#xD;
      increased inflammatory markers.Patients will be followed until Day 29 after randomization.&#xD;
