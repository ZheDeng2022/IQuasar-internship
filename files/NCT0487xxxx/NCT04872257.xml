  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial that treats vitiligo patients with oral vitamin D and Narrow-Band&#xD;
      Ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy (intervention group); or placebo and NB-UVB phototherapy&#xD;
      (control group). We will evaluate if the group supplemented with vitamin D achieves a higher&#xD;
      repigmentation rate than the control group, proving the relevance of vitamin D as an&#xD;
      immunomodulator in the pathophysiology of vitiligo. These findings may support the use of&#xD;
      vitamin D as an economic, safe, and adjuvant treatment for vitiligo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial, triple-blind, placebo-controlled treating patients with&#xD;
      diagnosed vitiligo. The intervention group will be treated with oral vitamin D 5,000 IU per&#xD;
      day and NB-UVB phototherapy. The control group will be treated with placebo and NB-UVB&#xD;
      phototherapy. We will evaluate the efficacy (repigmentation rate) and improvement of the&#xD;
      quality of life with vitamin D and phototherapy versus placebo and phototherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate if the use of the supplementation with oral vitamin D accelerates the&#xD;
           repigmentation rate in vitiligo lesions treated with NB-UVB phototherapy, achieving a&#xD;
           lower accumulated dose of phototherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare basal blood levels of vitamin D before and after treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare quality of life of the intervention group with the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Associate pigmentation rates between intervention and control group obtained with tools&#xD;
           that assess activity of disease, such as, Vitiligo Area and Severity Index (VASI) and&#xD;
           Vitiligo European Task Force (VETF) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare results in quality of life between intervention and control group obtained with&#xD;
           tools, such as, Vitiligo-Specific Quality-of-Life Instrument (VitiQoL) and Dermatology&#xD;
           Life Quality Index (DLQI).&#xD;

    <masking_description>Our randomization and blinding process is in charge by a nurse who is not part of the study. A pharmacy school laboratory (not part of the study) randomly assigned the intervention and placebo to each patient (1-20) as treatment A or B. This information was delivered in a sealed envelope, in which only the nurse had access to. Neither the participants, investigators and outcome assessor, nor the data analyst know which patient is receiving the experimental treatment.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Week 0</time_frame>
    <description>The VASI score is used to assess the severity and extent of Vitiligo. VASI is calculated using a formula that includes contributions from all body regions (possible range, 0-100). The body is divided into 6 separate and mutually exclusive sites (head/neck, hands, upper extremities [excluding hands], trunk, lower extremities [excluding feet], and feet), with percentage of vitiligo involvement estimated in hand units by the same investigator throughout the study.</description>

    <description>The VETF is a validated scoring system that assesses 3 dimensions of the disease (extent, staging, and spreading/progression). (1) the extent of vitiligo will be estimated as the percentage of vitiligo involvement of 5 body sites. (2) Stage of vitiligo will be assessed as 0 (normal pigmentation), 1 (incomplete depigmentation), 2 (complete depigmentation), 3 (partial hair whitening [&lt;30%]), and 4 (complete hair whitening). (3) Spreading of vitiligo will be scored as 0 (stable disease), -1 (observed ongoing subclinical repigmentation), and +1 (additional patches in a given area or observed ongoing subclinical depigmentation). The VETF score calculated as follows:&#xD;
VETF Extent or Staging or Spreading = Sum of all specific values for that category from all body sites (% of Area affected for Extent; 0-20 for Staging; -5 to +5 for Spreading).</description>
