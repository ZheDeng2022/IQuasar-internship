      In a randomized controlled study to evaluate the effect of acupressure application on&#xD;
      opioid-related constipation, the Patient Identification Form, Defecation Diary, Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale and Constipation Quality of Life Scale will be applied after obtaining written informed&#xD;
      consent from the patients. Patients in the experimental group will be given acupressure once&#xD;
      a day for 7 consecutive days. Acupressure application will be applied by researchers who have&#xD;
      been trained and certified on this subject. While the patients are in supine position,&#xD;
      pressure will be applied to each acupressure point around the navel, respectively, Zhongwan&#xD;
      (CV12), Guanyuan (CV4) and Tianshu (ST25) for 2 minutes for a total of 6 minutes. No attempt&#xD;
      will be made to the control group. All patients will be followed for a total of 4 weeks and&#xD;
      the Defecation Diary and Visual Comparison Scale will be applied weekly. 4. Constipation&#xD;
      Quality of Life Scale will be applied again at the end of the week. The study was planned to&#xD;
      examine the effect of acupressure on opioid-related constipation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Constipation symptom, which is very common in patients using opioids, affects the quality of&#xD;
      life of the patients and may increase the severity of other symptoms. Pharmacological and&#xD;
      non-pharmacological methods can be used in the management of opioid-associated constipation.&#xD;
      One of the non-pharmacological approaches used is acupressure application. The effects of&#xD;
      acupressure to increase bowel movements have been shown in studies. The study was planned to&#xD;
      examine the effect of acupressure on opioid-related constipation. The goals that achieve this&#xD;
      goal; To evaluate gastrointestinal functions in patients using opioid drugs, to examine and&#xD;
      alleviate the effect of acupressure application on gastrointestinal functions (stool&#xD;
      frequency, stool type, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness) in these&#xD;
      patients, their quality of life (anxiety / anxiety states, physical, psychological&#xD;
      discomfort) to evaluate and improve situations, satisfaction situations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population and Sample The research will be conducted in Istanbul University Istanbul&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine Hospital Algology Outpatient Clinic and Service. The universe of the&#xD;
      study will consist of all patients followed in the Algology outpatient clinic and service.&#xD;
      The sample of the study will consist of all patients who meet the inclusion criteria and who&#xD;
      are willing to participate in the study. The patients enrolled in the study will be divided&#xD;
      into intervention and control groups using the previously prepared randomization checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures In a randomized controlled study to evaluate the effect of acupressure application&#xD;
      on opioid-related constipation, the Patient Identification Form, Defecation Diary, Visual&#xD;
      Comparison Scale and Constipation Quality of Life Scale will be applied after obtaining&#xD;
      written informed consent from the patients. Patients in the intervention group will be given&#xD;
      acupressure once a day for 7 consecutive days. Acupressure application will be applied by&#xD;
      researchers who have been trained and certified on this subject. While the patients are in&#xD;
      supine position, pressure will be applied to each acupressure point around the navel,&#xD;
      respectively, Zhongwan (CV12), Guanyuan (CV4) and Tianshu (ST25) for 2 minutes for a total of&#xD;
      6 minutes. No attempt will be made to the control group. All patients will be followed for a&#xD;
      total of 4 weeks and the Defecation Diary and Visual Comparison Scale will be applied&#xD;
      weekly.No intervention will be applied to the control group.&#xD;

    <description>Pamuk et al. The form developed by (2003) includes 6 questions about the severity of the constipation symptoms. The Visual Analog Scale is a 10 cm horizontal line with 0 at one end and 10 at the other. The patient will be asked to mark the severity of each of the constipation symptoms on the horizontal line, giving a score between 0 and 10. The patients made this assessment daily, and by adding the scores, the total score average for one week for each item will be obtained. Minimum 0 Maximum 60 points are obtained from the scale. As the score increases, the severity of constipation increases.</description>

    <description>It will be used in order to determine the effects of constipation related to opioid treatment on daily life and to measure the quality of life. The highest score that can be obtained from the scale is 140 and the lowest score is 28. It is thought that as the scores obtained from the scale increase, the quality of life is also negatively affected.</description>
