    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constipation is a common problem, affecting up to 20% of the population during their&#xD;
      lifetime. Some patients respond poorly to standard treatments such as laxatives. A subgroup&#xD;
      of these have dyssynergic defaecation where the muscles that control bowel movements fail to&#xD;
      relax during pushing, preventing evacuation of stools. Currently, the mainstay of treatment&#xD;
      requires muscle retraining by a therapist using a technique called biofeedback. Patients in&#xD;
      whom biofeedback has failed are left with few options, one of which includes Botox injection&#xD;
      into the pelvic floor muscles involved in the defaecation process. However, current method of&#xD;
      injection is inaccurate and often requires anaesthesia. The investigators propose a novel&#xD;
      technique for Botox delivery which reduces the risks and associated costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary objective is to demonstrate technical feasibility of percutaneous&#xD;
           infracoccygeal Botox injection as an alternative to transanal puborectalis muscle&#xD;
           injection for the treatment of dyssynergic defaecation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary objectives are to assess the safety and acceptability of this technique,&#xD;
           and to derive pilot clinical effectiveness data to inform future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will carry out Botox injection into the puborectalis muscle under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance in the outpatient department. This will be done by percutaneous injection&#xD;
      below the coccyx where the puborectalis has been demonstrated to be easily accessible. An&#xD;
      electromyography of the puborectalis is obtained before the injection to demonstrate proof of&#xD;
      mechanism. The investigators will collect data using a combination of questionnaires, patient&#xD;
      baseline data, and anorectal physiology test results before and after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility: procedure duration, rate of identification of puborectalis by ultrasound&#xD;
           scan and pre-injection EMG, procedure limitations, and successful injection rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety: rate of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability: patient pain and comfort, willingness to undergo repeat procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preliminary data on effectiveness: Cleveland Clinic constipation score, anorectal&#xD;
           physiology test results&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with dyssynergic defaecation represent a subgroup of a larger group of patients&#xD;
      presenting with symptoms of chronic constipation. The disorder is characterised by impaired&#xD;
      stool expulsion as a result of inappropriate contraction of the pelvic floor musculation&#xD;
      despite normal propulsive force during attempted defaecation. Failure of the puborectalis&#xD;
      and/or anal sphincter muscles to relax during evacuation leads to a closed anal canal which&#xD;
      prevents the emptying of stools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cochrane review in 2014 on the treatment of chronic constipation in adults demonstrated a&#xD;
      high prevalence of dyssynergic defaecation and a variety of treatments. In this group,&#xD;
      biofeedback was found to be superior to oral diazepam, sham treatment, and laxatives; while&#xD;
      surgical procedures such as partial division of the puborectalis muscle were more&#xD;
      efficacious, the risks of adverse reaction, namely incontinence, were high. Thus, biofeedback&#xD;
      therapy is the current gold-standard for the treatment of dyssynergia. The success rate of&#xD;
      biofeedback in correcting or improving the symptoms in patients with dyssynergia varies&#xD;
      between 33% and 80%. Difficulty arises in those in whom biofeedback is unsuccessful, as there&#xD;
      is little, and conflicting, low quality evidence on alternative therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One further therapeutic option uses injection of Botulinum toxin type A (BTXA) into the&#xD;
      puborectalis and/or external anal sphincter muscles. This is currently the second-line&#xD;
      treatment for dyssynergic defaecation in whom biofeedback has failed. A systematic review in&#xD;
      2016 on the use of BTXA in patients with 'anismus', a term previously used to describe&#xD;
      dyssynergic defaecation, demonstrated initial clinical improvement in symptoms in 77.4% of&#xD;
      patients. Two of the seven studies were conducted on participants in whom biofeedback therapy&#xD;
      had failed. Complications were reported in 7.4% of patients (0 to 22.6%) and included faecal&#xD;
      incontinence, which was minor and transient, posterior anal fissure, and rectal prolapse. The&#xD;
      effect of BTXA was not permanent, with clinical improvement declining to 46% at four months&#xD;
      after the injection. For this reason, several studies offered repeated treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delivery of BTXA injection varied between studies and institutions in terms of dosage and&#xD;
      position of injection, but all were performed via perianal or transanal approaches, often&#xD;
      requiring sedation or anaesthesia. There are several disadvantages of this approach including&#xD;
      cost (operating theatre utilisation) and risks associated with anaesthesia and infection from&#xD;
      passing the needle through a contaminated operative field. In addition, the injection site is&#xD;
      defined blind by the surgeon's finger (an issue of accuracy of injection and hazard of needle&#xD;
      stick injury).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility of an alternative approach&#xD;
      to delivering BTXA injection in adult patients with dyssynergic defaecation. This novel&#xD;
      technique injects BTXA into the puborectalis muscle percutaneously using an infracoccygeal&#xD;
      approach under ultrasound guidance. This allows the procedure to be performed in an&#xD;
      outpatient radiology setting without the need for any form of anaesthesia or analgesia. The&#xD;
      injection is performed in a clean operative field away from the anus, minimising risk of&#xD;
      infection and the muscle can be clearly visualised (see below). These advantages will be&#xD;
      particularly valuable in patients who require repeated procedures or those with multiple&#xD;
      co-morbidities at high anaesthetic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The utilisation of BTXA in human is well established. This medication is licensed for use in&#xD;
      focal spasticity with well-established side-effects and interactions. Current evidence for&#xD;
      the use of BTXA in dyssynergic defaecation is based on the conventional transanal approach,&#xD;
      with report on efficacy and complications as previously stated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The puborectalis is easily accessible below the coccyx, and is the site for ultrasonic&#xD;
      assessment in the paediatric population. The identification of puborectalis muscle in the&#xD;
      infracoccygeal position has not been described in the literature in the adult population.&#xD;
      However, pilot imaging studies on a small number of non-obese subjects have been successful&#xD;
      in easily identifying the puborectalis using ultrasound scan. This approach has the potential&#xD;
      to allow accurate administration of BTXA injection under ultrasonic guidance in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting without the need for anaesthesia or operating theatre utilisation. The&#xD;
      general aim of this study is to demonstrate that percutaneous infracoccygeal BTXA injection&#xD;
      is a valid alternative approach to transanal injection for the treatment of dyssynergic&#xD;
      defaecation. Specifically, the investigators will determine technical feasibility (including&#xD;
      pilot proof of mechanism), patient acceptability, safety, and pilot efficacy outcomes for a&#xD;
      future definitive trial.&#xD;
