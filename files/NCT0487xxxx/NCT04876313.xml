      To assess whether nivolumab+nab-paclitaxel combination results in patients with&#xD;
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single-center, open-label, non-randomized study in patients with&#xD;
      muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general framework of the study will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A transurethral resection of the bladder for biopsy, histological characterization, and local&#xD;
      staging will be executed first. With the aim to improve the sensitivity of CT scan in&#xD;
      assessing pelvic lymph-nodes and better assess the local extent of bladder tumor, computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan, 18FDG-PET/CT scan, and multiparametric bladder MRI (mpMRI) will be done&#xD;
      during screening and before cystectomy to stage and evaluate response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive neoadjuvant treatment: 360 mg nivolumab IV on Day 1 plus 125&#xD;
      mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel on Day 1 and 8, in a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 4 cycles are planned before surgery. Surgery will be planned at the time of study&#xD;
      inclusion to be done within 3 weeks of the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose reductions will be applied depending on the severity of AEs, and treatment interruption&#xD;
      or discontinuation criteria will be fully described in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, patients will receive 12-month adjuvant therapy with nivolumab 360 mg IV,&#xD;
      every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECIST v1.1 criteria will be used to assess patient response to treatment by determining&#xD;
      tumor size and PFS. Screening assessments should be performed no more than 21 days prior to&#xD;
      the start of study treatment. Following the screening assessment, subsequent assessments will&#xD;
      be carried out after the administration of the study drugs prior to cystectomy. If an&#xD;
      unscheduled assessment is performed and the patient has not progressed, the results should be&#xD;
      reported at the next scheduled visit. The method of tumor assessment used at baseline e.g. CT&#xD;
      or MRI scans chest, abdomen, pelvis, must be used at each sub-sequent follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored carefully for the development of adverse events and will be&#xD;
      monitored for clinical and/or radiographic evidence of disease progression according to usual&#xD;
      standards of clinical practice. Adverse experiences will be evaluated according to criteria&#xD;
      outlined in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0.&#xD;
