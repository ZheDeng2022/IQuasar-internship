  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is a regular care for metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma, and it can induce&#xD;
      immunogenic death of tumor cells and a stronger immune response. Sometimes, tumor regression&#xD;
      would be observed at sites distant to an irradiated field because of the radiotherapy-induced&#xD;
      anticancer immune responses, so-called abscopal response. Manganese has been confirmed to&#xD;
      activate innate immune and function as anticancer immunoadjuvant in pre-clinical studies.&#xD;
      This study is designed to assess the abscopal response and safety of combined therapy of&#xD;
      manganese and radiotherapy in patients with metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of subjects with an abscopal response</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An abscopal response was defi ned as a decrease in the longest diameter of at least 30% in any measurable (≥1 cm) non-irradiated lesion from baseline.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with treatment-related adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events graded according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0. AEs were considered to be treatment-related if they had started or worsened within the interval from first study drug administration until the follow-up visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Disease control rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a stable disease (SD), partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS time was measured from study entry to the first documentation of disease progression or death. Disease progression was determined per the RECIST V1.1.</description>
