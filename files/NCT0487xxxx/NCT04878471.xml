      This study is comprised of 3 parts. Part 1 and Part 2 will be conducted in a parallel manner&#xD;
      while Part 3 will be conducted subsequentially. Participants will be residential for a period&#xD;
      of 3 days/2 nights. Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on day 2 on the&#xD;
      condition that all required assessments have been performed and that there are no medical&#xD;
      reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study investigational product (IP), whether or not considered related to the study IP. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.</description>
