      This pilot study will assess the feasibility, preliminary efficacy, and acceptability of the&#xD;
      Diabetes-REM (Rescue, Engagement, and Management), a comprehensive patient-centered&#xD;
      intervention delivered by community paramedics in the community setting to improve diabetes&#xD;
      self-management, prevent recurrent hypoglycemia, reduce diabetes distress, and improve&#xD;
      quality of life among adults in southeast Minnesota who were treated for hypoglycemia by&#xD;
      emergency medical services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe hypoglycemia in the management of diabetes is associated with high morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality, psychological distress, and impaired quality of life. Recognizing, actively&#xD;
      engaging, and providing comprehensive care to at-risk patients to address hypoglycemia risk&#xD;
      factors and enhance diabetes self-management skills may help reduce the frequency/severity of&#xD;
      hypoglycemic events, alleviate diabetes distress, and improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the feasibility, preliminary efficacy, and acceptability of&#xD;
      Diabetes-REM (Rescue, Engagement, and Management) to improve diabetes self-management among&#xD;
      adults in southeast Minnesota who had been treated for hypoglycemia by Mayo Clinic Ambulance.&#xD;
      The D-REM program is a one month long intervention delivered by community paramedics at the&#xD;
      patient's home. Community paramedics are trained in disease prevention, management, and&#xD;
      wellness in addition to emergency response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a two-group parallel design, 150 adults will be randomly assigned to 1 month of&#xD;
      Diabetes-REM or usual care. Both groups will receive education materials on&#xD;
      hypoglycemia/diabetes and clinical/community resources. One group, comprised of 75 patients,&#xD;
      will also be cared for by community paramedics at no cost to them. Study measures will&#xD;
      include surveys (completed by participants in both arms) and an interview (completed by a&#xD;
      subset of participants in the arm receiving community paramedic support).&#xD;
