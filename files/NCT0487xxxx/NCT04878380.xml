      The hiSG Sleep Health Study seeks to investigate the efficacy of education + goal-based&#xD;
      programmes for the promotion of healthy sleep habits and to evaluate its impact on daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness and mental health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a sub-study under the existing Health Insights Singapore study (hiSG). The hiSG&#xD;
      study is a longitudinal cohort study among working adults (aged 21-42y), monitoring health&#xD;
      parameters through wearable sleep/activity tracking and mobile phone-based questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hiSG Sleep Health Study (hiSG SHS) sub-study, will evaluate the efficacy of two&#xD;
      goal-based interventions for improving sleep. Participants will be recruited from the&#xD;
      existing hiSG subject pool (target N=300), and should have a habitual sleep duration below&#xD;
      the recommended 7h (as determined from the currently available hiSG data). Following informed&#xD;
      consent, participants will be randomized by the study team into two groups, a) Goal-Setting&#xD;
      and b) Tracking, based on a 2:1 ratio, i.e. in the event 300 participants are enrolled, 200&#xD;
      will be allocated to Goal-Setting and 100 to Tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is 22 weeks long and will proceed in 3 main phases, namely, 1) Baseline (Week 1-2)&#xD;
      2) Intervention (Week 3-12), and 3) Follow-up (Week 13-22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, participants in both groups will be rewarded for logging their nightly&#xD;
      sleep sessions regularly on their study wearable device, based on a weekly completion bonus&#xD;
      for a minimum of 3 nights of sleep preceding weekdays (Sunday - Thursday nights) per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily questionnaires probing daytime sleepiness, mood, and stress levels as well as&#xD;
      once-per-study phase sleep health, sleep hygiene, work-related stress and mental wellbeing&#xD;
      questionnaires will be pushed to participants during the baseline (Week 1-2), intervention&#xD;
      (Week 11-12) and follow-up periods (Week 21-22) via the hiSG mobile application. Participants&#xD;
      will also be reimbursed for completion of these questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will also receive sleep education tips before the intervention period. During the&#xD;
      intervention phase, the Goal-Setting group will be additionally rewarded for achieving sleep&#xD;
      goals, i.e. 30 mins longer than their habitual sleep duration and sleeping before midnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, given the pervasive telecommuting arrangements presently enforced in many&#xD;
      workplaces to curb spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, a work-life balance, burnout and work&#xD;
      engagement questionnaire will be administered to better understand reasons that could&#xD;
      contribute to poor sleep health and mental wellbeing.&#xD;
