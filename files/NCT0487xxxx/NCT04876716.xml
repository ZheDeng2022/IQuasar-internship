      The goals of this study are 3-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the main study and the primary endpoint will evaluate if the overall mortality can be&#xD;
      decreased with initial azole-echinocandin combination therapy compared with triazole&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients with IA and documented voriconazole susceptibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, the study design described will also allow to study several other subpopulations;&#xD;
      Indeed, the outcome of the following subgroups will be evaluated as well; a. Patients&#xD;
      starting azole monotherapy but who switch to directed therapy when it has become clear that&#xD;
      the infection is caused by an azole resistant A. fumigatus. b. patients in which eventually&#xD;
      no resistance data become available in relation to the treatment they received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, the study will evaluate what the outcome is of patients that turn out to be infected&#xD;
      with a triazole resistant A. fumigatus who started with a triazole-echinocandin combination&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with underlying haematological malignancies or immunocompromised for various other&#xD;
      reasons, are prone to fungal infections. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a common complication&#xD;
      during remission inducing chemotherapy for acute leukemia or other hematological&#xD;
      malignancies, as well as those who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) or solid organ transplantation (SOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For more than 15 years voriconazole, a drug of the triazole class, has been the recommended&#xD;
      treatment for this life-threatening infection after a pivotal randomized trial showed an&#xD;
      improved survival with voriconazole compared with amphotericin B deoxycholate. However, also&#xD;
      with voriconazole the overall 6-week mortality is still unacceptably high at 25-30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a randomized controlled trial assed the efficacy of voriconazole with or without&#xD;
      anidulafungin for the treatment of IA in haematology patients to prove that combination&#xD;
      therapy can improve outcome.Among the 277 patients with IA in this study, the 6-week&#xD;
      mortality with combination therapy was 30% lower (19.3%) than with monotherapy (27.5%),&#xD;
      p=0.087. In a post-hoc analysis of the 222 patients with radiographic abnormalities and a&#xD;
      positive galactomannan antigen test, a statistically significant difference in mortality was&#xD;
      observed (p=0.037). Though, this study did not result in conclusive evidence in favor of&#xD;
      combination therapy, it is a credible study which adds to the already existing in vitro and&#xD;
      animal studies in support of echinocandin triazole combination therapy for IA and thus paves&#xD;
      the way for a second larger and pragmatic clinical trial. Another important and new&#xD;
      consideration about the management of IA is the upcoming of infections with&#xD;
      triazole-resistant A. fumigatus. This is increasingly becoming a worldwide problem and leads&#xD;
      to longer hospital stay, higher costs and is associated with a very high mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is very likely that the excessive use of antifungals of the triazole class in agriculture&#xD;
      has formed the basis of this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2018 the Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic therapy (SWAB) guideline on the management&#xD;
      of invasive fungal infections therefore recommends upfront combination therapy (azole plus&#xD;
      echinocandins or liposomal-amfotericine B) until resistance can be excluded as one of the&#xD;
      treatment options for IA. Given the evidence in favor of voriconazole-echinocandin&#xD;
      combination therapy as well as the increasing incidence of voriconazoleresistant A. fumigatus&#xD;
      in Belgium and the Netherlands, a large clinical study on the value of combination therapy is&#xD;
      urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Evaluate if the survival in patients with a triazole susceptible IA can be improved when&#xD;
      the initial therapy consists of triazole and echinocandin combination therapy instead of&#xD;
      triazole monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate if a triazole/echinocandin combination therapy improves the overall quality of&#xD;
           life and if it is a cost-effective intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the outcome of patients in which a triazole-resistant A. fumigatus is detected&#xD;
           in relation to the initial antifungal therapy patients had received (i.e. triazole&#xD;
           monotherapy or combination therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the outcome of patients in which resistance testing is unsuccessful in function&#xD;
           of the antifungal therapy they received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate if the baseline serum galactomannan value and the serum galactomannan kinetics&#xD;
           are predictive of overall 6-week survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-blinded phase 3 randomized pragmatic clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunocompromised patients who fulfill the EORTC/MSG host factor and mycological criteria of&#xD;
      invasive aspergillosis ICU patients with influenza who fulfill a definition of IA specific&#xD;
      for this population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with a triazole (voriconazole or isavuconazole or posaconazole) + anidulafungin IV.&#xD;
      The triazole is administered for at least 6 weeks while anidulafungin is given for at least 7&#xD;
      and a maximum of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with a triazole (voriconazole or isavuconazole or posaconazole) for at least 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have started or will start voriconazole or isavuconazole (or posaconazole if&#xD;
             voriconazole or isavuconazole cannot be given as per treating physician's decision) as&#xD;
             antifungal therapy on the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For all patients: presence of one of the EORTC/MSG host factors as defined in appendix&#xD;
             1 or being admitted to the ICU with influenza&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For non-ICU patients or ICU patients without influenza: Meet the EORTC/MSG clinical&#xD;
             criterium (appendix 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For non-ICU patients or ICU patients without influenza: Meet the mycological criterium&#xD;
             (appendix 1) or fulfil inclusion criterium 7&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. For ICU patients with influenza we consider an isolated positive sputum culture for&#xD;
             Aspergillus spp. insufficient as amycological criterium. Therefore, in these patients&#xD;
             only one of the following mycological criteria are acceptable; Serum galactomannan&#xD;
             ≥0.5, BAL galactomannan ≥1.0 or Aspergillus spp. cultured in BAL fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Please note that patients with AML receiving chemotherapy or patients with ALL&#xD;
             receiving or having received corticosteroid therapy within the last 4 weeks in the&#xD;
             context of their pre-phase, induction, consolidation, intensification or interphase&#xD;
             treatment as well as patients receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD&#xD;
             can be included before the mycological criterium is fulfilled on condition that they&#xD;
             fulfill the EORTC/MSG lung CT radiology criteria (halo sign, well-described nodule,&#xD;
             cavity as described in appendix 1) at the time of inclusion and as long as the&#xD;
             mycological test results are expected to become available within 96 and no later than&#xD;
             7 days after inclusion. If these test results turn out to be negative, the patient&#xD;
             will be withdrawn from the study and further treatment is at physician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Written informed consent by patient or legal representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known history of allergy, hypersensitivity or serious reaction to azole or&#xD;
             echinocandin antifungals;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with chronic invasive aspergillosis or a chronic non-invasive aspergillus&#xD;
             infection (e.g. aspergilloma) defined as the clinical or radiological sign of&#xD;
             infection being present for &gt;28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Receipt of itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole or isavuconazole as prophylaxis&#xD;
             for at least 7 days in the 14 days preceding the date of the first radiological signs&#xD;
             of the Aspergillus infection. Patients in which the most recent serum level of the&#xD;
             triazole given as prophylaxis was subtherapeutic can be included (*).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Receipt of echinocandin prophylaxis for &gt;96 hours in the preceding 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Receipt of systemic antifungal treatment with an echinocandin or an azole for the&#xD;
             current episode of invasive aspergillosis for a duration of &gt; 96 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. For patients in the Netherlands only: Diagnostic testing to exclude azole resistance&#xD;
             will not be possible (sputum cultures are negative and BAL sampling will not be&#xD;
             performed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ICU patients only: Patients with a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score&#xD;
             &gt;11 at the time of screening for the study are excluded. If randomization is done &gt;24&#xD;
             hours after screening the calculation should be repeated before the patient can be&#xD;
             randomized (appendix 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. ICU patients only: Patients in which weaning from the ventilator or ECMO system is&#xD;
             deemed unlikely due to irreversible lung damage&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect&#xD;
             patient safety, preclude evaluation of response (e.g. because survival beyond 6 weeks&#xD;
             is unlikely due to the underlying disease status)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient previously included in this study&#xD;
