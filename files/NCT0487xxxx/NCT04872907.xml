  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, split-mouth, national multicenter&#xD;
      trial, comparing the efficacy of a self-etch adhesive system combined (SAM) with a flowable&#xD;
      composite to that of a fluoride varnish for the prevention of spontaneous dental abscesses in&#xD;
      children with XLH. For each patient, according to randomization, one side of the oral cavity&#xD;
      is treated with the experimental treatment (application of the adhesive system to healthy&#xD;
      anterior and posterior temporary teeth, and application of the flowable composite to healthy&#xD;
      posterior temporary teeth), and the other side with the active comparator (fluoride varnish).&#xD;
      The application process for both treatments is similar and will be renewed every 6 months&#xD;
      (visits at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months) systematically for the SAM and the varnish, and in case&#xD;
      of partial or total loss of the composite.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a vitamin D-resistant familial rickets resulting from a&#xD;
      mutation of the PHEX gene. One of the major clinical disorders is dental pulp necrosis, which&#xD;
      results in &quot;spontaneous&quot; dental abscesses not related to carious lesions or trauma. These&#xD;
      abscesses, which occur in about 67% of children with XLH, can lead to serious complications:&#xD;
      loss of teeth, disorders of masticatory, phonetic and aesthetic functions, disorders of&#xD;
      occlusion and alveolar-dental development, cervicofacial cellulitis, consequences on the&#xD;
      psychological development of the child. this study is the first randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      for the prevention of these abscesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to evaluate whether a non-invasive adhesive technique, combining the&#xD;
      application of a self-etch adhesive system (SAM) to all faces (smooth, proximal and occlusal)&#xD;
      of all temporary teeth (anterior and posterior) and a flowable composite applied in the&#xD;
      grooves of the posterior temporary teeth, is effective in preventing the development of&#xD;
      spontaneous abscesses in children with XLH, compared to the application of a fluoride&#xD;
      varnish.&#xD;

    <description>Spontaneous dental abscesses is defined at least one of the following criteria, in the absence of cavities or dental trauma:&#xD;
- Clinical criterion: Clinical vestibular, lingual or palatal gingival abscess , or Fistulized abscess, or Fistula, or Head and neck cellulitis .&#xD;
- Radiological criteria: Pathological bone radiolucency (periapical or interradicular), visible on a retro-alveolar image.&#xD;
The occurrence of at least one spontaneous abscess (binary criterion) will be evaluated for each of the treated sites (4 quadrants per child, corresponding to 2 quadrants on each side of the oral cavity). Only abscesses occurring on a tooth with a history of abscess and free from abscess at inclusion will be considered. Abscesses occurring on a tooth with a carious lesion will not be considered.</description>
