  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of ultrasound-guided thoracic&#xD;
      paravertebral block (TPVB) when performing sympathetic block for upper limb pain control.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Well-trained pain physicians performs all US-guided stellate ganglion block(SGB)s or&#xD;
      US-guided thoracic paravertebrl block(TPVB)s, who is not involved in evaluating study&#xD;
      variables. Electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation were monitored for all patients before, while, and after conducting procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For US-guided SGB, patients are supine positioned, and skin preparation on injection site is&#xD;
      done with chlorohexidine. Procedure is conducted under ultrasound guidance at C6 level. 6ml&#xD;
      of 1% mepivacaine is injected for the SGB group. Syringes are prepared by one nurse who do&#xD;
      not involved in other steps of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For US-guided TPVB, patients are prone positioned, and skin preparation on injection site is&#xD;
      done with chlorohexidine. Procedure is conducted under ultrasound guidance at T2&#xD;
      paravertebral space. 10ml of 1% mepivacaine is injected for the TPVB group. Syringes are&#xD;
      prepared by one nurse who do not involved in other steps of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temperature measurement is conducted 2 times (before US-guided SGB or TPVB and after 20&#xD;
      minutes) at both hands by one person who's not involved in other measuring in the study.&#xD;
