  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to the intensive care unit develop psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety,&#xD;
      depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, which can be prolonged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the COVID crisis, the presence of relatives in the intensive care unit was reduced and&#xD;
      this, in a lasting way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that there is a difference in the experience of the stay in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit whether or not one is affected by SARS-CoV-2 and that this difference is likely to&#xD;
      have an impact on the long-term outcome of the patients and their relatives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The stay in the ICU is a complex and often traumatic experience for patients. Patients often&#xD;
      develop psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      after an ICU stay. These symptoms can be prolonged over time, resulting in a decrease in&#xD;
      quality of life and a potential cost in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the epidemic context of the COVID crisis, the presence of family members in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit was reduced to its most extreme portion, with sometimes an almost total&#xD;
      impossibility of visiting a loved one. This situation, although it has become less strict,&#xD;
      has lasted for a long time. The patient can only exchange with them with difficulty, despite&#xD;
      the extremely trying situation that is resuscitation. Moreover, there is a stress factor&#xD;
      linked to the infectious risk for the relatives and for the relatives with regard to&#xD;
      COVID-19, in particular within the framework of family clusters with sometimes several&#xD;
      hospitalized subjects within the same family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of course, means of communication have been put in place with relatives, but these means do&#xD;
      not seem to be equivalent to the presence of one's relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore hypothesize that there is a difference in the experience of the&#xD;
      stay in the intensive care unit whether or not one is affected by SARS-CoV-2 and that this&#xD;
      difference is likely to have an impact on the long-term outcome of patients and their&#xD;
      relatives.&#xD;
