  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre single-blind waitlist randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will&#xD;
      examine the clinical value and cost-effectiveness of an online physical and emotional&#xD;
      wellbeing resource for the improvement of health-related quality of life in people with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical inactivity and poor mental health are very real concerns for people living with&#xD;
      kidney disease, and they report multiple symptoms that impact upon the physical component of&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A decrease in the physical component of HRQoL is&#xD;
      independently associated with mortality and morbidity. In people living with end stage kidney&#xD;
      disease (ESKD), systematic reviews indicate that a range of exercise training interventions&#xD;
      improve physical function and alleviate disability symptoms. The physical component of HRQoL&#xD;
      can be targeted with interventions to enhance physical activity, however people living with&#xD;
      kidney disease are still not routinely offered specialist physical activity or mental health&#xD;
      support in the NHS. Kidney Beam is a new wellbeing digital health intervention platform that&#xD;
      was developed, and launched, to help people with kidney disease manage their physical and&#xD;
      mental health through the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, resulting lockdown and&#xD;
      beyond. It involves a digital health intervention platform to support people with health&#xD;
      conditions to stay physically active. Patients will have access to live-on demand or recorded&#xD;
      physical activity classes that they will use for 12 weeks with 2 sessions per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit 304 patients.&#xD;

      Trial Design An investigator-led multicentre single-blind waitlist randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial (with nested pilot study) of participants with established chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      (CKD). The study will adopt a nested pilot design to preliminarily assess trial and&#xD;
      intervention feasibility. To assess this, a traffic light system will be utilised to&#xD;
      determine if the study should be halted (red), changes to the design or intervention&#xD;
      considered (amber) or is considered feasible and progress to the full trial (green). These&#xD;
      criteria will be reviewed and set by the investigators prior to start of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Participants and Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three hundred and thirty patients aged 18 years or over with established CKD will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Potential study trial patients will be identified in outpatient clinic list or&#xD;
      approached during their routine hospital visit for an informal chat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team and PI will confirm patient's eligibility. When patient agrees to participate,&#xD;
      patient will be asked to sign a consent form. Patient will be scheduled for baseline visit&#xD;
      and will be randomised using a secure web-based service. Only by the unblinded member of the&#xD;
      study team will be able to randomise patient. Blinded member of the team (research Assistant)&#xD;
      will perform the assessment of outcome measures at Baseline and 12 week visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomisation, patient will be assigned either to waiting list or non-waiting list. If&#xD;
      patient is assigned to nonwaiting list group, patient will be asked to attend a total of 3&#xD;
      virtual assessments (baseline, 6M and 12M) and will offered online Kidney BEAM intervention&#xD;
      straight away for 12 weeks. If patient is assigned to waiting list group, they will still be&#xD;
      asked to complete the 3 virtual assessments but will only start online Kidney BEAM&#xD;
      intervention after 12 weeks of being on study. Baseline and 12 week visit will include a&#xD;
      review of patient's up to date blood test results, functional capacity (Sit-to stand 60),&#xD;
      completion of questionnaire sets and adverse event assessment. After completing the&#xD;
      intervention, a highly trained physiotherapist will also conduct qualitative interview to&#xD;
      explore patient's experience of the study. For the pilot interviews , up to 15 participants&#xD;
      from the intervention arm will be recruited. For the final interviews, up to 30 participants&#xD;
      will be recruited in total, from each arm of the trial. Again, data collection will cease at&#xD;
      the point where information power is achieved. Interviews are expected to last approximately&#xD;
      60 minutes. At the end of each interview, participants will be given another opportunity to&#xD;
      ask questions, or seek clarification and the voluntary nature of their participation will be&#xD;
      re-iterated. Should any participant request further information or highlight any concerns&#xD;
      during the interview then these will be discussed with the Principal Investigator at their&#xD;
      recruiting site, for appropriate onward referral as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 Sub-study The Kidney Beam trial will contain an exploratory sub-study for any&#xD;
      patients with CKD who had COVID-19 or who have been left with CKD following AKI-related to&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection. Only patients with history of COVID prior to consent will be assessed&#xD;
      using COVID functional status tool at baseline and 12 week visit. Patients who develop COVID&#xD;
      while on study will be assessed the same tool on their follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those who had a positive test, an assessment of the severity of their COVID will be made&#xD;
      in the following way:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVID positive, managed at home not requiring hospital admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVID positive, required hospital admission but no oxygen therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVID positive, required hospital admission and oxygen therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVID positive, required hospital admission and non-invasive ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVID positive, required hospital admission and admission to intensive care Additional&#xD;
           details of the admission, including length of stay and time since discharge will be&#xD;
           recorded. Subjects will continue in the study in the same way but will complete the&#xD;
           post-COVID functional status tool questionnaire at baseline and follow-up in addition to&#xD;
           other outcome measures.&#xD;
