  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications are the leading cause of diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (DM)-related morbidity and mortality, creating a significant burden on the public health&#xD;
      system. This burden is, in part, attributable to poor medication adherence, with 21-42% of&#xD;
      patients failing to properly adhere to their care. Importantly, this issue is especially&#xD;
      pronounced in minority and low-income populations, which show higher rates of chronic illness&#xD;
      and lower medication adherence. Interventions that foster and reinforce patient-centered&#xD;
      communication between clinicians and patients show promise in improving health outcomes.&#xD;
      However, they have not been widely implemented, in part due to a lack of compelling evidence&#xD;
      for their effectiveness in primary care settings. Project Objective: The investigators&#xD;
      propose to evaluate the impact of a patient activation program: Office Guidelines Applied to&#xD;
      Practice (Office-GAP) combined with mobile text messaging reinforcement (Way to Health [W2H])&#xD;
      on medication adherence in patients with DM compared to mobile texting alone. Office-GAP&#xD;
      incorporates shared decision-making and a decision/support checklist to be completed during&#xD;
      office visits, to foster patients' investment in their own care. W2H is a texting service&#xD;
      that informs and encourages patients to adhere to goals and improve communication. The&#xD;
      long-term goal is to develop a model that can reliably improve and sustain adherence and can&#xD;
      be successfully implemented in primary care clinics to close the morbidity and mortality gap&#xD;
      for minority/low-income DM patients. The hypothesis is that the combined face-to-face patient&#xD;
      activation and texting- delivered reinforcement methods will facilitate communication between&#xD;
      patients and providers, improving the frequency, accuracy, and timeliness of communication&#xD;
      while reinforcing shared goals and engendering mutual respect more than texting alone.&#xD;
      Improved communication between patients and providers may improve medication adherence, blood&#xD;
      sugar, cholesterol, blood pressure control, and patient satisfaction with providers, and&#xD;
      ultimately decrease burden of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Strategy: The investigators will conduct a randomized community-based clinical trial&#xD;
      in Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in Michigan enrolling 378 patients in 17 teams.&#xD;
      All patients will receive usual care and medication for DM and CVD prevention. Eight teams&#xD;
      will use W2H alone, and 9 teams will combine Office-GAP with WTH. The investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of shared decision-making strategies for patients and providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: If successfully translated to clinical practice, these interventions have the&#xD;
      potential to significantly impact patient care in FQHCs, improving outcomes for DM and CVD.&#xD;
      This research also paves the way for shifting clinical practice across a spectrum of chronic&#xD;
      disease where medication non-adherence is an issue.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study design and overview: The investigators will conduct this study with 17 teams in 12&#xD;
      clinics that serve low-income patients: Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC's). The goal&#xD;
      of the study is to evaluate how well the approach to improving patient outcomes with a blend&#xD;
      of communication strategies works in real-world settings compared to mobile phone texting&#xD;
      alone. Each team will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the Intervention (Group 1):&#xD;
      includes a patient group meeting + a checklist used during each medical visit (together&#xD;
      called Office-GAP) along with text messaging in between visits; the Control (Group 2)&#xD;
      includes only the text messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: The investigators will recruit 22 diabetes (DM) patients per team. All&#xD;
      patients at a particular team will participate in the same group (intervention or control).&#xD;
      The investigators chose this approach because it is realistic for providers and patients at a&#xD;
      team to follow a similar approach. This also helps the comparison of control and intervention&#xD;
      groups to be more accurate because there is less chance of mixing between the two groups. In&#xD;
      Michigan, FQHCs have similar numbers and types of providers (internal and family medicine)&#xD;
      and nurse practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Setting: Because the investigators are interested in how well the interventions may&#xD;
      address disparities in health outcomes for low-income and minority patients, they are&#xD;
      recruited from FQHCs who serve these populations in Michigan. FQHC patients are mainly below&#xD;
      federal poverty levels (92% of participants); 56% are non-white; 91% are uninsured or covered&#xD;
      by Medicaid. Sample: A total of 378 patients, men and women, with Type II diabetes that is&#xD;
      not well-controlled (the standard will be a score for the HbA1c test equal to or higher than&#xD;
      8) will be recruited. In the investigators' pilot studies, 80% of patients who met these&#xD;
      criteria agreed to participate. In the pilot, about 10% dropped out before follow-up at 3&#xD;
      months and a further 3% dropped out before completion. A 20% dropout rate is anticipated.&#xD;
      Recruiting 378 patients will result in 320 patients retained by the end of the 5 year study.&#xD;
      Based on the pilot study and feedback from clinics, it is estimated that the enrollment goal&#xD;
      will be reached within 4 years. Each FQHC will have at least 200 DM patients who meet the&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Intervention procedures: Patients will participate either in the intervention group&#xD;
      (Office-GAP + Texting) or in the control group (Texting only) as described below. All&#xD;
      patients will receive medical treatment-as-usual from the participating clinics, consisting&#xD;
      of diabetes care, usual preventive care, and other medical treatment as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Office-GAP Intervention (Patient Activation Intervention): The investigators have described&#xD;
      the Office-GAP intervention in previous peer-reviewed publications (1-3). Briefly, after&#xD;
      recruitment, patients in the Office-GAP group will attend: 1) one scheduled group visit,&#xD;
      (90-120 min; 4-6 patients at a time); 2) one follow-up visit with their providers within one&#xD;
      month, and then at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the group visit. At these follow-up visits,&#xD;
      providers will complete the Office-GAP Checklist, which evaluates medication prescribing&#xD;
      behavior. In addition, shared decision-making (SDM) and goal setting occurs between patient&#xD;
      and provider. These follow-up visits are patients' regularly scheduled visits with their&#xD;
      providers and not additional to their usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the group visit: Research Assistants will obtain informed consent/HIPAA authorization from&#xD;
      patients after introducing them to the study; Group 1: Office-GAP + Texting session: the&#xD;
      group visit is a Shared Decision Making (SDM) activation session wherein patients learn&#xD;
      self-management behaviors, communication skills, and use of decision support tools (DSTs).&#xD;
      They also learn how to use the eCap electronic pill container to monitor medication&#xD;
      adherence; learn to use Way to Health Texting service and confirm set up on their mobile&#xD;
      phone. Group 2: For the texting only group: participants will learn how to use Way to Health&#xD;
      Texting service and confirm set up on their mobile phone, and learn how to use the eCap&#xD;
      electronic pill container to monitor medication adherence. They will not experience the&#xD;
      Office-GAP intervention. Both groups will also complete baseline study questionnaires during&#xD;
      the group visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Office-GAP Follow-up visit with providers: the Office-GAP Checklist. The Office-GAP Checklist&#xD;
      is the core tool of the SDM intervention. A one-page checklist, this SDM tool outlines all&#xD;
      evidence-based medications for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in T2DM&#xD;
      patients. It is an in-consultation decision support tool that helps engage the patient and&#xD;
      provider to encourage and enhance an SDM process via discussion of medication and secondary&#xD;
      prevention/lifestyle changes during an office visit. In this study, the Office-GAP Checklist&#xD;
      will be completed by the provider with direct patient involvement during the office visits at&#xD;
      0-1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Only Group 1 patients will use this checklist during their office&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Office-GAP Checklist also serves as a provider reminder at the point of care, because the&#xD;
      provider records a check-mark for each medication: &quot;Yes&quot; (if patient is on the medication),&#xD;
      &quot;No&quot; (if patient is not), or &quot;Does not apply to me because…&quot; A reason for exclusion of a&#xD;
      medication is also provided (patient is not eligible for the medication, has a&#xD;
      contraindication to its use, or the patient and provider have identified an alternative due&#xD;
      to side effect or cost concerns). Details about the next appointment and any secondary&#xD;
      prevention plan changes are also listed on the form. At the end of the visit, both patient&#xD;
      and provider sign the form to confirm that they have reviewed the checklist. The patient&#xD;
      receives a copy of the checklist to take home and a copy is retained in the patient record.&#xD;
      All providers in the intervention teams receive a brief provider education in Office-GAP tool&#xD;
      use and communication skills (described below C.4.15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational tool literacy standards. Office-GAP has been rigorously adapted for use with low&#xD;
      health literacy patients. All study materials are grade 6 reading level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile DM self-management texting intervention (Way to Health Texting Program). During group&#xD;
      visits, all patients in both groups will be taught how to send and receive text messages on&#xD;
      their phone. The Way to Health service does not require patients to use a special app. Way to&#xD;
      Health engages patients in two ways: 1) Patients receive daily Way to Health messages&#xD;
      appropriate to their diagnosis and medications (e.g. BP, blood glucose, medication) and&#xD;
      appointment reminders throughout the study. They also receive informational and educational&#xD;
      texts. 2) Patients respond to prompts, and may contact their providers' office throughout the&#xD;
      study via texting. Patients will receive additional diabetic modules that follow the standard&#xD;
      for diabetes education for the rest of the 12 months once the initial 15 week program is&#xD;
      complete. The Way to Health texting program will be used to encourage T2DM patients to&#xD;
      maintain communication with their providers, improve medication adherence, and other&#xD;
      secondary prevention and self-care between visits. Daily messages may take the form of&#xD;
      reminders, prompts, education, or reinforcement. Sample message texts include &quot;Did you take&#xD;
      your medications today?&quot; and &quot;How many times did you check your feet for wounds this week?&quot;&#xD;
      The pilot found the program to be usable and effective for both patients and providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provider and Practice Staff Training. All intervention providers will participate in an&#xD;
      interactive orientation which has been shown to promote behavioral change among health&#xD;
      professionals. Providers will be asked to agree to participate in the study before the&#xD;
      session. Provider/Staff Educational module: The training session is 90 minutes long. The&#xD;
      session is scheduled at multiple times to meet providers' needs. In the pilot Office-GAP&#xD;
      study, there was 100% participation by providers. The training module, delivered by the PI&#xD;
      and Dr. Karen Kelly-Blake, includes: 1) brief presentations on effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of medical therapy and behavior changes in management of T2DM, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and heart disease; 2) a hands-on practice session for providers to elicit patients'&#xD;
      preferences and values; 3) an introduction to the Office-GAP Checklist and best practices for&#xD;
      using it during a patient encounter; 4) review of the Smith evidence-based patient-centered&#xD;
      method for establishing trust, communicating clearly, and engaging in goal-setting with&#xD;
      patients. Providers will have a chance to practice skills using Braddock and Elwyn's approach&#xD;
      to role-playing to model office visits; and 5) a complete pre-and post-training survey&#xD;
      (before and after the training session) to determine provider attitudes about the use of&#xD;
      DSTs, SDM, and mHealth in their practice and an end of study semi-structured interview. The&#xD;
      investigators are highly experienced in provider training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of outcomes: The primary outcome (medication adherence - how well patients adhere to&#xD;
      their providers' advice to take medications) will be assessed in each individual patient by&#xD;
      e-CAP monitoring, a device that signals when patients open their prescription medication&#xD;
      bottles. The investigators will conduct preliminary analysis of study hypotheses at 6mo and&#xD;
      12mo using standard statistical tests. A comparison of Office-GAP plus Way to Health teams&#xD;
      (Group 1) to Way to Health only teams (Group 2) at baseline will be conducted to be sure the&#xD;
      patient populations are similar in terms of health characteristics that may influence the&#xD;
      results. If substantive differences are found, the investigators will be able to control for&#xD;
      these in subsequent analyses using statistical regression techniques. This method assures a&#xD;
      degree of dissimilarity rather than assuming all of the clinical populations are identical.&#xD;
      Equivalence between the groups will be assessed based on demographic factors such as age,&#xD;
      gender, education, race/ethnicity.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Office-GAP is a Patient Activation Intervention Program for Group 1 that includes: 1) Group visit 2) Provider training for patient activation, and 3) Office-GAP checklist used in the office. Patients in Groups 1 and 2 will attend one group visit and 5 follow-up visits with their provider in 1 month, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the group visit. For Group 1, the group visit is a shared decision making (SDM) activation session wherein patients learn self-management behaviors, medication use, communication skills, and use of decision support tools (DST). The Office-GAP Checklist is an in-consultation DST that helps engage the patient and provider in initiating and enhancing a SDM process via discussion of medication and secondary prevention/lifestyle changes. Way to Health is a text-based DM self-management program. Groups 1 and 2 receive a 15-week customized program of text messages after the group visit. For the remaining 12 months, they will receive standard diabetic education modules.</intervention_model_description>
