  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In most pediatric medical conditions, tremendous progress in pediatrics has significantly&#xD;
      improved the overall prognosis and transferred the mortality from childhood to adulthood.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, chronic diseases remain the leading cause of death and physical inactivity&#xD;
      appears to be a major aggravating factor. Yet, a good physical activity has a positive impact&#xD;
      on quality of life and prevents future health morbidities, such as obesity and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Therefore, after focusing on the survival of children with chronic diseases, more&#xD;
      attention is being given to health-related quality of life and secondary prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the cardio-pulmonary exercise test (CPET), which is a non-invasive and&#xD;
      dynamic examination, has become the gold standard to identify subjects with impaired physical&#xD;
      capacity and to identify the causes of their limitations (muscular, cardiac, respiratory,&#xD;
      behavioral, etc.). Moreover, CPET is the key examination to enroll patients in personalized&#xD;
      physical rehabilitation programs (muscle deconditioning, respiratory limitation, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a growing interest in CPET and individualized rehabilitation programs for chronic&#xD;
      diseases, the investigators still face the lack of reference values for pediatric CPET. In&#xD;
      current practice, many CPET pediatric laboratories use the reference values of maximum oxygen&#xD;
      uptake (VO2max) defined by Cooper et al. in 1984, from a cohort of 109 healthy children.&#xD;
      However, their equations are linear and based on weight only. Non linear equations and the&#xD;
      use of other anthropometric variables may be relevant in pediatrics. For instance, in the&#xD;
      current era, normal CPET pediatric values should consider the prevalence of overweight and&#xD;
      obesity in childhood general population (respectively 30% and 10% in Europa and 35% and 25%&#xD;
      in North America), as well as in the population of children with chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past decade, our group has developed a research program on physical capacity in&#xD;
      children, with a focus on pediatric CPET and physical rehabilitation, from a cohort of nearly&#xD;
      1000 exercise tests in children. The lack of reliable pediatric reference values for VO2max,&#xD;
      and all CPET variables as well, has become an important issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to define pediatric reference CPET values from a large&#xD;
      cohort of 6 to 17 year-old children, using several anthropometric variables to define the&#xD;
      most appropriate Z-scores equations (part 1). The investigators will also validate the&#xD;
      Z-scores equations using an independent population (part 2).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional study included healthy children from 6 to 17 years old and obese&#xD;
      children with no other comorbidities other than those due to metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      (hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes sleep apnea, hepatic steatosis). Patients refuse&#xD;
      the use of medical data will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 - Z-score equations: After description of the study sample, the regression method will&#xD;
      be identified (linear, polynomial, logarithmic, spline, etc.). The main anthropometric&#xD;
      determinants (age, gender, height, weight, BMI) will be tested, and the mathematical models&#xD;
      that best fit to the data will be identified (use of the adjusted coefficient of&#xD;
      determination R2). The models will calculate, for each subject, the difference between the&#xD;
      value predicted by the model and the value actually observed (residuals of the model). The&#xD;
      occurrence of heteroscedasticity (e.g. the circumstance in which the variability of a&#xD;
      variable is unequal across the range of values of a second variable that predicts it) will be&#xD;
      tested. The Z-scores will be measured by the difference between predicted values and observed&#xD;
      values divided by the calculated standard deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2- Validation of Z-score equations from an independent population The validity of the&#xD;
      Z-score equations will be tested on a cohort of 100 pediatric in 6 to 18 year-old children,&#xD;
      from pediatric CPET laboratories that did not participate in the part 1 study. The CPET&#xD;
      variables may be retrospectively collected from existing database or prospectively collected,&#xD;
      but no CPET should be performed for the only purpose of the research (observational study)&#xD;
