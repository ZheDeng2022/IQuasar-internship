    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare the Emsella Chair therapy to Sham and to&#xD;
      determine whether electromagnetic technology is effective in the treatment of overactive&#xD;
      bladder (OAB). Currently there are no other studies utilizing the Emsella Chair for the&#xD;
      treatment of OAB. Eligible subjects will receive 2 treatments per week for a total of 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common and often debilitating condition in both men and women.&#xD;
      OAB symptoms including urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge incontinence (UI), have been&#xD;
      found to negatively impact quality of life. Due to side effects and the lack of patient&#xD;
      compliance to pharmacologic treatments for OAB, non-pharmacologic treatments are in high&#xD;
      demand for this condition. Neuromodulation therapies have become increasingly popular for the&#xD;
      treatment of overactive bladder in men and women. These neuromodulation therapies work in&#xD;
      treating OAB by stimulating the pudendal nerve. The BTL EmsellaTM (Emsella Chair) is a&#xD;
      conservative neuromodulation therapy that may have a role for patients who are not surgical&#xD;
      candidates or who desire a noninvasive treatment option. The ideal treatment for OAB is still&#xD;
      lacking. Many patients are interested in pursuing conservative treatment options. The Emsella&#xD;
      chair may have a role for patient who do not desire surgery found with SNM or desire a&#xD;
      noninvasive treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Emsella chair is approved as a treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI).&#xD;
      Overactive bladder patients may benefit from treatment. The Emsella chair generates&#xD;
      electromagnetic stimulation which is able to penetrate deep into the pelvic floor muscles&#xD;
      inducing stimulation and providing rehabilitation for weak pelvic floor muscles. The Emsella&#xD;
      chair is a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology for the treatment&#xD;
      of SUI, in addition to other pelvic floor related disorders. HIFEM technology induces deep&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle contractions designed to deliver the equivalent of 11,200 Kegel exercises&#xD;
      over 28 minutes.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the efficacy of Emsella Chair versus Sham by evaluating the proportion of subjects reporting &quot;moderately improved&quot; or &quot;markedly improved&quot; responses on the Global Response Assessment (GRA) for overall bladder symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after completing all treatments; week 8 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The GRA evaluates the patients' perceptions of overall improvement in symptoms on a 7-point scale (markedly worse, moderately worse, mildly worse, unchanged, slightly improved, moderately improved, markedly improved).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the efficacy of Emsella chair versus Sham by evaluating the change in subject-reported urinary urgency, frequency, and leakage episodes as reported in a 3-day voiding diary.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after completing all treatments; week 8 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will record all urinary voids, specifying each episode of urination, urinary leakage, including type, urinary urgency before voiding. In each 3-day voiding diary, subjects are to record voiding data for 3 consecutive days on a paper diary. To be considered valid, each 3-day voiding diary must be recorded within 7 days on either side of a planned visit, based on the date of randomization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the efficacy of Emsella chair versus Sham by evaluating the change in subject-reported overactive bladder symptoms as measured by the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire-Short form (OAB-q).</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after completing all treatments; week 8 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The OAB-q short form is a disease-specific questionnaire that assesses symptom bother and health related quality of life (HRQL) in people with OAB. The OAB-q short form consists of a 6-item symptom bother scale and a 13- item HRQL scale. A higher score indicates a greater severity of symptom bother.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the efficacy of Emsella chair versus Sham by evaluating the change in subject-reported impact of urinary incontinence on daily life as measured by the Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire (I-QOL).</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after completing all treatments; week 8 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The I-QOL is a self-reported quality of life measure specific to urinary problems that can be used to assess the impact of urinary problems and their treatment. The I-QOL is a 22 item measure that is divided into three domains: 1) 8-item domain assessing the physical impact of urinary incontinence. 2) 9-item domain assessing psychological impact 3) 5-item domain assessing social impact. Scores are calculated for each domain, and a total summary score can be calculated from all 22 items. A higher scores indicates a greater severity of symptoms on quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the efficacy of Emsella chair versus Sham by the change in subject-reported fecal incontinence as measured by the Wexner Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score (Wexner Scale).</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after completing all treatments; week 8 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The Wexner Scale is a self-administered questionnaire to assess the frequency and severity of fecal incontinence. The score takes into account the type and frequency of incontinence and the extent to which it alters the patient's life. The score ranges from 0 (perfect continence) to 20 (complete incontinence). A higher score indicates a greater severity of fecal incontinence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary durability objective for this study is to determine whether subjects in the Emsella Chair active treatment group continue to have a higher responder rate, as measured by the GRA for overall bladder health, compared to the Sham group.</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment durability will be assessed 4 weeks after the primary endpoint; week 12 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The GRA evaluates the patients' perception of improvement in overall bladder symptoms on a 7-point scale (markedly worse, moderately worse, mildly worse, unchanged, slightly improved, moderately improved, markedly improved).</description>

    <description>Active subjects will be asked to sit on the center of the device and the height will be adjusted until the subject's feet are on the floor. The active treatments are individualized, since some subjects will be more sensitive than others. The Emsella chair will be turned on and the setting gradually increased to the subject's sensory threshold; the maximum sensation the subject can tolerate. The setting will be decreased slightly and stay unchanged for the reminder of the treatment. The treatment threshold should be increased with every treatment until the subject reaches 100%.</description>

    <description>The Emsella Chair is a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology for the treatment of pelvic floor related disorders. HIFEM technology induces deep pelvic floor muscle contractions designed to deliver the equivalent of 11,200 Kegel exercises over 28 minutes. The treatment paradigm consists of 3 different phases. The phases consist of an intense stimulation of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM), which consists of stimulation and relaxation. The repetition of the phases and focused electromagnetic energy delivery leads to pelvic floor stimulation, adaptation, and remodelation.</description>
