  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Secondary angiosarcomas are aggressive mesenchymal tumors with a poor prognosis and limited&#xD;
      therapeutic options. Recent studies conducted in patients with cutaneous squamous-cell&#xD;
      carcinoma provide evidence that cemiplimab has the potential to be an effective treatment&#xD;
      also for patients with secondary angiosarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall response rate after 24 weeks of&#xD;
      cemiplimab treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic secondary angiosarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that cemiplimab could be an effective treatment for patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with locally advanced and metastatic secondary angiosarcomas.&#xD;

      Study design: A prospective, interventional, non-randomized, multicenter, phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cemiplimab is registered for the use in patients with cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma. In&#xD;
      these patient groups cemiplimab showed impressive results. There are numerous similarities&#xD;
      between cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma and secondary angiosarcomas. Based on these&#xD;
      similarities, including a complex genetic background, PD-L1 expression and MYC expression,&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesize that cemiplimab might be an effective treatment for locally&#xD;
      advanced and metastatic secondary angiosarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) after 24 weeks of cemiplimab in secondary&#xD;
      angiosarcomas, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 or&#xD;
      daylight photography as per WHO Offset Publication No. 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include the establishment of the best ORR, median time to response,&#xD;
      duration of response and progression free survival. The secondary objectives also comprise&#xD;
      safety and toxicity quantification and to investigate the relation between response to&#xD;
      cemiplimab and various tumor characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for inclusion are at least 18 years of age, with adequate organ function,&#xD;
      who have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of progressive unresectable locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic secondary angiosarcoma. Patients eligible are patients in the first line of&#xD;
      treatment if they are unfit for chemotherapy and patients in advanced lines of systemic&#xD;
      treatment. Major exclusion criteria include significant ongoing autoimmune disease that&#xD;
      requires immunosuppressive treatment, prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors,&#xD;
      active uncontrolled infections or recent pneumonitis. All patients will provide Informed&#xD;
      Consent prior to inclusion in the study and during the course of the trial, al relevant data&#xD;
      will be stored in electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study inclusion, patients will be treated with Cemiplimab 350mg intravenously every&#xD;
      three weeks. Patients will receive treatment until disease progression or discontinuation due&#xD;
      to unacceptable toxic effects, withdrawal of consent or other reasons. The maximum treatment&#xD;
      period will be two years, as is standard of care for patients treated with immunotherapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that&#xD;
             required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk&#xD;
             for irAEs. The following are not exclusionary: vitiligo, childhood asthma that has&#xD;
             resolved, type 1 Diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism that required only hormone&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Continuous immunosuppressive corticosteroid treatment (doses &gt; 10 mg prednisone daily&#xD;
             or equivalent) within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of cemiplimab. Note: patients&#xD;

             not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active uncontrolled infection requiring therapy, including infection with HIV, active&#xD;
             infection with HBV or HCV.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Untreated brain metastasis(es) that may be considered active.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Note in clarification: Patients with previously treated brain metastases may&#xD;
             participate provided that the lesion(s) is (are) stable (without evidence of&#xD;
             progression for at least 6 weeks on imaging obtained in the screening period), and&#xD;
             there is no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and the patients do not&#xD;
             require any immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids for management of&#xD;
             brain metastasis(es) within 28 days of the first dose of cemiplimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with allergy or hypersensitivity to cemiplimab or to any of the excipients&#xD;
             must be excluded. Specifically, because of the presence of trace components in&#xD;

             transplants may be allowed to enroll after discussion with and approval from the&#xD;
             medical monitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any anticancer treatment other than radiation therapy (chemotherapy, targeted systemic&#xD;
             therapy, imiquimod, photodynamic therapy), investigational or standard of care, within&#xD;
             30 days of the initial administration of cemiplimab or planned to occur during the&#xD;
             study period&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Receipt of live vaccines (including attenuated) within 30 days of first study&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Prior use of PI3K-D inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)*, or sexually active men, who are unwilling to&#xD;
             practice highly effective contraception prior to the initial dose/start of the first&#xD;
             treatment prior to the start of the first treatment, during the study, and for at&#xD;
             least 6 months after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Positive serum pregnancy test (a false positive pregnancy test, if demonstrated by&#xD;
             serial measurements and negative ultrasound, will not be exclusionary, upon&#xD;
             communication with and approval from the medical monitor)&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any other condition that might interfere with experimental treatment and the study&#xD;
             procedures as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
