  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse interstitial lung disease brings together a heterogeneous group of pulmonary&#xD;
      pathologies, characterized by infiltrating and diffuse lesions of the pulmonary interstitium.&#xD;
      The evolving risk of these ILD is pulmonary fibrosis, with the development of chronic&#xD;
      respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of the etiological diagnosis of ILD results from a multidisciplinary approach&#xD;
      (pulmonologists, radiologists, occupational health specialists, anatomo-pathologists, etc…).&#xD;
      Indeed, the multitude of possible causes of these diseases makes the etiological diagnosis&#xD;
      difficult. Professional aetiologies are also frequently mentioned : pneumoconiosis,&#xD;
      hypersensitivity pneumonitis, as a differential diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It therefore appears essential to deepen the professional aspect during the diagnostic&#xD;
      process for ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since May 2020, a professional interview has been systematically offered by the Occupational&#xD;
      Pathology Consultation Center of the Hospital Center Lyon Sud, to patients followed by the&#xD;
      team of Professor Vincent COTTIN, whose file was discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected to constitute a database are the following variables: age, sex, diploma,&#xD;
      professional course coded in CITP (International Standard Classification of Professions) and&#xD;
      NAF (French Nomenclature of Activities), occupational exposures, smoking, risk factors&#xD;
      non-professionals, clinical elements of ILD and elements relating to an occupational disease&#xD;
      certificate. This database is anonymized.&#xD;

    <description>The data collected are the following variables: age, sex, diploma, professional course coded in CITP (International Standard Classification of Professions) and NAF (French Nomenclature of Activities), occupational exposures, smoking, risk factors non-professionals, clinical elements of ILD and elements relating to an occupational disease certificate. This database is anonymized.&#xD;
The precise diagnosis of ILD is retained during the multidisiciplinary meeting.&#xD;
Occupational exposures are assessed in specialized consultation :&#xD;
a first professional interview phase: The professional history is traced, listing the training courses followed and the trades carried out. The questioning is precise and focuses on the different tasks performed, and the products used.&#xD;
a second step, where a questionnaire is completed by the doctor: A list of specific substances is offered to the patient, who responds whether or not he thinks he has been exposed to them in his professional past.</description>
