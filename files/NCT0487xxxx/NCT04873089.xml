  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate, at different times, the RV3278A - ET0943 cosmetic&#xD;
      product efficacy after 8 weeks of application on the face (twice-daily application). At T1&#xD;
      (Baseline), T2 (4 weeks) and T3 (8 weeks), the following assessments are performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The reduction of the pilosebaceous follicular ostium size in vivo (pores) on the&#xD;
           forehead&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical evaluation (count of non inflammatory and inflammatory acne lesions, IGA&#xD;
           score) of the face&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The reduction in visible follicles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The standardized numerical photographs of face and Â¾ right and left profile in normal,&#xD;
           parallel polarized, cross polarized and UV light&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The analysis of the skin lipids of the forehead&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the sebum and comedones constituents (nose&#xD;
           wings)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a comparative, open-labelled study, on subjects with oily and acne prone skins on the&#xD;
      face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group includes 18 subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is monocentric, comparative versus non-treated group, open-labelled, exploratory,&#xD;
      conducted in adults having oily and acne prone skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 4 visits for each group, including subjects' selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V0: Subjects' selection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V1: Baseline inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V2: 4 weeks, follow-up visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V3: 8 weeks, study end&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximal study duration is 61 days. The front, temporal areas and nose wings are defined&#xD;
      as the study interest areas for superficial samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation is at 3 times: T1 baseline, T2 at 4 weeks and T3 at 8 weeks of application of&#xD;
      RV3278A formula ET0943 with comparison of each time versus baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are twice-daily applications (morning and evening) of the test product on the face.&#xD;
