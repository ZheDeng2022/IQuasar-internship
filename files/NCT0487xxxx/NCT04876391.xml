  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with hidradenitis suppurativa who took part in a previous&#xD;
      clinical study of a medicine called spesolimab. Participants who completed treatment can join&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out how safe spesolimab is and whether it helps people&#xD;
      with hidradenitis suppurativa in the long-term. Participants are in this study for about 2&#xD;
      years and 4 months. For 2 years, participants visit the study site every 2 weeks to get&#xD;
      spesolimab injections under the skin. At study visits, doctors check the severity of&#xD;
      participants' hidradenitis suppurativa and collect information on any health problems of the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

    <measure>Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HiSCR is defined as at least a 50% reduction from baseline in abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count, with no increase in the abscess or draining fistula count.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4) value up to week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>up to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The IHS4 assesses the HS severity and the resulting IHS4 score is arrived at by the number of nodules (multiplied by 1) plus the number of abscesses (multiplied by 2) plus the number of draining tunnels (multiplied by 4). A total score of 3 or less signifies mild, 4-10 signifies moderate and 11 or higher signifies severe disease.</description>

    <description>The HS-PGA score ranges from 0 to 5, where 0 (clear, no abscesses, draining tunnels, inflammatory nodules or noninflammatory nodules), 1 (minimal, no abscesses, draining tunnels or inflammatory nodules and the presence of noninflammatory nodules), 2 (mild, no abscesses or draining tunnels and 1-4 inflammatory nodules, or 1 abscess or draining tunnel and no inflammatory nodules), 3 (moderate, no abscesses or draining tunnels and ≥5 inflammatory nodules, or 1 abscess or draining tunnel and ≥1 inflammatory nodule, or 2-5 abscesses or draining tunnels and &lt;10 inflammatory nodules), 4 (severe, 2-5 abscesses or draining tunnels and ≥10 inflammatory nodules), 5 (very severe, &gt;5 abscesses or draining tunnels).</description>

    <description>HASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single score in the range 0 (no disease) to 72 (severe disease).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of at least one flare (defined as at least 25 % increase in AN count with a minimum increase of 2 relative to baseline) up to week 12</measure>

    <time_frame>up to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain NRS assesses the HS-related pain severity. The Pain NRS is completed by the patients during clinic visits. Response is given by an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no HS pain) to 10 (HS pain as bad as one can imagine).</description>
