  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite being a key contributor to maternal mortality in high-burden regions, TB in pregnancy&#xD;
      is a hugely neglected area of global public health. During pregnancy, the symptoms of TB are&#xD;
      often overlooked and undiagnosed because they are vague, non-specific, and can be very&#xD;
      similar to common complaints during pregnancy. Women with TB in pregnancy are at an increased&#xD;
      risk of anemia and perinatal death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DROP-TB project aims to expand the tuberculosis (TB) detection testing in pregnancy by&#xD;
      creating a system where blood samples are collected from women at their local healthcare&#xD;
      clinics instead of/or at national-level TB diagnostic centres where visits can require&#xD;
      substantial travel and cost. Blood samples collected in specific RNA stabilizing tubes and on&#xD;
      specific storing paper filters are collected from pregnant women with presumptive TB and&#xD;
      transported to a central TB testing facility and analyzed by real-time polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (qPCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DROP-TB method measures the mRNA expressions known to be markers of TB infection and&#xD;
      disease. Based on veinous blood sampling, those signatures have showed high sensitivity (93%)&#xD;
      and specificity (97%), can differentiate between active and latent infection, and performs&#xD;
      well in the presence of other infections such as HIV. The DROP-TB program was specifically&#xD;
      designed to increase the coverage of TB testing in pregnancy to improve health outcomes for&#xD;
      women and their unborn children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence generated from this program will demonstrate the feasibility of this program in&#xD;
      providing TB diagnosis to women in rural and remote regions of LMIC with the example of&#xD;
      Madagascar. Evidence will be presented to policy makers as a case to support the national&#xD;
      scale up of the program in LMICs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With this Grand Challenges Canada Transition to scale DROP-TB program, the Institut Pasteur&#xD;
      de Madagascar will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct a validation trial of the DROP-TB screening program in rural Madagascar,&#xD;
           enrolling 3,500 women with presumptive TB, of which ~1,229 will be pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Support the development of laboratory capacity to collect veinous, DBS and other samples&#xD;
           for qPCR at the 101 TB testing centres participating in the trial and implement standard&#xD;
           operating procedures for DROP-TB testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the implementation and cost of the shipping program to bring different type of&#xD;
           blood samples from community-based centres to national health centres for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross -sectional study conducted on pregnant women suspected of having pulmonary TB&#xD;
      (n = 1300), pregnant women without apparent pathology (controlled pregnant women), TB&#xD;
      indemnity and without notion of tuberculous contact ( n = 50) and non -pregnant women were&#xD;
      also free of TB and without a notion of tuberculous contact to control for tests (n = 50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated in the hypothesis of a conservative situation by comparing&#xD;
      confirmed tuberculous participants (positive gold standard diagnostic test) and non&#xD;
      -tuberculous (negative gold standard diagnostic test). The blood signature measured on venous&#xD;
      blood samples showed a sensitivity of 93% in pregnant women. If the acceptable sensitivity&#xD;
      for the new testing method is estimated at 96% and the prevalence of pulmonary TB in pregnant&#xD;
      women in peripheral health centers is 12% and a precision of ± 7 is desired %and an α risk of&#xD;
      5%, a potency of 80%, the required sample size is 1167 pregnant women of which 140 are&#xD;
      bacteriologically confirmed as active TB and 1027 controls. Considering an enrollment or&#xD;
      rejection rate of 20%, the total needed sample would be 1,400 pregnant women in the CDT&#xD;
      functions in the regions of Madagascar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical data as well as biological samples (blood and sputum samples) are collected at&#xD;
           the inclusion, the samples are analyzed at the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data collection is done on paper based questionnaire where the data of each patient&#xD;
           is recorded. The results of biological tests, paraclinical investigations as well as&#xD;
           their results are also be recorded for each participant with the help of this&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data are collected and transferred to a single database (REDCap). The REDCap system&#xD;
           is compliant with the FDA standard CRF-21 part 11 as a reliable tool that allows to&#xD;
           improve data quality and guarantee traceability. The data is stored on an IPM's secure&#xD;
           server.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data management and quality control:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data management is carried out by the IPM's Epidemiology and Clinical Research Unit&#xD;
           (EPI-RC) data management team which closely collaborate with the study coordinators.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Access to this database is restricted and secure. The list of persons with access rights&#xD;
           appears in the data management manual. The data manager of the study is responsible for&#xD;
           the security and quality of the data. A list of errors and inconsistencies detected in&#xD;
           the database are regularly sent to the field team to make corrections. This regular&#xD;
           monitoring will allow to improve the quality of the database. The request for partial or&#xD;
           total extraction of the database must be the subject of a manuscript request and must&#xD;
           have the consent of the epidemiological coordinator and scientific managers of the&#xD;
           project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analyzes:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The entire study data is grouped into a single database and cleaned prior to any&#xD;
           statistical processing of the data. All statistical analyzes will be performed on the&#xD;
           GraphPad PRism and R software (http://www.R-project.org/) by designated competent&#xD;
           persons for each data category studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Management of Potential Unnecessary Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All undesirable events, observed during the study will be recorded in an observation&#xD;
           register, which is either their severity and the link with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Events will be coded using the 10th International Classification of Diseases (CIM-10)&#xD;
           http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Quality assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project investigators ensure the internal monitoring of the project at the study sites and&#xD;
      are directly responsible for the collection, storage and transportation of the samples.&#xD;
      Experienced laboratory technologists are in charge of manipulating and preparing samples for&#xD;
      qPCR and DBS techniques at IPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators and coordinators ensure that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the protocol is followed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the recruitment of participants is done according to the planned schedule;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological samples are labeled appropriately and consistently;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the data is coherent and collected, recorded and secured as indicated in the data&#xD;
           management plan of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Coordinator and supervisors, recruited by the IPM, plan to visit the study sites&#xD;
      regularly and is authorized to inspect the study documents so that patient confidentiality is&#xD;
      maintained, in accordance with local regulations. The investigator cooperates with the&#xD;
      coordinator so that any problems are identified during these control visits or resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPM has specific quality controls and assurance procedures developed and maintained in its&#xD;
      laboratories and research units.&#xD;

      The novel test is based on measurements of relative amounts of mRNA expression associated&#xD;
      with 3 target genes identified through a genome-wide multicohort analysis using genetic&#xD;
      sequencing data from confirmed pulmonary TB patients. The 3-gene mRNA-based q-PCR test (3G&#xD;
      q-PCR) is able to detect infection in 93% of patients, can differentiate between active&#xD;
      pulmonary disease and latent infection with good sensitivity (i.e. 88%)&#xD;
