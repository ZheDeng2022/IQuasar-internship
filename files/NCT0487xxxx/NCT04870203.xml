  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As stated by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the Société Française de&#xD;
      Rhumatologie (SFR), treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should target&#xD;
      sustained remission or at least low disease activity. However, despite significant advances&#xD;
      based on various combinations of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs&#xD;
      (DMARDs) and biologic DMARDs, RA therapies meet treatment goals only in some patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  40 to 50% of patients with early RA, treated with methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy as&#xD;
           first-line therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 to 30% of patients treated with a combination of MTX and biologic as second-line&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less than 10% of patients treated with a combination of MTX and another targeted DMARD,&#xD;
           such as baricitinib, as third-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, new strategies targeted at achieving a higher percentage of remission are needed,&#xD;
      that do not require waiting for multiple failed therapies. Combinations of biologics have&#xD;
      shown synergistic improvement of symptoms in murine models of RA relative to the improvement&#xD;
      observed with either agent alone. However, in RA patients, only five randomised clinical&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) have explored the efficacy and safety of combining tumour necrosis factor (TNF)&#xD;
      inhibitor with another biologic (anakinra, abatacept, rituximab or bimekizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baricitinib is a selective, reversible and competitive inhibitor of Janus kinases (Jaki).&#xD;
      This treatment is efficient in a number of therapeutic scenarios in RA and showed a clinical&#xD;
      superiority over adalimumab in one RCT (RA-BEAM study in MTX inadequate responders). Of note,&#xD;
      baricitinib inhibits many of the pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      RA but does not block signalling downstream of TNF. Owing to the interest in combining&#xD;
      different mechanisms of action, the investigators plan to assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      combination therapy with baricitinib and a TNF inhibitor (adalimumab). The investigators are&#xD;
      aware that combining targeted therapies is not recommended due to a potential increase in the&#xD;
      frequency of serious adverse events. However, several case series on patients treated with a&#xD;
      combination of targeted therapies have been published, suggesting a certain efficacy in&#xD;
      patients with refractory RA. The first ones focused on inflammatory bowel diseases and&#xD;
      psoriasis, but more recently, combination of tofacitinib (which belongs to the same Jaki&#xD;
      family as baricitinib) with various biologics has been reported in a sample of RA patients.&#xD;
      No serious adverse effects were reported over a mean of approximately 11 months of therapy.&#xD;
      The clinical improvement was mild but noticeable in these refractory RA cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, data of interest from the RA-BEAM study have been reported. Patients who switched&#xD;
      from adalimumab to baricitinib showed improvements in disease control. Because the switch&#xD;
      from adalimumab to baricitinib occurred without a washout period, and because adalimumab has&#xD;
      a mean circulating half-life of approximately 14 days, patients would have received several&#xD;
      weeks of dual TNF and Jak1/Jak2 inhibition in the course of the change of treatment. The&#xD;
      observation of increased efficacy, with no apparent acute safety issues during the weeks when&#xD;
      patients were exposed to both adalimumab and baricitinib, is of interest, and supports our&#xD;
      strategy to combine the two treatments for patients with refractory RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators consider that there is a need for investigation into the addition of&#xD;
      adalimumab to baricitinib in patients suffering of refractory RA (inadequate response to TNF&#xD;
      inhibitors). The investigators hypothesize that in this population, based on ACR50 score,&#xD;
      this combination therapy will decrease disease activity more efficiently than a switch to&#xD;
      another targeted DMARD, such as baricitinib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive combination therapies have revolutionised the management of solid neoplasms,&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies, and acquired-immune-deficiency syndrome. These intensive strategies&#xD;
      are based on the need to obtain rapid control of disease activity to afford the chance of&#xD;
      stable full remission and avoid irreversible complications. The same goal applies to&#xD;
      management of RA. Because current therapeutic strategies may fall short of these target goals&#xD;
      and fail to improve quality of life in some patients, novel approaches are needed to improve&#xD;
      outcomes. RA is a complex disease involving numerous cell types and inflammatory mediators of&#xD;
      innate and adaptive immune systems. The investigators are aware that most of combination&#xD;
      bDMARD strategies have been associated with little or no incremental benefit in efficacy&#xD;
      compared to single-biologic therapy. However, our study will target mechanisms that differ&#xD;
      from those in previous studies. Strategies that simultaneously target different pathways&#xD;
      involved in the pathogenesis of RA may enhance treatment responses in patients with RA. Of&#xD;
      note, baricitinib does not directly block signalling downstream of TNF, even if an indirect&#xD;
      effect on TNF production is likely to occur. Targeting multiple inflammatory cytokines in&#xD;
      combination may lead to more effective treatment and enhanced clinical responses in patients&#xD;
      with RA compared to the current second-line strategies. The different mechanisms of action of&#xD;
      baricitinib and adalimumab, should ensure the efficacy of the combination. No concurrent&#xD;
      trial evaluating similar strategies is registered at ClinicalTrial.gov.&#xD;
