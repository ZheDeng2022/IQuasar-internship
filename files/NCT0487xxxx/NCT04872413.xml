  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial collects and tests samples using genetic testing to find personalized&#xD;
      treatments that may work best for patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) that has come back&#xD;
      (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Several types of MCL are difficult&#xD;
      to treat due to specific genetic changes (mutations or alterations in the DNA/RNA expression&#xD;
      in the cells) that make them not respond to a certain type of drug called a Bruton's tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase (BTK) inhibitor. The goal of this clinical research study is to use genetic testing to&#xD;
      identify which drugs may be most effective in treating patients with MCL who have this type&#xD;
      of genetic mutation.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed therapy based on dysregulated cell signaling&#xD;
      pathways in combination with in vitro drug activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Overall response rates (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]). II. Safety in&#xD;
      patients who were treated with matched personalized therapies. III. Duration of response. IV.&#xD;
      Progression free survival (PFS). V. Overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Correlation of somatic mutations in MCL with cell signaling dysregulated activity and&#xD;
      therapeutic implications of somatic mutations in relapsed MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood, saliva or tissue sample collection for messenger ribonucleic acid&#xD;
      analysis (mRNA) analysis and drug efficacy testing. Patients assigned treatment per the&#xD;
      results are followed every 1 cycle of therapy for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, every 4&#xD;
      months for 1 year then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
