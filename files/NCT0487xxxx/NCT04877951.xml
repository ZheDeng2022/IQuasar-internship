    <textblock>
      LSVT BIG is an intensive, amplitude based rehabilitation program that has been demonstrated&#xD;
      to improve one of the hallmark features of Parkinson's disease, specifically bradykinesia. We&#xD;
      are interested in knowing the effects of this therapeutic approach on postural control and&#xD;
      gait parameters.&#xD;

      LSVT BIG is an intensive, amplitude based rehabilitation program that has been demonstrated&#xD;
      to improve one of the hallmark features of Parkinson's disease, specifically bradykinesia.&#xD;
      Postural instability and gait disturbance is another debilitating feature of Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease. While LSVT BIG targets postural correction through exercises which challenge&#xD;
      balance, the effect of this intervention on stability margins and functional balance&#xD;
      assessments have not been well established in the literature. This study includes outcome&#xD;
      measures not previously examined with this intervention and may provide valuable evidence&#xD;
      regarding the impact of this intervention on postural control, balance and falls risk.&#xD;
      Alternative amplitude programs have also been designed to meet the needs of patients with PD.&#xD;
      These programs adjust frequencies for patients and individualize sessions more than LSVT BIG.&#xD;
      We are interested in knowing if these alternative frequencies and amplitude approaches are&#xD;
      similarly as effective as LSVT BIG in our outcome measures.&#xD;
