    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information about people with fibrolamellar cancer&#xD;
      (FLC). This study is a registry of people with FLC around the world. This study will involve&#xD;
      collecting information about participants, their medical history and the regular medical care&#xD;
      they receive for FLC. The study will not provide treatment for your cancer.&#xD;

    <description>The questionnaire will be completed at the time of enrollment, every month, and at the end of study. Regardless of current interventions or lack of, assessments will be completed at enrollment and then monthly for a total of 18 months. In order to provide reasonable flexibility to participants, physicians, and study teams, the assessments can be completed within 30 days of the last assessment. The next month will be recalculated based on last reporting date.</description>

        Potential research subjects may also be identified by a member of the patient's treatment&#xD;
        team, the protocol investigator, or research team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center&#xD;
        (MSKCC). If the investigator is a member of the treatment team, s/he will screen their&#xD;
        patient's medical records for suitable research study participants and discuss the study&#xD;
        and their potential for enrolling in the research study. Potential subjects contacted by&#xD;
        their treating physician will be referred to the investigator/research staff of the study.&#xD;
