  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of image-guided hyper-fractioned proton therapy&#xD;
      in treating patients with head and neck cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph&#xD;
      nodes (locally advanced) and cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Radiation therapy&#xD;
      uses high energy protons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. The change in dose radiation&#xD;
      frequency and dose investigated in this study may help to better control the tumor and&#xD;
      prevent it from coming back or growing. The goal of this study is to test a new radiation&#xD;
      schedule that administers more radiation to the tumor tissue using image guided proton&#xD;
      therapy for patients that have a high risk of having a tumor recurrence (the tumor comes back&#xD;
      after treatment).&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety &amp; feasibility of image guided mid-treatment hyper-fractioned&#xD;
      dose-escalation with proton therapy and identify the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) for the&#xD;
      treatment of locally advanced human papillomavirus (HPV) negative head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days a week (Monday through Friday) for&#xD;
      the first 18 days and then twice daily (BID) for 15 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 8 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12&#xD;
      months in the first year after radiation therapy, every 4 months in the second year after&#xD;
      radiation therapy, and then every 9 months thereafter.&#xD;
