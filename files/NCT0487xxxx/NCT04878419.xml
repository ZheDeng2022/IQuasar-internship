    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, study investigators aim to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of&#xD;
      a 3-month interactive virtual educational program, designed on principles of self-efficacy,&#xD;
      reviewing aspects of Diabetes Mellitus care in adolescents and young adults with Type 1&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Secondarily, investigators also aim to evaluate the effect of the&#xD;
      educational program on participants subjective diabetes self-efficacy, diabetes related&#xD;
      knowledge, diabetes distress as well as glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen (15) patients will be recruited and enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a pilot acceptability and feasibility study with a prospective design&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of the educational intervention on multiple endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete educational intervention over duration of 3 months after which&#xD;
      their glycemic control data will be retrieved from the first clinic visit post intervention&#xD;
      (within 5 months of completion of the intervention). Hence, The overall study duration is&#xD;
      approximately &gt;3 to 9 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background/Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The landmark study Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT, 1982-1993) conclusively&#xD;
      proved that intensive glycemic control causes a reduction in the early stages of all&#xD;
      microvascular complications of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The durability of the impact of&#xD;
      intensive glycemic control in reducing long term microvascular as well as macro vascular&#xD;
      complications of T1DM was further endorsed by the observational follow up study 'Epidemiology&#xD;
      of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC). (1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive glycemic control has since become the primary clinical goal to ensure a healthy,&#xD;
      long life for patients with T1DM. In clinical practice, this is truly a challenge.&#xD;
      Particularly in pediatric patients, metabolic control worsens during adolescence in both&#xD;
      sexes. (2) Physiologic increase in insulin resistance during puberty partly plays a role, but&#xD;
      research has shown that psychosocial factors like family functioning, coping skills,&#xD;
      depression/anxiety contribute to metabolic control in adolescence. (3,4) Unfortunately, this&#xD;
      worsening of metabolic control continues into young adulthood. Glycemic control substantially&#xD;
      declines amongst T1D patients in the age range for transition to adult care, with mean HbA1C&#xD;
      at its peak of 9.2% at age 19 years after which the glycemic control gradually improves. (5)&#xD;
      Of note, between the ages 18-25 years of age, only 14% of patients were shown to meet&#xD;
      American Diabetes Association(ADA) HbA1c targets from the updated data from the T1D Exchange&#xD;
      Clinic Registry. (5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1DM is a chronic lifelong illness that requires self-management on a daily basis. Despite&#xD;
      technological leaps in the insulin delivery and blood glucose monitoring devices,&#xD;
      self-management remains vital to diabetes mellitus care. Undoubtedly, closed loop systems&#xD;
      have taken away the need for frequent Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose and insulin dose&#xD;
      administrations and adjustments, this technology is still fairly new, not universally&#xD;
      available, is not personally preferred universally and continues to require awareness of the&#xD;
      technological issues and participation in other aspects of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) self-care&#xD;
      like diet and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This self-management role transitions from parent-dominant to shared management to adolescent&#xD;
      dominant management over the course of adolescence period. (6) This age group is of&#xD;
      particular interest for self-efficacy enhancement studies as the adolescents will soon&#xD;
      transition to adulthood and more or less independent self-care. Self- efficacy is one's&#xD;
      beliefs about ability to achieve a goal. Metabolic control is affected by perceived&#xD;
      self-efficacy to conduct self-care. (7) Self-efficacy beliefs are influenced by mastery,&#xD;
      imaginal, vicarious experiences as well as physiological states and social persuasion. (8)&#xD;
      Cultivation of positive self-efficacy is very important as it not only influences task&#xD;
      performance but also plays a role in coping. (8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies to improve glycemic control remains an area of interest for clinicians and&#xD;
      researchers. In a meta-analysis of ten randomized control trials, Winkley et al concluded&#xD;
      that psychological treatments can slightly improve glycemic control in children. (9) Other&#xD;
      studies have shown that adherence to treatment regimen is linked to better glycemic control.&#xD;
      (10) Literature is rampant with adherence promoting behavioral interventions to positively&#xD;
      affect the diabetes self-management. Some examples include motivational/solution-focused&#xD;
      group intervention (11), coping skills training (12), family-focused teamwork (TW)&#xD;
      intervention (13), diabetes personal trainer&quot; intervention, consisting of self-monitoring,&#xD;
      goal-setting, and problem-solving sessions with trained nonprofessionals (14). Meta-analysis&#xD;
      of fifteen (randomized control trials (RCTs) that employed adherence promoting behavioral&#xD;
      interventions concluded that there is only a modest improvement in glycemic control with&#xD;
      significant variability between different interventions. (15)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, most of these interventions are costly, time consuming and not practical for&#xD;
      long term maintenance and employment in a clinical setting. Interventions that keep in&#xD;
      consideration the concept of reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, maintenance (RE-AIM)&#xD;
      are required. (16)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To tackle these issues, investigators plan to study virtual interventions employing&#xD;
      telehealth services. Telehealth videoconferencing has the potential to improve care in&#xD;
      pediatric diabetes patients by increasing visits. (17) Studies have shown that patients'&#xD;
      glycemic control remained stable and there was no increase in Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA),&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED) or hospital visits and satisfaction was equal to in-person visits&#xD;
      with telehealth. (18) Virtual access is more stream- lined, overcomes the challenge of time&#xD;
      and resources needed on part of patient. Particularly, during the uncertain times of the&#xD;
      Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, virtual programs can serve a vital role. The&#xD;
      study findings can be used to construct a virtual structured transition of care program for&#xD;
      youth with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus which is more accessible and time-flexible for patient&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a 3-month interactive virtual&#xD;
           educational program, designed on principles of self-efficacy, reviewing aspects of&#xD;
           Diabetes Mellitus care in adolescents and young adults with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of the educational program on participants subjective diabetes&#xD;
           self-efficacy, diabetes related knowledge, diabetes distress as well as glycemic&#xD;
           control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effect of outcome expectation on degree of change in participants&#xD;
           subjective diabetes self-efficacy, diabetes related knowledge, diabetes distress as well&#xD;
           as glycemic control after the educational intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the association of childhood opportunity index with the impact of the&#xD;
           educational intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigators hypothesize that the participants will have improvement in their&#xD;
           subjective diabetes self-efficacy, diabetes knowledge scores, diabetes distress as well&#xD;
           as their glycemic control (measured by percent change in HbA1C and Time in Range data)&#xD;
           post-completion of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator also hypothesize that participants with positive outcome expectation for&#xD;
           the virtual education program and with a higher childhood opportunity score will have&#xD;
           greater improvement in their subjective diabetes self- efficacy, diabetes related&#xD;
           distress, diabetes knowledge scores and glycemic control post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot acceptability and feasibility study with a prospective design to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of the educational intervention on multiple endpoints.The overall study duration is&#xD;
      approximately &gt;3 to 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Intervention Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following surveys will be administered to the participants at the pre-intervention&#xD;
      encounter:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A baseline survey about patient's characteristics and diabetes management data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diabetes Self Efficacy survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diabetes related Distress survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Diabetes Knowledge survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Survey for Outcome expectation for the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycemic control data (HBA1C and Time in Range) will be retrieved from the patient's medical&#xD;
      chart from the clinic visit prior to consenting for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly virtual and interactive educational sessions will be administered by the PI. There are&#xD;
      total 11 sessions. Each session is about 15-20 minutes. These sessions will be administered&#xD;
      through secure tele-health media Doxy.me. At the end of each module, feedback surveys will be&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Broadly, the educational sessions will cover topics including Type 1 Diabetes&#xD;
      pathophysiology, management of T1DM and complications of Hypoglycemia and Hyperglycemia,&#xD;
      Types of Insulin, available Diabetes technology and utilizing blood glucose data for T1DM&#xD;
      management, Sick day management, diabetes related complications, practical life issues during&#xD;
      transition to adulthood including insurance, medications and supplies management, driving,&#xD;
      dating and impact of drinking and drugs on T1DM management. These modules will also cover&#xD;
      anticipated issues during transition to college or to workplace and guidance to mitigate the&#xD;
      issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Intervention Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the entire 3 month educational program, following surveys will be&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feedback survey for the entire educational program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diabetes Self Efficacy survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diabetes related Distress survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Diabetes Knowledge survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycemic control data (HBA1C and Time in Range) will be retrieved from the patient's medical&#xD;
      chart from the 1st clinic visit after completion of the entire educational program ( within&#xD;
      five months of completion of the intervention).&#xD;
