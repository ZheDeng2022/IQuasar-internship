      This two-year project will adapt and conduct a trial examining the ability of two recruitment&#xD;
      strategies, chain-referral and credible messenger, to reach those who use opioids and other&#xD;
      substances in order to increase their uptake of onsite point of care COVID-19 testing that&#xD;
      will be delivered in two community based organizations (CBOs): Alliance for Positive Change&#xD;
      and Argus Health Inc. In Phase 1, Adapt two implementation strategies to support COVID-19&#xD;
      testing uptake and sustainability, adapting elements of existing efficacious social&#xD;
      network-based interventions via a CBPR approach. In Phase 2, we will examine and compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of two sets of implementation strategies on (i) reach, (ii) testing uptake, (iii)&#xD;
      service delivery (i.e. quarantine, medical care, contact tracing) and (iv) sustainability for&#xD;
      individuals who use opioids and other drugs. In Phase 3, Elucidate and compare the&#xD;
      system/organizational-, staff-, and individual-level factors that influence implementation&#xD;
      (i.e. fidelity, acceptability, feasibility, sustainability) of the strategies to develop a&#xD;
      plan for dissemination and scale-up in other CBOs who serve opioid and other substance using&#xD;
      individuals in NYC.&#xD;

      Aims. Building on the expertise and community out-reach infrastructure of two community-based&#xD;
      organizations (CBOs), Argus Community Inc. and Alliance for Positive Change, and following a&#xD;
      CBPR approach, investigators propose to take two implementation strategies that have been&#xD;
      proven to increase the reach, access, and uptake of HIV testing and related services, and&#xD;
      adapt them to support the uptake and sustainability of point-of-service (POS) onsite COVID-19&#xD;
      testing in CBOs that target the underserved population of those who use opioids and other&#xD;
      substances. Guided by social cognitive theory, Andersen's model of health care access and the&#xD;
      EPIS framework, the specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1). Adapt two implementation strategies to support COVID-19 testing uptake and&#xD;
      sustainability, adapting elements of existing efficacious social network-based interventions&#xD;
      via a CBPR approach; (2). Examine and compare the efficacy of two sets of implementation&#xD;
      strategies on (i) reach, (ii) testing uptake, (iii) service delivery and (iv) sustainability&#xD;
      for individuals who use opioids and other drugs. Use of data drawn from Healthix, a public&#xD;
      health information exchange, will supplement this comparison by generating a baseline of&#xD;
      participant prior testing and health behavior to determine access to underserved populations&#xD;
      as well as long-term influence on future testing behavior; and (3) Elucidate and compare the&#xD;
      system/organizational-, staff-, and individual-level factors that influence implementation of&#xD;
      the strategies to develop a plan for dissemination and scale-up in other CBOs who serve&#xD;
      opioid and other substance using individuals in NYC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings. Alliance for Positive Change and Argus Health Inc have well-established partnership&#xD;
      with members of the parent grant team following partnerships on numerous initiatives&#xD;
      targeting HIV, HCV and STIs prevention, testing and treatment for over 20 years. Argus and&#xD;
      Alliance have had a combined presence in the communities of Washington Heights, Harlem and&#xD;
      the South Bronx for over 50 years, and have subsequently developed considerable trust,&#xD;
      support and &quot;credibility&quot; within these communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, Sample Size and Randomization. Two distinct social network recruitment strategies&#xD;
      will be adapted and compared. Guided by the EPIS framework, SCT, and Andersen's Model, this&#xD;
      2-year study will comprise three phases. In Phase 1: Adaptation of outreach recruitment&#xD;
      strategies, investigators will work with our project CAB, via a CBPR approach, to adapt&#xD;
      chain-referral and POL strategies for uptake of COVID-19 testing, to finalize recruitment and&#xD;
      on-site testing protocols. In Phase 2: Strategy Efficacy Trial and Implementation Evaluation,&#xD;
      investigators will compare the two strategies in a cross-over design at two CBOs, with&#xD;
      initial strategy assignment randomly determined and rolled out for 4 months before&#xD;
      cross-over. Investigators will examine the impact of each strategy on (i) reach, (ii)&#xD;
      COVID-19 testing/repeat testing, and (iii) service delivery among those who test positive for&#xD;
      COVID-19. In Phase 3: Sustainment, CBOs will implement the strategy with more favorable&#xD;
      outcomes in Phase 2, and investigators will examine their sustainment of the program.&#xD;
      Implementation evaluation will identify participant-, staff-, and organizational-level&#xD;
      factors that influence the feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of each strategy in&#xD;
      the CBOs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Adaptation of Outreach Strategies. Investigators will employ a CBPR-guided approach&#xD;
      to adapt the social network-based outreach strategies. To do this, investigators will hold&#xD;
      four 1-hour working groups with our CAB. All CAB members will be reimbursed for their time.&#xD;
      These groups will address how to best employ the different strategies to reach our target&#xD;
      population and motivate testing uptake. Protocols will be shaped by findings from working&#xD;
      group meetings and shared back to the CAB who will provide feedback to inform changes in&#xD;
      content and format, and help identify markers of success and potential challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Strategy Efficacy Trial and Implementation Evaluation Overview. During the first 4&#xD;
      months of Phase II each site will roll out a different recruitment strategy (randomly&#xD;
      assigned 1:1) to the site Following four months of implementation, the sites will conduct a&#xD;
      rapid PDSA through a series of four, weekly workgroups. Revisions to protocols will be made&#xD;
      during these meetings and then the sites will &quot;cross-over&quot; and implement the other&#xD;
      recruitment strategy for the next four months. Participants may be recruited twice, once in&#xD;
      each strategy; any instances of repeat testing will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. In Phase 2, using two different strategies, investigators aim to enroll N=500&#xD;
      individuals with a history of opioid and/or substance abuse within the past 6 months. Based&#xD;
      on the geographic catchment areas of Argus and Alliance and current demographics of their&#xD;
      current substance using clientele, investigators anticipate participants will be 64% male,&#xD;
      51% African American, 39% Hispanic. Inclusion/exclusion criteria. All participants,&#xD;
      regardless of recruitment strategy, must endorse opioid or other substance abuse in the past&#xD;
      6 months, and must speak English or Spanish; &gt;18years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study enrollment, and consent. Once an individual is screened at the agency and determined to&#xD;
      be eligible, Research Assistants (RAs) will obtain written informed consent for study&#xD;
      participation and consent to access their clinical information in Healthix, a large health&#xD;
      information exchange in NYC. Following consent, the RA will administer the baseline&#xD;
      assessment in a private office. Participants will receive remuneration in accordance with&#xD;
      standards in this population. These procedures will occur in the same way regardless of&#xD;
      recruitment method into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy Efficacy Trial and Implementation Evaluation. Chain-referral Strategy. Recruitment&#xD;
      of seed participants. N=16 participants who meet inclusion criteria will be recruited from&#xD;
      among clients at Argus and Alliance (n=8 at each site) to serve as seeds. Seeds will be&#xD;
      stratified by substance use treatment status and gender. Site staff will contact selected&#xD;
      individuals and refer those interested to the research team who will screen for eligibility.&#xD;
      Following the completion of the screen, the participant will be offered COVID-19 testing;&#xD;
      they will be compensated $20 for completing the interview at the end of the visit.&#xD;
      Participants will be given the option to help recruit others to receive a COVID-19 test for a&#xD;
      small incentive. If participants agree, they will receive a brief training on recruitment and&#xD;
      three coupons. The participants will be instructed to give these coupons only to people they&#xD;
      know who use substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chain-referral recruitment: Individuals redeeming coupons will be screened for study&#xD;
      participation, assessed and offered COVID-19 testing. Those eligible and interested will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Procedures for informed consent, study enrollment and peer education training will&#xD;
      be identical to those for seeds. Participants will return after three weeks to receive a&#xD;
      recruitment incentive of $10 for every coupon redeemed. During this second visit they will&#xD;
      complete a brief questionnaire to quantify peer-recruitment attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: All participants will receive a maximum of four coupons to prevent the&#xD;
      development of &quot;professional recruiters.&quot; The process will continue until the sample size&#xD;
      exceeds 125 persons (at each site) or the recruitment period is over. Based on prior work&#xD;
      with similar populations in NYC investigators anticipate being able to recruit 125&#xD;
      participants for a COVID-19 test in 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POL Strategy: Alliance and Argus have existing POL/peer outreach programs with&#xD;
      well-established histories of community involvement. Investigators will leverage this&#xD;
      existing infrastructure and adapt to focus on COVID-19 testing. Based on protocols developed&#xD;
      in Phase 1, POLs will be trained to (i) initiate conversations related to stopping&#xD;
      transmission of COVID-19; (ii) deliver effective messages endorsing benefits of COVID-19&#xD;
      testing, social distancing and mask wearing; (iii) identify and visit those venues known to&#xD;
      them where those with substance use will likely congregate; (iv) set goals to engage in&#xD;
      conversations about COVID-19 testing with the target population and (v) document/track&#xD;
      efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants via credible messengers: Based on these organizations' previous&#xD;
      POL recruitment, 4 POLs are able to recruit 10 participants per week for HIV testing and&#xD;
      related services. This will permit recruitment of 3-4 participants/week per POL (12-16&#xD;
      total/week), allowing completion of enrollment for outreach strategy in 4 total months.&#xD;
      Participants recruited via POL will be consented and interviewed in the same manner as&#xD;
      described above. Following the interview, participants will then be offered COVID-19 testing;&#xD;
      they will be compensated $20 for completing the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Improvement (QI)/PDSA: Following the completion of the first 4-month recruitment&#xD;
      period, agency staff, CAB members and POLs will participate in quality improvement. Using an&#xD;
      abbreviated PDSA protocol, stakeholders across both agencies will participate to facilitate&#xD;
      information sharing, cross-learning, and capacity building. They will refine messaging,&#xD;
      procedures, and educational content, and make a plan to implement change during the next&#xD;
      recruitment period. The fourth workgroup will address issues associated with internal site&#xD;
      logistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment and analysis. Investigators will examine the impact of the intervention on (i)&#xD;
      reach, (ii) testing uptake and (iii) service delivery; and (iv) sustainability for&#xD;
      individuals who use opioids and other drugs as well as potential mediating/moderating&#xD;
      variables from the Andersen, SCT and EPIS models. Data drawn from Healthix on prior and&#xD;
      future COVID-19 testing will augment study data to determine access to underserved&#xD;
      populations and influence on future testing behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation assessment. A multi-method approach will allow us to identify implementation&#xD;
      features that promote optimal testing uptake in the context of these CBOs. To quantify&#xD;
      implementation, investigators will conduct staff survey assessments, monthly process&#xD;
      checklists and a focus group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff recruitment for surveys and focus groups. Staff will be eligible if they are currently&#xD;
      employed at either Argus or Alliance, including POLs participating in Peer programs.&#xD;
      Considerable effort will be taken to ensure that staff do not feel coerced to participate.&#xD;
      Staff and organizational-level EPIS-derived factors will be assessed the launch of the&#xD;
      testing initiative and after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly process assessments. Once the recruitment strategy protocols are finalized,&#xD;
      investigators will develop the following monthly process assessments to be completed by&#xD;
      agency staff and POLs. Feasibility: Investigators will develop a strategy specific&#xD;
      feasibility checklist measuring three types of program delivery obstacles: obstacles to&#xD;
      target population participation; concrete obstacles; and site/staffing obstacles. Fidelity:&#xD;
      To assess the relationship between planned and actual implementation, investigators will&#xD;
      design a checklist-based monitoring system with assessments completed by POLs and agency&#xD;
      staff after a) testing/screening, b) education of recruits; recruits will also complete a&#xD;
      brief checklist that documents time and effort in recruiting chains. Acceptability and&#xD;
      Sustainability: Investigators will assess qualitatively implementation challenges to&#xD;
      acceptability and sustainability via a series of two implementation focus groups with agency&#xD;
      staff and POLs following completion of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis overview and main outcomes. The primary outcome of interest comparing the strategies&#xD;
      will be testing occurrence as an indicator of testing uptake. An important secondary outcome&#xD;
      will be reach measured through the number of coupons redeemed.&#xD;
