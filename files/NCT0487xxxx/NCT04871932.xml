  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, single-cell high-throughput sequencing technology has developed rapidly and&#xD;
      is widely used in research related to the immune system, breaking traditional cognition and&#xD;
      gaining a new understanding of immune cell classification. In particular, the emerging single&#xD;
      cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides new ideas for the study of cell heterogeneity in&#xD;
      multicellular organisms. Analyzing the changes in the expression profile of the cell&#xD;
      transcriptome at the single-cell level can clearly show the changes in the trajectory of&#xD;
      individual cells, reveal new cell types, and discover the potential functions of immune&#xD;
      cells. Therefore, this study intends to recruit healthy adults and use multi-omics techniques&#xD;
      such as single-cell sequencing to systematically classify the peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells of healthy adults to provide a basis for further disease-related research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As an important part of the human body, the immune system is closely related to the&#xD;
      occurrence of diseases. Based on the traditional classification methodology, it is mainly&#xD;
      divided into two branches: innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immune cells mainly&#xD;
      include monocytes (Mono), natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells (DC). The adaptive&#xD;
      immune cells mainly include B lymphocytes (B) and T lymphocytes (T). Peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) mainly include T cells, B cells, NK cells, Mono cells and DC cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of these cell populations varies among individuals. Usually in PBMC, T&#xD;
      lymphocytes account for 45-70%, B cells account for 5-15%, NK cells account for 5-20%, Mono&#xD;
      cells account for 10-30%, and DC cells account for 1-2%. Among them, B cells can be divided&#xD;
      into transitional, naive, memory subgroups and plasma cells. While, T cells are mainly&#xD;
      composed of cluster of differentiation 4+ (CD4+) T cells and cluster of differentiation 8+&#xD;
      (CD8+) T cells with the ratio about 2:1. What's more, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells can be&#xD;
      further divided into naive cells, central memory cells in contact with antigen, effector&#xD;
      memory cells and effector cells. Mono cells can be divided into classic monocytes and&#xD;
      non-classical cluster of differentiation 16+ (CD16+) pro-inflammatory monocytes. DC cells&#xD;
      include plasmacytic dendritic cells (pDC) and myeloid dendritic cells (mDC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, scRNA-seq has developed rapidly and is widely used in research related to&#xD;
      the immune system, breaking traditional cognition and gaining a new understanding of immune&#xD;
      cell classification. In particular, the emerging scRNA-seq provides new ideas for the study&#xD;
      of cell heterogeneity in multicellular organisms. Analyzing the changes in the expression&#xD;
      profile of the cell transcriptome at the single-cell level can clearly show the changes in&#xD;
      the trajectory of individual cells, reveal new cell types, and discover the potential&#xD;
      functions of immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults have a relatively stable immune system, with little interference from the external&#xD;
      environment. Therefore, this study intends to recruit healthy adults and use multi-omics&#xD;
      techniques such as scRNA-seq to systematically classify the PBMCs of healthy adults to&#xD;
      provide a basis for further disease-related research.&#xD;
