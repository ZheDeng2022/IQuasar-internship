  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a technology-based&#xD;
      intervention for cognitive-motor training in rehabilitation clinics with geriatric,&#xD;
      neurological and cardiac patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of exergame-based&#xD;
      cognitive-motor training in in-patient rehabilitation settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this pilot trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an expanded&#xD;
      rehabilitation treatment (combining exergame training with conventional care) on physical and&#xD;
      cognitive functioning in different patient groups.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot trial with two arms: an intervention group where the conventional&#xD;
      treatment during the stay in the in-patient rehabilitation clinic is extended with a&#xD;
      technology-based cognitive-motor intervention and a control group following just the&#xD;
      conventional treatment. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups. The&#xD;
      selected methods to evaluate the primary and secondary endpoints include quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative measures. This national study will be conducted in Switzerland in a multicentre&#xD;
      setup; three rehabilitation clinics are involved as study centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include at least 40 patients in each of the rehabilitation clinics involved as&#xD;
      study centres (20 patients in the intervention group, 20 patients in the control group),&#xD;
      resulting in a total sample size of 120 patients. At clinic entry, patients potentially&#xD;
      fulfilling all inclusion criteria will be informed in oral and written about the study and&#xD;
      asked if they wish to participate. All interested participants will then be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility. The included participants will then undergo a baseline assessment battery and&#xD;
      will be subsequently randomly allocated to the intervention or the control group using a&#xD;
      block randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening as well as baseline measurements (T1-measurements) are conducted within the first&#xD;
      two days upon entry at the rehabilitation clinic. T1-measurements will last around 60-70&#xD;
      minutes. One day after T1- measurements, the intervention will begin (for patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group). The intervention period will be equal to the length of the stay in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation clinic (between 2-3 weeks, according to each cantonal/regional regulations and&#xD;
      insurance coverage) and will include short daily training sessions using the Dividat Senso&#xD;
      (5x/week à 10-15min), resulting in 10 to 15 training sessions in total. The training sessions&#xD;
      will be supervised by a qualified study investigator (carefully observing patients while&#xD;
      training and also preventing/aiding in case of adverse events). At the last two days before&#xD;
      discharge from the clinic, post-measurements (T2-measurements) will be performed with all&#xD;
      (intervention &amp; control) study participants. T2-measurements last around 70-80 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients allocated to the intervention group will conduct simultaneously combined&#xD;
      cognitive- motor training on a technological device providing exergames, the Dividat Senso.&#xD;
      Both, the hardware (Dividat Senso) and the software (exergames) are specifically developed&#xD;
      considering the needs and requirements of older adults but also clinicians/therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dividat Senso is a platform for the dynamic recording of steps, weight shifts and other&#xD;
      body movements producing forces. The platform includes 20 sensors (strain gauges), 5&#xD;
      vibration motors and an light-emitting diode (LED) control. It is certified as a medical&#xD;
      device class 1 and used by clinics, hospitals and nursing and care homes in 15 countries&#xD;
      worldwide. It is connected to a small computer (running the software) and a large screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dividat exergames specifically target all cognitive functions relevant for the successful&#xD;
      mastering of activities of daily living such as executive and attentional functions and&#xD;
      physical functions such as balance and coordination. The games are played by conducting body&#xD;
      movements, mainly steps in four directions (front, right, left, back) but also body weight&#xD;
      shifting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dividat software is a web-based environment that includes data backing (Dividata), an&#xD;
      administrative interface (Dividat Manager) and an intelligent, adaptable training environment&#xD;
      with the exergames for motor-cognitive training (Dividat Play). In the Dividat Manager,&#xD;
      participants can be registered as users and their training program can be managed. The&#xD;
      training software (Dividat Play) contains an algorithm for automatic, real-time adaptation of&#xD;
      the difficulty of a training game to the skills of a user. Moreover, the training applied in&#xD;
      this study is progressive in the course of the intervention period; patients start with the&#xD;
      easier games in the first week, progressing to more difficult games in the second week and so&#xD;
      on. Therapists and study investigators have the opportunity to individually adapt the&#xD;
      training plan to meet each patient's functional capacity in the Dividat Manager. Thus,&#xD;
      personalized training and optimal challenge for each patient are ensured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention period in the rehabilitation setting will be equal to the length of the stay&#xD;
      in the rehabilitation clinic (between 2-3 weeks, according to each cantonal/regional&#xD;
      regulations and insurance coverage) and will include short daily training sessions using the&#xD;
      Senso (5x/week à 10- 15min), resulting in 10 to 15 training sessions in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session contains various combinations of the Dividat exergames (each of the games lasts&#xD;
      around 2-3min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients of the control group follow the standard rehabilitation procedure including per&#xD;
      week: 3x 30min physiotherapy, 8x 30min group therapy, 3x 45min group therapy (group therapy&#xD;
      includes body- focused therapy, mindfulness therapy, respiratory therapy, gymnastics, hiking&#xD;
      etc.).&#xD;
