  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies the direct effects on cancer cells of the drugs binimetinib&#xD;
      and palbociclib, in patients with KRAS-positive lung, colorectal, or pancreatic cancer that&#xD;
      can be removed by surgery (operable). Binimetinib and palbociclib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving binimetinib and&#xD;
      palbociclib may halt the growth of cancer cells and improve access of the immune system&#xD;
      cells, a patient's own cells that fight infection and cancer, into the tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the on-target efficacy of binimetinib and palbociclib in patients with&#xD;
      operable RAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal, or pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Correlative analysis of gene expression analysis. II. Define immune subsets within the pre&#xD;
      and post-treatment tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive palbociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and binimetinib PO twice daily (BID)&#xD;
      for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 1 week&#xD;
      after last dose of study medication, patients undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
