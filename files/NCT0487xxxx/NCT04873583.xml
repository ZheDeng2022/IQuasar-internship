    <textblock>
      This clinical trial deals with focal cerebral arteriopathy and childhood stroke, a rare but&#xD;
      devastating condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focal cerebral arteriopathy (FCA) is an inflammatory vessel wall disease provoked by&#xD;
      infection and there is increasing evidence that inflammatory processes play a crucial role in&#xD;
      childhood stroke, influencing the outcome of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of existing data suggests that outcomes are improved and that there is less stroke&#xD;
      recurrence in children treated with steroids to reduce the acute inflammatory processes. This&#xD;
      clinical trial will be conducted in over 20 hospitals in several countries in order to&#xD;
      investigate this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly separated into two groups. The first group will be treated with&#xD;
      standard of care (including aspirin) combined with high dose steroids. The second group will&#xD;
      be treated with standard of care (including aspirin) but without steroid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to investigate if children treated with a combination of high dose steroid&#xD;
      and aspirin will have a better and quicker recovery of FCA, better clinical functional&#xD;
      outcome, and less recurrence compared to children treated with aspirin alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has been identified by international pediatric stroke experts as the most&#xD;
      important topic for a clinical trial in the field and is as well one of the most important&#xD;
      research priorities identified by parents. The study results will also provide insight into&#xD;
      the evolution of inflammatory vessel disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) is a rare but devastating condition affecting&#xD;
      2-5/100,000 children/year. Children do not recover better than adults with 2/3 suffering long&#xD;
      term neurological, cognitive and behavioural problems. The economic cost of stroke is&#xD;
      substantial. Arteriopathy is identified as AIS aetiology in 60-80% of previously healthy&#xD;
      children and is the strongest predictor of recurrent events. 30-40% of these children will&#xD;
      have a focal cerebral arteriopathy (FCA). FCA in childhood is shown to be an inflammatory&#xD;
      vessel wall pathology provoked by infections. This encourages treatment with steroids,&#xD;
      despite lack of evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: There is increasing evidence that etiologically inflammatory processes play a&#xD;
      crucial role in childhood stroke, and influence outcome. Retrospective analyses suggest&#xD;
      improved outcome and less recurrence with steroid treatment. With the exception of sickle&#xD;
      cell disease, this study will be the first randomized clinical trial in children with&#xD;
      arterial ischemic stroke. It will provide high-level evidence for the most appropriate&#xD;
      treatment for children with AIS due to FCA. Alignment of interventions and outcome as well as&#xD;
      pooled analysis with the planned FOCAS study in North America will allow pooled analysis&#xD;
      results.This is very important in view of the marked neurological, social and economic burden&#xD;
      of childhood AIS for patients and families. This project has been identified as the most&#xD;
      important AIS treatment trial by a Delphi survey of international paediatric stroke experts&#xD;
      and is one of the most important research priorities identified by parents. In addition, the&#xD;
      study will provide insights into the pathogenesis of inflammatory vasculopathies.The&#xD;
      objective of this trial is to show that children with first stroke event due to unilateral&#xD;
      FCA treated with a combination of high dose steroid and aspirin will have better and quicker&#xD;
      recovery of arteriopathy, better clinical functional outcome, and less recurrence compared to&#xD;
      children treated with aspirin alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a prospective multicentre, parallel group, two-arm, randomized&#xD;
      controlled, open-label clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment, comparing a high dose&#xD;
      course of methylprednisolone / prednisolone plus standard of care with standard of care alone&#xD;
      in children with unilateral arteriopathy and acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and procedures: Participants will be randomized within 48 hours after diagnosis&#xD;
      (maximum 96 hours after stroke onset) to standard of care (SC) alone (control group) or SC&#xD;
      plus steroids (experimental group). SC will be harmonized among the study centres to include&#xD;
      aspirin treatment. Patients will be assessed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Magnetic imaging and&#xD;
      angiography (MRI/MRA) will be done at 1, (3) and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Participants: 70 participants in total, 35 per treatment arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 48 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Centre(s): International multi-centre study with approximately 20 to 30 centres&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating countries:Switzerland, Germany, France, Austria, Great Britain &amp; Australia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centres in additional countries might be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations: The sample size is based on the comparison of the primary outcome&#xD;
      - the change in FCASS from baseline to 1 month - between the two treatment groups. The&#xD;
      standard deviation from 13 patients of a retrospective study was calculated. The standard&#xD;
      deviation of the baseline and follow-up FCASS was 3.0 and 3.3, respectively. The standard&#xD;
      deviation of the change in FCASS from baseline was 2.8. Based on the standard deviation of&#xD;
      2.8 and a two-sample means test, 64 patients (32 in each group) are required to detect a&#xD;
      difference of 2.0 with a power of 80% at a two-sided alpha-level of 0.05. To account for&#xD;
      dropouts (8%), we enlarge the sample size to 70 patients (35 in each group). The primary&#xD;
      analysis will follow the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, i.e. all patients will be&#xD;
      analysed in the allocated group regardless of any protocol violations such as cross-overs.&#xD;
      The primary outcome (change in FCASS from baseline to 1 month) as well as other secondary&#xD;
      continuous score outcomes that are measured multiple times during follow-up (RRQ, mRS, PSOM,&#xD;
      VABS, modAspect) will be assessed in a repeated-measure, mixed-effects linear model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCP Statement: This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the current&#xD;
      version of the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH-GCP as well as all national legal and regulatory&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
