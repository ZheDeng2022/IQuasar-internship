  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is a serious public health problem worldwide and it is&#xD;
      a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Nowadays, COPD patients are increasing in all&#xD;
      societies and the problems that arise during the life of these patients increase the need for&#xD;
      care and rehabilitation. Pulmonary rehabilitation has proven to be the best supportive&#xD;
      treatment for individuals with COPD. However, there are difficulties in rehabilitation&#xD;
      practices in terms of the fragility of patients, transportation and access problems.&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation allows patients who cannot access rehabilitation due to their&#xD;
      geographical, economic or physical disabilities to benefit from rehabilitation services.&#xD;
      There are different studies demonstrating the effect of telerehabilitation in COPD patients&#xD;
      and confirming that it is safe, but it is a developing area and has a limited area of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized controlled study, it is aimed to examine the effect of telerehabilitation&#xD;
      training on respiratory functions, exercise capacity, quality of life, fatigue and&#xD;
      psychosocial factors in individuals with COPD via video conferencing including respiratory&#xD;
      exercises and postural exercises.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in respiratory functions on the spirometry at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry is a standard test doctors use to measure how well your lungs are functioning. The test works by measuring airflow into and out of your lungs.Spirometry measures two key factors: expiratory forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in exercise capacity on six-minute walk test at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walk test measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes.A lower score (reflecting less distance covered in 6 minutes) indicates worse function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in health-related quality of life on Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-specific instrument designed to measure impact on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being in patients with obstructive airways disease.Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in psychosocial factors on Beck Depression and Beck Anxiety Inventory at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory is a self-assessment scale that determines the risk of individuals in terms of depression and measures the level of depressive symptoms and the change in severity.Beck Anxiety Inventory is a likert type self-assessment scale that determines the frequency of anxiety symptoms experienced by individuals. The high score the individual gets from the scale indicates the severity of anxiety experienced.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in fatigue on COPD and Asthma Fatigue Scale at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The COPD and Asthma Fatigue Scale , was developed for use in clinical trials and other studies in respiratory diseases. The COPD and Asthma Fatigue Scale was intended to be sufficiently comprehensive to capture fatigue experienced by patients with either asthma or COPD, yet be brief and patient centered.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in dyspnea on Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale is the most commonly used validated scale to assess dyspnea in daily living in chronic respiratory diseases. It is a scale scored between 0 and 5 based on various factors causing dyspnea.</description>
