  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal of this study is to evaluate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in&#xD;
      patients after kidney transplantation who are one of the risk groups for the severe course of&#xD;
      the infection and map the progression of the virus throughout this specific part of&#xD;
      population, which is also important for possible future epidemics. We will evaluate the&#xD;
      seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies according to age and gender. We will compare&#xD;
      seroprevalence in all measured antibodies types and we will also assess the development of&#xD;
      antibodies level in positive patients.&#xD;

      The Czech Republic (Central Europe region) is one of the most affected countries in the World&#xD;
      by COVID 19 pandemic. By 1st of March 2021, the SARS-COV-2 virus infection was proven in the&#xD;
      Czech Republic in 1 247 051 thousand people, which is 11.7% of the population (11 627 per 100&#xD;
      000, in the USA 8743/100 000, in the UK 6300/100 000, in the Germany 2879/100 000, France&#xD;
      5379/100 000). The rapidly increasing number of people infected in October 2020 have led to&#xD;
      adoption of strict countrywide epidemic measures, which are still largely ongoing. During&#xD;
      first 2 months of 2021 was still serious spread of the virus in population with increasing&#xD;
      numbers of infected persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SARS-CoV-2 virus can be detected in the body by several ways. The presence of the virus&#xD;
      can be directly confirmed by RT-PCR or by determination of viral antigen from a swab from the&#xD;
      nasopharynx, throat, direct examination of sputum or aspirate from bronchoscopy, or rectum.&#xD;
      Indirect methods of virus detection include the determination of antibodies in the blood.&#xD;
      Antibodies can target several structures of the virus: spike protein (S), envelope, membrane&#xD;
      or nucleocapsid (NP). The S protein is composed of S1 and S2 subunit. The S1 subunit contains&#xD;
      receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is necessary for interaction and entering human cells. In&#xD;
      practice, IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies against RBD and NP are usually detected.2,3 With regard&#xD;
      of serious development of the COVID 19 epidemic situation in the Czech Republic, we decided&#xD;
      to do this prevalence study. Our goal is to evaluate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      antibodies in patients after kidney transplantation which is also important for possible&#xD;
      future epidemics.&#xD;
