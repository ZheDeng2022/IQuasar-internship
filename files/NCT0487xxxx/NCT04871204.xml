      The aim of the study is to clarify whether octreotide therapy can reduce undesired&#xD;
      postoperative weight loss, increase health-related quality of life and improve the appetite&#xD;
      after surgery for esophageal or gastric cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary complications are the biggest problem for patients before, during and after surgical&#xD;
      treatment. Improved multimodal therapy and centralization of treatment to highly specialized&#xD;
      centers have led to an increase in the number of patients surviving with chronic negative&#xD;
      effects of esophageal surgery. The scientific state of knowledge about HRQOL and the symptoms&#xD;
      of long-term survival of esophageal cancer is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcome measures (PRUs) are results reported by the patient himself, e.g.&#xD;
      HRQOL, remaining symptoms, satisfaction with health care and other problems in daily life.&#xD;
      These results have rarely been of importance before but are now increasingly crucial in the&#xD;
      evaluation of treatment. It is no longer just about survival for patients with cancer of the&#xD;
      esophagus. The aim of the study is to clarify whether octreotide therapy can reduce undesired&#xD;
      postoperative weight loss, increase health-related quality of life and improve the appetite&#xD;
      after surgery for esophageal or gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that intramuscularly administered octreotide can decrease weight loss after&#xD;
      gastrectomy or esophagectomy due to cancer and that it may improve postoperative health&#xD;
      related quality of life. This study aims to investigate if postoperative eating problems can&#xD;
      be reduced by treatment with octreotide in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of the study: Sub study 1, safety, tolerability and feasibility of&#xD;
      octreotide treatment will be investigated. Twenty patients diagnosed with esophageal or&#xD;
      gastric cancer will receive three monthly injections of 10 mg of Sandostatin LAR depot.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months for monitoring of safety blood&#xD;
      parameters, changes in weight, health-related quality of life and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study: Sub study 2, efficacy of treatment with octreotide will be&#xD;
      studied. 152 patients diagnosed with esophageal or gastric cancer will be randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      post-surgical treatment with octreotide or no treatment. Patients in the active arm will&#xD;
      receive three monthly injections of 10 mg of Sandostatin LAR depot. All patients will be&#xD;
      followed up at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months in the same manner as in Sub study 1. In this study part&#xD;
      gastrointestinal satiety hormones and nutritional evaluation associated quality of life will&#xD;
      be studied in addition to body weight, body composition and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
