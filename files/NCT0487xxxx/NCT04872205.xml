      The Shanghai Elbow Dysfunction Score (SHEDS) is originally developed in English to evaluate&#xD;
      elbow function in patients with elbow stiffness. The purpose of this study is to translate&#xD;
      and cross-culturally adapt the SHEDS instrument into Turkish and investigate its psychometric&#xD;
      properties.&#xD;

      The Shanghai Elbow Dysfunction Score (SHEDS) is originally developed in English to evaluate&#xD;
      joint function in patients with elbow stiffness. The purpose of this study is to translate&#xD;
      and cross-culturally adapt the SHEDS instrument into Turkish and investigate its psychometric&#xD;
      properties. Approximately seventy patients with elbow limitation will be included. For&#xD;
      cross-cultural adaptation, two bi-lingual translators will use the back-translation&#xD;
      procedure. Within a 3-to-5-day period after the first assessment, the participants will&#xD;
      complete the Turkish version of SHEDS (SHEDS-T) to evaluate test-retest reliability.&#xD;
      Cronbach's alpha (α) will use to assess internal consistency. The correlation with the&#xD;
      Turkish version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, the&#xD;
      Turkish version of Mayo Elbow Performance Score, and Short Form-12 will be determined to&#xD;
      check the validity. Responsiveness and floor and ceiling effects will be detected.&#xD;

    <description>The Shanghai Elbow Dysfunction Score (SHEDS) is composed of 12 items and developed in 3 parts: elbow motion capacities, elbow-related symptoms, and patient satisfaction level. The SHEDS is a comprehensive and valid scoring system to evaluate elbow function in patients with elbow stiffness.</description>

    <description>The Shanghai Elbow Dysfunction Score (SHEDS) is composed of 12 items and developed in 3 parts: elbow motion capacities, elbow-related symptoms, and patient satisfaction level. The SHEDS is a comprehensive and valid scoring system to evaluate elbow function in patients with elbow stiffness. The cumulative score is ranged from 0 to 100, where the higher scores indicate an increased level of function.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (First assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire 30 core questions and optional additional 8 questions that are scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale (no difficulty-unable). The cumulative DASH score is ranged from 0 to 100, where the higher scores indicate an increased degree of disability.</description>

    <measure>Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (First assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) is designed to measure pain, stability, range of motion and the patient's ability to accomplish functional tasks, is one of the most commonly used physician based and joint-specific elbow rating system The cumulative MEPS score is ranged from 0 to 100, where the higher scores indicate an increased level of function.</description>

    <measure>Short Form-12 (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (First assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form-12 (SF-12), which is developed based on Short Form-36, consists of 12 items: 7 items dealing with the physical components scores (PCS-12) and 5 items related to the mental components scores (MCS-12) of SF-12. Range of both scores is 0 to 100, where the higher scores indicate better health related quality of life.</description>

        All participants are patients who had sustained an elbow fracture and are treated&#xD;
        surgically. The participants with elbow stiffness after an elbow fracture are directed for&#xD;
        assessment following a confirmation by an orthopaedist that the bone fracture healed based&#xD;
        on the physical examinations and diagnostic imaging.&#xD;
