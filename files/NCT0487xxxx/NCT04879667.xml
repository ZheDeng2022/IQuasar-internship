      This study included patients who were admitted to investigators' center to do laparoscopic&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy and complicated by gastro-cutaneous fistula . Cases were collected in the&#xD;
      period from December 2019 to march 2021. The study was approved by the research and Ethics&#xD;
      committee of investigators' University .a written informed consent was obtained from all&#xD;
      participating patients after explaining to them all the study procedures with its benefits&#xD;
      and hazards. the work has been carried out in accordance with the code of ethics of the world&#xD;
      medical association ( Declaration of Helsinki ) for studies involving humans .the sample size&#xD;
      was calculated using open Epi program using the following data ; confidence interval 95% ,&#xD;
      power of test 80% , ratio of unexposed/exposed 1, percent of patients with successful&#xD;
      management of refractory gastro-cutaneous fistula by surgical intervention 50% and those with&#xD;
      successful management by endoscopy 99% , odds ratio 99%, and risk ratio 2 , so the calculated&#xD;
      sample size equal 30 patients divided into two equal groups. Group (1) included 15 patients&#xD;
      managed by surgical intervention , group (2) included 15 patients managed by endoscopic&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient complicated with gastrocutaneous fistula after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.&#xD;
      patients with ASA I &amp; II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient complicated with gastrocutaneous fistula after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy&#xD;
      and managed by conservative measures. Patients with bad general condition ASAIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized control trials , all patients were subjected to the followings: patients&#xD;
      were selected by randomization method , Full history taking , Complete physical examination ,&#xD;
      laboratory investigations ( complete blood picture , liver and kidney functions , coagulation&#xD;
      profile ) , radiological investigations ( chest x- ray , ct with oral and i.v contrast to&#xD;
      assess if the fistula had track or not ) &amp; patients were subjected to upper GI endoscopy to&#xD;
      assess the site , size &amp; cause of fistula .&#xD;
&#xD;
      endoscopic techniques : we performed upper GI endoscopy to all cases first to assess the site&#xD;
      , size and cause of fistula . we used stents , clips , sutures and ballon dilatation to close&#xD;
      the fistula according to size , site and cause of fistula.if the fistula had no track that&#xD;
      was proved by CT with oral &amp; I.V contrast , we used the endoscopic stent. if the fistula had&#xD;
      track that was proved by CT with oral &amp; I.V contrast , we used the OVASCO clip , endo&#xD;
      suturing or ballon. Combined maneuvers may be used like ballon dilation and clipping or&#xD;
      ballon dilatation and suturing if there was distal narrowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up after endoscopy and discharge from the hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We examined the patients clinically, made routine laboratory investigations , made follow up&#xD;
      ct with oral and i.v contrast &amp; patients were subjected to upper GI endoscopy. The patients&#xD;
      were followed up for one week, two weeks and one month, 6months post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data were analyzed by computer using Statistical Package of Social Services&#xD;
      version 22 (SPSS), Data were represented in tables and graphs, Continuous Quantitative&#xD;
      variables e.g. age were expressed as the mean ± SD &amp; (range), and categorical qualitative&#xD;
      variables were expressed as absolute frequencies (number) &amp; relative frequencies&#xD;
      (percentage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suitable statistical tests of significance were used after checked for normality. Categorical&#xD;
      data were cross tabulated and analyzed by the Chi-square test or Fisher's Exact Test;&#xD;
      Continuous data were evaluated by student t- test. The results were considered statistically&#xD;
      significant when the significant probability was less than 0.05 (P &lt; 0.05). P-value &lt; 0.001&#xD;
      was considered highly statistically significant (HS), and P-value ≥ 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically insignificant (NS).&#xD;
