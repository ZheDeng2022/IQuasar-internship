             wearing the sensor(s) on normal skin (e.g., extensive psoriasis, recent burns or&#xD;
             severe sunburn, extensive eczema, extensive scarring, extensive tattoos, dermatitis&#xD;
             herpetiformis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently in an intensive care unit (ICU) of the following type (does not apply to&#xD;
             participants placed in an ICU bed due to space issues in the non-ICU areas)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to medical-grade adhesives&#xD;
&#xD;

             dialysis during the study wear period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in another investigational study protocol (If a subject has&#xD;
             recently completed participation in another drug study, the subject must have&#xD;
             completed that study at least 7 days prior to being enrolled in this study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with their&#xD;
             participation in the trial or pose an excessive risk to study staff (e.g., known&#xD;
