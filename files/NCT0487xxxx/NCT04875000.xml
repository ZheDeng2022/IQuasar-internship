  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this in vivo study is to evaluate the post-bleaching enamel hypersensitivity and&#xD;
      the possible color changes following the application of arginine and nano-hydroxyapatite&#xD;
      remineralizing solutions after enamel bleaching using an in-office chemical bleaching agent.&#xD;
      A commercial Fluoride remineralizing and desensitizing agent will be used as the control&#xD;
      group. Following bleaching of the anterior teeth and then the application of the different&#xD;
      tested remineralizing agents; the patients will be assessed for post-bleaching&#xD;
      hypersensitivity using the visual analogue scale (VAS) to describe the severity of the&#xD;
      hypersensitivity from mild to moderate to severe. On the other hand, the baseline shade and&#xD;
      post-bleaching color changes will be evaluated using a shade guide. The data will be&#xD;
      collected and tabulated then the statistical analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that the different tested remineralizing agents will have a similar&#xD;
      effect on the post-bleaching teeth hypersensitivity &amp; the color changes of the bleached&#xD;
      teeth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, there has been several patients that favor the in-office bleaching technique due to&#xD;
      its quick and satisfying aesthetic outcome, nevertheless clinical research reported some&#xD;
      clinical adverse effects. Teeth hypersensitivity is the most common adverse effect of teeth&#xD;
      bleaching. It was suggested that hydrogen peroxide can pass to the pulp through enamel and&#xD;
      dentin to create an inflammatory reaction or directly stimulate the neural receptors&#xD;
      triggering pain sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was reported that tooth sensitivity during bleaching has a range of 18-78%. Usually, teeth&#xD;
      hypersensitivity subsides upon accomplishment of the bleaching procedure, but occasionally it&#xD;
      may cause the patient to withdraw from form the treatment session. Different methods and&#xD;
      approaches with a varying rate of success have been advocated to reduce teeth sensitivity,&#xD;
      such as decreasing the rate of application, using different desensitizing agents before or&#xD;
      after bleaching procedure, desensitizing agent incorporation into the bleaching gel, and&#xD;
      decreasing the concentration of bleaching agent. In this context, the efficacy of&#xD;
      desensitizing obliteration agents to prevent and treat the post-bleaching hypersensitivity&#xD;
      has been investigated in many clinical trials presenting promising results. These&#xD;
      obliterating agents can enhance the enamel mineral content, impeding hydrogen peroxide&#xD;
      infiltration to the nerve endings and thereby hypersensitivity is much reduced or even&#xD;
      eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized clinical study will use the &quot;excel sheet&quot; for randomization and assigning the&#xD;
      subjects into the respective test groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the included subjects will sign an informed consent before participating in this clinical&#xD;
      study, in full accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings and locations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 33 volunteers will be&#xD;
      enrolled for the study. The clinical study will be performed from March 2021, through June&#xD;
      2021, in the outpatient dental clinic at the National Research Centre in Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An equivalence test of means using two one-sided tests based on data from a previous study&#xD;
      resulted in a design of 11 patient in each group (control and treatment groups) as minimum&#xD;
      sample sizes and will achieves 92% power at a 5.0% significance level when the true&#xD;
      difference between the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) means is 0.3, the standard deviation is&#xD;
      0.3, and the equivalence limits are -0.7 and 0.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tested materials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The materials to be used in the study will be: an in-office hydrogen peroxide&#xD;
      chemical-activated bleaching kit: Opalescence™ Boost™ 40% hydrogen peroxide Tooth Whitening&#xD;
      System (Ultradent Products, Inc., South Jordan, UT, USA) and three desensitizing agents: a&#xD;
      commercially available UltraEZ desensitizing gel (Ultradent Products, Inc., South Jordan, UT,&#xD;
      USA) and 2.5% concentration of arginine and nano-Hydroxy apatite solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample grouping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolled 33 participants will be randomly divided into three groups (n=11) according to&#xD;
      the &quot;Coin-Toss method&quot;, representing the investigated remineralizing and desensitizing agent&#xD;
      to be received after bleaching of their maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth with a 40%&#xD;
      hydrogen peroxide in-office chemical-activated bleaching agent as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I : UltraEZ desensitizing gel application after bleaching (control). Group II : 2.5%&#xD;
      Arginine solution application after bleaching. Group III: 2.5% nano-hydroxyapatite solution&#xD;
      application after bleaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-office teeth bleaching:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative hypersensitivity will be determined and recorded for all enrolled subjects&#xD;
      using the VAS method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline shade color of the predetermined teeth will be recorded using Classical VITAPAN&#xD;
      shade guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in-office bleaching procedure will be performed using Opalescence™ Boost™ 40% Tooth&#xD;
      Whitening System (Ultradent Products, Inc., South Jordan, Utah, USA) chemical bleaching agent&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of arginine and nano-hydroxyapatite solutions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two and a half g of arginine powder (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 2.5 g of&#xD;
      nano-hydroxyapatite powder (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) will be weighed with a digital&#xD;
      balance then mixed with 100 ml of distilled water to obtain a 2.5%-concentration of arginine&#xD;
      and nano-hydroxyapatite solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of the remineralizing agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A commercially available fluoride agent &quot;UltraEZ gel (Ultradent Products, Inc., South Jordan,&#xD;
      UT, USA)&quot; will be applied to the teeth of the assigned patients of Group I and left&#xD;
      undisturbed for 20 min as recommended by the manufacturer. Then the patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to rinse their teeth thoroughly with water. The 2.5% prepared solutions of&#xD;
      arginine and nano-hydroxyapatite will be applied to the bleached teeth of the assigned&#xD;
      patients of Group II and Group III respectively, using micro brushes in a generous amount to&#xD;
      the labial surfaces of the bleached teeth and left undisturbed for 20 min. Then the patients&#xD;
      will be instructed to rinse their teeth thoroughly with water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative hypersensitivity evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-operative hypersensitivity of the bleached maxillary anterior teeth will be recorded&#xD;
      immediately after bleaching then once again after application of the remineralizing agents at&#xD;
      the same session. Tooth sensitivity will be evaluated using a 3-way syringe at 5 to 10 cm&#xD;
      distance using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Whereby, readings from 0-10. Zero denoting no&#xD;
      sensitivity, 1-3 is presented as mild, 4-7 is presented as moderate and 8-10 is presented as&#xD;
      severe sensitivity. After that, it will be recorded on daily bases for the first week by the&#xD;
      participants who will be asked to bring their records in the follow-up sessions. Then the&#xD;
      postoperative hypersensitivity will be evaluated in-office every week for a 3-week follow-up&#xD;
      period using the VAS scoring system. All the readings will be recorded in a self-structured&#xD;
      proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative color evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-bleaching shades of the maxillary anterior teeth will be recorded immediately after&#xD;
      bleaching, then once again after application of the desensitizing agents at the same session.&#xD;
      Afterwards, it will be recorded every week for a 3-week follow-up period using VITAPAN&#xD;
      classical A1-D4® shade guide at the middle third of the anterior maxillary teeth. The 16 tabs&#xD;
      of the VITAPAN classical shade guide were arranged in descending numerical order regarding&#xD;
      the value from B1 to C4. Then these values were converted into code numbers using a&#xD;
      conversion table.&#xD;
