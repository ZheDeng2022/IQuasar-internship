      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, degenerative movement disorder that is&#xD;
      characterized by motor and nonmotor symptoms and its incidence increases with age. It has&#xD;
      been reported that 40-90% of patients have pain symptoms in PD. Pain can be the result of&#xD;
      motor fluctuations, dystonic muscle contractions, deep visceral pain, and musculoskeletal&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;

      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, degenerative movement disorder that is&#xD;
      characterized by motor and nonmotor symptoms and its incidence increases with age. It is the&#xD;
      second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's.Bradykinesia, which is&#xD;
      characterized by rigidity, resting tremor, postural instability, gait disturbance and&#xD;
      progressive decrease in the speed and amplitude of repetitive movements throughout the course&#xD;
      of the disease, are the main cardinal motor findings.Sensory dysfunction such as non-motor&#xD;
      findings in PD, disruption in the sleep-wake cycle, neuropsychiatric findings such as&#xD;
      dementia, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, depression, gastrointestinal dysfunction,&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system disorders such as bladder dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, and&#xD;
      pain perception may develop.Although dopaminergic therapies in PD are the gold standard in&#xD;
      the treatment of disorders such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, adequate response&#xD;
      cannot be obtained in the treatment of non-motor symptoms. For this reason, rehabilitative&#xD;
      applications, especially pain symptom, and complementary medicine methods are very&#xD;
      important.It has been reported that 40-90% of patients have pain symptoms in PD. Pain can be&#xD;
      the result of motor fluctuations, dystonic muscle contractions, deep visceral pain, and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture and dry needling therapy have been used clinically for a long time as pain&#xD;
      relievers such as migraine pain, low back pain, chronic pain and cancer pain. On the other&#xD;
      hand, there are very limited and very limited number of studies on the efficacy of dry needle&#xD;
      therapy applied to acupuncture points in pain control in PD.In this study, our aim is to&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness of dry needling treatment applied to acupuncture points in neck&#xD;
      pain due to PH on musculoskeletal pains.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consists of a 100 mm horizontal line and is marked from 0 to 10. In our study, patients were told that the &quot;0&quot; point was not pain at all, and the &quot;10&quot; point showed unbearable pain, and patients were asked to mark their pain intensity by considering their pain at rest.</description>

    <measure>Neck Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This index consists of 10 questions and is used to evaluate how and to what extent the neck pain affects the daily life activities of the patient. Neck disability index includes the severity of pain, self-care, load-lifting, reading, headache, concentration, driving, sleep, and social activity parameters. The patients are asked to mark the most appropriate for them from the 6 options given for each parameter. Each title is scored from 0 &quot;(no disability) to 5&quot; (complete disability). The total score is between 0 (no disability) and 50 (total disability). After the total score is obtained, the value calculated according to the formulation is concluded as % insufficiency. High scores indicate high disability, and low scores indicate a low disability level.</description>

    <description>This is an extensive scale employed for the clinical evaluation of severity of PD. It consists of four sections including non-motor findings, motor problems, motor findings, and treatment complications. Fourteen motor findings (0 - no finding, or normal, 4- severe finding) in the second section of the scale and comprising the motor problems part.</description>
