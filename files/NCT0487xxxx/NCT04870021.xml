  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With 2.5% prevalence in general population, Pakistan is an intermediate endemicity country&#xD;
      for hepatitis B. However, wide disparity exists across the country as disease prevalence in&#xD;
      general population soars as high as 14% in hyper endemic areas. This hyper endemicity&#xD;
      increases the risk of acquiring infection via vertical and horizontal routes of disease&#xD;
      transmission. National immunization schedule in Pakistan administers the first vaccine&#xD;
      against hepatitis B at 6th week after infant birth. Owing to this 6 week interlude the&#xD;
      existing immunization schedule may not provide adequate protection to a newborn against the&#xD;
      disease. A monovalent hepatitis B vaccination shot, administered within 12 hours of birth, is&#xD;
      the preferred strategy for disease control in hyper endemic areas. The National Immunization&#xD;
      Technical Advisory Groups around the world are expected to use rigorous scientific evidence&#xD;
      and make changes in the immunization schedule and vaccine dosage, responding to the evolving&#xD;
      epidemiology of childhood diseases. Such research on local evidence for hepatitis B vaccine&#xD;
      in Pakistan is not available and our research fills this gap by This research studied the&#xD;
      hepatitis B vaccine response, in two cohorts of healthy infants. An open labeled, randomized&#xD;
      controlled, non-inferiority, vaccine trial methodology was used. Margin of non&#xD;
      non-inferiority (Δ) was set at 5%. The trial administered hepatitis B birth dose as an&#xD;
      intervention and vaccination done under the national immunization schedule was taken as&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an unblinded, open-labeled, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial with a&#xD;
      participant ratio of 1:1 in each group (the design remained the same through the length of&#xD;
      the study and no changes were made to the methods approved in the protocol). The reason for&#xD;
      making the study as an open labeled trial is that mothers could not feasibly be blinded from&#xD;
      the information on allocation scheme, and the information on vaccine given to infants could&#xD;
      not be held back from family and parents. Another non-inferiority vaccine trial in Pakistan&#xD;
      also used a similar approach in allocation scheme Trial Profile The trial was done at a&#xD;
      tertiary care hospital in an urban area from March 15, 2015, to May 20, 2016. Assuming an&#xD;
      attrition rate of 25%, the study enrolled 296 expectant mothers for allocation in two groups,&#xD;
      intervention, and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population was healthy newborns born to healthy females, in a health facility.&#xD;
      These pregnant women were registered for institutional deliveries at Countess Dufferin Fund&#xD;
      (CDF) Hospital, Hyderabad. The CDF Hospital Hyderabad is a tertiary care hospital for women&#xD;
      and children. The hospital is located in a populous downtown area of the Hyderabad city and&#xD;
      caters to patients coming from the urban areas of the city. The average daily out-patient&#xD;
      visits to the hospital are 200 women. The average number of daily deliveries in the hospital&#xD;
      is 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women who attended an antenatal clinic for a routine examination by gynecologist were&#xD;
      evaluated on following inclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Full term pregnant and registered for delivery at CDF Hospital Hyderabad 2.1. An absence&#xD;
      of a chronic illness (Diabetes / Tuberculosis / Hypertension) 3.1. No serological marker (HBs&#xD;
      Ag) of prior exposure to hepatitis B Inclusion criteria for mothers and Recruitment process&#xD;
      All women who attended an antenatal clinic for a routine examination by gynecologist were&#xD;
      evaluated on following inclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Full term pregnant and registered for delivery at CDF Hospital Hyderabad&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An absence of a chronic illness (Diabetes / Tuberculosis / Hypertension)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No serological marker (HBs Ag) of prior exposure to hepatitis B Prior to the due date&#xD;
           for childbirth, while attending the antenatal clinic, these females were approached and&#xD;
           informed about the study. Those who were willing to participate were given a consent&#xD;
           form to sign. After the informed consent, blood was obtained by a finger prick and a&#xD;
           drop of blood was put onto the Abbot's Determine ® rapid testing kit for detection of&#xD;
           hepatitis B surface antigen. The Determine ® has sensitivity, (negative predictive&#xD;
           value) of 98% and specificity, (positive predictive value) of 100%, compared to the&#xD;
           Enzyme Link Immunosorbent Assay (96).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results were interpreted as follows;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two red bars meant blood is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single red bar meant blood is negative for hepatitis B surface antigen Women who were&#xD;
           negative for hepatitis B surface antigen were then allocated into an intervention or a&#xD;
           control group (details of the methodology are given below). They were followed until&#xD;
           they delivered and were discharged from the hospital with a healthy baby. For vaccine&#xD;
           given at birth, other researchers have also enrolled infants as subjects of the vaccine&#xD;
           trials(97)(98)(99). Infants have also been selected as trial participants and the&#xD;
           hepatitis B vaccine was given to infants in trials of preventing mother to child&#xD;
           transmission of hepatitis B(100).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for neonates:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the delivery infants born in both groups were examined by a trained midwife for&#xD;
      following criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Weight, less than 2000 grams&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Signs and Symptoms of febrile Illness/sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Congenital Malformation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Signs of Cyanosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Difficulty in breathing The newborns who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, i.e., weight&#xD;
           more than 2000 grams and absence of above-mentioned criteria were followed up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      One cc of intravenous blood was drawn from the peripheral veins of these healthy newborn. The&#xD;
      blood was immediately centrifuged, and serum was put in a plastic container, labeled with a&#xD;
      unique identification number. The serum containers were frozen and then sent using a cold&#xD;
      chain container, to Pakistan Medical Research Council laboratory at Jinnah Postgraduate&#xD;
      Medical Center Karachi. The serum was tested for anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody on&#xD;
      Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) kit DS-EIA-Anti-HBsAg, manufactured by DSI S.r.I (Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining a blood sample, infants born to mothers in the intervention group were&#xD;
      administered GSK's ® recombinant hepatitis B vaccine ENGERIX 10 micrograms (µ gm),&#xD;
      intramuscular in the anterolateral part of either of thighs. This birth dose of hepatitis B&#xD;
      was followed by zero dose oral polio vaccine as per hospital policy. Infants born to mother&#xD;
      in the control group were given oral polio vaccine as per the hospital policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent vaccinations in both groups of infants were administered as per the expanded&#xD;
      program on immunization schedule in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from the hospital, both groups of children were followed until the completion&#xD;
      of the third dose of Diptheria - Pertussis Tetanus - Hemophilus Influenza Type B - Hepatitis&#xD;
      B - Pneumococcal (DPT-HiB-HBV-PCV) vaccine offered under the Expanded Program on&#xD;
      Immunization. The follow up was done with caregivers at 6, 10 and 14 weeks, follow up started&#xD;
      at 8 weeks and duration of follow-up was up to 10 weeks after the 3rd shot of DPT-HiB-HBV-PCV&#xD;
      vaccine. After the discharge of mothers from hospital, preformed, short text messages (SMS)&#xD;
      were sent to parents, reminding them of the due date for as per the vaccination schedule. One&#xD;
      day after the due date of the vaccine shot, a phone call was made to confirm the child was&#xD;
      vaccinated or not. The parents were approached after eight weeks of the last DPT-HiB-HBV-PCV&#xD;
      vaccine shot. They were requested to bring the child to the hospital for a follow-up blood&#xD;
      test to evaluate the presence of anti-HBs Ag-Ab titer in the blood. Upon the follow-up visit,&#xD;
      infants were weighed, and 1 cc venous blood was drawn from the peripheral veins. Blood was&#xD;
      centrifuged, and serum was stored in a plastic container labeled with a unique number. All&#xD;
      the samples were then sent in cold chain to Pakistan Medical Research Council laboratory at&#xD;
      the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center Karachi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four (4) mothers from the intervention group were shifted to a teaching hospital, prior to&#xD;
      delivering a baby. Baseline blood samples were taken from 144 babies and the birth dose was&#xD;
      administered. During subsequent follow-up, cell numbers of three mothers were not responsive,&#xD;
      after a period of three months, they were declared as lost to follow-up. Baseline antibody&#xD;
      titer in serum of fourteen infants was found to be greater than10 mIU/ml. These children were&#xD;
      not followed. One child died, and parents of five children refused to continue and did not&#xD;
      allow obtaining a peripheral follow up blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high attrition of study participants happened in the control group. Thirty-two expectant&#xD;
      mothers refused to participate in the study when told that their babies would not get birth&#xD;
      dose hepatitis B vaccination. This attrition occurred despite an explanation of trial to the&#xD;
      control group participants, prior to the enrollment. The phenomenon of high attrition in the&#xD;
      control group is a well-known and well-documented effect of an unblinded trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Margin of non-inferiority In a non-inferiority trial, if the upper limit of 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval is less than the margin of non-inferiority i.e. delta (Δ), there is evidence of&#xD;
      non-inferiority cases(48). At the protocol development stage, published literature was&#xD;
      reviewed for seroprotection correlates. For the purpose of this trial, we calculated the Δ as&#xD;
      the difference in seroprotection correlates with or without the birth dose of hepatitis B&#xD;
      vaccine, and the Δ for this study was set to be 5%. The trial outcome set at the time of&#xD;
      protocol design was not changed during the course of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size In the non-inferiority trials, where the primary response variable is&#xD;
      dichotomous, it is assumed that the event rate for the two interventions is equal to p i.e.&#xD;
&#xD;
      p = p intervention = p control. With this assumption the formula becomes as under(48); 2N =&#xD;
      4p (1-p) (Zα - Zβ)2 / Δ2 A brief explanation of the variables used in the equation is given&#xD;
      below P = 0.957 (proportion of children attaining seroprotection correlates) (104) Δ = 0.05&#xD;
      (5%) Zα = 2.57 (99% CI) Zβ = 0.89 (80% power) After solving the equation 2 N comes out to be&#xD;
      228, hence 1 N =114. Thus, to get the answer to questions posed in the study; the number of&#xD;
      subjects in one arm of the trial is 114. The trial was planned to end after the last follow&#xD;
      up&#xD;
