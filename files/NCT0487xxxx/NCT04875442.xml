      Safety and performance study of the MemoWave electroencephalographic and sound recording&#xD;
      device to increase slow brain waves during sleep to improve memory consolidation in subjects&#xD;
      with mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      24 subjects aged between 40 and 85 years, presenting a mild cognitive disorder of the amnesic&#xD;
      type (ie a memory complaint, a Mini Mental State ≥ 24 and a score ≤26 on free recall or ≤45 /&#xD;
      48 on total recall of the RLRI16 test) will be included;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient spends 3 polysomnography nights at hospital: 1 night of habituation without&#xD;
      Memowave device and next 2 nights with Memovave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device emits sounds to increase slow brain waves but Memowave emits sounds during only&#xD;
      one of the two nights of test (night placebo vs night &quot;verum&quot;). The attribution of the night&#xD;
      is randomized.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The device studied is worn during the 2 polysomnogaphy nights. The device emits sounds during only one night in order to observe the difference of EEG signals.&#xD;
The night during which the device emits sounds is determined by randomization. The nature of the second night with the device, will be the reverse of the first, in a crossover fashion.</intervention_model_description>
