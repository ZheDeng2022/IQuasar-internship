    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, Phase III, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ZKAB001 in combination with carboplatin +&#xD;
      etoposide compared with treatment with placebo + carboplatin + etoposide in patients who have&#xD;
      ES-SCLC and are untreated for their extensive-stage disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter III study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will randomly enter the trial group or control group at 1:1, that is,&#xD;
      ZKAB001+ carboplatin + etoposide or placebo + carboplatin + etoposide, with a treatment cycle&#xD;
      every 3 weeks. There are 4 cycles of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification factors included gender (male / female), PS score (0/1) and brain metastasis&#xD;
      (yes / no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included screening period, treatment period (subjects received study treatment&#xD;
      until confirmed disease progression, or intolerable toxic reaction, or reached the maximum&#xD;
      medication cycle of 2 years, or the subject voluntarily requested the end of the study&#xD;
      treatment) and follow-up period (including safety follow-up and survival follow-up).&#xD;
