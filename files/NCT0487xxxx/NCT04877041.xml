  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a 12-week cycling during hemodialysis&#xD;
      program on hemodialysis-induced myocardial stunning in adult individuals receiving&#xD;
      hemodialysis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with kidney failure receiving chronic hemodialysis (HD) suffer from post-HD treatment&#xD;
      fatigue, poor functional status and high rates of cardiac failure and death. Previous work&#xD;
      has shown that these outcomes are correlated with recurrent ischemic cardiac injury&#xD;
      (myocardial stunning) that occurs during HD treatments. Myocardial stunning, identified by&#xD;
      regional cardiac wall motion abnormalities (RWMA), is common during HD. Intradialytic cycling&#xD;
      (during HD) decreases HD-induced stunning, and may improve adverse outcomes associated with&#xD;
      stunning. We will use echocardiography (echo) to understand the effects of intradialytic&#xD;
      aerobic exercise on myocardial stunning and HD-related symptoms.&#xD;
