  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Main objective of this study is to describe and evaluate safety and efficacy of MBG453&#xD;
      (sabatolimab) in combination with FDA approved HMAs of investigator's choice (IV Decitabine&#xD;
      or Azacitidine /SC Azacitidine /Oral Decitabine (cedazuridine combination (INQOVI))&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, non- randomized, open label, phase II multi-center study of intravenous&#xD;
      MBG453 (sabatolimab) added to FDA approved Hypomethylating agents of investigator's choice&#xD;
      (IV/SC/ Oral) in adult participants with intermediate, high or very high risk myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome (MDS) as per IPSS-R criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three separate periods of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening period (signing of written informed consent through Day 1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Core phase for 24 months (with post treatment safety follow-up monitoring for adverse&#xD;
           events (AEs) for 30 days following the last dose of azacitidine or decitabine or INQOVI&#xD;
           (oral decitabine), or 150 days following the last dose of MBG453 (sabatolimab),&#xD;
           whichever is later);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Extension phase for efficacy and/or survival status (up to 36 months from last patient&#xD;
           enrolling) (with post treatment safety follow-up monitoring for adverse events (AEs) for&#xD;
           30 days following the last dose of azacitidine or decitabine or INQOVI (oral&#xD;
           decitabine), or 150 days following the last dose of MBG453 (sabatolimab), whichever is&#xD;
           later).&#xD;
