  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic AntiBody-Mediated Rejection (cABMR) is the leading cause of late kidney transplant&#xD;
      loss (after 1 year of kidney transplantation). Its therapeutic management is poorly codified&#xD;
      and there is currently no treatment referring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal phototherapy (ECP) is a therapeutic apheresis that involves purifying&#xD;
      mononucleated cells in the blood, exposing them to UltraViolet A (UVA) and re-injecting them&#xD;
      to the patient. This treatment is used as common care in the first line as part of the&#xD;
      treatment of cutaneous T lymphoma and in the second line as part of the graft versus host&#xD;
      reaction after bone marrow allograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms underlying the action of the ECP are not well known. They are mediated by the&#xD;
      reinjection of cells exposed to UVA which enter apoptosis and induce immunomodulation. Recent&#xD;
      work during cABMR shows that TFH lymphocytes, the maturing population of B lymphocytes, are&#xD;
      deregulated and activated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that ECP can modulate T Follicular Helper (TFH) lymphocytes during cABMR.&#xD;
