  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate if enteric feeding schedules alter the development of delirium in&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit patients who have been placed on mechanical ventilation. Delirium is an&#xD;
      altered state of consciousness, which can involve agitation, inattention, and decreased&#xD;
      awareness. We will enroll Intensive Care Unit patients who have been placed on a ventilator&#xD;
      and are being given tube feedings. We will randomize participants into two groups: one group&#xD;
      will receive continuous feedings via feeding tube, and the other group will receive feedings&#xD;
      on a schedule to mimic breakfast, lunch, a snack, and dinner. Subjects will be assessed for&#xD;
      the development of delirium. Subjects will also be monitored for sleep quality and biomarkers&#xD;
      of circadian rhythm.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will need to have at least 48 hours of enteric feedings to be included, and will be&#xD;
      stratified by their APACHE IV score. Patients will be randomized into time restricted feeding&#xD;
      vs continuous feeding by investigators, with no change in caloric intake nor nutrient content&#xD;
      from orders. Patients will be assessed for delirium using the CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment&#xD;
      Method in the Intensive Care Unit) screening tool every twelve hours. At the time of the CAM&#xD;
      ICU assessment, as part of the experimental design, the patient's sleep will be monitored by&#xD;
      X8 Sleep Profiler device, placed and secured to their forehead, and the Sleep Profiler device&#xD;
      will collect information regarding sleep quality as assessed by relative delta power,&#xD;
      relative theta power and relative beta power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the circadian rhythm marker analysis, blood samples (15 mL) will be collected at two time&#xD;
      points: a day sample will be collected between 6 and 7 AM and a night sample will be&#xD;
      collected between 11 PM and 12 AM. Collection will start approximately 48 hours after ICU&#xD;
      admission. The expressions of the genes PER2 and SIRT with their proteins will be analyzed.&#xD;
      The samples will also be used to measure serum free cortisol and serum insulin levels.&#xD;
