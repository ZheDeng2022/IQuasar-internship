  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, several drugs including Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine,&#xD;
      ritonavir+lopinavir, Tocilizumab, Arbidol and interferon are under randomised controlled&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) for efficacy and/or safety evaluations in patients with COVID-19 in different&#xD;
      countries. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is among these investigational drugs and some studies&#xD;
      reported promising results. Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue intravenous pro-drug&#xD;
      developed by Gilead Sciences, an American biopharmaceutical company, for treatment of Ebola&#xD;
      virus during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Western Africa. Remdesivir shows broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antiviral activity against many RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2 through blocking RNA&#xD;
      polymerase thereby terminating RNA transcription. Remdesivir was among the first treatments&#xD;
      used in China as the outbreak emerges and it has been reported as potential treatment options&#xD;
      for COVID-19 in the USA, China and Italy.&#xD;

      Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel β-coronavirus which is named as&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 shares 79% RNA sequence identity with severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) and 50% genomic sequence identity with Middle East&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which caused a major outbreak since 2002 and 2012&#xD;
      in China and Saudi Arabia, respectively. Despite global containment measures to fight the&#xD;
      disease, the pandemic continued to rise, rapidly spread across the world, and resulting in in&#xD;
      10.5 million confirmed cases and 51391 deaths worldwide as of July 1st 2020. The outbreak of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection has a significant threat to international health, the economy,&#xD;
      psychological stress and mental health worldwide. Yet, there are no approved vaccines or&#xD;
      drugs to make the disease less deadly; implying that searching therapeutic options are&#xD;
      critical issues to overcome the outbreak. Studies are strongly underway to discover rapidly&#xD;
      drug candidates for COVID-19, and studies are looking into repurposing drugs that have been&#xD;
      used for the treatment of other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pakistan is badly facing this pandemic too. Up till now there are 221,896 confirmed cases&#xD;
      with 4551 deaths with a death ratio of 2.1%. More than 3000 patients are critical.8 In&#xD;
      Punjab, being allocated as a leading tertiary care centre for COVID-19 patients, Mayo&#xD;
      hospital Lahore is dealing with each and every category of COVID-19 patients with variable&#xD;
      presentations and treating those patients with different investigational drugs in keeping&#xD;
      with other countries to find the best possible treatable drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorisation (EUA) of the&#xD;
      antiviral drug remdesivir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Although clinical&#xD;
      trials have showed remdesivir as a treatment option for COVID-19, results are controversial.&#xD;
      That's why we need to conduct a trial in our part of the world too to see its effectiveness&#xD;
      in patients presenting with Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remdesivir has been recently approved by CEAG (Corona Expert Advisory Group) for COVID&#xD;
      patient is Mayo hospital. Remdesivir has never been used before in any public sector hospital&#xD;
      in Punjab. Investigators aim to do this study in Mayo hospital Lahore to check the efficiency&#xD;
      of this drug in COVID-19 patients in Mayo hospital Lahore&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of remdesivir in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 presenting to Mayo Hospital Lahore&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME AND UTILIZATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no therapy has demonstrated efficacy for patients with COVID-19.This study will help&#xD;
      in finding any definite role of Remdesivir in COVID -19 patients who are severely ill .&#xD;
      Although data from several international ongoing randomized, controlled trials will soon&#xD;
      provide more informative evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of remdesivir for&#xD;
      COVID-19, but this needs to be evaluated in local arena too.&#xD;
