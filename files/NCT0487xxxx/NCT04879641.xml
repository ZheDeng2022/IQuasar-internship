  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is characterized by a marked fear of negative evaluation in&#xD;
      social situations. It is the third most common psychiatric disorder and highly disabling&#xD;
      (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Although effective treatments such as&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are available, most individuals suffering from SAD do not&#xD;
      seek and eventually find help, and even in the best available treatments, remission rates are&#xD;
      below 50%. The overall aim of the project is to better understand and improve the efficacy of&#xD;
      Internet-based CBT (ICBT) that has shown to be efficacious in many trials and that provide&#xD;
      broad and low-threshold access to empirically supported treatments. Specifically the&#xD;
      objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to investigate the active ingredients of ICBT for SAD by testing the main effects and&#xD;
           interactions for the four main treatment components (i.e., psychoeducation, cognitive&#xD;
           restructuring, attention training, and exposure);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate the effects of each treatment component on hypothesized change&#xD;
           mechanisms, and to explore whether and which change mechanisms mediate the effect of the&#xD;
           treatment components on symptom reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to investigate whether the specific mechanisms mediate the effect of the treatment&#xD;
           components on primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;

      Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is characterized by a marked fear of negative evaluation in&#xD;
      social situations. It is the third most common psychiatric disorder and highly disabling.&#xD;
      Although effective treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are available, most&#xD;
      individuals suffering from SAD do not seek and eventually find help, and even in the best&#xD;
      available treatments, remission rates are below 50%. The overall aim of the project is to&#xD;
      improve the efficacy of Internet-based CBT (ICBT) that has shown to be efficacious in many&#xD;
      trials and that provide broad and low-threshold access to empirically supported treatments.&#xD;
      Specifically, the objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to investigate the active ingredients of ICBT for SAD by testing the main effects and&#xD;
           interactions for the four main treatment components (i.e., psychoeducation, cognitive&#xD;
           restructuring, attention training, and exposure);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate the effects of each treatment component on hypothesized change mechanisms&#xD;
           (change of the knowledge of SAD, change on negative social cognitions, changes on&#xD;
           self-focused attention, changes on social avoidance and use of safety behaviors), and to&#xD;
           explore whether and which change mechanisms mediate the effect of the treatment&#xD;
           components on symptom reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to investigate whether the specific mechanisms mediate the effect of the treatment&#xD;
           components on primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a single-center, factorial trial with four experimental factors (treatment&#xD;
      components, i.e., psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, attention training, and exposure)&#xD;
      each evaluated at two levels (presence vs. absence) resulting in 16 conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited using reports in newspapers, through internet&#xD;
      forums, social media (e.g., Facebook), and via our website (https://www.online-therapy.ch/)&#xD;
      in German-speaking countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling: After checking the inclusion criteria, participants will be randomized with equal&#xD;
      probability to one of the 16 conditions. The random allocation will be unknown to the&#xD;
      investigators. In order to keep the sample sizes of the 16 conditions similar, the allocation&#xD;
      list will be made using randomly permuted blocks. A total of 464 participants with a&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders diagnosis of SAD will be included, with&#xD;
      29 patients being assigned to each of the 16 conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment procedures: The primary outcome measure is change in symptoms of SAD at&#xD;
      post-treatment, i.e., after 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes include sustaining change at follow&#xD;
      up (6 months after baseline), changes in depressive symptoms, changes in general anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms, changes in quality of life, adherence to treatment, treatment satisfaction,&#xD;
      negative effects and changes of diagnosis of SAD. Furthermore, the hypothesized change&#xD;
      mechanisms (change of the knowledge of SAD, change on negative social cognitions, changes in&#xD;
      self-focused attention, changes in social avoidance and use of safety behaviors) will be&#xD;
      assessed. Self-report measures are taken at pre-treatment (baseline), after 4 weeks&#xD;
      (mid-treatment), after 8 weeks (post-treatment), and at 6 months after randomization&#xD;
      (follow-up). Besides the self-report measures, a diagnostic interview will be conducted by&#xD;
      phone at pre-treatment, eight weeks (posttreatment), and six months (follow-up). The&#xD;
      structured M.I.N.I. Interview will be used. The interviews will be administered by advanced&#xD;
      Master students in clinical psychology and psychotherapy supervised by the study team.&#xD;
      Interrater reliability will be assessed on a subset of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: The internet-based self-help program (&quot;Shyne&quot;,&#xD;
      https://selfhelp1.psy.unibe.ch/shyne/) is based on the well-established cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      treatment of social anxiety by Clark and Wells and has been proven efficacious in previous&#xD;
      studies. Shyne is accessed through a secure website, with each participant having a&#xD;
      password-protected account. It consists of the following four treatment components: (1)&#xD;
      psychoeducation (knowledge about SAD and its treatment); (2) cognitive restructuring&#xD;
      (challenging dysfunctional social cognitions); (3) attention training (decrease of&#xD;
      self-focused attention); and (4) exposure (decrease of avoidance of feared situations and&#xD;
      safety behaviors). These treatment components will be offered in 16 different combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Primary analyses will be conducted on the Intention-To-Treat (ITT) sample&#xD;
      (i.e., all randomized participants). The analyses are carried out on the basis of the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat (ITT) approach using linear mixed models. In addition, but only secondary,&#xD;
      completers analysis will be carried out. In order to test for main and interaction effects of&#xD;
      treatment components on outcomes and change mechanisms across the time points of assessment,&#xD;
      linear mixed models Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or latent growth curve modelling will be&#xD;
      used. Main effects and interactions will be based on aggregates across experimental&#xD;
      conditions. Sensitivity analyses will explore the impact of the imputation of missing values.&#xD;
      For binary outcome data (i.e., SAD diagnosis), a logistic regression model will be used.&#xD;
      Furthermore, mediation analyses will be used to determine whether the hypothesized change&#xD;
      mechanisms mediate the effect of the treatment components on primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      The mediation will be tested using an approach that allows multiple mediators in one model.&#xD;
      In addition, potential moderation of the treatment components by various measured variables&#xD;
      such as comorbid disorder, medication, the severity of SAD, age and sex will be investigated.&#xD;
      Reporting will follow CONSORT E-Health standards.&#xD;
