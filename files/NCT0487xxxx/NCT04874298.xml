  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was planned as a randomized controlled experimental study to determine the effect&#xD;
      of inhalation use of ginger and peppermint on postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients&#xD;
      undergoing thyroidectomy surgery. After the approval of the ethics committee and&#xD;
      institutional permission, 81 patients who applied to the general surgery clinic for&#xD;
      thyroidectomy between 1 December 2020 and 1 December 2021 and met the inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be included in the study. Within the scope of the planned study, the sample size in the light&#xD;
      of the reported academic studies was determined as effect size d = 0.40 (effect size), α =&#xD;
      0.05 (margin of error), 1-β = 0.90 (Power) and by using the G-power package program with the&#xD;
      specified criteria. It was decided to recruit 81 people (27 people per 3 group). Block&#xD;
      randomization method will be used to determine the experimental and control groups. In order&#xD;
      for the groups to be distributed homogeneously, the order produced by a computer program&#xD;
      (https://www.randomizer.org/) will be used. Randomization will be done by a biostatistician&#xD;
      outside the researcher. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in&#xD;
      the study will be assigned to the experimental and control groups according to the&#xD;
      randomization list. Before the operation, the patient will be visited and information will be&#xD;
      given about the purpose, content and intervention to be applied. After obtaining verbal and&#xD;
      written permission from the patients who accepted to participate in the study, the &quot;Informed&#xD;
      Consent&quot; will be filled in the &quot;Patient Identification form. On the day of surgery, &quot;surgical&#xD;
      intervention information will be filled in by the researcher. In the postoperative period at&#xD;
      the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 12th and 24th hours, the patient will use ginger and peppermint oil as&#xD;
      inhalation. At the end of the 24th hour, the application will be terminated. In the control&#xD;
      group, no application will be made during and after the surgical intervention, and routine&#xD;
      treatment and care will be applied. After admission to the clinic of the patients in the&#xD;
      experimental and control groups, the severity of pain, nausea and vomiting, the number of&#xD;
      nausea-vomiting at the 2nd, 6th, 12th and 24th hours, the name, dose, frequency and time of&#xD;
      the antiemetic drugs used were determined by the researcher. At the end of the 24th hour,&#xD;
      Rhodes Nausea Vomiting Index score will be evaluated by the researcher.&#xD;

      The universe of the research; patients who are planned to undergo thyroid surgery between 1&#xD;
      December 2020 and 1 December 2021 in the general surgery clinic where the study will be&#xD;
      conducted will comprise the patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate&#xD;
      in the study. The research was planned as a randomized controlled experimental study. Block&#xD;
      randomization method will be used to determine the experimental and control groups. In order&#xD;
      for the groups to be distributed homogeneously, the order produced by a computer program&#xD;
      (https://www.randomizer.org/) will be used. Randomization will be done by a biostatistician&#xD;
      outside the researcher. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in&#xD;
      the study will be assigned to the experimental and control groups according to the&#xD;
      randomization list. Research data will be collected in a hospital's general surgery ward&#xD;
      between 1 December 2020 and 1 December 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variables of the research; age, gender, educational status, marital status,&#xD;
      height, weight, habits and general health parameters were defined as independent variables.&#xD;
      The dependent variables of the study are postoperative nausea-vomiting status (number and&#xD;
      severity), pain severity (Visual Analog Scale-VAS), and Rhodes nausea-vomiting index score&#xD;
      average.&#xD;
