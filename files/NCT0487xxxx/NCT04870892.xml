      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of norepinephrine and fluid expansion on&#xD;
      capillary refill time during septic shock.&#xD;

      An interventional study compared, in septic shock, the effect of resuscitation strategy&#xD;
      targeting normalization of capillary refill time versus strategy targeting serum lactate&#xD;
      level. This last highlight a decrease of organ dysfunction at 72 hours with capillary refill&#xD;
      time strategy and non-significant trend towards lower 28-day mortality in the capillary&#xD;
      refill time strategy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strategy guided by the decreasing of capillary refill time allowed the administration of&#xD;
      less fluid than that guided by lactate. This is an important advantage when the intensive&#xD;
      care doctor know that the mortality of patient in septic shock increases with the amount of&#xD;
      fluid administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the variations of capillary refill time induced by the principal treatment in septic&#xD;
      shock (norepinephrine and fluid resuscitation) during circulatory failure are actually&#xD;
      insufficiently described. The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of norepinephrine&#xD;
      and fluid expansion on capillary refill time during septic shock.&#xD;
