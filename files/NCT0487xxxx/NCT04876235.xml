  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Walled-off necrosis (WON) is defined as an encapsulated collection of solid and liquid&#xD;
      necrotic material that is usually formed 4 weeks after an episode of acute necrotizing&#xD;
      pancreatitis. As the advances in endoscopic techniques and accessories, Endoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      (EUS)-guided transluminal drainage has evolved to become the treatment of choice for&#xD;
      symptomatic pancreatic walled-off necrosis (WON). This article aims to compare the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of a double mushroom head metal stent and a double pigtail plastic stent in the&#xD;
      treatment of encapsulated necrosis of the pancreas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the revised Atlanta classification, pancreatic fluid collections (PFCs) include&#xD;
      acute peripancreatic fluid collections(APFCs) and acute necrotic collections(ANCs), which,&#xD;
      over time, turn into pancreatic pseudocysts (PPs) and walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WON).&#xD;
      Drainage of these PP and WON is required when they increase in size and become infected or&#xD;
      become symptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, WON has been managed surgically, however, surgical necrosectomy is associated&#xD;
      with substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly when pursued early. In recent years,&#xD;
      with the development of minimally invasive techniques, Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided&#xD;
      transluminal drainage has evolved to become the treatment of choice for symptomatic&#xD;
      pancreatic walled-off necrosis (WON).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-pigtail plastic stents(DPPS) is the earliest stent used for WON drainage in ultrasound&#xD;
      endoscopy, however, These stents are limited by their small diameter leading to increased&#xD;
      risk of stent obstruction. Recently, lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) have been&#xD;
      increasingly used because of the advantage of better lumen apposition and wider diameter,&#xD;
      improving access for endoscopic debridement. However, more adverse events(AEs) such as&#xD;
      bleeding have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This article aims to compare the efficacy and safety of DPPS and LAMS in the treatment of&#xD;
      Walled-off necrosis&#xD;
