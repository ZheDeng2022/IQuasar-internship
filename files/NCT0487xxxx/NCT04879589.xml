  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To access the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of subcutaneously&#xD;
      administered ATRA-2002 against commercially available oral formulation of abiraterone acetate&#xD;
      in healthy male adults&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 4 dosing groups of 8 subjects each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-two healthy adult men will be randomly assigned to a treatment cohort and will receive&#xD;
      either a single Subcutaneous (SC) dose of ATRS-2002 (abiraterone acetate), or a single oral&#xD;
      dose of the commercially available formulation of abiraterone acetate (ZytigaÂ®).&#xD;
      Additionally, for Cohorts 1 through 3, a single subject will be randomized as a sentinel&#xD;
      subject to be dosed at least 24 hours prior to the rest of cohort (ROC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing in the abiraterone acetate SC cohorts will be sequential and will start with subjects&#xD;
      in the lowest SC dosing cohort (i.e., 25 mg). Dosing will not begin in the next highest SC&#xD;
      dose cohort until all safety data, as well as available PK (Pharmacokinetic) data and TT&#xD;
      levels, from the previous cohort(s) have been reviewed by the safety review committee (SRC&#xD;
      e.g., Sponsor and Investigator) and it has been deemed safe to proceed to the next highest&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing in the oral abiraterone acetate cohort (Cohort 4) may begin at any time during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
