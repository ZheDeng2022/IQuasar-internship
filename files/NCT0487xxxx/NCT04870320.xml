  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial investigates if certain electronic games may be effective in improving&#xD;
      attention and memory function in cancer survivors. Cancer related cognitive impairment (CRCI)&#xD;
      is an issue experienced by many cancer patients/survivors. CRCI includes perceived or&#xD;
      objective problems with memory, executive function, and attention/concentration. CRCI has a&#xD;
      negative impact on survivors' ability to work, carry out routine activities, and engage in&#xD;
      social and family relationships. CRCI may result in significant distress and reduced quality&#xD;
      of life. Certain electronic games may help improve attention and memory function in cancer&#xD;
      survivors and reduce symptoms of CRCI.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the recruitment and retention rates for both arms of this study. II. Determine&#xD;
      the effect size for changes in cognitive function (i.e., Test of Variables of Attention&#xD;
      (TOVA) [i.e. attention], Adaptive Cognitive Evaluation (ACE) [i.e. working memory]) in the&#xD;
      intervention group compared to the control group following the 4-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate adherence rates for and satisfaction with the interventions. IV. Evaluate for&#xD;
      treatment-related adverse events (e.g., nausea, motion sickness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine effect sizes for depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance, by comparing&#xD;
      changes in the intervention group to changes in the control group, following the 4-week&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients play Endeavor over 25 minutes daily 5 days a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients play Words! over 25 minutes daily 5 days a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean change in scores on the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TOVA records responses to visual or auditory stimuli through the participants iPAD, with a unique, highly accurate +/1 millisecond (ms) microswitch. The TOVA (Copyright 1991- 2021 by The TOVA Company) automatically calculates response time variability (consistency), response time (speed), commissions (impulsivity), and omissions (focus and vigilance). Results are reported as standard scores (average = 100 with a standard deviation of 15) and are compared to a large normative sample stratified by gender and age. Scores above 85 are within normal limits, 80-85 are borderline, and below 80 are not within normal limits. The mean change in scores will be estimated as the norm-based standardized difference in means from enrollment (Week 1) to the last assessment (Week 4).</description>

    <measure>Mean changes in Adaptive Cognitive Evaluation (ACE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ACE is a mobile cognitive control assessment battery containing standard tests that assess different aspects of cognitive control (attention, working memory, and goal management), modified by incorporating adaptive algorithms, immersive graphics, video tutorials, motivating feedback, and a user-friendly interface. The ACE is administered to all participants via iPad and the scores will be estimated as the standardized difference in means from enrollment (Week 1) to the last assessment (Week 4).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety analyses will involve examination of and comparison between groups for the percentage of participants by adverse event severity and type of treatment-related adverse events. Comparisons of the frequencies between groups will be conducted using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean severity scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CES-D scale is a brief self-report scale designed to measure self-reported symptoms associated with depression experienced in the past week. Responses are rated on a 5 point Likert scale with response option ranging 0=&quot;Rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day )&quot; to 4='Most or all of the time (5-7 days)&quot;. The scoring of positive items is reversed. Possible range of scores is 0 to 60, with the higher scores indicating the presence of more symptomatology and will be estimated as the standardized difference in means of each measure at the last assessment from enrollment to the last assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean severity scores on the Lee Fatigue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Lee Fatigue Scale is used to measure the impact of fatigue on a participants quality of life. The scale consists of 18 items relating to the subjective experience of fatigue. Each item is rated on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (e.g., from &quot;not at all tired&quot; to &quot;extremely tired&quot;). Scores can range from 0 to 10. The instrument has two subscales: fatigue (items 1-5 and 11-18) and energy (items 6-10). The fatigue subscale score is calculated as the mean of the 13 fatigue items and the energy subscale score is the mean of the 5 energy items. Higher scores on the fatigue subscale represent greater fatigue severity, and higher scores on the energy subscale indicate higher levels of energy and will be estimated as the standardized difference in means of each measure at the last assessment from enrollment to the last assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in severity scores on the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GSDS consists of 21 items related to frequency in the past month of difficulty getting to sleep when respondents were asked to think about the past month, and each response is on a 8-point Likert scale from 0 (&quot;never&quot;) to 7 (&quot;all the time&quot;). Will be estimated as the standardized difference in means of each measure at the last assessment, and as the difference between the groups in the percent change from enrollment to the last assessment.</description>
