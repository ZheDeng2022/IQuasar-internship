  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Common mental disorders (CMDs) like depression and anxiety account for a large proportion of&#xD;
      disability worldwide. Access to effective treatments like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      is limited and has not reduced the public health burden of psychopathology. For patients with&#xD;
      mild-moderate CMDs, lower-intensity treatments like guided self-help CBT (GSH-CBT) are&#xD;
      effective and more scalable (e.g., via the internet). The advent of social media has opened&#xD;
      avenues for dissemination of GSH-CBTs and allows for passive sensing of mood, thinking,&#xD;
      behavior, and social networks. We propose to leverage a social media platform used by over a&#xD;
      fifth of the United States (Twitter) as a recruitment tool to virtually screen over 150&#xD;
      individuals, recruit N=60 to a 5-week course of GSH-CBT, and extract social media data from&#xD;
      individuals engaged in GSH-CBT. Sociodemographic and social media data will be used to&#xD;
      predict engagement, outcomes, and processes in GSH-CBT.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6-week change in Kessler 6 Psychological Distress Scale (K6)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in K6 from baseline to Week 6. The K6 is a measure of distress and the measure is scored on a scale of 0 - 24 where higher scores indicate higher distress (i.e., are negative). Thus, lower scores relative to baseline indicate more positive outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6-week change in the WHO 5 Well-being Index (WHO-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in WHO-5 from baseline to Week 6. The WHO-5 is a measure of well-being and the measure is scored on a scale of 0 - 100 where higher scores indicate higher satisfaction with life (i.e., are positive). Thus, higher scores relative to baseline indicate more positive outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-week change in Emotion Regulation Scale (ERQ) - Reappraisal subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the ERQ Reappraisal subscale from baseline to Week 6. The Reappraisal scale is a measure of regulating emotions by engaging in reappraisal (i.e., changing the one one thinks about an emotion evoking stimuli), widely considered an adaptive strategy. The measured is scored on a 1-7 scale where higher scores indicate greater use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies (i.e., positive). Thus, higher scores relative to baseline indicate more positive outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-week change in the Emotion Regulation Scale (ERQ) - Suppression subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the ERQ Suppression Scale from baseline to Week 6. The ERQ Suppression scale is a measure of regulating emotions by engaging in suppression (i.e., trying not to think or feel), which is considered a maldaptive emotion regulation strategy. The measure is scored on a scale of 1 - 7 where higher scores indicate higher use of suppression (i.e., negative). Thus, lower scores relative to baseline indicate more positive outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>3-month change in Kessler 6 Psychological Distress Scale (K6; 0 - 24)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-month</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in K6 from baseline to 3 months after the termination of the study. The K6 is a measure of distress and the measure is scored on a scale of 0 - 24 where higher scores indicate higher distress (i.e., negative). Thus, lower scores relative to baseline indicate more positive outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>3-month change in the WHO 5 Well-being Index (WHO-5)</measure>

The WHO-5 is a measure of well-being and the measure is scored on a scale of 0 - 100 where higher scores indicate higher satisfaction with life (i.e., are positive).

    <description>Participants are given access to the World Health Organization's (WHO) &quot;Doing what matters in times of stress: An illustrated guide&quot; (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240003927) virtually (i.e., as a pdf) and/or in print. Each participant is assigned an &quot;eCoach&quot; -- an undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, or graduate research assistant -- who will meet with the participant for a 60-minute welcome call describing the intervention and 3-6 sessions of guidance focused on promoting adherence to the manual and using skills in everyday life.</description>

    <intervention_name>Doing What Matters in Times of Stress: An Illustrated Guide</intervention_name>
    <description>From the WHO's website: Doing What Matters in Times of Stress: An Illustrated Guide is a stress management guide for coping with adversity. The guide aims to equip people with practical skills to help cope with stress. A few minutes each day are enough to practice the self-help techniques. The guide can be used alone or with the accompanying audio exercises.&#xD;
Informed by evidence and extensive field testing, the guide is for anyone who experiences stress, wherever they live and whatever their circumstances.</description>
