      Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Incidence rates&#xD;
      are high in more developed countries than rates in less developed countries In Egypt,&#xD;
      standardized age of cancers are 166.6per 100.000 in both sexes cancer breast represent 32%in&#xD;
      females and 15.4%in both sexes of all cancer Mastectomy is an important treatment method in&#xD;
      Brest cancer. But, mastectomy has a deep and stable negative impact on a woman because,&#xD;
      mastectomy as a treatment option, can result in a sense of mutilation and diminished&#xD;
      self-worth and may threaten perceptions of femininity Body image of a woman includes the&#xD;
      symbolic meaning and importance of her breasts. The more she values her breasts, more&#xD;
      devastating effects of having a mastectomy can be. it has been reported that cutting&#xD;
      off/amputating one or both breasts was associated with several problems in women such as loss&#xD;
      of fertility, charm and sexuality, fear of recurrence Social support plays an important role&#xD;
      in reducing the pressure and improving health. Cancer patients who lack social support may be&#xD;
      more pessimistic and desperate as they are constantly looking for support from others&#xD;
      Therefore, it is critical for health care professionals to become familiar with the impact of&#xD;
      a breast cancer diagnosis and its treatment on patient's quality of life .&#xD;
