    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Teaching Obesity&#xD;
      Treatment Options to Adult Learners (TOTAL intervention), which includes an educational video&#xD;
      about obesity treatment options within VA in conjunction with three telemedicine motivational&#xD;
      sessions to increase obesity treatment initiation. 10 participants will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Madison VA Medical Center. Participation involves 3.5 hours of total time with study follow&#xD;
      up to 18 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. The treatment of obesity and its&#xD;
      related comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, exceeds $150 billion&#xD;
      annually. &quot;Morbidly&quot; or &quot;severely&quot; obese patients, defined by a body mass index (BMI) of 35&#xD;
      kg/mÂ² or greater, are especially high risk for serious complications due to the metabolic and&#xD;
      physiologic derangements that occur with severe obesity. Within the Veterans Health&#xD;
      Administration (VA) system, nearly 600,000 patients are severely obese. These Veterans exert&#xD;
      significant costs on the VA system, experience poorer quality of life, and have shortened&#xD;
      lifespans. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity for weight&#xD;
      loss, comorbidity resolution, and quality of life. Bariatric surgery is supported as a&#xD;
      treatment option by many national societies, including those representing primary care and&#xD;
      endocrinology. However, less than 1% of Veterans who qualify for bariatric surgery undergo&#xD;
      it. The investigator's previous research indicates that two important barriers to obesity&#xD;
      treatment participation are poor Veteran knowledge about the risks of obesity and obesity&#xD;
      treatment options, and lack of Veteran motivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Teaching Obesity&#xD;
      Treatment Options to Adult Learners (TOTAL intervention) among Veterans with&#xD;
      overweight/obesity who are not participating in MOVE! program (a Weight Management Program,&#xD;
      supported by VA's National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP). The&#xD;
      primary outcomes will be recruitment and retention rates and acceptability of TOTAL. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes include MOVE! program initiation sustained MOVE! participation, obesity&#xD;
      medication receipt, bariatric surgery referral, and weight loss 18 months post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to pilot test the TOTAL intervention for up to 10 Veterans with&#xD;
      overweight/obesity who are not currently participating in MOVE!. Once participants are&#xD;
      consented and baseline data are obtained, participants will view the TOTAL video and&#xD;
      participate in three one-on-one, 30-minute motivational sessions via VVC at 1-week, 6-months,&#xD;
      and 12-months. All VVC sessions will be audio recorded. This timing was selected so Veterans&#xD;
      would have regular interactions with the interventionist within one year of initiating the&#xD;
      intervention. Each motivational session will be tailored to where Veterans are in the&#xD;
      treatment initiation process. Further, the investigators will conduct 15-minute participant&#xD;
      interviews after each motivational session to assess how the TOTAL educational video and the&#xD;
      motivational sessions are received by Veterans using VVC. These interviews will not be&#xD;
      audio-recorded. Lastly, participants will complete a brief post-assessment at the 18-month&#xD;
      visit to obtain information about their obesity initiation/treatment as well as their final&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
