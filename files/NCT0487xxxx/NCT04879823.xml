      The goal of this study is determine if an oral systemic course of steroids is a safe and&#xD;
      effective option in lowering pain and complications following adenotonsillectomy in various&#xD;
      pediatric age groups. A double blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of&#xD;
      steroids (dexamethasone) versus placebo postoperatively will be performed. Investigators will&#xD;
      determine if there is a difference in post-operative pain and complications between groups.&#xD;

      Purpose: To determine if post-operative dexamethasone is a safe and effective option in the&#xD;
      reduction of post-operative pain and morbidity following adenotonsillectomy in various&#xD;
      pediatric age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The subject population will be patients between the ages of 3 and 17 who will&#xD;
      undergo adenotonsillectomy. The study will consist of two double-blinded arms - patients&#xD;
      receiving a course of oral dexamethasone (doses on post-operative days 2, 4, and 6; 0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg; max dose: 20 mg) in addition to standard pain control regimen and patients receiving&#xD;
      an oral placebo course in addition to standard pain control regimen. In the diary they will&#xD;
      receive, patients or caregivers will record when specific pain medications were taken each&#xD;
      day, a symptoms survey, and pain ratings measured by the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale.&#xD;
      Patients are able to return their diary at a post-operative appointment at CHP Main, through&#xD;
      email by scanning the diary or taking pictures with their phone, or through mailing in the&#xD;
      survey in a pre-stamped envelope. Demographic information such as age, race, gender, and&#xD;
      household income will be extracted from the diary and the electronic medical record.&#xD;
      Information such as surgical technique, concurrent operations, post-operative pain&#xD;
      prescription (types, weight based dosage, and total days prescribed) will be extracted from&#xD;
      the electronic medical record and recorded as well. Outcomes measured will include pain scale&#xD;
      rating and rates of complications between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: If it can be demonstrated that dexamethasone after adenotonsillectomy can&#xD;
      reduce pain, complications, or need for opioid analgesics without appreciable side effects, a&#xD;
      strong argument can be made for the addition of this inexpensive medication to routine&#xD;
      post-operative adenotonsillectomy care. This would help with limiting the burden of clinical&#xD;
      course of tonsillectomy.&#xD;

    <description>Average pain over 14 post-operative days before and after medications. This is quantified using the validated Wong-Baker FACES pain metric. The scale is from 0 to 10 with 10 being worse outcome. Patients receive a take-home pain diary and for 14 days report their maximum pain both before and after taking each pain medication. The mean of these pain ratings will be the primary outcome measure.</description>

    <description>Score assigned by the patient at the end of 14 post-operative days in the take-home pain diary using a 5-point Likert scale of 0 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Patients will respond to the following statement &quot;I am happy with the pain relief I received in the last 14 days&quot; with responses ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The responses will be assigned a numerical value and the average value for all subjects in the group will be reported as the overall pain relief satisfaction.
