  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of omacetaxine and&#xD;
      venetoclax in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that&#xD;
      has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) and have a genetic&#xD;
      change RUNX1. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as omacetaxine, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking&#xD;
      Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Giving omacetaxine and venetoclax may help&#xD;
      to control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      omacetaxine in combination with venetoclax for patients with relapsed/refractory acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome harboring a RUNX1 mutation. (Phase 1b) II. To&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of omacetaxine in combination with venetoclax for patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome harboring a RUNX1&#xD;
      mutation. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine duration of response (DOR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival&#xD;
      (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate occurrence of minimal residual disease (MRD) negative status by&#xD;
      multiparameter flow cytometry and molecular evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate global gene expression profiles, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation&#xD;
      profiles, BH3 profiling and other potential prognostic markers to explore predictors of&#xD;
      antitumor activity and/or resistance to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose de-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive omacetaxine subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 2-3 or 2-4, and&#xD;
      venetoclax orally (PO) on days 1-7, 1-10 or 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to&#xD;
      12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days, then every 3&#xD;
      months for 3 years.&#xD;
