  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 3D-Transition study is a follow-up of the 3D Cohort pregnancy study (NCT03113331, which&#xD;
      covered from the 1st trimester of pregnancy to age 2 years) as the children transition into&#xD;
      kindergarten and first grade. It aims at clarifying prenatal and preschool predictors of&#xD;
      challenging and successful transitions to school as measured by mental health and academic&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Broad goal: This study seeks to understand how early vulnerabilities (externalizing or&#xD;
      internalizing symptoms, or low neurodevelopmental/academic skills) turn into a rate of 10-15%&#xD;
      of externalizing and internalizing mental health problems in school-aged children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Several lines of research guide this study. Functional impairments emerge for some&#xD;
      children challenged by the transition to kindergarten and grade school. This risk is also&#xD;
      thought to be programmed very early in life through cumulative early perinatal and&#xD;
      psychosocial adversity. Further, interactions between the child, family and school&#xD;
      environment during the transition may mitigate future impairments and this may be different&#xD;
      for boys and girls. Finally, stress regulation mechanisms during the transition seem linked&#xD;
      to early child vulnerabilities. This design allows us to contrast any combination of these&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: This study will clarify the role of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a mismatch between some child preschool vulnerability (externalizing, or internalizing&#xD;
           symptoms, or low neurodevelopmental/academic skills) and the challenges of the&#xD;
           transition from preschool to formal schooling;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the experience of perinatal adversity and home chaos during child first years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. supportive environments (high quality families or schools) during the school transition,&#xD;
           and child sex; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the child stress response to the school transition, as assessed through salivary&#xD;
           cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Building on an existing pregnancy cohort (NCT03113331, which was structured around a&#xD;
      triadic (mother-partner-child) framework, and which covered from the 1st trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy to age 2 years), the investigators have followed at least once 939 of 1551 families&#xD;
      that agreed to a further follow-up past the initial study. Children in this cohort, who were&#xD;
      seen in 3 waves based on age on September 30th, entered kindergarten in the fall of 2016,&#xD;
      2017, and 2018, respectively. A cohort-sequential longitudinal research design spanning&#xD;
      pre-kindergarten to 2nd grade (ages 4 to 8 years), was implemented to follow each wave 6&#xD;
      times over 4 years. Cascade models will be used to address aims 1-3. The stress hormone&#xD;
      cortisol will be examined on 11 days spread over a 16 months period for a subsample of 384&#xD;
      children to address aim 4, using growth curves models. This design is well suited and&#xD;
      sufficiently powered to examine change processes over time, controlling for potential&#xD;
      differences in waves and time of measurement effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data: The Research Ethics Committee authorized two Corona Virus (COVID-19)&#xD;
      supplemental data collections without additional consent for the spring of 2020 and the&#xD;
      spring of 2021. However, cohorts 1 and 2, which had completed participation in 2019 and 2020,&#xD;
      were re-consented, and this extended the maximum age range to 10 and 9 years, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: Public health interventions are being put in place to help children manage&#xD;
      the transition to school on the basis of little evidence. This longitudinal research will&#xD;
      provide a greater understanding of individual and environmental factors linked to children's&#xD;
      adaptation during the perinatal period and transitions to school. As such, mental health&#xD;
      prevention research will be better informed on the developmental timing of individual and&#xD;
      environmental targets that need to be considered in a developmental framework.&#xD;
