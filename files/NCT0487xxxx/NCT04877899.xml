  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare conventionally acquired Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction (LVEF)&#xD;
      and Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) data to Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven automated&#xD;
      processing of 2 dimensional contrast and 2 dimensional non-contrast resting transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiograms for application in the assessment of patients undergoing chemotherapy with&#xD;
      cardiotoxic drugs. This is a single-centre retrospective study which utilizes&#xD;
      echocardiographic DICOM image and meta-data datasets received from a Canadian site. Data&#xD;
      processed using the AI driven automated processing will be compared to conventionally&#xD;
      acquired LVEF and GLS measurements and results will be analysed to determine accuracy and&#xD;
      precision.&#xD;

    <description>EchoGo Core is a stand-alone software application. Echocardiograms should be acquired under the supervision of a physician and standard clinical protocols which includes focused apical 2, 3 and 4 chamber views. The results contain calculated measurements that will be returned to the interpreting physician. These results are intended as an additional input to standard diagnostic pathways and should only be used by a board-certified cardiologist/physician.&#xD;
EchoGo Core is intended to be used for the quantification and reporting of results of cardiovascular function to support physician diagnosis. EchoGo Core is indicated for use in adult populations.</description>

        - Data included for analysis in this study will be retrospective data from male and female&#xD;
        patients aged 18 years or above who received an echocardiogram for baseline and follow-up&#xD;
        of cardiotoxic agent management, who agreed to participate in the echocardiography registry&#xD;
        of the MAHI, and who have already provided a written consent that their anonymized imaging&#xD;
        data can be used to advance echocardiographic assessment of LV function.&#xD;
