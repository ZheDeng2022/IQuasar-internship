  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BAY2586116 is a new drug in development for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. This is&#xD;
      a condition that causes breathing to repeatedly stop and start during sleep due to blocked&#xD;
      upper airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study to learn more how safe BAY2586116 is, how it affects the body, how it moves&#xD;
      into, through and out of the body in healthy Japanese male participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomly chosen to receive 1 of 3 different doses of BAY2586116 or&#xD;
      to receive a placebo. A placebo looks like a treatment but does not have any medicine in it.&#xD;
      The participants will receive their study treatment either 1 single time or once a day for 5&#xD;
      days through a nasal spray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be in the study for a total of about 12 weeks. They will stay at their&#xD;
      study site for either 5 or 9 days, depending on which study treatment they receive. During&#xD;
      this time, the doctors will take blood and urine samples and check the participants' health.&#xD;
      About 6 to 8 days after the participants receive their last treatment, the researchers will&#xD;
      check the participants' health again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to learn more about how safe BAY2586116 is compared to the&#xD;
      placebo. To answer this question, the researchers will count the number of participants who&#xD;
      have medical problems that may or may not be related to the study treatment. These medical&#xD;
      problems are also known as &quot;adverse events&quot; while they are in the study.&#xD;
