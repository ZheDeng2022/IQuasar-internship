  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of a virtual, group mind-body resiliency&#xD;
      intervention adapted to target fear of recurrence (FOR) among cancer survivors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot feasibility trial (1:1 intervention versus usual care; a referral&#xD;
      to community-based cancer survivor support group) that will use mixed methods (quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative) to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of a&#xD;
      virtual, group mind-body resiliency intervention adapted to target fear of recurrence (IN&#xD;
      FOCUS) among cancer survivors with clinically elevated fear of recurrence (N = approximately&#xD;
      64).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcomes on psychological and behavioral outcomes will be measured at T0&#xD;
      (baseline), T1 (post-intervention/approximately two months post-baseline), and T2 (three&#xD;
      months post-intervention/approximately five months post-baseline). Exit interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted after the T1 survey. Participants are expected to be in the study for approximately&#xD;
      five months.&#xD;

    <measure>Feasibility: Retention Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to approximately 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary metric for assessing feasibility will be retention at the initial follow-up assessment (≥70%). For descriptive purposes, secondary exploratory metrics of feasibility will include reasons for ineligibility, refusal, or dropping out will be measured, as will rates of enrollment, ratio of screened-to-eligible, attendance per session as well as per participant (e.g., ≥75% of intervention sessions attended), self-reported adherence to skills practice, interventionist fidelity, and survey completion within and across assessments. Exit interviews will use open-ended questions to assess the feasibility of attending virtual sessions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability: 5 item measure of enjoyableness, convenience, helpfulness, odds of future use, and overall satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to approximately 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate the enjoyableness, convenience, helpfulness, odds of future use, and overall satisfaction (1=very low to 5=very high) of the intervention or support group. A secondary acceptability metric will include themes generated from open-ended questions from exit interviews that assess participants' expectations, recommendations, and perceived changes in FOR and healthcare engagement. Exit interviews will also ask participants in the intervention about the acceptability of each mind-body skill taught (e.g., perceived benefits, challenges, barriers, any modifications made).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of Recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to approximately 2 months, approximately 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of recurrence (FOR) severity will be measured using the 9-item Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory severity subscale. Scores range from 0-36 with higher scores indicating greater FOR severity. To supplement this measure, open-ended questions in the exit interview will assess perceived changes in FOR.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Healthcare Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to approximately 2 months, approximately 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Healthcare engagement will be measured using an 18-item questionnaire adapted from the MEPS Cancer Experiences Questionnaire and MEPS Adult Self-Administered Questionnaire. We will assess type and frequency of clinic visits, frequency and duration of emergency department visits and in-hospitalizations, and cancer-related testing (e.g., biopsies, MRI's, CT). We will supplement these measures with health records data and open-ended questions in the exit interview assessing perceived changes in healthcare engagement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to approximately 2 months, approximately 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health behaviors (i.e. physical activity, diet, smoking, etc.) will be assessed using a 28-item health behavior questionnaire.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Coping Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to approximately 2 months, approximately 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Coping skills will be measured using the Measure of Current Status-Part A and Brief COPE. The MOCS-A is a 13-item self-report measure developed to assess participants' current self-perceived status on: the ability to relax at will, recognize stress-inducing situations, restructure maladaptive thoughts, and choose appropriate coping responses as needed. The Brief COPE is a 28-item self-report measure assessing a variety of coping styles. Subscale and total scores will be computed. To supplement these measures, exit interviews with participants in the intervention arm will ask about the acceptability of mind-body coping skills taught (e.g., perceived benefits, challenges, barriers, any modifications made).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mind-Body Practice</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to approximately 2 months, approximately 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mind-body practice will be assessed using a 17-item mind-body practice questionnaire. This questionnaire asks patients to report on their use, frequency of use, and perceived benefits from a variety of mind-body practices.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resiliency</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to approximately 2 months, approximately 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Resiliency will be measured using the 23-item Current Experiences Scale. Subscale scores and total scores (range from 0-115) will be computed, with higher scores indicating higher resiliency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cancer Related Uncertainty</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to approximately 2 months, approximately 5 months</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Uncertainty Tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to approximately 2 months, approximately 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Uncertainty tolerance will be measured using the 12-item Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Short Form. Total scores range from 12-60, with higher scores indicating greater uncertainty. The measure also includes a prospective anxiety and inhibitory anxiety subscale, with higher scores on each subscale indicating greater anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to approximately 2 months, approximately 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Positive affect will be measured using the 10-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule -Positive affect subscale. Total scores range from 10-50 with higher scores indicating greater positive affect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to approximately 2 months, approximately 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and depression will be measured using the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire. PHQ-4 total scores range from 0 to 12, with both an anxiety and depression subscale. Greater scores on each subscale indicate greater symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Worry</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to approximately 2 months, approximately 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Worry will be measured using the 16-item Penn State Worry Questionnaire. Total scores range from 16-39, with higher scores indicating greater worry.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to approximately 2 months, approximately 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Distress will be measured using a single item visual analog scale. Patients will be asked to rate their current level of distress on a scale from 0 (no distress) to 10 (very high distress).</description>
