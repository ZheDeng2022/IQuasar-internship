  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to Covid-19, intensive care (ICU) patients are not allowed visitors or have severely&#xD;
      restricted visiting. After being admitted to ICU most patients are unconscious or extremely&#xD;
      weak and therefore cannot speak on a phone or video call to a family member. Before these&#xD;
      visiting restrictions, family members of patients admitted to ICU as a result of being&#xD;
      critically ill were already known to suffer significant psychological distress and may now&#xD;
      face increased distress given they are unable to visit a loved one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research demonstrates that keeping a paper diary has been found to be helpful for&#xD;
      ICU patients and families. When lockdown measures were announced, NHS Scotland introduced&#xD;
      video diaries as an emergency measure to try to support communication with families and&#xD;
      reduce distress. vCreate is an NHS Trusted secure video messaging service that helps&#xD;
      patients, families and clinical teams stay connected throughout their care journey. The use&#xD;
      of video diaries may have a positive impact for family members but there is a risk that they&#xD;
      could also have negative effects for some people. There is a need to explore both ICU&#xD;
      healthcare professionals and family members' experiences of using video diaries. At the same&#xD;
      time it is also important to test the feasibility and acceptability of measures of distress&#xD;
      and psychological well-being on family members during and after their experience of video&#xD;
      diaries. In doing so, some initial recommendations about video diaries can be made and a&#xD;
      larger subsequent study planned to test their effect on family members and healthcare&#xD;
      professionals.&#xD;
