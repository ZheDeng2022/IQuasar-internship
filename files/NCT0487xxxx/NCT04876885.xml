    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to study whether education, in the form of three two-minute educational&#xD;
      videos about COVID-19 vaccine development and dissemination, reduces vaccine hesitancy and&#xD;
      increases intent to vaccinate. The investigators intend to use insights from this research&#xD;
      study to develop a framework for video-based 'education prescriptions' that reduce vaccine&#xD;
      hesitancy and increase intent to vaccinate across a number of infectious diseases. This may&#xD;
      have wide-ranging impact: inform practice for health promotions and public health, as well as&#xD;
      support infectious disease related work done by healthcare professionals (e.g. those working&#xD;
      in travel medicine, where vaccination rates are also low).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the leading threats to&#xD;
      global health in 2019. Vaccine hesitancy is defined as the &quot;reluctance or refusal to&#xD;
      vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines&quot;. Given the novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic,&#xD;
      hesitancy towards use of COVID-19 vaccine may be linked to the process of vaccine development&#xD;
      and clinical trial validation of safety and/or efficacy, rather than hesitations regarding&#xD;
      vaccines in general. This has already inspired several education campaigns. It is unclear&#xD;
      whether education leads to reduced hesitance and whether reduced hesitance leads to increased&#xD;
      intent to vaccinate. Further, early surveys demonstrating high COVID-19 vaccine acceptance&#xD;
      and intent to vaccinate may not reflect actual uptake, as shown by comparisons to flu&#xD;
      vaccination uptake at a time when flu vaccines are both available, validated and largely&#xD;
      freely accessible. Inspiring vaccine confidence is a multifaceted challenge, and the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic has shed light on one of its aspects, specifically the public health approach to&#xD;
      health information dissemination. The lack of evidence-based knowledge and preparedness&#xD;
      coupled with pandemic fatigue impacts the uptake of recommended health behaviours and puts&#xD;
      human lives at risk. Different people adopt different responses to health promotion materials&#xD;
      based on a variety of socioeconomic factors. For example, in an American study on vaccination&#xD;
      in children, it was found that children who had never received a vaccine tended to come from&#xD;
      affluent, college educated families, while those who had only received some recommended&#xD;
      vaccinations came from minority families that were single parent, low-income and less likely&#xD;
      to have completed higher education. Almost 50% of the parents of the unvaccinated children&#xD;
      cited concerns about vaccine safety. The strength of beliefs leading to hesitancy may change&#xD;
      the ability to affect intent to vaccinate. These beliefs may be contributed to by cultural&#xD;
      dimensions in Canada and cultures of recently immigrated individuals, with regards to&#xD;
      individualism, collectivism, perceptions of social benefits, etc. These factors might also&#xD;
      impact the choice to vaccinate. The existence of many outlets for highly varied information&#xD;
      underscores the need for unbiased and credible education on COVID-19 vaccinations. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to study whether education, in the form of three two-minute educational&#xD;
      videos about COVID-19 vaccine development and dissemination, reduces vaccine hesitancy and&#xD;
      increases intent to vaccinate. The investigators intend to use insights from this research&#xD;
      study to develop a framework for video-based 'education prescriptions' that reduce vaccine&#xD;
      hesitancy and increase intent to vaccinate across a number of infectious diseases. This may&#xD;
      have wide-ranging impact: inform practice for health promotions and public health, as well as&#xD;
      support infectious disease related work done by healthcare professionals (e.g. those working&#xD;
      in travel medicine, where vaccination rates are also low).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study looks at two groups. First, it directly measures response of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the general public to education videos on COVID-19 vaccine development, validation, and dissemination. Second, it surveys two stakeholder groups - healthcare professionals and public health professionals to better understand their evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine education needs in the general public, based on their interpretation of commonly asked questions, best practices in health promotion, and evaluation of information already available.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The primary end point of the study is &quot;intent to vaccinate against COVID-19&quot; within the general public survey. We are looking for an increase in intent to vaccinate after the educational videos are completed. This is a yes/no answer choice. A change in response may be indicative of the impact of education on vaccination intent.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in score regarding vaccine hesitation after exposure to educational materials</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>The study seeks to understand whether providing video-based educational materials yields a positive change in score regarding vaccine hesitation (at least one point decrease) after exposure to educational materials. A change in score may indicate that educational materials support a decrease in COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy in the population. The scale title will be &quot;Level of concern about the COVID-19 vaccine&quot;. Values will range from 1-5, where 1 indicates no concern and 5 indicates high concern.</description>
