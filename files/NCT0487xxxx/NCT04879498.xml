  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the present study are to compare the survival rates and possible biological&#xD;
      and technical complications of metal-ceramic, veneered and monolithic zirconia posterior&#xD;
      three-unit fixed partial dentures. The null hypothesis is that no differences would be found&#xD;
      between the parameters studied for each type of restoration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ninety patients requiring at least one 3-unit Fixed partial denture (FPD) in the posterior&#xD;
      region of the maxilla or mandible were included in this study. All subjects were recruited&#xD;
      from the Master in Buccofacial Prostheses and Occlusion (Faculty of Odontology, University&#xD;
      Complutense of Madrid, Spain). Before treatment, patients were informed of the study&#xD;
      objectives, clinical procedures, materials used, advantages and possible risks of the ceramic&#xD;
      material, and other therapeutic alternatives. Prior to the study, participants were asked to&#xD;
      provide written informed consent. Ninety posterior FPDs were produced and allocated in&#xD;
      parallel and randomly to either monolithic zirconia, veneered zirconia or MC restorations.&#xD;
      The clinical procedures were performed by two experienced clinicians. All participants&#xD;
      received oral hygiene instructions and a professional tooth cleaning prior to prosthetic&#xD;
      treatment. The abutment teeth were prepared with a 0.8- to 1-mm-wide circumferential chamfer,&#xD;
      an axial reduction of 1 mm and an occlusal reduction of 1.5- to 2.0-mm. A 10- to 15- degree&#xD;
      angle of convergence was achieved for the axial walls. Tooth preparations were scanned with&#xD;
      an intraoral scanner and the FPDs were designed using specific software. The restorations&#xD;
      were then cemented using a resin self-adhesive cement. After cementation, occlusal contacts&#xD;
      were evaluated, and the adjusted surfaces were polished using a porcelain polishing kit. The&#xD;
      90 FPDs were examined at 1week (baseline),1, 2 and 2 years by 2 researchers who were not&#xD;
      involved in the restorative treatment.&#xD;
