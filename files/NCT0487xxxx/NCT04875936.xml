  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to advance a biologically-based approach to treatment of&#xD;
      reading disorders after stroke, which will expand the limits of cognitive rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Using a novel brain imaging technique, called real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) neurofeedback combined with right hand motor imagery, this project will re-instate&#xD;
      brain activity in the left language-dominant hemisphere. Stroke patients will practice&#xD;
      modulating their own brain activity using fMRI neurofeedback signal and will select the most&#xD;
      effective mental strategies that help them maintain brain activation patterns associated with&#xD;
      better reading recovery.&#xD;

    <description>Touch-screen computer tests of semantics, phonology, and orthography. The semantics task is to choose one of two examples at the bottom of the screen that matches the target at the top in meaning. The phonology task is to select a rhyme of the target in a similar fashion. These tests have a word and picture versions. The orthography task is to choose a letter string that more closely resembles a word. Each subtest accuracy ranges from 0 to 60 items, with higher scores representing better function.</description>

    <intervention_name>Motor Imagery and Real-Time fMRI Neurofeedback</intervention_name>
    <description>Survivors of left-hemisphere stroke (&lt;5 weeks post-stroke) or healthy volunteers will use right-hand motor imagery coupled with fMRI neurofeedback to help them re-engage the left hemisphere by shifting brain activation leftward relative to the initial left-right asymmetry. Following group assignment, participants will perform a motor imagery task and complete 3 sessions of motor imagery and reading tasks in the MRI scanner over 3 weeks. During the MRI sessions they will receive real time neurofeedback about how well they are engaging the left side of their brain compared to the right side. They will also practice the same task for 30 min a day as homework using the most effective motor imagery strategy that worked for them in the MRI scanner.</description>

    <description>Survivors of left-hemisphere stroke (&lt;5 weeks post-stroke) or healthy volunteers will practice right-hand motor imagery coupled with sham fMRI neurofeedback. As the experimental group, participants will perform a motor imagery task and complete 3 sessions of motor imagery and reading tasks in the MRI scanner over 3 weeks. However, during the MRI sessions they will receive sham neurofeedback on the basis of another participant's brain activity. Like the experimental group, they will also practice the same task for 30 min a day as homework.</description>
