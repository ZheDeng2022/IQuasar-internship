  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, randomized, single-dose, two-period, two-group, crossover study was conducted&#xD;
      in 48 healthy Chinese volunteers under fasted or fed conditions (24 volunteers for each&#xD;
      condition) to assess the bioequivalence between two formulations of Sitagliptin&#xD;
      Phosphate/metformin Hydrochloride Tablets.&#xD;

      The single-dose randomized, open-label, two-period crossover study was executed in the Phase&#xD;
      I Clinical Research Center of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. This study was&#xD;
      conducted to assess the bioequivalence of Sitagliptin Phosphate/metformin Hydrochloride&#xD;
      Tablets in healthy Chinese subjects and estimate the pharmacokinetics profiles of Sitagliptin&#xD;
      Phosphate/metformin Hydrochloride Tablets. An open-label, randomized, single-dose,&#xD;
      two-period, crossover study was conducted in 48 healthy Chinese volunteers under fasted or&#xD;
      fed conditions (24 subjects for each condition) to assess the bioequivalence between two&#xD;
      formulations of Sitagliptin Phosphate/metformin Hydrochloride Tablets. Blood samples were&#xD;
      collected at specified time intervals, and the plasma concentrations of sitagliptin and&#xD;
      metformin were determined by a validated liquid chromatography mass spectrum/ mass spectrum&#xD;
      method. Pharmacokinetic and bioavailability parameters were estimated via non-compartmental&#xD;
      methods. Adverse events were also recorded. If the 90% confidence intervals of the ratios of&#xD;
      geometrical mean of test and reference formulations for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ are all&#xD;
      within the predefined bioequivalence criteria range of 80%-125% for sitagliptin and&#xD;
      metformin, the two formulations can be considered bioequivalent.&#xD;
