    <textblock>
      Background: Post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a leading cause of medical&#xD;
      separation from military service. Anterior cruciate ligament injury and surgical&#xD;
      reconstruction (ACLR) incurs a high PTOA risk and is an ideal model for evaluating PTOA&#xD;
      prevention strategies. Aberrant gait biomechanics are a primary contributor to PTOA&#xD;
      development and are attributable in part to quadriceps muscle dysfunction. Vibration acutely&#xD;
      improves quadriceps function and gait biomechanics in individuals with ACLR, but its effects&#xD;
      on joint health and PTOA risk are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of vibration&#xD;
      embedded in ACLR rehabilitation on 1) quadriceps function, 2) gait biomechanics, 3) patient&#xD;
      self-report outcomes, and 4) MRI indicators of knee joint health. The central hypothesis is&#xD;
      that vibration will enhance gait biomechanics consistent with reduced PTOA risk and that&#xD;
      whole body vibration (WBV) delivered by a commercial device and local muscle vibration (LMV)&#xD;
      delivered by a prototype device will produce equivalent improvements in the study outcomes.&#xD;
      The rationale for the hypothesis is that vibration will more effectively improve quadriceps&#xD;
      function compared to standard rehabilitation, thus restoring normal gait biomechanics and&#xD;
      mitigating declines in joint health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To compare the effects of Standard rehabilitation vs. Vibration&#xD;
      rehabilitation (WBV and LMV) on quadriceps function. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      Vibration will produce superior outcomes (e.g. strength) compared to Standard rehabilitation,&#xD;
      but that WBV and LMV will produce similar outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To compare the effects of Standard rehabilitation vs. Vibration&#xD;
      rehabilitation (WBV and LMV) on gait biomechanics linked to PTOA development. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that Vibration will produce superior outcomes compared to Standard&#xD;
      rehabilitation, but that WBV and LMV will produce similar outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To compare the effects of Standard rehabilitation vs. Vibration&#xD;
      rehabilitation (WBV and LMV) on patient self-report outcomes. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that Vibration will produce superior outcomes compared to Standard rehabilitation, but that&#xD;
      the outcomes will be similar between the WBV and LMV cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To compare the effects of Standard rehabilitation vs. Vibration&#xD;
      rehabilitation (WBV and LMV) on MRI indicators of knee joint health. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that cartilage composition (e.g. collagen, water, and proteoglycan content) will&#xD;
      be poorer and PTOA incidence (MOAKS score) will be higher in the Standard cohort compared to&#xD;
      both Vibration cohorts, but that WBV and LMV will produce similar outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The approach will be to recruit ACLR patients at the onset of rehabilitation&#xD;
      and conduct a Phase II single-blind randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of&#xD;
      standard ACLR rehabilitation (control) vs. standard rehabilitation that incorporates WBV or&#xD;
      LMV on quadriceps function, gait biomechanics, patient self-report outcomes, cartilage&#xD;
      composition, and PTOA incidence over the first year post-ACLR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: The proposed work will evaluate the effects of a novel rehabilitation approach&#xD;
      (vibration) for preventing PTOA. PTOA is a leading cause of medical separation from military&#xD;
      service, degrades quality of life, increases the risks of several comorbidities (e.g.&#xD;
      obesity, depression, cardiovascular disease), and is a primary contributor to years of life&#xD;
      lost due to disability. Improving rehabilitation of knee injuries is paramount for&#xD;
      maintaining the combat readiness of the armed forces and preserving the health and well-being&#xD;
      of Service members and Veterans, as well as millions of Americans who are at risk of PTOA.&#xD;
      Vibration represents a promising approach to this important challenge. Furthermore, in&#xD;
      addition to being cost-effective, the portable nature of the prototype LMV device could have&#xD;
      substantial implications for military personnel and US citizens, particularly those with&#xD;
      limited access to rehabilitation facilities. The proposed work represents the critical&#xD;
      translational link between existing pre-clinical data and the clinical setting that is&#xD;
      necessary to establish its efficacy and accelerate its development as a commercially&#xD;
      available device.&#xD;
