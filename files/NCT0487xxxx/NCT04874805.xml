    <textblock>
      In many patients, respiratory Sars-Cov2 infection causes arterial hypoxemia, which remains&#xD;
      without signs of verbalized respiratory distress, up to a point. This phenomenon, called&#xD;
      &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;silent&quot; hypoxemia, has a plural pathophysiological basis. Hypoxemia has been&#xD;
      shown to be predictively associated with admission to the ICU. Therefore, the question of&#xD;
      constant monitoring of oxygenation, practiced on a large scale, at home, in asymptomatic&#xD;
      patients or contact cases, arises. A large number of portable pulse oximeter are currently&#xD;
      freely available on the market; however, their clinical validation remains sometimes&#xD;
      doubtful, or even absent from FDA standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of SpO2 values provided by portable&#xD;
      pulse oximeter in COVID patients, in comparison with the reference method. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted on a population of adult patients with COVID, hospitalized in the ICU, for whom&#xD;
      gasometry sampling is already scheduled in the usual management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The constant monitoring of saturation by the pulse oximeter, the result of three centuries of&#xD;
      technological progress, has introduced a true revolution in medical management that now&#xD;
      relies on this vital parameter. In many patients, Sars-Cov2 respiratory infection causes&#xD;
      arterial hypoxemia, which remains without signs of verbalized respiratory distress, up to a&#xD;
      certain point. This phenomenon, called &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;silent&quot; hypoxemia, has a plural&#xD;
      pathophysiological basis. Hypoxemia has been shown to be predictively associated with&#xD;
      admission to the ICU. Therefore, the question of constant monitoring of oxygenation,&#xD;
      practiced on a large scale, at home, in asymptomatic patients or contact cases, arises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its many advantages (non-invasive, kinetic), the pulse oximeter can be misused in&#xD;
      several pathophysiological situations. The reference method for measuring hemoglobin oxygen&#xD;
      saturation remains arterial gasometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a large number of portable pulse oximeter are currently freely available on the&#xD;
      market; however, their clinical validation is sometimes questionable or even absent from FDA&#xD;
      standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of SpO2 values provided by portable&#xD;
      pulse oximeter in COVID patients, in comparison with the reference method (arterial&#xD;
      gasometry). The study will be conducted on a population of adult patients with COVID,&#xD;
      hospitalized in the ICU, for whom gasometry sampling is already scheduled in the usual&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily at 6am, during the systematic monitoring, arterial gasometry will be taken (as part of&#xD;
      routine care) by the nurse or medical staff on duty. Synchronous measurement of Sp02 given by&#xD;
      three portable pulse oximeter (1 measurement point per device, therefore 3&#xD;
      measurements/patient/day for a minimum of 3 days).&#xD;
