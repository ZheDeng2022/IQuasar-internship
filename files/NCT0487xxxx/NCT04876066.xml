  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that ketamine is very effective and has a quick onset in treatment of&#xD;
      depression. Most of these studies used intravenous ketamine in an inpatient setting and there&#xD;
      are no large trials examining its use in Post Stroke Depression (PSD). There have been only&#xD;
      few studies that have used other routes of administration (i.e., oral, transmucosal,&#xD;
      intranasal, intramuscular) of ketamine which provided symptom relief for depression. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of use of transmucosal&#xD;
      ketamine in treatment of PSD. We hypothesize that fast acting antidepressant effects can be&#xD;
      achieved with tolerable side effects for translation into the general post-stroke population.&#xD;
      To test our hypothesis, the specific aim is to: (1) demonstrate that transmucosal&#xD;
      administration of ketamine is feasible within the post-stroke depression population and has&#xD;
      tolerable side effects. Exploratory aims will include assessment if ketamine also produces&#xD;
      fast acting antidepressant effects.&#xD;

    <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire used by mental health clinicians to measure the severity of depressive episodes in subjects with mood disorders. Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60. &quot;Reduction of MADRS&quot; = 50% drop in total score as compared to baseline, a score of 0-8 indicating NO depression OR a decrease from a more severe category to a more mild one.</description>

    <description>The recommended ketamine dose of 0.5 mg/kg will be administered using a transmucosal route of administration wherein the subject will be instructed to place the liquid solution beneath their tongue and hold it in their mouth for 5 minutes. The pharmacy will prepare two 0.5 mg/kg solutions of ketamine in two syringes for each subject based on subject weight. For example, a 70 kg adult subject will receive a 0.35 mL solution of ketamine. The patient will receive a dose every 7 days for two weeks, for a total of two doses.</description>
