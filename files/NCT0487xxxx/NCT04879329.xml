  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if a drug called disitamab vedotin works to treat HER2&#xD;
      expressing urothelial cancer. It will also test how safe the drug is for participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have cancer that has spread in the body near where it started (locally&#xD;
      advanced) and cannot be removed (unresectable) or has spread through the body (metastatic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also study what side effects happen when participants get the drug. A side effect is&#xD;
      anything a drug does to your body besides treating the disease.&#xD;
