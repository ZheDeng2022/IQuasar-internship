  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-centre, randomized, double-blind, two-period, two-sequence, cross-over 7-day study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the first safety/tolerability evaluation of a product -suppository formulation&#xD;
      containing 6 mg BDP (once daily dosing), a second-generation oral or rectal corticosteroids&#xD;
      with high topical anti-inflammatory efficacy in the gut and minimal systemic bioavailability&#xD;
      (BA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BDP is marketed in different pharmaceutical formulations, including 3 mg suppositories, and&#xD;
      approved for ulcerative proctosigmoiditis in the first attack or exacerbation phase at the&#xD;
      dosage of 3 mg twice a day. For these reasons, a 6 mg suppository (Test - &quot;T&quot; product) is a&#xD;
      scale-up of the 3 mg formulation (Reference - &quot;R&quot; product).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For locally-applied-locally acting drug products that result in quantifiable systemic&#xD;
      availability due to absorption from the administration site, relative systemic BA is&#xD;
      informative for safety, but also with respect to efficacy. Therefore, safety/tolerability of&#xD;
      T is evaluated through a comparison to R.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is the evaluation of systemic safety of T, based on valid surrogate&#xD;
      outcomes - systemic BA (relative BA) at the start of treatment (first 24 hours) and after 7&#xD;
      days of continuous treatment; effects on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA)&#xD;
      assessed based on 24-hour cortisol profile after 7 days of continuous treatment. This&#xD;
      includes identification of subjects with cortisol levels &lt;10 μg/dL at the last sampling point&#xD;
      in the 24-hour cortisol profile (08:00 a.m. on Day 8). In such cases, identified subjects&#xD;
      will undergo ACTH stimulation test in the morning of Day 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is the evaluation of safety/tolerability based on clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
