  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of intravenous thrombolysis has greatly improved the rate of recanalization&#xD;
      and reperfusion in patients with acute ischemic stroke, increasing the proportion of patients&#xD;
      with good outcome and reduced mortality. The guideline recommends that patients with ischemic&#xD;
      stroke should be treated with intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5 hours. The latest&#xD;
      meta-analysis found that ischemic stroke with onset time of 4.5-9 hours with infarction core&#xD;
      volume &lt;70ml, ischemic penumbra volume &gt;10ml, and hypoperfusion volume / infarction core&#xD;
      volume &gt;1.2 could be benefit from intravenous thrombolysis. The DAWN clinical trial has shown&#xD;
      that patients with ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion with onset time of 6-24 hours&#xD;
      could be benefit from endovascular treatment after screening by multi-mode imaging.&#xD;
      Therefore, we hypothesize that patients with ischemic stroke with onset time of 4.5-24 hours&#xD;
      with a definite penumbra may also benefit from intravenous thrombolysis. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to explore whether the patients with ischemic stroke with onset time of 4.5-24 hours&#xD;
      can benefit from intravenous thrombolysis if they meet the standard of CT perfusion&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In recent years, the development of intravenous thrombolysis has greatly improved the rate of&#xD;
      recanalization and reperfusion in patients with acute ischemic stroke, increasing the&#xD;
      proportion of patients with good outcome and reduced mortality. The guideline recommends that&#xD;
      patients with ischemic stroke should be treated with intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5&#xD;
      hours. The latest meta-analysis found that ischemic stroke with onset time of 4.5-9 hours&#xD;
      with infarction core volume &lt;70ml, ischemic penumbra volume &gt;10ml, and hypoperfusion volume /&#xD;
      infarction core volume &gt;1.2 could be benefit from intravenous thrombolysis (the ratio of mRS&#xD;
      0-1 in 3 months, thrombolysis vs non thrombolysis: 35.4% vs 29.5%). Thus, the time window is&#xD;
      not an absolute constant indicator. In theory, compared with time window, the physiological&#xD;
      window based on the concept of ischemic penumbra is more reasonable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, the AHA/ASA guidelines recommended that patients with ischemic stroke with large&#xD;
      vessel occlusion should receive endovascular treatment within 6 hours. The DAWN clinical&#xD;
      trial has shown that patients with ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion with onset&#xD;
      time of 6-24 hours could be benefit from endovascular treatment after screening by multi-mode&#xD;
      imaging (CT perfusion or MR perfusion). As a result, the 2018 AHA/ASA guidelines extended the&#xD;
      endovascular treatment window to 24 hours for patients with large vessel occlusion stroke&#xD;
      that meet the standard of perfusion. Therefore, we hypothesize that patients with ischemic&#xD;
      stroke with onset time of 4.5-24 hours with a definite penumbra may also benefit from&#xD;
      intravenous thrombolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore whether the patients with ischemic stroke with&#xD;
      onset time of 4.5-24 hours can benefit from intravenous thrombolysis if they meet the&#xD;
      standard of CT perfusion screening (infarction core volume &lt;70ml, ischemic penumbra volume&#xD;
      &gt;10ml, and hypoperfusion volume / infarction core volume &gt;1.2).&#xD;
