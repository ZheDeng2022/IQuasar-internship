      Context: CEMENT PBS CIMMO DTA® has physical and biological properties that classify it as a&#xD;
      biocompatible material and inducer of biomineralization, attributes that qualify it as&#xD;
      material as an indirect pulp capper in permanent tooth restorations. Objective: The present&#xD;
      clinical study proposes the use of PBS CIMMO DTA® cement as an indirect pulp capper, in resin&#xD;
      restorations composed of permanent molars and premolars. The objective was to minimize&#xD;
      postoperative sensitivity arising from restorative procedures. Method: Randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial with two arms, double blind, interventional, prospective. The sample consisted of 20&#xD;
      male patients, with an average age of 20 years. Totaling 70 teeth to be treated. The teeth&#xD;
      were divided into two groups: Group R (Control Group, n = 35), treated with a standard&#xD;
      restorative procedure. Group D (Study group n = 35), treated using CEMENT PBS CIMMO DTA®, as&#xD;
      an indirect capper of the pulp wall. The evaluation was carried out by a masked examiner for&#xD;
      both groups. Sensitivity tests were performed before the restorative procedure, at 48 hours,&#xD;
      7, 15 and 30 days after the procedure. The analysis included pain caused by thermal stimuli:&#xD;
      Cold Test (TM); horizontal (TPH) and vertical (TPV) percussion; Bite Test (TM) and Pain&#xD;
      Decline Time (DD) was measured. Measured using Visual Analog Scale (EVA).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The present study is a clinical trial: an intervention model, prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind (patients and evaluator). It was held at the Dental Office of the 14th Field&#xD;
      Artillery Group - Pouso Alegre (MG), Military Organization of the Brazilian Army in&#xD;
      conjunction with the University of Vale do Sapucaí (UNIVÁS), Pouso Alegre, Minas Gerais,&#xD;
      Brazil; in the period from 23 March 2020 to 18 January 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were initially evaluated according to the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria&#xD;
      of the research. Clinical examinations were performed initially using a mouth mirror,&#xD;
      explorer probe (Golgran®, São Caetano do Sul, SP, Brazil). The data were recorded on clinical&#xD;
      records for screening. The radiographic examination included performing periapical&#xD;
      radiographs as diagnostic aids, for participants who met the inclusion criteria during the&#xD;
      clinical examination. Oral hygiene guidelines were provided to all research participants. To&#xD;
      begin the service, an anamnesis form was filled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization occurred after applying the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria of the&#xD;
      patients, 20 were selected, according to the initial clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 20 patients were randomized and the random sequence for submission to radiographic&#xD;
      examinations was determined, defining 70 teeth to be treated, within the study criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for the group that each tooth would belong to; 70 brown envelopes were made: 35 containing&#xD;
      green paper, belonging to the standard restorative procedure group and 35 containing pink&#xD;
      paper, belonging to the DTA® group. Before starting the procedure for each tooth, the patient&#xD;
      was asked to choose the envelope. Thus, the sequence of treatments was determined. The&#xD;
      envelopes chosen for each treatment were discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The teeth grouped in group R were treated with composite resin restoration without liner&#xD;
      material, considered a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The teeth grouped in group D received PBS CIMMO DTA® as indirect capping material of the&#xD;
      cavity, followed by restoration of composite resin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the restorative treatment, dental sensitivity assessment was performed: Cold&#xD;
      test: Using cotton in Cremer® balls, safe in clinical forceps (Duflex®), cooled with&#xD;
      fluorethane gas, applied over the buccal surface of the tooth for 15s or until patient&#xD;
      indicates painful sensation (Endo Ice® Spray, Maquira), for the Cold Test. The time from the&#xD;
      beginning of the stimulus until its disappearance was counted (Time of Decline of pain).&#xD;
      Percussion test: With the aid of the mouth mirror handle (Duflex®), the tooth was touched&#xD;
      with light &quot;taps&quot;, in the occlusal-apical and vestibule-lingual / vestibule-palate&#xD;
      directions. Masticatory strength test: The patient performed masticatory movements under a&#xD;
      bite device (Indusbello®, Londrina, PR, Brazil). The patient's perceptions of sensitivity&#xD;
      were checked on a scale from 0 to 10 using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restorative procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pumice prophylaxis (SS White®, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) and water were initially performed&#xD;
      in order to remove residues and / or dental biofilm. Proceeding to the stage of topical&#xD;
      anesthesia (Benzotop® 200mg, DFL, Jacarepaguá, RJ, Brazil), followed by local infiltrative&#xD;
      anesthesia (Alphacaine® 2% DFL, Jacarepaguá, RJ, Brazil) and absolute isolation of the&#xD;
      operative field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that the absolute isolation was performed prior to the cavity preparation,&#xD;
      following the sanitary rules (Covid 19), to contain aerosols caused by the use of high speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operative procedure was performed initially with spherical diamond tips (KG® Sorensen,&#xD;
      Cotia, SP, Brazil) numbering compatible with the carious lesion (1011, 1012, 1013, 1014,&#xD;
      1016), until reaching the caries carefully, so as not to remove structure healthy dental.&#xD;
      Then, carbide steel spherical drills, numbering compatible with the lesion, no. 2, 4 or 6 (KG&#xD;
      Sorensen®, Cotia, SP, Brazil) were used at low speed (Contra-angle, Kavo®, Joinville, PR,&#xD;
      Brazil) to remove carious tissue. Each diamond tip and Carbide drill was used a maximum of 4&#xD;
      times, after which they were discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For restorations that needed to restore the shape of the proximal walls, wedges, preformed&#xD;
      metal matrices and staples (Unimatrix®, TDV Pomerode-SC-Brasil) were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the cavities were restored, as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group R teeth, the following operative step was performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditioning with 37% phosphoric acid (Condac® 37, FGM, Joinville, SC, Brazil) was performed&#xD;
      for 30 seconds on enamel and 15 seconds on dentin. Then the cavity was washed with the aid of&#xD;
      a triple syringe using an air / water jet for 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cavities received the restorative system composed of the Adper Single Bond2® adhesive,&#xD;
      and the nano-particulate resin Filtek Z350XT® (3M ESPE Dental Products TM, St. Paul, MN,&#xD;
      USA). The dentin substrate was left slightly moist, with the aid of cotton in Cremer® balls.&#xD;
      Adhesive material was used, using a Cavibrush® microbrush brush, FGM, Joinville, SC, Brazil),&#xD;
      strictly following the manufacturer's rules, used for this purpose; saturated for each&#xD;
      covering, two consecutive layers of the enamel and dentin adhesive were applied, waited 30&#xD;
      seconds, continued with light air jets for 5 seconds and then the photoactivation was&#xD;
      performed for 10 seconds with LED (Poly® Wireless , Kavo, Joinville-SC-Brazil), with a power&#xD;
      of 600 ± 50 mW / cm².&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restorations were performed using the composite resin Filtek Z350 XT® (3M ESPE Dental&#xD;
      Products TM, St. Paul, MN, USA) using the incremental oblique technique, in increments of a&#xD;
      maximum of 2 mm in thickness, and each increment was photoactivated by 20 seconds, with LED&#xD;
      (Poly® Wireless, Kavo, Joinville, SC, Brazil) final polymerization for 40s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the restorations were completed, absolute isolation was removed, then the sculpture was&#xD;
      refined and occlusal adjustment was carried out, immediate finishing with thin diamond tips&#xD;
      number 2135F, 3118F and 3195F (KG Sorensen®, Cotia, SP, Brazil), depending of the restored&#xD;
      anatomical region. Polishing was carried out with abrasive silicone polishers for resins&#xD;
      (Microdont®, Camanducaia, SP-Brazil) in medium (yellow) and superfine (white) granules and&#xD;
      felt disc (Diamond®, FGM) with diamond paste (Diamond Excel® , FGM, Joinville, SC, Brazil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group D teeth, the same restorative step was also carried out, but prior to the acid&#xD;
      conditioning step, PBS CIMMO DTA® cement was applied as a base for the dental cavity,&#xD;
      following the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PBS CIMMO DTA® Cement was handled in a sterile glass plate and spatula 24 (Duflex®), a&#xD;
      portion of the cement powder and a drop of distilled water were dispensed (1: 1 ratio). Then,&#xD;
      the manipulated material was inserted, with the aid of a dentin spoon (Duflex®), to the pulp&#xD;
      wall of the cavity preparation. Using clinical forceps (Duflex®) and cotton in Cremer® balls,&#xD;
      the cement was condensed at the bottom of the cavity, obtaining adaptation and removing&#xD;
      excess moisture. Then, acid conditioning, adhesive application, restorative technique and&#xD;
      polishing were performed as previously recommended for group R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research participants had their personal records, anamnesis, as well as the type of&#xD;
      treatment proposed inserted in a clinical form. However, only the operator, who performed the&#xD;
      restorative procedures, had access to them. In another form, the values obtained in the&#xD;
      Sensitivity Tests at 5 different moments were noted. The first tests, performed in the&#xD;
      preoperative period and the others in the postoperative period. The evaluations were&#xD;
      performed by a single examiner, trained by the researcher and not involved with the&#xD;
      restorative procedures. The evaluations were noted on a specific form (Appendix B). The&#xD;
      examiner was kept blind in all assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is noteworthy that: due to the health requirements imposed by the pandemic Covid 19, the&#xD;
      evaluations were carried out by a single evaluator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity tests were performed before the restorative procedure, at 48 hours, 7, 15 and 30&#xD;
      days post-procedures. The analysis included: pain caused by thermal stimuli, percussion and&#xD;
      bite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the thermal test, cotton was used in Cremer® balls, secured by clinical forceps&#xD;
      (Duflex®), cooled with fluorethane gas (Endo Ice® Spray, Maquira) and applied over the buccal&#xD;
      surface of the treated tooth, for 15s or even the patient indicates painful sensation. In the&#xD;
      percussion test, with the aid of the mouth mirror handle (Duflex®), touches were made on the&#xD;
      tooth with light &quot;taps&quot;, in the occlusal-apical and vestibule-lingual / vestibule-palate&#xD;
      directions. For the test of masticatory forces, the patient performed masticatory movements&#xD;
      under a bite device (Indusbello®, Londrina, PR, Brazil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients received a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (AMARAL and CALASANS, 2013) (Figure 1).&#xD;
      Sensitivity perceptions were cataloged from 0 to 10. The scores determined were: 0 no pain, 1&#xD;
      to 2 mild pain, 3 to 5 moderate pain, 6 to 7 moderate pain slightly worse, 8 to 9 severe&#xD;
      pain, 10 maximum pain .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyzes were tabulated in Microsoft exel and sent for statistical procedures.&#xD;
