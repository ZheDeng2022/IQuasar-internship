  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both behavioral, psychological, and cognitive differences related to social cognitive&#xD;
      function have been related to illness-state in eating disorders, but interventions that&#xD;
      directly target these problems are limited. This pilot intervention explores whether a brief&#xD;
      art-therapy team-building intervention coupled with psychoeducation about social behavior can&#xD;
      change self-concept or clinical symptoms in patients with eating disorders. Participants will&#xD;
      complete pre-treatment assessments related to social behaviors and clinical symptoms, attend&#xD;
      four two-hour group sessions, and provide two follow-up post-treatment assessments at 1-4&#xD;
      weeks after the treatment and 3-5 months later. Comparisons between the pre-intervention data&#xD;
      and the first follow-up will be the primary outcome measures. The primary hypotheses are that&#xD;
      participants will show increases in self-esteem and positive self-attributions and decreases&#xD;
      in eating disorder symptoms after the intervention. The secondary hypothesis is that other&#xD;
      clinical symptoms (depression, anxiety) will be improved after the intervention. Feedback&#xD;
      from participants about their experience with the study will assess perceived benefits as&#xD;
      well as acquisition of the psychoeducation targets.&#xD;

      This project will recruit subjects with eating disorders in the Dallas Fort Worth area.&#xD;
      Pre-assessment measures of anxiety, self-esteem, depression, eating disorder symptoms, and&#xD;
      attributional style will be completed before the intervention. Participants attend four&#xD;
      weekly sessions of a group psychoeducational intervention. The intervention includes an art&#xD;
      therapy experiential activity, psychoeducation on social function, reflection and discussion&#xD;
      of sample videos and scripts, homework assignments, and guided discussions. Post-assessments&#xD;
      will be completed 1-4 weeks and 3-5 months after the interventions is completed.&#xD;
