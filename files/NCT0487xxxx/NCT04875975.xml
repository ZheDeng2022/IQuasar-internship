    <time_frame>From Baseline until the end of the Treatment Period (Week 25)</time_frame>
    <description>The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) consists of 12 subtests that contribute to 5 age-based domain index scores (immediate memory, visuospatial, language, attention, delayed memory) that are aggregated for a total scale index score. Higher scores reflect better neurocognitive performance.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of participants who required rescue medication due to an absence or loss of clinical benefit during the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until the end of the Treatment Period (Week 25)</time_frame>
    <description>Study participants who require rescue medication due to an absence or loss of clinical benefit will discontinue blinded treatment, and complete the assessments for the Early Discontinuation Visit.</description>

    <measure>Time to first occurrence of seizure freedom during the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until the end of the Treatment Period (Week 25)</time_frame>
    <description>The time to first occurrence of seizure freedom (TTFSF) is defined by the number of days after randomization to the first day of the first 28 consecutive days without seizures during the Treatment Period</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until the End of Study Visit (Week 32)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
