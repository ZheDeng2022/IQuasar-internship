  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project's significance includes a big cohort of Autism spectrum disorder (ASD),&#xD;
      originality/novelty (new approaches and technologies including next-generation sequencing,&#xD;
      multi-echo functional MRI, metabolomics, microbiomics, and machine learning), and the&#xD;
      integration of multi-dimentional measures. With the accomplishment of this project, we will&#xD;
      establish the most comprehensive ASD bio-bank in Asia, develop ASD NGS panel, identify&#xD;
      several ASD biomarkers, publish at least 15 SCI papers in total, and in the end, have patents&#xD;
      registration and technology transfer of our precise objective, automated assessment system&#xD;
      for ASD. Our findings will further advance our understanding of ASD, ultimately contribute to&#xD;
      the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of ASD, and be the first step of precise&#xD;
      medicine for ASD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder with&#xD;
      high genetic and clinical heterogeneity. Due to its high prevalence, long-term impairment,&#xD;
      unclear etiologies, and a lack of effective detection, prevention and biological treatment&#xD;
      for this disorder, this catastrophic disorder has been prioritized for molecular genetic and&#xD;
      brain research. The main PI Gau has established a cohort of more than 900 ASD probands and&#xD;
      their families with clinical, neuropsychological, image, and genetic data. With the advance&#xD;
      in digit health, this integrated project aims to develop and potentially commercialize an&#xD;
      objective, automated assessment system for early diagnosis of ASD based on the clinical,&#xD;
      behavioral, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, genetic (whole exome sequencing, WES),&#xD;
      metabolomics, and microbiomics data of probands with ASD and typically developing&#xD;
      controls(TDC) without ASD&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 3-year, 5 subprojects (SP) project is based on an existing big cohort of &gt; 900 ASD&#xD;
      probands and their families with high-quality genetic data, clinical diagnoses, symptoms,&#xD;
      psychopathology, social functions, neuropsychological functions (n= 600 for CPT, 300 for&#xD;
      CANTAB), and structural and functional images (n=196), data. Due to a limited budget, SP1&#xD;
      will only select 360 ASD (ages 4-25 years old) and 90 TDC for this integrated project. SP1&#xD;
      will check the quality and presence of the data followed by recollecting DNAs of 100 ASD, MRI&#xD;
      data of 205 ASD (360-196=164, 164/0.8(successful rate)=205), and CANTAB of 60 ASD to have a&#xD;
      complete dataset of clinical/phenotype/neurocognition/image measures. SP1 will prepare DNAs&#xD;
      for SP2's WES analyses; and will collect serum and stool of 360 ASD and 90 TDC and provide&#xD;
      these samples to SP3 and SP4 for metabolomics and microbiomics analyses, respectively. All&#xD;
      the data collected and results generated from SP1-4 will be saved and managed in the ASD bank&#xD;
      (SP1, main PI) and analyzed by SP5 using AI machine learning to develop the precise objective&#xD;
      automatic assessment platform for ASD. The topics of the five subprojects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subproject 1. Establishing the standard procedure for data collection and clinical-biological&#xD;
      bank of autism spectrum disorder including clinical, behavioral, cognitive, neuroimaging,&#xD;
      genetic, and biological data Subproject 2. Deciphering genetic cause in autistic spectrum&#xD;
      disorder using whole exome sequencing Subproject 3. Metabolomics investigation of Autism&#xD;
      Spectrum Disorder Subproject 4. Intestinal microbiota and disease outcome in children with&#xD;
      autism spectrum disorder Subproject 5. A computerized assessment system from genome,&#xD;
      gut-brain, and metabolic mechanisms&#xD;
