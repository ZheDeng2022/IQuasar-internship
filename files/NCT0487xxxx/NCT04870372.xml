    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, single-arm 8-week investigation of Selegiline. Subjects&#xD;
      who have a diagnosis of PD based on UK brain bank criteria with ESS&gt; 7 will be received&#xD;
      Selegiline as an adjunctive therapy or monotherapy. This study will assess the impact of&#xD;
      Selegiline treatment on the severity of sleep disturbances among PD patients.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be received Selegiline.The study medication dosage will be escalated from 5mg/daily to the target dose(5~10mg/daily) in 2 weeks and then maintained for the remaining 6 weeks.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive one Selegiline tablet (5 mg) per day administered at breakfast. The initial dose of Selegiline is 5 mg/day and be up-titrated in 2-week intervals in increments of 5 mg up to 10 mg (which can be taken at breakfast or divided doses of 5 mg each taken at breakfast and lunch) according to the investigator's judgment, based on individual clinical response and tolerability.</description>
