    <textblock>
      The anatomical changes of the upper airway in a standing vs pseudo-supine position using&#xD;
      Carestream Orthodontic Imaging (Volumetric) and Carestream Orthodontic Imaging module (AP&#xD;
      measurements) of the patient's airway respectively, have been taken and the obtained results&#xD;
      compared. In order to simulate the supine position, patients are placed in a supine position&#xD;
      (180 degrees) in a dental exam chair, and asked to relax their lower jaw, allowing it to drop&#xD;
      back, simulating their jaw falling back while sleeping. That bite is then captured with a&#xD;
      Correct Plus™ Impression Material Superfast. Once the bite material hardens, it locks the&#xD;
      bite in place. The patient then stands upright, and CBCT is taken standing while the jaw&#xD;
      placement is still pseudo sleep-supine, supported by the bite material.&#xD;
