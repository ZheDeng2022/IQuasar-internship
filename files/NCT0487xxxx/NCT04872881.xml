  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tracheostomy is a vital procedure in the ICU to maintain the airway and prevent complications&#xD;
      that may occur due to intubation. It helps reduce the dead space volume, airway resistance&#xD;
      and provides comfort to the patients during the weaning from mechanical ventilation. Two&#xD;
      methods are widely used in Percutaneous Dilatational Tracheostomy (PDT): The multiple&#xD;
      dilation method (Ciaglia) and the Griggs method.Griggs method will be used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Griggs Method: A 10-15 millimeter skin incision is made between the level of the&#xD;
      second-third tracheal rings. The location of the needle is confirmed by entering the trachea&#xD;
      with an injector filled with 2-3 mL saline from the midline and aspirating air. A J-tipped&#xD;
      guidewire is advanced through the needle and the needle is removed. A special forceps with a&#xD;
      channel at the tip, through which the guidewire can pass is used in this method. The forceps&#xD;
      advanced through the guidewire and then subcutaneous tissues and trachea are dilated in one&#xD;
      or two steps. When the stoma is large enough to insert the cannula, it is placed in the&#xD;
      trachea and fixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will undergo tracheostomy in the ICU will be included in the study and randomly&#xD;
      assigned into two groups. Two different methods, endotracheal tube (ET) or laryngeal mask&#xD;
      (LMA), will be used during the tracheostomy for airway management. In both methods,&#xD;
      fiberoptic bronchoscopy will assist the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers aim to compare the two airway management methods in terms of complications,&#xD;
      procedure time, and the number of staff needed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Protection of the airway during percutaneous tracheostomy can be achieved with an&#xD;
      endotracheal tube (ETT) or laryngeal mask (LMA).Researchers aimed to compare the use of ETT&#xD;
      and LMA in this prospective, randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple blood gas analyses will be performed during the procedure. Airway failure rates,&#xD;
      total procedure time, the occurrence of gastric distension and regurgitation, number of staff&#xD;
      needed, complications (Hypercarbia, hypoxia, etc.), and hemodynamic parameters (Non-invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure, pulse oximeter, electrocardiogram) will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into two groups with simple randomization. A-priori study with 14&#xD;
      patients suggested 52 patients are needed for statistical significance (G*Power 3.1 software&#xD;
      was used). Patients will be reviewed for suitability for procedure as stated in the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Patients and/or relatives will be informed about the study and informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained. Invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring of the patients will be&#xD;
      available. Before the procedure, the patients' fasting period for 6 hours will be completed&#xD;
      and the nasogastric catheter will be removed. Arterial blood gas sample will be checked&#xD;
      before the procedure begins. By placing a transverse elevation under the shoulders, the&#xD;
      patients' neck will be extended as appropriate. Patients will be positioned after induction&#xD;
      with 2 mg/kg propofol, 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium, and 1 mcg/kg fentanyl IV, and positioning time&#xD;
      will be recorded. Propofol infusion at the dose of 6 mg/kg/hour will be started.&#xD;
      Electrocautery will be available. Patients will be mechanically ventilated with a controlled&#xD;
      mode (CMV) with 7ml/kg tidal volume, 15/min frequency, and 5 cmH2O PEEP. Preoxygenation will&#xD;
      be made with 100% FiO2 for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETT Group: ETT will be repositioned with direct laryngoscopy (ETT cuff will be inflated just&#xD;
      above the vocal cords). &quot;The Reposition Time&quot; will start with the cuff deflation and end with&#xD;
      successful ventilation after repositioning. If the ETT can not be repositioned within 5&#xD;
      minutes, it will be considered as a &quot;Failed Airway&quot; and tracheostomy will be continued with&#xD;
      the usual method (ETT cuff will be inflated under the vocal cords).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LMA Group: After selecting the appropriate LMA size for the patient, the ET Tube will be&#xD;
      removed and the LMA will be inserted. &quot;The LMA Insertion Time&quot; will start with the cuff&#xD;
      deflation of the ETT and end with successful ventilation after LMA insertion. If the LMA&#xD;
      cannot be inserted in 3 attempts, it will be considered as a &quot;Failed Airway&quot; and tracheostomy&#xD;
      will be continued with the usual method (ETT cuff will be inflated under the vocal cords).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the ventilation is provided, arterial blood gas samples will be analyzed at the 3rd,&#xD;
      6th, and 10th minutes and every 5 minutes afterward until the end of the procedure. In both&#xD;
      groups, fiberoptic bronchoscopy will assist the procedure and &quot;Duration of the Confirmation&#xD;
      of the Incision Site&quot; will be noted. The bronchoscopy period will start when the physician&#xD;
      who will perform the bronchoscope takes the bronchoscope in his hand and ends with the&#xD;
      confirmation of the incision site. The area will be cleaned with iodide skin antiseptic,&#xD;
      covered with a sterile cover, and surgical tools and tracheostomy kit will be prepared for&#xD;
      the procedure. This will be recorded as &quot;Preparation Time&quot;. Tracheostomy will preferably be&#xD;
      performed between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage rings but one upper or lower level will be used&#xD;
      if needed (per patients' anatomy). Local anesthesia will be applied for the incision site&#xD;
      with 4 ml of local anesthetic solution containing %2 lidocaine and %0,00125 epinephrine.&#xD;
      &quot;Procedure Time&quot; will start with skin incision and end with successful ventilation after the&#xD;
      tracheostomy cannula cuff is inflated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric distension, hypoxia, regurgitation, hemodynamic parameters (every 3 minutes),&#xD;
      complications, and the number of staff will be recorded. When the tracheostomy cannula is&#xD;
      placed and the patient is ventilated, the procedure will be terminated and confirmed with an&#xD;
      anteroposterior chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 24) was used for statistical&#xD;
      calculation. Parametric test results were reported as mean and standard deviation and&#xD;
      non-parametric test results as number and percentage or median and interquartile range. The&#xD;
      compliance of the data to normal distribution was determined by the single sample&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normally distributed quantitative data were compared with the&#xD;
      independent sample T-Test, quantitative data that did not follow normal distribution were&#xD;
      compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. A Chi-square test was used to compare qualitative&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance level was determined as p &lt;0.05 at the 95% confidence interval for the&#xD;
      analyzes.&#xD;
