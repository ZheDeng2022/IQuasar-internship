  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with severe chronic pulmonary disease often life isolated with a high burden of&#xD;
      symptoms. Nutritional risk and low quality of life are common, and both associated with&#xD;
      increased societal cost and poor prognosis. COPD is a complex and progressive disease with&#xD;
      changing clinical states that influences nutritional status and quality of life in different&#xD;
      ways. The primary aim is to improve quality of life for individuals with severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 individuals are recruited from the outpatient clinic at Nordsjællands Hospital in Denmark&#xD;
      to a randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups (intervention and control). The&#xD;
      intervention will last for 12 weeks comprising four dimensions including nutritional plan,&#xD;
      regular contact, informal caregiver/friendly reminder and a weight dairy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that the intervention will improve quality of life, nutritional status and&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;

    <description>Measured using the FRAILscale. The FRAILscale contains five categories including Fatigue (F): is the participant tired, Resistance (R): Does the participant experience difficulty walking up one flight of stairs, Ambulation (A): Does the participant experience difficulty walking 200 meters, Illnesses (I): Does the participant have more than five illnesses, Loss of weight (L): Has the participant lost more than 5% weight within the last year. Each question is answered with &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. &quot;No&quot; gives 0 points and &quot;Yes&quot; gives 1 point. For a total score of 0,1-2 and 3-5 the participant is categorized as &quot;robust&quot;, &quot;pre-frail&quot; and &quot;frail&quot;, respectively.</description>

    <description>The four dimensions of MINDNUT are described below:&#xD;
Nutritional plan: is conducted in collaboration with the participant based on nutritional registration and information about routines and habits to reach a daily protein target of 1.5 g/kg/day. The nutritional plan is adjusted at the regular contact, and nutritional supplementation will be handed out to the participant.&#xD;
Friendly reminder/informal caregiver: is a friendly reminder that encourage the participant to follow the nutritional plan and to ask for support (a note to hang on the refrigerator). The informal caregiver is a person with close contact to the participant.&#xD;
Regular contacts: The participant will be contacted on regular basis (with an interval of 7-14 days) via phone and besides nutritional plan, this conversation will be used to talk about well-being, compliance and potential side-effects.&#xD;
Weight diary: participants is instructed in keeping a weight diary which include registration of a daily weight.</description>
