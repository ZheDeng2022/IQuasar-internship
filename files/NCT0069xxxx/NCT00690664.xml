      The purpose of this research study is to better understand African American hair and scalp,&#xD;
      its biologic appearance and how this relates to African Americans' perceptions of their hair&#xD;
      and scalp health. Since most hair studies have looked at Caucasian hair and scalp, we will&#xD;
      use a population of Caucasian subjects for comparison in evaluating various hair and scalp&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
