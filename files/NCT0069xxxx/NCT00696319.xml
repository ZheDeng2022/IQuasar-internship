      The study that is registered in ClinicalTrials is a part study of an overall study with the&#xD;
      title 'Dynamic stability of the ACL-injured knee'. The aim of the overall study is to&#xD;
      prospectively follow a cohort of newly injured patients with total rupture of the anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament in the knee, in order to document results from different rehabilitation&#xD;
      regimes after the injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The title of the part study is 'Neuromuscular changes in ACL-deficient individuals before and&#xD;
      after an intensive perturbation training program. A case-control study.' The aims of the part&#xD;
      study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe muscle activation patterns, joint angles and forces during gait and&#xD;
           one-legged hop in newly injured ACL-deficient individuals before and after execution of&#xD;
           an intensive training program consisting of either perturbation training or conventional&#xD;
           balance- and stability training&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe eventual changes between the two groups that may indicate superiority of&#xD;
           either one of the methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 25 subjects in each group. The intervention consists of two different&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocols for neuromuscular training. Subjects will be tested in a&#xD;
      biomechanical laboratory before and after intervention, with use of 3D camera systems, force&#xD;
      plates and electromyographic measurements (EMG). Main outcomes are eventual differences in&#xD;
      muscle activation patterns, joint angles and forces during selected phases of walking and&#xD;
      one-legged hopping. Secondary outcomes of interest are self-assessment of knee function,&#xD;
      isokinetic strength and functional one-legged hop tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status: Inclusion to the main study started in January 2007. Data collection for the&#xD;
      case-control part study will take place in 2008-2009. The part study study should be finished&#xD;
      in 2010, where results will be included in a PhD dissertation. The PhD student responsible,&#xD;
      Ingrid Eitzen, is enrolled in the Doctoral program at the Faculty of Medicine, University of&#xD;
      Oslo. She is employed at Orthopaedic Centre, Ullevaal University Hospital and part of The&#xD;
      Norwegian Research Center for Active Rehabilitation (NAR). The project is included in the NAR&#xD;
      research program. In addition, the overall study is organized as a formalized collaboration&#xD;
      with the University of Delaware, US, where they also will follow a cohort of 150 subjects.&#xD;

      The study 'Dynamic stability of the ACL-injured knee' is carried out as part of a formalized&#xD;
      research collaboration between the University of Delaware, US, and NAR, Orthopaedic Centre,&#xD;
      Ullevaal University Hospital, Norway. The project is funded by National Institutes of Health.&#xD;
      150 patients, both men and women, aged between 13-55 years, will over a three year-period be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Follow-up time is 2 years. A part-study will have a case-control&#xD;
      design and include 50 of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Norway, approximately 4000 persons rupture their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)per year.&#xD;
      The majority of these individuals are relatively young people, engaged in various physical&#xD;
      activities. Most ACL-ruptures occur within pivoting sports like soccer, team handball,&#xD;
      floorball, basketball and volleyball, but also within racket sports, ice-hockey,&#xD;
      dance/gymnastics and alpine skiing. A ruptured ACL is a serious injury for the individual,&#xD;
      who often experiences exclusion form both work, leisure activities and sports for potentially&#xD;
      a long period of time. A considerable number of the patients will not be able to return to&#xD;
      their pre-injury activity level, and many will also experience long time consequences, the&#xD;
      most serious of these being development of knee osteoarthritis(OA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The function of the injured knee varies considerably among patients with a torn ACL. Some are&#xD;
      able to stabilize their knees even during demanding activities and sports, while others&#xD;
      experience frequent episodes of giving way, also following daily activities. Currently, there&#xD;
      is little consensus regarding the optimal rehabilitation program following ACL injury and/or&#xD;
      criteria for ACL-reconstruction. But, whether managed operatively or non-operatively, a full&#xD;
      return to pre-injury activities after ACL rupture is always dependent on the development of&#xD;
      dynamic knee stability. In the past 10-15 years, a test battery consisting of standardised&#xD;
      and validated tests for screening and classification of newly injured ACL-patients has been&#xD;
      developed. The test battery includes four different functional one-legged hop tests, two&#xD;
      questionnaires on knee function and self-evaluation of knee status in the form of a global&#xD;
      rating. The questionnaires included are The Knee Outcome Survey - Activities of Daily Living&#xD;
      (KOS-ADL), and The International Knee Documentation Subjective Knee Form (IKDC 2000). In&#xD;
      addition, we measure the laxity between the tibia and femur with KT1000, register eventual&#xD;
      number of episodes of giving way and perform isokinetic strength measurements of the&#xD;
      quadriceps and hamstrings muscles with a Biodex6000 system. Based on these tests, all newly&#xD;
      diagnosed patients with an ACL-rupture may be classified according to whether they have good&#xD;
      or poor dynamic stability. Those with 80% or more performance on the injured leg compared to&#xD;
      the non-injured leg on all hop tests, who score 80 or more in KOS-ADL, who rate themselves to&#xD;
      a score of at least 60 on the global rating and have experienced maximum one episode of&#xD;
      giving way, are categorized as potential copers. Those who score below these limits and/or&#xD;
      have experienced two or more episodes of giving way are categorized as non-copers. In Norway,&#xD;
      approximately 50% of all ACL-injured individuals go through reconstructive surgery. The&#xD;
      optimal time to decide whether surgery is the best treatment option or not is highly&#xD;
      individual, but recent research has demonstrated that the functional status of the knee at&#xD;
      the time of eventual surgery is more important than the time span since the date of injury.&#xD;
      Reconstructive surgery will to a large degree re-establish the mechanical stability of the&#xD;
      knee, but has not been proven to provide sufficient dynamical stability or make the patient&#xD;
      able to return to his/hers pre-injury activity level. It can at present time neither be&#xD;
      documented that reconstructive ACL-surgery reduces the risk of later development of knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several questions remain that will affect the development of effective rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs for patients after ACL rupture. Validated practice guidelines for patients after ACL&#xD;
      injury that discriminate between surgical and non-surgical candidates, lead to a return to&#xD;
      pre-injury activities, and protect future joint health have not been reported. The&#xD;
      case-control part study will aim specifically to investigate the effectiveness of two&#xD;
      different protocols for neuromuscular training, with before- and after intervention data&#xD;
      collection in a biomechanical laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the overall study (inclusive the part study) will allow us to extend our&#xD;
      previous findings and will provide information that is needed to identify and treat&#xD;
      individuals with ACL rupture across the spectrum of compensation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
