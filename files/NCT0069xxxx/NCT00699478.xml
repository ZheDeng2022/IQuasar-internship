  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pernicious anemia develops in 50% of total gastrectomized due to gastric cancer patients.&#xD;
      Lack of intrinsic factor, which is secreted by parietal cell from stomach wall causes&#xD;
      deficiency of cobalamin, which, in final, causes pernicious anemia. Thus, patients who had&#xD;
      undergone total gastrectomy needs to be provided externally with cobalamin. Until now,&#xD;
      intramuscular injection of cyanocobalamin has been the choice of treatment for cobalamin&#xD;
      deficiency, but it has demerits in that it causes discomfort of coming to the hospital to get&#xD;
      an injection, and in its high costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in pernicious anemia in old age and absorption disorder patients, it has been&#xD;
      reported that oral administration of cobalamin had effect of elevating serum vitamin B12.&#xD;
      Thus, this study was designed to prove the effect of oral administration of vitamin B12 in&#xD;
      total gastrectomized patients with cobalamin deficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin B 12 is important for hexane synthesis. Its deficiency causes pernicious anemia and&#xD;
      abnormal functioning neurons. It is not synthesized intrinsically, and extrinsic supplement&#xD;
      is vital. Vitamin B 12 is known to be abundant in meat and dairies. It is usually absorbed in&#xD;
      form of cobalamin and forms a complex with R binder, decomposed in duodenum, again form a&#xD;
      complex with intrinsic factor, and finally absorbed in terminal ileum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this process, intrinsic factor takes a major role, but when total gastrectomized,&#xD;
      absorption of cobalamin is impossible theoretically, because intrinsic factor is known to be&#xD;
      produced only from mucosa of the stomach. Thus,deficiency of vitamin B 12 develops, which&#xD;
      causes clinical symptoms of pernicious anemia and neurological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total gastrectomy for cure of upper body cancer of stomach is gradually growing in Korea and&#xD;
      Japan, and more than 50% of the patients are reported to have deficiency of vitamin B12.&#xD;
      Pernicious anemia and irreversible neurologic disorder can develop, thus supplementing the&#xD;
      vitamin is an important treatment for the patient. However, the protocol in supplementation&#xD;
      has not been exhibited as yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reported as now in Korea, after average six months postoperation, decrease of vitamin B12 was&#xD;
      seen, and it is recommended that injection of Actinamide monthly after six months for&#xD;
      supplementation should be the protocol for total gastrectomized patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intramuscular injection of Actinamide is the choice of treatment for vitamin B12 deficiency&#xD;
      for total gastrectomized patient. However, having to visit hospital and the high cost of&#xD;
      intramuscular vitamin B12 is a big burden for the patients. Van Walraven et al. from Canada&#xD;
      reported in 2001, that when comparing the cost for oral supplementation of vitamin B12 with&#xD;
      intramuscular injection, the difference of cost could rise up to 2 billion dollars. Oral&#xD;
      supplementation of vitamin B12 is simple to use, can lower the number of hospital visits, and&#xD;
      lessen the injection related complications, and thus improve the quality of life of the&#xD;
      patient and bring reduction of medical expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, effect of oral supplementation of vitamin B12 has not been studied in Korea. In&#xD;
      Japan, Adachi et al. has reported that oral supplementation has effects on total&#xD;
      gastrectomized patients, although its mechanism was not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on oral supplementation of vitamin B12 for total gastrectomized patient are rare,&#xD;
      thus this study was aimed to prove the effect of oral vitamin B12 in total gastrectomized&#xD;
      patients, and to establish a protocol for postoperation follow up.&#xD;
