  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of intramuscular injections of VM202 for subjects with critical limb ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects selected for this study will have critical limb ischemia that has not responded to&#xD;
      standard therapy with symptoms including pain at rest and/or ischemic ulcers.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of four (4) cohorts with a total of 3 subjects enrolled in each cohort&#xD;
      to VM202.For each dose cohort, VM202 will be administered as a local intramuscular injection&#xD;
      in 2 divided doses with a 2-week interval between the injections. Preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      (hemodynamic assessments), safety and tolerability will be evaluated at Baseline (screening)&#xD;
      and at designated time points throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all subjects in the first dose cohort have completed the 30-day (+ 2 days) follow-up&#xD;
      visit following the first dose of the study drug, an interim safety evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed with the submission of safety data to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).&#xD;
      If the DSMC recommends continuing the study, the second dose cohort will be treated. This&#xD;
      process will be repeated between the second and third dose cohort and between the third and&#xD;
      fourth dose cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All four dose cohorts will be followed for up to 5 years from the time of the first dose of&#xD;
      study drug administration.&#xD;
