  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder will have abnormal DESAÂ® results. Our objective is&#xD;
      to use neuroelectrical measures to determine the degree of processing abnormalities in&#xD;
      individuals with Autism. The study will survey processing patterns and will locate and&#xD;
      evaluate the degree(s) of abnormalities for further study. The abnormal results of&#xD;
      comprehensive neuroelectrical evaluations of individuals with Autism when compared to the&#xD;
      normative database will provide objective, verifiable, neurophysiological information with&#xD;
      which to form novel approaches to the disorder.&#xD;

      The research method will be: gathering, analyzing and utilizing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will observe research subjects through neuroelectrical instrumentation, then, compare&#xD;
      results to retrospective information collected from research subjects and a normative&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualified neurologist thoroughly familiar with electrophysiology will interpret the data,&#xD;
      and analyze it to explore the abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will, then, utilize the results to find data-based forms of treatment for those with the&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;

        The study population includes individuals with Autism without exclusion on the basis of&#xD;
        sex, gender, race or ethnicity. There will be 100 research subjects, with a ratio of four&#xD;
        males to one female, and those being approximately sixty-five children and thirty-five&#xD;
