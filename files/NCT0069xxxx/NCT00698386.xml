  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral Zinc administration in&#xD;
      new smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Evidence is available suggesting that&#xD;
      zinc deficiency rapidly diminishes antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses in both&#xD;
      humans and animals and renders the individual susceptible to a variety of pathogens. This&#xD;
      micronutrient has also been found to be useful in the treatment of lung tuberculosis in&#xD;
      limited number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are conducting this study in category-I patients (As per World Health Organization, Geneva&#xD;
      classification of tuberculosis) having lung tuberculosis to see the efficacy and also to see&#xD;
      any change in the immunological parameters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is commonly observed in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. There are reports&#xD;
      claiming patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis are malnourished as indicated by&#xD;
      diminished visceral proteins, anthropometric indexes, and micronutrient status. Zinc plays&#xD;
      role in protecting cells from the damaging effects of free radicals. Zinc supplementation was&#xD;
      shown to prevent pulmonary pathology due to hypoxia-induced lung damage in rats. The role of&#xD;
      zinc in faster sputum smear conversion has not yet been studied. However, there are reports&#xD;
      which confirms, in vitro cellular killing of tubercle bacilli by macrophages after zinc&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are investigating oral zinc supplement for its efficacy in TB patients in a &quot;double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial&quot; fashion. We are conducting this trial in&#xD;
      Category-I pulmonary TB Patients (as per RNTCP, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,&#xD;
      Govt.of India), and are assessing the outcome in the form of clinical improvement, sputum&#xD;
      conversion and immunological parameters. This is a multi-centric trial sponsored by the&#xD;
      Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplements and placebo have been prepared by Cadila pharmaceutical Ltd., India, in the form&#xD;
      of tablets. Each micronutrient tablet contains 50mg zinc (as zinc sulphate) in a lactose&#xD;
      matrix. The placebo consisted of lactose alone. Supplement and placebo capsules were&#xD;
      indistinguishable in appearance both externally and internally. In this clinical trial one&#xD;
      tablet of zinc as oral supplement will be given everyday during the entire course in line&#xD;
      with the directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) strategy recommended by the World&#xD;
      Health Organization.&#xD;
