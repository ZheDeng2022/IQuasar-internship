    <description>Assessment of functional capacity in study participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) via the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) provided an objective measure of disability. The 6MWT is a practical and objective evaluation of functional exercise capacity. The test measures the distance that a participant can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in 6 minutes. In order to ensure uniformity among the sites, the specifications of the course for the 6MWT were modified from being 30 meters long with 60-meter laps to be 15 meters long with 30-meter laps to accommodate space limitations encountered at select sites.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Day 85 in the Distance Walked During the 6 Minute Walk Test (MWT) Following Treatment With SUN11031 in Participants Having Cachexia Associated With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</title>
        <description>Assessment of functional capacity in study participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) via the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) provided an objective measure of disability. The 6MWT is a practical and objective evaluation of functional exercise capacity. The test measures the distance that a participant can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in 6 minutes. In order to ensure uniformity among the sites, the specifications of the course for the 6MWT were modified from being 30 meters long with 60-meter laps to be 15 meters long with 30-meter laps to accommodate space limitations encountered at select sites.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Days 29, 57, and 85 in the Distance Walked During the 6 Minute Walk Test (MWT) By Sub-groups Following Treatment With SUN11031 in Participants Having Cachexia Associated With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</title>
        <description>Assessment of functional capacity in study participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) via the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) provided an objective measure of disability. The 6MWT is a practical and objective evaluation of functional exercise capacity. The test measures the distance that a participant can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in 6 minutes. In order to ensure uniformity among the sites, the specifications of the course for the 6MWT were modified from being 30 meters long with 60-meter laps to be 15 meters long with 30-meter laps to accommodate space limitations encountered at select sites.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Improvement in Distance Walked During the 6 Minute Walk Test (MWT) By Sub-groups Following Treatment With SUN11031 in Participants Having Cachexia Associated With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</title>
        <description>Assessment of functional capacity in study participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) via the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) provided an objective measure of disability. The 6MWT is a practical and objective evaluation of functional exercise capacity. The test measures the distance that a participant can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in 6 minutes. In order to ensure uniformity among the sites, the specifications of the course for the 6MWT were modified from being 30 meters long with 60-meter laps to be 15 meters long with 30-meter laps to accommodate space limitations encountered at select sites.</description>

        <description>Measurements of body weight were performed in the morning when the participant had an empty stomach (ie, had consumed no food overnight) and had emptied the bladder and had a bowel movement, if possible. These measurements were performed using the same calibrated scale for an individual participant throughout study.</description>
