      The study compares two patient setups (Standard Prone vs. Genital Drop Technique) with&#xD;
      identical radiation treatment technique and parameters. After the two setups have been&#xD;
      planned, the treating faculty reviews the setups and will choose the setup he feels that will&#xD;
      give the patient improved dosimetry to the local regions and hopefully reduce toxicity and&#xD;
      improve treatment tolerability.&#xD;

      This is a study of two different setups when treating a patient with standard of care&#xD;
      radiation doses. The study compares two patient setups (Standard Prone vs. Genital Drop&#xD;
      Technique) with identical radiation treatment technique and parameters. After the two setups&#xD;
      have been planned, the treating faculty reviews the setups and will choose the setup he feels&#xD;
      that will give the patient improved dosimetry to the local regions and hopefully reduce&#xD;
      toxicity and improve treatment tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be randomized or stratified by demographic or disease risk assessment, but&#xD;
      treatment will be tailored to stage specific current standards of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extra (non standard of care) CT is required to analyze the data.&#xD;

    <description>The Genital Drop Technique (IMRT-GD) decreased the radiation dose to the testicles, scrotal skin and penile shaft compared to the standard conformal radiation therapy (CRT) and IMRT plans while preserving adequate planned target volume (PTV) dose coverage and homogeneity to the target organs in male anal cancer patients.</description>
