      This study is designed to compare self-directed bibliotherapy and therapist-directed&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy for children and adolescents with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder&#xD;
      (OCD). Both treatments involve exposure and response prevention (EX/RP), in which the child&#xD;
      confronts OCD fears and is asked to refrain from compulsive rituals (such as repetitive&#xD;
      handwashing, counting, etc.). Participants are requested to complete an initial evaluation to&#xD;
      determine diagnosis, and four follow-up evaluations to assess symptom severity and change due&#xD;
      to treatment for a total of 16 weeks. Participant involvement to self-directed bibliotherapy&#xD;
      versus traditional cognitive-behavioral treatment will be determined through random&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the bibliotherapy condition, the child or adolescent will meet with a therapist twice over&#xD;
      the course of treatment, along with a parent. The therapist will discuss a self-directed&#xD;
      program of EX/RP to be implemented at a pace deemed appropriate by child and parent at their&#xD;
      own home. The child and parent will be provided with a manual designed to instruct them how&#xD;
      to cope with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. This treatment involves the parent and child&#xD;
      reading the book, performing exercises, and monitoring symptoms on a weekly basis for 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the therapist-directed treatment condition, the child or adolescent will meet weekly with&#xD;
      a therapist along with their parent. The therapist, parent, and child will work together to&#xD;
      design and implement a program of EX/RP. This treatment involves performing exercises,&#xD;
      monitoring symptoms on a weekly basis, and completing homework assignments. Parents will be&#xD;
      asked to help coach their child with at-home exercises challenging the Obsessive Compulsive&#xD;
      Disorder. This treatment lasts 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations will be conducted following the completion of each treatment to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of each treatment on OCD symptoms. The treatment and evaluations for OCD are&#xD;
      provided free of charge.&#xD;
