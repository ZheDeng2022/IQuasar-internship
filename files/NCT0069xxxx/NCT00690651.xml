  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a patient has fractured an ankle that then requires surgery, the recommendation is to&#xD;
      remain in bed, with the operated leg elevated on pillows for 48 hours. This is a&#xD;
      precautionary measure, as yet unsubstantiated by research, which is thought to minimize ankle&#xD;
      swelling that can inhibit the healing of the surgical wound. However, prolonged bed rest can&#xD;
      lead to other complications such as blood clots in the lungs or leg veins, or chest&#xD;
      infections such as pneumonia. Prolonged bed rest is also known to cause weakness and a loss&#xD;
      of fitness such that recovery may be slower. In this research the investigators will be&#xD;
      randomly allocating patients to mobilize within 24 hours post operatively or to rest in bed&#xD;
      for 48 hours with their leg well elevated. The investigators will measure length of stay and&#xD;
      wound healing and integrity at 14 days. This study aims to investigate whether getting&#xD;
      patients out of bed within 24 hours of surgery can accelerate recovery and reduce acute&#xD;
      hospital length of stay without affecting wound healing. If bed rest for 2 days is not&#xD;
      necessary, there will be benefits for the patient in terms of general health and ability, and&#xD;
      for the hospital in terms of cost savings through shorter lengths of stay and patient through&#xD;
      put. The investigators already know that early mobilization is beneficial following other&#xD;
      types of orthopedic surgery such as hip fractures. This study aims to investigate if early&#xD;
      mobilization following surgical management of ankle fractures is safe with specific regard to&#xD;
      wound integrity and wound outcomes. This study will also investigate the effect of earlier&#xD;
      mobilization on the length of time spent in the acute hospital and for those discharged&#xD;
      directly home, the amount and type of support required. If early mobilization is found to be&#xD;
      safe for wound healing and results in shorter in-hospital stays, this research will provide&#xD;
      the confidence to endorse a change to current clinical practice.&#xD;
