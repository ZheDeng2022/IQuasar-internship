      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Talent&#xD;
      Endoluminal Spring Graft System, an investigational device, to treat abdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysms (AAA). The treatment population will include patients with an abdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. All patients in the treatment population&#xD;
      will undergo post-procedure follow-up evaluations at one (1), six (6), and 12 months and&#xD;
      annually thereafter up to five (5) years post-procedure.&#xD;

      Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) offers certain advantages as compared to surgical repair&#xD;
      of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Known benefits associated with EVAR, as described in&#xD;
      scientific literature, include minimally invasive procedure, shorter ICU and hospital stay,&#xD;
      reduced blood loss, more rapid recovery, and reduced need for general anesthesia. Potential&#xD;
      benefits that may be associated with use of the Talent device include reduced occurrence of&#xD;
      endoleaks, therefore reduced subsequent re-interventions. The risks/complications known to&#xD;
      occur to all patients undergoing AAA repair may include anesthetic complications, (e.g.,&#xD;
      aspiration), aneurysm enlargement, rupture, perforation or dissection, bleeding, arterial or&#xD;
      venous thrombosis and/or pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, hematoma or coagulopathy,&#xD;
      bowel complications, cardiac complications, (e.g., arrhythmia, myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      congestive heart failure, hypotension, hypertension), embolization (micro and macro) with&#xD;
      transient or permanent ischemia or infarction, genitourinary complications, infection,&#xD;
      neurologic complications, occlusion of device or native vessel, pulmonary/respiratory&#xD;
      complications and renal complications.&#xD;

    <description>Delivery success is defined as the successful access of the vessel and insertion of the delivery sheath to the treatment site. Deployment success is defined as the advancement through the vasculature to the desired location and full deployment within 0.5 cm of the intended location. Aneurysm exclusion is achieved when there is no evidence of blood flow around or through the stent graft into the aneurysm or where there is an absence of contrast within the aneurysm sac.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Subject has an AAA that is dilated to &gt; 4 cm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a proximal AAA neck (distance between the top of the aneurysm and the&#xD;
             renal arteries) &gt; 5 mm.&#xD;

        <description>Delivery success is defined as the successful access of the vessel and insertion of the delivery sheath to the treatment site. Deployment success is defined as the advancement through the vasculature to the desired location and full deployment within 0.5 cm of the intended location. Aneurysm exclusion is achieved when there is no evidence of blood flow around or through the stent graft into the aneurysm or where there is an absence of contrast within the aneurysm sac.</description>
