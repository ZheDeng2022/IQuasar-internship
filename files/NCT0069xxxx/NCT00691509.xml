      RATIONALE: Eating a diet rich in phytoestrogens may slow the growth of breast cancer cells&#xD;
      and prevent further tumor progression. Learning about the lifestyles of women with breast&#xD;
      cancer, their intake of phytoestrogens derived from food and supplements, and their use of&#xD;
      complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) practices may help doctors learn more about&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the effect of dietary and supplemental&#xD;
      phytoestrogens and CAM therapies in preventing progression and improving survival of women&#xD;
      with breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if phytoestrogen intake affects breast cancer progression and survival in&#xD;
           women with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To consider the influence of other phytochemicals on breast cancer progression in these&#xD;
           patients, using samples of patient blood and urine and patient-derived data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a database of food, dietary supplements, and phytoestrogens based on data&#xD;
           derived from these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To consider influences of diet and dietary supplements on quality of life of these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure 17 phytoestrogens in blood and urine samples from these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood and urine sample collection once a year for 5 years during routine&#xD;
      clinical follow-up after breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Blood samples are frozen for&#xD;
      future analysis of body hormones, tumor markers, and immune reactions, as well as vitamins&#xD;
      and plant chemicals reflecting patient diet and supplements. Blood samples are also analyzed&#xD;
      for genetic studies of cancer risk factors and polymorphisms. Urine samples are analyzed for&#xD;
      the presence of phytoestrogens and their metabolites by immunoassays, high performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry. Some samples are analyzed for estrogenic&#xD;
      potency by the estrogen receptor-mediated chemical activated luciferase gene expression test&#xD;
      to assess total plasma levels of estrogen-mimics not previously detected by the other tests.&#xD;
      Phytochemicals are also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients also complete a series of questionnaires once each year for 5 years and an EPIC&#xD;
      7-day Food Diary in years 2 and 4 to assess the role of diet and lifestyle in breast cancer&#xD;
      survival. The questionnaires include the EORTC Quality of Life-30 to assess lifestyle; the&#xD;
      General Health Questionnaire 12 to assess general health and levels of anxiety; and up to two&#xD;
      Food Frequency questionnaires to assess habitual dietary intake of phytoestrogens. Patients&#xD;
      are also asked about their use of dietary supplements and complementary and alternative&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
