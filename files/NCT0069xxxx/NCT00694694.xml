      This trial sets out to determine whether the combination of azithromycin and artesunate&#xD;
      (AZ+AS) is as good as the current standard treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania,&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL). There are two reasons this is important&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. there are only a limited range of drug combinations which work against malaria in this&#xD;
           area of Tanzania&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. azithromycin has antimalarial properties, but is also a broad-spectrum antibiotic, so if&#xD;
           the combination is an effective antimalarial it might have a place where there are no&#xD;
           diagnostic facilities as syndromic treatment for fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artesunate and azithromycin have both been used alone or in combination with other drugs in&#xD;
      children in Tanzania for many years, and are considered safe. There is trial evidence for the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this combination in adults in Asia, as well as in-vitro (laboratory)&#xD;
      evidence that it works against the malaria parasite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial randomizes children with non-severe malaria to the new combination AZ+AS or the&#xD;
      standard care arm AL. The primary outcome is the parasitological failure rate by day 28-&#xD;
      meaning do malaria parasites get cleared, and stay cleared for at least 28 days. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include safety.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Trial drugs. Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) has been selected to be the drug used to treat&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania. There is extensive efficacy, effectiveness and safety data&#xD;
      on this combination from Tanzania. Artesunate is a key component of most ACTs. It should not&#xD;
      be used as monotherapy, but is highly effective as an antimalarial when used in combination&#xD;
      with another drug with antimalarial properties. There are now many years of experience of&#xD;
      artesunate combinations on Africa and it appears safe in children. Azithromycin is licensed&#xD;
      for use in childhood infections and trachoma. It is well tolerated and appears very safe in&#xD;
      children; for example it does not have the effects of occasional bone-marrow toxicity seen&#xD;
      with chroramphenicol, or the skin reactions sometimes seen with sulpha-drugs. It is active&#xD;
      against the majority of childhood bacterial infections. There is extensive safety data on&#xD;
      azithromycin, including data on azithromycin safety and tolerability in African children.&#xD;
      Azithromycin has been shown to have significant antimalarial activity in vitro. There is good&#xD;
      in vitro data on artemisinin + azithromycin combinations against malaria including tests for&#xD;
      interactions . As a prophylactic drug against malaria azithromycin is effective in both West&#xD;
      and East Africa. Azithromycin-artesunate has been used as an antimalarial drug combination in&#xD;
      Asia. There is experience from small trials of combinations of artemisinin drugs and&#xD;
      azithromycin to treat P. falciparum in Southeast Asia which were less effective than&#xD;
      artesunate-mefloquine and artemether-doxycycline but several factors, especially the low&#xD;
      doses of azithromycin used in two of these studies and patterns of antibiotic use locally may&#xD;
      well have contributed to this; the combination appears safe . This contrasts with the&#xD;
      evidence in East Africa that azithromycin is an effective antimalarial when used for&#xD;
      prophylaxis, and there are several reasons why it may well be more effective in East Africa&#xD;
      than in SE Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The overall study objectives will therefore be to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      azithromycin-artesunate and artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of non-severe falciparum&#xD;
      malaria in children in an area of high antimalarial drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives are i) to compare the effects of the drugs on parasitological failure&#xD;
      rates at 28 days in each arm, both unadjusted and adjusting for reinfection judged by&#xD;
      genotyping ii) to compare the drugs for clinical failure rate at 28 days. iii) to compare the&#xD;
      drugs for clinical and parasitological failure at day 42. iv) to compare the drug&#xD;
      combinations for adverse events and side effects v) to undertake a cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      analysis of the two drug combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial of azithromycin-artesunate and artemether-lumefantrine for the&#xD;
      treatment of non-severe falciparum malaria in children between 6 months and 5 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted among children attending the MCH clinic in one of the hospitals&#xD;
      in the Tanga region (Muheza Designated District Hospital) with symptoms compatible with&#xD;
      malaria. Those with malaria parasites in their blood smear will be considered for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A randomised, open-label trial will be carried out. The slide reader assessing the&#xD;
           primary endpoint will be blind to treatment allocation, and analysis performed by&#xD;
           intention-to-treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All study drug regimens will be oral. After educating the patient on the need to&#xD;
           complete the course prescribed by the clinician, drugs will be administered as direct&#xD;
           observed therapy (DOT) by a nurse of the study team for morning doses and the evening&#xD;
           dose (AL only) will be taken at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with non-severe (WHO definition) slide proven malaria with &gt;2000 parasites/microL&#xD;
      will be recruited from the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) clinic of Teule Hospital following&#xD;
      initial pilot studies to identify and solve logistic or other problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project nurses will interview parents/guardians of all febrile children and of those with a&#xD;
      recent (past 48 hours) history of fever to exclude other causes of fever. Those who are&#xD;
      clearly seriously unwell (unconscious, fitting etc) will be triaged immediately to the&#xD;
      emergency admissions team. Those with a fever or history of fever will be referred for rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic testing (RDT) with blood taken by fingerprick. A slide will be taken at the same&#xD;
      time, to be used by the study team or hospital team if appropriate. If RDTs are positive a&#xD;
      study slide will be made, stained and read and they will be referred to the study physician;&#xD;
      if RDTs are negative to the Teule hospital doctor. Duplicate thick and thin blood smears will&#xD;
      be made from all probable malaria cases, Giemsa stained at pH 7.2, and examined&#xD;
      microscopically. All patients seen by the study team will be re-assessed by the physician of&#xD;
      the study team to exclude concomitant infection(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random number generated by the computer will be allocated to the two study regimens in blocks&#xD;
      of random size. Patients consenting to participate in the study will be registered&#xD;
      numerically as they present. The registration (enrolment) number of each patient will&#xD;
      determine the drug regimen to be given. Registration numbers will correspond to sealed opaque&#xD;
      envelopes with treatment allocation. Opening an envelope will be deemed to be randomisation,&#xD;
      and intention to treat analysis will proceed on that basis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomised, the child will be treated with the study drug they are allocated unless they&#xD;
      withdraw or are withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be observed on days 0,1,2,7,14,28 and 42. Finger-prick for malaria blood&#xD;
      slide, haemacue and filter paper blood specimen for genotyping will be taken on days 0, 2, 7,&#xD;
      14, 28 and 42 or any day the child presents unwell, and venous blood drawn for a full blood&#xD;
      count and liver enzymes on days 0 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quinine at a dose of 10-mg/kg body weight for 7 days will be the rescue medication, as per&#xD;
      Tanzanian national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If patients are found to have deteriorating clinical condition in the presence of&#xD;
           asexual parasites from days 0-3 of treatment this will be deemed an early treatment&#xD;
           failure; they will be admitted for parenteral treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If patients develop severe or complicated malaria (WHO) at any other stage they will be&#xD;
           admitted for parenteral treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who recrudesce with or without symptoms during the study period will be treated&#xD;
           with oral quinine and visited every day by VHCs to support the guardian and detect any&#xD;
           problems early. If there is any sign of deterioration or unexpected side effects they&#xD;
           will be admitted. At day 7 post commencing rescue treatment all patients will have a&#xD;
           blood film; if this is positive they will be admitted for directly observed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients who recrudesce after quinine treatment will be treated as inpatients according&#xD;
           to local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recrudescence versus reinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood for PCR will be collected from all patients at enrolment and on follow-up as outlined&#xD;
      above. PCR analysis of parasite genes will be performed only in patients with re-appearance&#xD;
      of parasitaemia in order to differentiate between re-infection and recrudescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events If a patient is unable to tolerate the trial medication the reason for&#xD;
      discontinuation will be recorded in the Clinical Record Form as an &quot;adverse event&quot; and&#xD;
      alternative rescue medication initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any significant clinical or laboratory abnormality as judged by the senior attending&#xD;
      physician (PI) will be recorded as an adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of efficacy; primary outcome: day 28 slide clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of first treatment is day 0. The day 28 slide clearance rate is the primary end point&#xD;
      of therapeutic efficacy for this trial. It is the proportion of treated patients with no&#xD;
      asexual parasitaemia double-read by microscopists blind to treatment allocation, and who did&#xD;
      not receive rescue medication within that period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of efficacy; secondary endpoints. All analysis intention-to treat unless otherwise&#xD;
      specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Day 14 slide clearance rate by slides double-read blind to treatment allocation ii)&#xD;
      Clinical failure rate on or by day 28 iii) Clinical failure rate on or by day 14 iv)&#xD;
      Parasitological and clinical failure at day 42 v) Day 28 recrudescence rate assessed by PCR&#xD;
      vi) Day 14 and 42 recrudescence rate assessed by PCR vii) Day 28 hemoglobin level viii)&#xD;
      Differences in side effects/AE between groups ix) A per-protocol analysis for all day 14 and&#xD;
      day 28 outcomes&#xD;
