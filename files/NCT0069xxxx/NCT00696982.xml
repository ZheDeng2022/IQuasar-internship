      Recently a new category of antihyperglycemic therapy aiming to modulate the incretin system&#xD;
      has emerged. These drugs induce insulin secretion without inducing hypoglycemia. The effect&#xD;
      of the incretin modulators drugs on hypertension, arterial stiffness, inflammation and&#xD;

      have demonstrated that GLP-1 improves endothelial dysfunction in a small group of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes subjects, with coronary heart disease. We hypothesize that DPP-4 inhibitor will have&#xD;
      an effect on hypertension and arterial stiffness by effect on the NO pathway.The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the effect of two insulin inducers drugs, sulfonyl urea and DPP-4&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new category of hypoglycemic therapy has emerged, aimed to modulate the incretin&#xD;
      system in diabetic patients. Compared to other drugs that induce insulin secretion, these&#xD;
      agents do not cause hypoglycemia. However, until now the differential effects of incretin&#xD;
      modulators and the classical insulin inducers on hypettension, arterial stiffness,&#xD;
      inflammation and oxidative stress parameters have not been yet investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incretins The increase in plasma insulin levels following oral administration of glucose&#xD;
      usually exceeds the levels observed after intravenous glucose administration. The phenomenon&#xD;
      is defined as incretin effect and has been attributed to the intestinal hormones which are&#xD;
      released after oral glucose administration. The two most important incretin hormones are&#xD;
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incretin effect is reduced in type-2 diabetic patients. After oral glucose administration,&#xD;
      both GIP and GLP-1 are secreted and rapidly inactivated by an enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4&#xD;
      (DPP-4). Accordingly, the half-life of active GLP-1 is less than 2 min (2). Both GIP and&#xD;
      GLP-1 stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Moreover, GLP-1 has also&#xD;
      been shown to increase islet cell neogenesis and differentiation, as well as reduce apoptosis&#xD;
      of Î²-cells in rodents. (3-5). Incretins also affect glucagon secretion. GIP stimulates&#xD;
      glucagon production (6) ,whereas GLP-1 inhibits synthesis of the latter (7). Differential&#xD;
      effects of the two peptides on glucagon secretion may prove responsible for normalization of&#xD;
      blood glucose after intravenous injection of GLP-1 but not after administration of GIP or its&#xD;
      derivatives [7, 8]. Therefore, GLP-1 is the only incretin that has been applied for treatment&#xD;
      for diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its direct insulin/glucagons activities, GLP-1 has other extra-pancreatic&#xD;
      effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It inhibits gastric emptying and small bowel motility , the effects being dependent on&#xD;
           nitric oxide (NO) (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It induces satiety through a central nervous system mechanism (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is some data suggesting that GLP-1 infusion improves LV function .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rGLP-1 infusion significantly attenuated the development of hypertension in Dahl Salt&#xD;
           sensitive rats [11]. In patients with type 2 DM, exenatide treatment for 2 years also&#xD;
           resulted in improvement of blood pressure [12]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GLP-1 exerts direct beneficial effects on endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in&#xD;
           healthy non-diabetic non-smoking normotensive subjects [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In type 2 diabetic subjects with coronary heart disease, GLP-1 infusion significantly&#xD;
           increased relative changes in brachial artery diameter (i.e. improved endothelial&#xD;
           dysfunction) [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the main limitation of GLP-1 from the pharmacokinetic point of view is its rapid&#xD;
      inactivation by DPP- 4, two strategies have been developed. One strategy is the development&#xD;
      of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 mimetics) which are resistant to DPP-4, such as exenatide&#xD;
      (Byetta). The other approach is to prevent inactivation of GLP-1 by inhibiting the DPP-4&#xD;
      enzyme activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DPP-4 inhibitors Mice with a genetic deletion of DPP-4 have increased glucose tolerance&#xD;
      following oral glucose administration in association with augmented insulin secretion. [15]&#xD;
      DPP-4 inhibitor in animal studies was shown to augments the active GLP-1 concentration,&#xD;
      increase insulin secretion and improve glucose tolerance. [16, 17] Previous rodent studies&#xD;
      have found that GLP-1 and its analogues may increase beta cell mass by stimulating islet&#xD;
      neogenesis and differentiation and inhibiting apoptosis.[3]. Similar effect can be produced&#xD;
      by DPP-4 inhibition [18, 19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is one of the two most studied DPP-4 inhibitors (the other one being&#xD;
      vildagliptin). It is a competitive reversible inhibitor of the enzyme.[20] It is an orally&#xD;
      active drug that can be absorbed rapidly and efficiently. Hepatic insufficiency does not seem&#xD;
      to alter the pharmacokinetics of this drug, however, renal insufficiency increases&#xD;
      circulating levels of sitagliptin. [21] Sitagliptin proved to be a well tolerated and safe&#xD;
      drug, both for monotherapy and for combination therapy with metformin or thiazolidiediones.&#xD;
      Thus far, no drug interactions have been observed with the DPP-4 inhibitors. However,&#xD;
      recently post-marketing reports of anaphylaxis, angioedema, and rashes, including&#xD;
      Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have emerged in sitagliptin treated patients. [22] The reported&#xD;
      numbers of hypoglycemic events have been very low, as should be expected from the glucose-&#xD;
      induced GLP-1 secretion/effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitagliptin has been shown to reduce HBA1C by 0.8%-1.1% , to decrease fasting plasma glucose&#xD;
      and to increase beta cell function indices in type 2 diabetes patients, as a single therapy&#xD;
      or in combination with metformin or thizolidinediones, as compared to placebo [23-27].&#xD;
      Sitagliptin and glipizide have similar effect on plasma glucose when administered in&#xD;
      combination with metformin therapy. [28]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction Augmentation of arterial blood pressure,&#xD;
      reflecting the pulsatile component of blood pressure and thus arterial stiffness, is a&#xD;
      well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease outcome.[29-33] Augmentation index (AIx)&#xD;
      measurement, a non-invasive way of appreciating the rate of arterial stiffness, has been&#xD;
      shown to predict coronary artery disease (CAD) in whole population as well as in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes [32, 34, 35]. Differential effects of the drugs on arterial stiffness&#xD;
      may be, in part, responsible for the diversity of impacts of various antihypertensive&#xD;
      drug/treatments on CAD.[33] The Conduit Artery Function Evaluation (CAFE) study, a sub-study&#xD;
      to the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), examined the impact of two&#xD;
      different blood pressure lowering regimens, atenolol-thiazide based versus&#xD;
      amlodipine-perindopril based therapy, on derived central aortic pressure values and on&#xD;
      hemodynamics in 2199 patients.[33] Central pulse pressure was an independent risk factor for&#xD;
      composite outcome of total cardiovascular events/procedures and the development of renal&#xD;
      impairment. Similarly, statin drugs have been shown to exert additional beneficiary effects&#xD;
      on AIx, the result entirely independent of their primary, cholesterol lowering, effect.[36].&#xD;
      Regarding type 2 diabetes, it has been previously demonstrated that increase in adiponectin&#xD;
      levels, secondary to treatment with the insulin sensitizers pioglitazone or metformin, may&#xD;
      decrease arterial stiffness.[37] . By analogy, incretins, in addition to stimulatory effects&#xD;
      on insulin secretion, might have a positive impact on decreasing arterial stiffness in&#xD;
      diabetic patients. Nystrom et al. have demonstrated that GLP-1 improves endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction in a small group of type 2 diabetes subjects with coronary heart disease [14].&#xD;
      However, the actual effect of DPP-4 on arterial stiffness has not yet been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the American diabetes association, treatment with biguanides should be started&#xD;
      in case of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes .If the targeted glycemia level is not achieved,&#xD;
      another medication should be added. In this respect, one cannot overemphasize the importance&#xD;
      of discovering positive additional effects, if any, of the administered antidiabetic drugs on&#xD;
      blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and oxidative stress and/or inflammation markers. The&#xD;
      purpose of the proposed clinical trial is to compare the effects of two different types of&#xD;
      insulin inducers, sulfonyl urea and incretin, on blood pressure, monitored within a 24h&#xD;
      period, as well as on arterial stiffness parameters. In addition, assessment of blood markers&#xD;
      for oxidative stress, as represented by 8-STAT-Isoprostane, oxidized LDL and [H202? carbonil&#xD;
      groups?], as well as of markers for inflammation, as represented by TGF-Ã, Il-1, Il-6, Il-4,&#xD;
      Il-10 and highly sensitive CRP will be performed .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study has been designed as a prospective, randomized, single blind, cross-over&#xD;
      trial. It will include 60 diabetic patients, aged 18 years or older, treated with metformin.&#xD;
      Only patients with HbA1C levels within the range 7% - 11% will be enrolled in the study. All&#xD;
      patients will submit written informed consent to participate in the experiment prior to their&#xD;
      inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CCT&lt;30&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A history of treatment with incretins or sulfonylurea during the last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with nitrates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled hypertension and/or any change in the hypertensive medications within one&#xD;
           month prior starting the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No proven regular treatment with aspirin or statins within one month prior starting the&#xD;
           study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any malignancy with life expectancy of less then 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study will be randomly assigned to one of the two experimental&#xD;
      groups: Group A: to receive sitagliptin, 100 mg by a single dose daily, Group B:&#xD;
      glibenclamide, 5 mg by a single dose daily. The latter dosage might be increased, if needed,&#xD;
      to 5 mg twice a day. After 3 month, a one-week wash-out period during which no antidiabetic&#xD;
      drugs (excluding metformin) will be administered, will be imposed on all patients .Following&#xD;
      1 week, a cross-over protocol will be applied: group A, earlier treated with sitagliptin,&#xD;
      will now receive glibenclamid and, vice versa, group B will start the sitagliptin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end results aimed to be obtained from this study are detection of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness, defined as change in augmentation index measured by means of a non-invasive&#xD;
      technique using the commercially available SphygmoCor System, and the results of the 24 hour&#xD;
      blood pressure monitoring. The secondary end results would be oxidative stress parameters, as&#xD;
      evaluated by oxidized LDL and Isoprostanes, and markers of inflammatory status, including&#xD;
      measurements of pro-inflammatory interleukins and performance of highly sensitive CRP test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients enrolled in the study will be invited to the Research &amp; Development Unit of&#xD;
      Assaf-Harofeh for three visits: prior to starting the experiment, following 3 months and&#xD;
      following 6 months. Their weight and abdominal circumference will be recorded; arterial&#xD;
      stiffness will be measured; then, they will be connected to a blood pressure halter,&#xD;
      recording their blood pressure for 24h. At each visit, 10ml periohera blood will be drawn for&#xD;
      evaluation of HBA1C, complete blood count, serum electrolytes, albumin, blood lipids, fasting&#xD;
      glucose 8F-STAT-Isoprostanes, oxidized LDL, nitric oxide, inflammatory interleukins and&#xD;
      highly sensitive CRP (hsCRP). Any side effects of the drugs and any complaint on the event of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia will also be recorded.&#xD;
