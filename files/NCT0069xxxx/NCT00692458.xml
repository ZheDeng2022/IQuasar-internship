        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed primary State II or Stage III breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (e.g., cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,&#xD;
             carboplatin) at the time of randomization and has not received adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
             for at least 6 weeks prior to the randomization visit (Visit 2). This inclusion&#xD;
             criterion does not include hormone therapy, which is permitted (see inclusion&#xD;
             criterion # 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is not receiving hormonal therapy OR if patient is receiving hormonal therapy&#xD;
             (e.g., leuprolide, tamoxifen, anastrozole) she is on a stable regimen for at least 3&#xD;
             months at the time of screening (Visit 1). If patient is HER2-positive and is&#xD;
             receiving trastuzumab treatment, she must be on a stable regimen for at least 1 month&#xD;
             at the time of Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is not pregnant or breast-feeding. All women of childbearing potential must&#xD;
             have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone metastases or history of bone metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has evidence of other distant metastases (e.g., visceral, soft-tissue, or&#xD;
             brain)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has had a prior local or regional recurrence of her breast cancer, or a&#xD;
             contralateral tumor. DCIS (ductal carcinoma in-situ), and LCIS (local carcinoma&#xD;
             in-situ) in either the ipsilateral or contralateral breast are permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has ANY of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. is currently receiving a bisphosphonate or other drug therapy for osteoporosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. has been treated with an oral bisphosphonate for osteoporosis for more than 3&#xD;
                  months within the 2 years prior to Visit 1, or for a total of more than 6 months&#xD;
                  at any time prior to Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. has been treated with an intravenous bisphosphonate within the 12 months prior to&#xD;
                  Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a history of malignancy other than breast cancer &lt;5 years prior to signing&#xD;
             informed consent, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin&#xD;
             cancer or in situ cervical cancer. Patients with melanoma, leukemia, lymphoma, and&#xD;
             myeloproliferative disorders of any duration are exclusionary&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is currently participating or has participated in a study with an&#xD;
             investigational compound or device within 30 days of signing the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is currently participating in or has at any time in the past participated in a&#xD;
             breast cancer study with a registered medication (i.e., approved by the regulatory&#xD;
             agency in which she resides) being tested for the treatment of breast cancer (an&#xD;
             unapproved indication)&#xD;
