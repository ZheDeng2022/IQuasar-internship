      Objective of this study is to further assess the response to treatment and safety of 0.03%&#xD;
      tacrolimus (FK506) ointment when used for 6 months in pediatric patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe atopic dermatitis, known to be responsive to topical steroids.&#xD;

      The main phase is 6 month duration, but the follow-up phase up to 12 months will allow the&#xD;
      collection of RTT and safety data in a period which will include all seasons in each patient,&#xD;
      to account for seasonal variability which strongly affect AD course.&#xD;
