      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, there has been a marked rise in the frequency of young people engaging in&#xD;
      Deliberate Self-Harm (DSH). DSH refers to all kinds of self-harming behaviour, with and&#xD;
      without suicidal intent. Early identification and treatment of persons who engaged in DSH is&#xD;
      important because every episode of DSH increases the risk of future episodes and, eventually,&#xD;
      suicide. A number of comprehensive treatment programs have been developed and proven to be&#xD;
      effective in reducing DSH in adults. Especially the modification of inadequate emotion&#xD;
      regulation strategies seems to be essential in the prevention of future episodes of DSH. The&#xD;
      first short-term results of a Dutch time-limited and structured individual&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for DSH in adolescents and young adults also showed&#xD;
      positive effects on repetition of DSH and associated problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects and costs of the total individual CBT package and one of the components&#xD;
      of the total CBT treatment package (i.e. mindfulness training) in a group format compared to&#xD;
      Treatment-as-Usual (TAU) on the short and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial with repeated measurements at baseline&#xD;
      (M0),and posttreatment (M6)), 12 (M12) and 18 months (M18) after baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young persons aged 15-35 who recently have engaged in DSH and have been referred to the&#xD;
      Leiden University Medical Centre, the mental health centre Rivierduinen or the University&#xD;
      Medical Centre St. Radboud following an act of DSH will be invited to participate. Persons&#xD;
      reporting severe psychiatric disorders requiring intensive inpatient treatment or serious&#xD;
      cognitive impairments will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly allocated to CBT, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy(MBCT) or&#xD;
      Treatment-as-Usual (TAU). The CBT treatment consists of up to 12 weekly sessions of&#xD;
      individual treatment mainly consisting of emotion regulations skills, cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring, and behavioural skills training. The MBCT training consists of 8 2-hour&#xD;
      sessions in a group format within a three months time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same outcome measures to assess the clinical effects of treatment as in the previous&#xD;
      study will be used (repetition of DSH, depression (BDI-II), anxiety (SCL-90),&#xD;
      self-concept(RSC-Q), and suicide cognitions (SCS)) allowing a historical comparison of&#xD;
      treatment effectiveness across both randomized clinical trials. In addition at all&#xD;
      assessments health-related quality of life, use of medical resources and loss of productivity&#xD;
      will be assessed (EuroQol, VAS and TTO). In addition,problems in emotion regulation (an&#xD;
      important risk mechanism for repetition of DSH) will be assessed before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in societal costs (intervention, other (health) care and productivity)will be&#xD;
      compared to differences in the frequency of DSH and quality adjusted life years (EuroQol, VAS&#xD;
      and TTO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data-analysis/power:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our previous study at least a medium effect of treatment on repetition of DSH may be&#xD;
      expected. Assuming a medium effect of one of the treatments compared to TAU (delta =.75) and&#xD;
      an attrition rate of about 20 %, at least 42 patients per study arm are needed to detect a&#xD;
      minimal clinical relevant difference in repetition of DSH with a power of 80% and alpha set&#xD;
      at .05.&#xD;
