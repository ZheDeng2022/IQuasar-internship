    <textblock>
      The primary idea is that the use of a computerized reminder system to help with the guideline&#xD;
      implementation will increase utilization and adherence of guideline-driven care, leading to&#xD;
      improved patient outcomes. The hypothesis we aim to address is that an automatic,&#xD;
      computerized reminder system for detecting asthma patients in the pediatric ED will increase&#xD;
      paper-based guideline utilization compared to paper-based guideline without the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to implement a real-time, computerized asthma detection system and integrate the&#xD;
      system with the pediatric emergency department information system, and evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      the asthma detection system on reminding clinicians to use the paper-based asthma guideline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the leading chronic childhood disease affecting 9 million children (12.5%) under 18&#xD;
      years of age (1). Asthma exacerbations cause an estimated 14 million missed school days (2)&#xD;
      and more than 1.8 million emergency department (ED) visits annually (2), and account for &gt;60%&#xD;
      of asthma-related costs (3). The chronic characteristic of asthma carries a considerable&#xD;
      economic burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncontrolled asthma can lead to exacerbations requiring the patient to seek immediate care,&#xD;
      frequently in an ED setting. Several asthma guidelines, including the nationally accepted&#xD;
      guideline from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), exist to support&#xD;
      clinicians in providing adequate treatment. Utilization of and adherence with asthma&#xD;
      guidelines improves patients' clinical care (4, 5). However, guideline adherence remains&#xD;
      suboptimal. In the ED, early recognition and accurate assessment of the severity of airway&#xD;
      obstruction and response to therapy are fundamental to the improvement of health for patients&#xD;
      with asthma. The NHLBI guidelines emphasize early recognition and treatment of asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations, as well as appropriate treatment stratified by severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer applications for patient care can address barriers to optimal medical care. Computer&#xD;
      systems have improved the use and adherence to practice guidelines, provide clinical alerts&#xD;
      and reminders, and generate patient-specific treatment recommendations and educational&#xD;
      material. Implementation of guideline-driven decision support is frequently paper-based or&#xD;
      computerized. In either form a major barrier remains on the busy clinicians to remember to&#xD;
      initiate the guideline a process and to embed the guideline tasks in the clinical workflow of&#xD;
      the care team (5). The proposed study examines the benefits of a novel approach for reminding&#xD;
      clinicians in an ED setting to use guideline-driven care. The approach will apply a&#xD;
      workflow-embedded process taking advantage of an advanced information technology&#xD;
      infrastructure. The informatics approach will include two elements: a) a computerized,&#xD;
      real-time reminder system, which will automatically detect guideline-eligible patients&#xD;
      without requiring additional data entry, and b) a computerized, workflow-embedded guideline&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
