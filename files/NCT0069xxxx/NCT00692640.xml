  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL147 in combination&#xD;
      with erlotinib (Tarceva®) in subjects with solid tumors. XL147 is a new chemical entity that&#xD;
      inhibits PI3 Kinase. Inactivation of PI3K has been shown to inhibit growth and induce&#xD;
      apoptosis (programmed cell death) in tumor cells. Erlotinib is an orally administered&#xD;
      inhibitor of EGFR (also known as HER1) tyrosine kinase. It was approved by the FDA as a&#xD;
      single agent for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC) after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen and in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine for first line treatment of patients with locally advanced,&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  in the Dose Escalation Phase, the subject has a histologically confirmed solid&#xD;
                  tumor that is metastatic or unresectable and is no longer responding to therapies&#xD;
                  known to prolong survival or to other standard therapies, or has disease for&#xD;
                  which no standard therapy exists or for which monotherapy with erlotinib is&#xD;
                  considered standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  in the Cohort Expansion Phase, the subject has advanced or metastatic NSCLC that&#xD;
                  is no longer responding to therapies known to prolong survival or to other&#xD;
                  standard therapies and which:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. has been previously or currently treated with erlotinib or gefitinib or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. with the agreement of the sponsor, has been previously or is currently&#xD;
