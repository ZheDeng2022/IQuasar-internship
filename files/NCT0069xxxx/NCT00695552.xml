      This trial investigates the biological effect of exercise training on depression.&#xD;
      Participants will randomly be allocated to either a aerobic exercise group performing&#xD;
      exercise on stationary bikes or a group performing low-impact exercise such as stretching&#xD;
      exercises. Both groups will attend sessions three times per week for 3 months. Before and&#xD;
      after the intervention the investigators will measure the severity of depression using the&#xD;
      Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D17).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The yearly incidence of depression is estimated to be 3-5%, with a lifetime prevalence of 17%&#xD;
      in western societies.Furthermore, Major depression is associated with increased mortality&#xD;
      from somatic disorders such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, and endocrinological diseases.&#xD;
      WHO and others stated that unipolar depressive disorders was the leading cause of disease&#xD;
      burden in the western world in 2002 accounting for 9,0% of all disability adjusted life&#xD;
      years. Projecting the current development in disease patterns unipolar depression is expected&#xD;
      to be the second highest cause of global disease burden in 2030. With remission rates of&#xD;
      approximately 50% using medical antidepressant therapy, the search for alternative or&#xD;
      augmentation therapy is a key issue in depressive research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2001 a meta-analysis concluded that the effect of exercise training could not be&#xD;
      determined due to lack of good quality research. The authors found that the majority of&#xD;
      trials were without blinded outcome assessment, lacked intention-to-treat analysis, and most&#xD;
      had short follow-up. In this context, one of the authors in 2004 launched a pragmatic&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of exercise training on depressive&#xD;
      symptoms - the DEMO trial(10). The 165 included participants were randomized to either&#xD;
      aerobic, non-aerobic, or relaxation training in a four-month training programme. The primary&#xD;
      outcome was the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D17) and data collection ended June 1st&#xD;
      2007. After four month intervention there were no overall effect of exercise on depressive&#xD;
      symptoms; the estimate at four month between non-aerobic and relaxation training was -0.9&#xD;
      (95%CI: -3.2 to 1.4) and between aerobic and relaxation training was 0.99 (95%CI: -1.3 to&#xD;
      3.3). These results do not support any biological effect of exercise on major depression.&#xD;
      However, the majority (115/165) of patients had received antidepressant medication for more&#xD;
      than six weeks at baseline thus the lack of a positive result could partly be explained by a&#xD;
      treatment resistant group. A subgroup analysis of patients not medicated at baseline&#xD;
      estimated the effect between non-aerobic and relaxation training to -1.7 (95% CI: -6.0 to&#xD;
      2.5) and between aerobic and relaxation training to 0.3 (95% CI: -3.9 to 4.6). The number of&#xD;
      patients in this important sub-group, means that any conclusion on non-medicated patients is&#xD;
      underpowered. In addition the literature suggest that the possible effect of exercise on&#xD;
      depression is frequency and intensity related. In the DEMO trial the participants only&#xD;
      trained twice pr. week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This result from the DEMO trial is somewhat in contrast with the abundant publications of&#xD;
      animal research showing that exercise stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis and in theory&#xD;
      improves depressive symptoms and cognitive skills. The hippocampus is involved in cognitive&#xD;
      functions such as memory and learning processes as well as regulation of the hypothalamus. In&#xD;
      depression and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson Disease, which&#xD;
      share features like impaired memory and learning abilities, the hippocampus is characterized&#xD;
      by atrophia. In addition to a decreased hippocampal volume, brain imaging studies have&#xD;
      observed reduction in volume of prefrontal cortex of depressed patients, though postmortem&#xD;
      studies have less evident results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective studies on healthy adults suggest that exercise has a beneficial effect on&#xD;
      cognitive functions or reduces an age related decline in these. Research on rodents suggest&#xD;
      that an increase in memory and learning in relation to exercise is mediated through an&#xD;
      up-regulation of brain derived neurotrophic factor, which has the ability to stimulate&#xD;
      synaptic-plasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly the exercise induced cell proliferation is inhibited by peripheral blockade of&#xD;
      either insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which&#xD;
      could indicate that the exercise induced neurogenesis is dependent of IGF-I/VEGF. The role of&#xD;
      IGF-I in neurogenesis is supported by studies showing an increase in new hippocampal cells in&#xD;
      sedentary animals given IGF-I infusion. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) also increases in&#xD;
      the rat hippocampus in response to exercise, however FGF-2 injections into the adult rat&#xD;
      hippocampus do not increase neurogenesis. The importance of IGF-I in neurogenesis is&#xD;
      emphasized by the fact that homozygous IGF1 -/- mice at the age of to months had reduced&#xD;
      brain weight affecting all major brain areas, especially the volume of the dentate gyrus(33)&#xD;
      in contrary to BDNF null mutant mice that did not show major hippocampal deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it has been shown that antidepressant treatment up-regulates sBDNF in humans and&#xD;
      a relationship between genetic variants of BDNF locus and depression have been implied. On&#xD;
      this background it could be argued that low BDNF levels contribute to the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      depression, and that exercise has a beneficial effect on cognitive function in patients with&#xD;
      depression through an up-regulation of IGF-1, VEGF and BDNF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of exercise on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition have recently been supported&#xD;
      in a human study measuring cerebral blood volume in the dentate gyrus by magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this background the investigators have designed this randomized trial comparing aerobic&#xD;
      exercise and no treatment in light to moderate depression. This trial will employ adequate&#xD;
      methods of reducing bias such as centralized randomization, blinded outcome assessment, and&#xD;
      analysis according to the intent-to-treat principle. In addition the investigators plan to&#xD;
      include a healthy control group to establish any differences in biological response to&#xD;
      exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The primary objective for the DEMOII superiority trial is to assess the beneficial&#xD;
      and harmful effect of aerobic exercise versus stretching exercise in patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      moderate depression according to ICD-10. The primary outcome will be an assessment of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms as measured with the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D17), by outcome&#xD;
      assessors blinded to intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to measure the effect of exercise on neurogenesis in the&#xD;
      hippocampal region by cerebral blood volume. The assessors will be blind to participation&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary objects is to evaluate cognitive skills, brain derived neurotrophic factor, insulin&#xD;
      like growth hormone 1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and other variables associated&#xD;
      with the development of cardiovascular disease (interleukin 6, maximal oxygen uptake, BMI,&#xD;
      tumour necroses factor alpha and blood pressure).&#xD;
