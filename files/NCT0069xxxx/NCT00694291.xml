    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the benefit of sorafenib in patients with a rising&#xD;
      PSA after treatment with radiation therapy or surgery who are NOT receiving with androgen&#xD;
      ablation therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a placebo controlled double blind study of sorafenib versus placebo of in patients&#xD;
      with high risk biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. High risk characteristics include a&#xD;
      short PSADT (&lt;9 months) or high Gleason score (&gt;8), characteristics, which correspond to a&#xD;
      higher risk of prostate cancer specific mortality in patients with biochemical recurrence&#xD;
      following radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior definitive treatment with radical prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy&#xD;
             (external beam or brachytherapy). Patients may have received post prostatectomy&#xD;
             radiation therapy in the adjuvant setting or for biochemical recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormone sensitive prostate cancer as evidence by a serum total testosterone level&#xD;
             within the institution's normal range £4 weeks of registration. (Patients may have&#xD;
             received hormonal therapy in the adjuvant setting provided the last dose was ³ one&#xD;
             year from the date of enrollment.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have evidence of biochemical progression as determined by 3 PSA&#xD;
             measures. (PSA-2, PSA-1 and PSA 0) The most recent PSA value (PSA0) will serve as the&#xD;
             baseline. All of these PSA values must be obtained at the same reference lab and the&#xD;
             earliest (PSA-2) ≥ eight weeks prior to registration, but ≤ six months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The most recent PSA value (PSA 0) must be drawn £ seven days of treatment and must be&#xD;
             greater than 0.4 ng/ml (after prostatectomy) or greater than ³1.5 ng ml (after&#xD;
             radiation therapy) at the time of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be at high risk for developing distant metastases by one of the&#xD;
             following criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Prostate specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) less than nine months calculated&#xD;

&#xD;
        where t = number of days between PSA- 2 and PSA-1 PSA-1 is the most recent PSA value PSA-2&#xD;
        is the next most recent PSA value Ln = natural log PSADT in months = PSADT divided by 30.4&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;

                  anticoagulation. Patients receiving anti-coagulation treatment with an agent such&#xD;
                  as warfarin or heparin may be allowed to participate. For patients on warfarin,&#xD;
                  the INR should be measured prior to initiation of Sorafenib and monitored at&#xD;
                  least weekly, or as defined by the local standard of care, until INR is stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men should agree to use adequate birth control during and for at least three months&#xD;
             after the last administration of Sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. A signed&#xD;
             informed consent must be obtained prior to any study specific procedures.&#xD;

             not be considered a candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Therapy modulating testosterone levels (such as leuteinizing-hormone releasing hormone&#xD;
             agonists/antagonists and antiandrogens) for treatment of biochemical recurrence of&#xD;
             prostate cancer. Treatment in the neoadjuvant setting is permissible if greater than 1&#xD;
             year prior to registration. Agents such as 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, ketoconazole,&#xD;
             megestrol acetate, systemic steroids, or herbal supplements that are known to affect&#xD;

             pressure &gt; 90 mmHg, despite optimal medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic Hepatitis B or C.&#xD;
             HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Sorafenib. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies may be undertaken in patients&#xD;
