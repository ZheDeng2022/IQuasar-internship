      1.0 INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classic articles by Kocher, Halsted, Lahey, Crile and Riddell have provided surgeons with&#xD;
      principles that have significantly reduced operative morbidity and mortality from&#xD;
      thyroidectomy. Nowadays, surgery of the thyroid gland is considered safe with practically&#xD;
      null mortality. Morbidity, although infrequent, is still a reason for concern. The&#xD;
      complications directly attributed to total thyroidectomy are hypoparathyroidism, recurrent&#xD;
      laryngeal nerve injury, hemorrhage, oesophageal perforation and trachea instability and&#xD;
      perforation. Furthermore, other complications, related to the surgical technique, such as&#xD;
      seroma or wound infection, may also occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several techniques are employed in order to resect the suffering thyroid gland. Classic&#xD;
      thyroidectomy (T) is considered today, the golden standard of total thyroid resection for&#xD;
      nodular goiter. One the other hand, new technologies and great experience of several surgeons&#xD;
      gave recently birth to a new technique named mini Video Assisted Thyroidectomy (miVAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is designed to compare data in regards to T versus miVAT in the late&#xD;
      postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the late postoperative course and complications of the patients using the two&#xD;
      techniques (T and miVAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 DESIGN AND STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a prospective randomized single center study. Any patient that is&#xD;
      scheduled for a total thyroidectomy for nodular goiter with nodules less that 4cm will be&#xD;
      offered participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 STUDY PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Pre-Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures preformed such as routine hospital examinations, antibiotic prophylactic&#xD;
      treatment, anticoagulant treatment and diet will be according to the standard management&#xD;
      protocol and will be recorded for the study. The following pre-surgery information will be&#xD;
      recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic information including: Date of birth (age), gender, ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
       10. Operation performed&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Procedure related comments&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Post-operative diagnosis including pathology report&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Weight of the gland&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dimensions of the gland&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Postoperative follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up evaluation will be performed on the 3rd and 6th month. The following information&#xD;
      will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Wound infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Average Pain score for patient resting and moving/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Postoperative labs (WBC, Ht, Hgb, SGOT, SGPT, LDH, Glc, Ure, Cre, K+, Na+, Ca2+,Mg2+,&#xD;
           TP, ALB, fT3, fT4, TSH, PTH, PT, aPTT, INR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sign of hypoparathyroidism (Chvostek and Trousseau)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Vocal alterations by patient (voice completely altered=10 to voice not altered=1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Vocal cord assessment by indirect laryngoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Comments&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 COMPLICATIONS AND ADVERSE EVENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator is required to notify the coordinator of any serious adverse events. The&#xD;
      coordinator is also required to notify the Ethics Committee according to local regulations&#xD;
      and requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Death regardless of cause&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any-life-threatening event&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Any hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Any event that results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity to the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the T with the miVAT techniques concerning the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative course of the patients in relation to complications during and post&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis included description of these intraoperative and postoperative outcomes,&#xD;
      and indication of patient characteristics associated with these outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to efficiently compare the two techniques random allocation of the patients within&#xD;
      two groups (Group A=T and Group B=miVAT) was employed. All patient with even number were&#xD;
      included in group A, while all patients with odd number were included in group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the study does not have pre-specified hypotheses all statistical analyses are&#xD;
      exploratory and interpretation of results should be within this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.0 DATA MONITORING PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coordinator will monitor all data accrual. Furthermore, the coordinator will review the&#xD;
      progress of the clinical trial including safety data and ensure as possible that it is&#xD;
      conducted, recorded and reported in accordance with the protocol, good clinical practice and&#xD;
      the applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.0 DATA CONFIDENTIALITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient ill be identified by his/her initials and a unique patient identification&#xD;
      number. Source data will be stored with source documents. Only personnel responsible for&#xD;
      collecting data and transcribing it into the case report forms will have access to the data.&#xD;
      Records will remain on site in secure areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.0 ETHICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to study institution review board (IRB) approval should be obtained. Any changes in the&#xD;
      study protocol, informed consent forms, or investigator must be re-approved by the IRB. All&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the study will provide their consent prior to entering the study. An&#xD;
      informed consent form shall be signed and dated by the patient. The investigator will retain&#xD;
      the forms as part of the study records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be executed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, in agreement with&#xD;
      the guidelines for conducting a clinical investigation in accordance with the principles of&#xD;
      ICH GCP outlined in the E6 document. By signing the present protocol, participants in the&#xD;
      study commit themselves to carry it out in accordance with local legal requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.0 INFORMED CONSENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients should have the capacity to provide an informed consent. The above&#xD;
      described inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to ensure the entry of the&#xD;
      appropriate population of patients to this study and will be approved by the local IRB.&#xD;
      Screening for these criteria will be conducted by the coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be educated about the research proposal by a study investigator. To&#xD;
      determine whether the patient has understood the issues, he/she will be asked to describe&#xD;
      what the research entails and whether they have any questions. All questions will be&#xD;
      addressed prior to enrollment. The patient can refuse participation in the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A written informed consent form will be generated. For each patient, a case report form (CRF)&#xD;
      will be completed, providing general medical information and history.&#xD;
