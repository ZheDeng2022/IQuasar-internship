  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective pilot clinical study to assess the utility of the Triage&#xD;
      NGAL Test - alone and in conjunction with the Triage BNP test - as an aid in the early risk&#xD;
      assessment for heart-failure-related adverse clinical outcomes (deaths, readmissions, and&#xD;
      additional emergent outpatient visits) through Day 30 and Day 90 in patients presenting with&#xD;
      acutely decompensated heart failure (HF). Its utility as an aid in the early risk assessment&#xD;
      for renal dysfunction in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure undergoing&#xD;
      treatment with IV diuretics will also be assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Approximately 200 adults presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) / hospital with acutely&#xD;
      decompensated HF will be enrolled. EDTA anti-coagulated blood samples will be collected for&#xD;
      measurement of blood NGAL levels (using the Triage NGAL Test) at the point of care in all&#xD;
      subjects at up to 8 different time points from presentation until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of these NGAL assessments will be blinded to the medical team during the study&#xD;
      and will not impact the medical management of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for unblinded assessment of both serum creatinine (analyzed at the hospital's&#xD;
      laboratory) and whole blood BNP (analyzed with the Triage BNP Test at the point-of-care or&#xD;
      laboratory) will also be obtained at some of the same time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dialysis, emergent outpatient visits for HF, hospitalizations and mortality will be recorded&#xD;
      through Day 30 and Day 90. If an additional serum creatinine has been obtained as standard&#xD;
      care near Day 30, it will also be recorded.&#xD;
