      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm if ketoconazole inhibition of CYP3A activity affects fractional excretion of&#xD;
           docetaxel in the urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the metabolite ratios of the major metabolites of docetaxel in the presence&#xD;
           and absence of CYP3A inhibition.&#xD;

      Introduction: This is a follow-up protocol to an earlier study entitled &quot;A phase I study of&#xD;
      docetaxel with ketoconazole modulation in solid tumors&quot; (PH14/01) which showed 2-fold&#xD;
      reduction in docetaxel clearance and a clear correlation with renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The aim of this study is to confirm that ketoconazole inhibition of CYP3A activity&#xD;
      changes the urinary excretion profile of docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This is a single-centre, crossover study. Ten patients (calculated sample size&#xD;
      =5, α=0.05, β=0.8, difference in means=5%, within group standard deviation=3) will be accrued&#xD;
      and randomly assigned to receive docetaxel at either 75mg/m2 q3w x 1 dose or 70mg q3w x 1&#xD;
      dose with ketoconazole 200mg bid x q3d at cycle 1 of chemotherapy. This will be followed by a&#xD;
      20-day washout period before receiving the other regimen of docetaxel at cycle 2. Blood&#xD;
      samples of 5mls each will be drawn at times 0, 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 3h, 4h, 6h and 24h after the&#xD;
      onset of docetaxel infusion for pharmacokinetics analysis. A 24-hour urine collection&#xD;
      commencing on the same day as docetaxel infusion will be required of the patients. All urine&#xD;
      over the next 24 hours must be collected and returned to the study coordinator on Day 2 of&#xD;
      each study cycle for docetaxel analysis and creatinine clearance determination. The amount of&#xD;
      docetaxel excreted by each patient with and without ketoconazole modulation will be&#xD;
      determined by a LCMSMS method and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Relevance: This is to ensure the safe advocation of a dose-sparing strategy&#xD;
      established in an earlier study for the costly agent docetaxel by confirming if changes in&#xD;
      excretion profile occurs once its major route of hepatic metabolism is blocked.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or&#xD;
             unresectable and for which docetaxel is indicated.&#xD;

          2. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. With the exception of alopecia, fatigue, nausea and asthenia, patients must have&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;

             negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study enrollment. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering&#xD;
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have rapidly progressive intracranial or spinal metastatic disease&#xD;
             (including patients who require corticosteroid for CNS disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to docetaxel or ketoconazole used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who have prior medications known to be metabolized by or induce/inhibit&#xD;
             CYP3A4 within 1 week of each treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because docetaxel is embryotoxic/fetotoxic&#xD;
             with the potential for abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with docetaxel, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with docetaxel. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
