      The primary objective of this study will be to determine the effects of physical activity in&#xD;
      patients during substantial surgery-induced weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled physical activity intervention trial in a group of patients&#xD;
      undergoing bariatric surgery for weight loss. The study will involve two sites with an active&#xD;
      bariatric surgery program, which have a strong track record of bariatric surgery research.&#xD;
      The study will include 160-200 subjects. Changes in the primary outcome variables will be&#xD;
      determined in previous gastric bypass patients as a result of 6 months of moderate physical&#xD;
      activity compared to an educational control group not engaged structured exercise.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study will be to determine the effects of physical activity in&#xD;
      patients during substantial surgery-induced weight loss. We propose to employ a randomized&#xD;
      controlled physical activity intervention trial in a group of patients undergoing bariatric&#xD;
      surgery for weight loss. The study will involve two sites with an active bariatric surgery&#xD;
      program, which have a strong track record of bariatric surgery research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment goals are 160-200 gastric bypass patients who will undergo 6 months of moderate&#xD;
      physical activity compared to an educational control group not engaged structured exercise.&#xD;
      Subjects will be included if their BMI is less than 55 kg/m2 prior to surgery and they are&#xD;
      located relatively close to centers for intervention sessions. At baseline (3 months&#xD;
      following surgery) and 6 months later (9 months following surgery), subjects will have a CT&#xD;
      scan, IV glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and muscle biopsy (~8 hour visit). They will be&#xD;
      scheduled for separate visits for a test of physical fitness (VO2max) and general body&#xD;
      composition (DXA scan)(~2 hour visit), and a 15-min sub-maximal exercise session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical activity group: Subjects will be progressed to 4-5 days per week, 30-45 min per&#xD;
           session (120-180 min per week) of moderate intensity exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control (educational) group: Subjects will receive their usual care following surgery&#xD;
           that includes information on physical activity. They will also be asked to participate&#xD;
           in monthly health education sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will promote this study as one that will help determine whether physical activity may be&#xD;
      beneficial in addition to their weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Insulin resistance and metabolic risk factors. Approach: To address Aim 1, we will&#xD;
      determine 6-month changes in insulin sensitivity in subjects after 3-month initial weight&#xD;
      loss from bariatric surgery. As outlined above, we will employ a randomized controlled&#xD;
      physical activity intervention trial in which half of the subjects will be entered into a&#xD;
      physical activity group, while the other half will participate in monthly health education&#xD;
      sessions (control). By randomizing these groups three months after initial weight loss, both&#xD;
      groups should begin the intervention with similar baseline characteristics (e.g. insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, body weight, physical fitness, etc.). We are not attempting to determine the&#xD;
      effect of the weight loss per se on insulin sensitivity. However, we realize that the amount&#xD;
      of weight loss could potentially have a major confounding influence on detecting changes in&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity between the two groups. Thus, we will examine the degree of weight loss&#xD;
      as a covariate in our analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Intramyocellular lipids and body composition. Approach: We will examine pre to post&#xD;
      intervention, changes in intramyocellular lipid determined with percutaneous biopsies, as&#xD;
      well as abdominal and intermuscular adipose tissue determined by CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Mitochondria content, function and fat oxidation. Approach: We will use three&#xD;
      complimentary measures to quantify changes in oxidative metabolism before and after the&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial described above. All three of these measures will make specific&#xD;
      contributions to this specific aim. Rates of resting post-absorptive fat oxidation will be&#xD;
      measured with indirect calorimetry. Since skeletal muscle accounts for the vast majority of&#xD;
      energy production during physical activity, sub-maximal exercise is a good model to assess&#xD;
      skeletal muscle fatty acid metabolism. We will employ whole body gas exchange indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry during moderate exercise designed to elicit high rates of fatty acid oxidation.&#xD;
      The non-invasive measures of systemic fat oxidation during both resting and exercise&#xD;
      conditions procedures take very little time and present relatively little burden on the&#xD;
      volunteers or technical staff, thus providing an efficient means to obtain significant&#xD;
      information concerning the capacity for fat oxidation in vivo. Muscle biopsy samples will be&#xD;
      obtained before and after the trial to measure changes in the oxidative capacity (electron&#xD;
      transport chain activity, in vitro fatty acid oxidation, muscle fiber type and oxidative&#xD;
      enzyme (succinate dehydrogenase) staining activity of muscle.&#xD;

             glucose homeostasis (oral glucocorticoids, nicotinic acid)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females currently on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can participate in the study if&#xD;
             they have been on HRT for at least 6 months and will continue to be on HRT during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disqualifying findings on physical examination include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lower extremity thrombophlebitis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence of peripheral neuropathy, paresis or edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If the resting EKG prior to the exercise test shows any abnormalities, the test will not be&#xD;
        conducted. If any abnormalities develop during the test, the test will be stopped. On both&#xD;
        occasions, the participant will be referred to their PCP for further evaluation and will&#xD;
        only be allowed to continue the study with written clearance by his/her PCP or&#xD;
        cardiologist. American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) criteria will be used to halt&#xD;
        maximal exercise testing should adverse cardiovascular responses develop. Only after a&#xD;
        cardiologist interprets the resting and exercise ECG of the participant and clears them for&#xD;
        exercise, will subjects be able to continue with the study&#xD;
