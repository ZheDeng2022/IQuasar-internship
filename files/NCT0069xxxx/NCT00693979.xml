    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the safety and performance of two stents coated with the same drug&#xD;
      (the TAXUS Element Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent System and the TAXUS Express2&#xD;
      Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent System).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1264 subjects at a maximum of 100 clinical sites will be part of this study.&#xD;
      This study will recruit approximately 30 subjects from NHC &amp; NUH (12 from NUH) over a period&#xD;
      of 6 to 9 months recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel is the active ingredient in Taxol®, a drug originally developed to treat cancer.&#xD;
      The addition of the paclitaxel coating to the stent could improve the performance of the&#xD;
      stent by preventing the re-narrowing of the treated coronary artery. This re-narrowing is&#xD;
      called restenosis. Restenosis can occur after balloon angioplasty or the placement of a stent&#xD;
      and is the result of too much cell growth at the treatment site in the coronary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TAXUS Element stent is an investigational device. The term investigational means that the&#xD;
      stent is not currently approved for commercial use by the FDA or other regulatory agencies&#xD;
      worldwide. The TAXUS Express 2 stent is also a coronary stent made with the same drug coating&#xD;
      as the Element stent. It is approved for commercial use by the FDA and other regulatory&#xD;
      agencies worldwide, with the exception of the 4.0 mm size, which is not yet approved by the&#xD;
      FDA. However, the 4.0 mm size was studied for safety and performance in a clinical trial and&#xD;
      the results of that trial have been submitted to FDA to support approval. FDA has agreed that&#xD;
      the 4.0 mm size may be used in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel was selected as the drug to coat the stent because it is known to prevent the&#xD;
      uncontrolled cell growth that contributes to the narrowing of artery, by interfering with the&#xD;
      ability of cells to divide and multiply. Because of these properties, it has been used as a&#xD;
      drug for the treatment of various types of cancer. Cancer patients are given paclitaxel as a&#xD;
      solution into the vein. For this study, paclitaxel will be administered locally to the wall&#xD;
      of coronary artery as a coating on the stent. Cancer patients receive a dose of paclitaxel&#xD;
      approximately 1100 - 1400 times greater than the dose used in the coating of the stent. It is&#xD;
      highly unlikely that levels of paclitaxel in the blood would be measurable or have effects&#xD;
      anywhere beyond the heart.&#xD;
