      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of topical application of omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids (6% by volume) containing cream on persons with a TMD disorder, specifically with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of Myofacial Pain. Omega-3 fatty acids have minimal side effects when applied&#xD;
      topically. If Omega-3 fatty acids used in this study are shown to reduce myofacial pain then&#xD;
      this formulation could potentially be used for treatment of TMD patents with myofacial pain&#xD;
      in the future. Omega-3 fatty acids are natural ingredients with almost no side effects.&#xD;
      Topical application can lead to fewer side effects than systemic medications. In addition,&#xD;
      there is no substantial morbidity &amp; mortality associated with topical application of Omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids. It is hypothesized that subjects receiving topical application of omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids will demonstrate reduced subjective masseter muscle pain in comparison to subjects&#xD;
      receiving placebo cream. This is a pilot study to assess the topical application of Omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids on muscle pain in the muscles of mastication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of clinically significant temporomandibular disorder (TMD)-related jaw pain&#xD;
      has been estimated to be between 3% and 5%. Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a group of&#xD;
      conditions characterized by pain or dysfunction in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), the&#xD;
      articular disc and/or the muscles of mastication. TMD is typically classified into three&#xD;
      major diagnostic categories, using RDC-TMD classification criteria these would include&#xD;
      Myofacial pain (with or without limitation), Disc Displacements (with and without reduction,&#xD;
      including with a limited opening,) and Arthralgia, Arthritis and Arthrosis. These pain&#xD;
      problems are about twice as common in women as in men in the general population and even four&#xD;
      times more common in women in patient populations. A wide range of treatment modalities have&#xD;
      been used for the management of myofacial pain. Physical treatments include ultrasound&#xD;
      therapy, appliance therapy, intramuscular and nerve root stimulation, anesthetic injection,&#xD;
      botulinum toxin injection and dry needling of trigger points, physical therapy, acupuncture&#xD;
      and spray and stretch. The major goal of these treatments is to relieve pain and tightness of&#xD;
      the involved muscles. Omega-3 fatty acids or fish oil are a family of polyunsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are powerful anti-inflammatories and lower proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines. However to obtain any discernible beneficial effects, large doses of Omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids are required. Thus, topically applied alternatives prove beneficial over systemic&#xD;
      routes. Studies show the anti-inflammatory properties of the Omega-3 fatty acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of topical application of omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids (6% by volume) containing cream on persons with a TMD disorder, specifically with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of Myofacial Pain. Omega-3 fatty acids have minimal side effects when applied&#xD;
      topically. If Omega-3 fatty acids used in this study are shown to reduce myofacial pain then&#xD;
      this formulation could potentially be used for treatment of TMD patents with myofacial pain&#xD;
      in the future. Omega-3 fatty acids are natural ingredients with almost no side effects.&#xD;
      Topical application can lead to fewer side effects than systemic medications. In addition,&#xD;
      there is no substantial morbidity &amp; mortality associated with topical application of Omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids. It is hypothesized that subjects receiving topical application of omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids will demonstrate reduced subjective masseter muscle pain in comparison to subjects&#xD;
      receiving placebo cream. This is a pilot study to assess the topical application of Omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids on muscle pain in the muscles of mastication.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be recruited who are ages 18 to 70 with a current diagnosis of myofacial&#xD;
             pain (using RDC-TMD criteria) including pain on palpation of the masseter muscle.&#xD;
             Subjects will be recruited from the Oral Medicine Clinic, School of Dentistry. Because&#xD;
             this is a small pilot study, and there will not be sufficient sample size/power, only&#xD;
             female subjects will be recruited, as temporomandibular disorder is more prevalent in&#xD;
             women than men. Additional inclusion criteria include a &quot;Characteristic Pain&#xD;
             Intensity&quot; (CPI) self reported score of three or more. This will be recorded on&#xD;
             &quot;Baseline Questionnaire&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study exclusion criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
               7. Temporomandibular joint surgery on the affected side&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Allergy to any of the ingredients in the placebo and the active cream.&#xD;
