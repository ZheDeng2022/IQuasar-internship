      This study will compare levels of p11 protein in people with and without major depressive&#xD;
      disorder (MDD) and examine if p11 levels in patients are affected by treatment with&#xD;
      citalopram (Celexa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with chronic or recurrent major depression between 18&#xD;
      and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric interview and medical examination, questions about family history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with MDD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - Evaluation and Discontinuation of Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, electrocardiogram, blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gradual antidepressant medication withdrawal, followed by 2- to 6-week drug-free period.&#xD;
           If needed, medicines for anxiety and difficulty sleeping may be prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Citalopram Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start daily citalopram treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluations at the start of phase 2 and every week for 8 weeks with following&#xD;
           procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms ratings interview and questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of side effects and new medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and pulse measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, plans are developed for long-term treatment and transfer of care to&#xD;
      the patient s own physician.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious, debilitating, life-shortening illness that&#xD;
      affects many persons of all ages and backgrounds. While treatments are effective for a&#xD;
      significant portion of patients with MDD, progress in developing more effective treatments is&#xD;
      lagging. Furthermore, with regards to existing antidepressant medications, there are yet no&#xD;
      reliable predictors of the likelihood of remission, response or non-response with an initial&#xD;
      trial of an antidepressant medication. Identifying factors that are likely to predict&#xD;
      response would have the advantage of personalizing treatment to a particular individual; that&#xD;
      is selecting the antidepressant medication that is most likely to give the greatest&#xD;
      probability of having a favorable outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serotonin system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and mechanism&#xD;
      of action of existing effective antidepressant treatments. Fourteen different serotonin&#xD;
      receptors have been identified to date. One of them, 5-HT1B, plays an important role in&#xD;
      regulating serotonin neurotransmission. Recently, p11 (a member of the S100 family of&#xD;
      proteins) was found to interact with 5-HT1B receptors (Svenningsson et al 2006; Svenningsson&#xD;
      and Greengard 2007). p11 mRNA levels are markedly reduced in the forebrain in helpless&#xD;
      H/Rouen mice and the level of p11 mRNA was down-regulated in the anterior cingulate cortex&#xD;
      from depressed patients. p11 mRNA is distributed in an anatomical pattern that closely&#xD;
      resembled that of 5-HT1B receptor mRNA, including cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and raphe&#xD;
      nuclei. Chronic administration of the antidepressants imipramine, tranylcypromine, and&#xD;
      citalopram significantly increase the level of p11 in cortex. Finally, we have found that&#xD;
      chronic treatment with fluoxetine increases p11 in peripheral mononuclear cells in monkeys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will now study whether the blood cell levels of p11 differ between healthy individuals and&#xD;
      patients suffering from unipolar depression. Moreover, we will study whether the levels of&#xD;
      p11 are affected by treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram.&#xD;
      Complementary work will continue at other laboratories to better characterize the role of p11&#xD;
      in the pathophysiology of depression (e.g., animal studies, post-mortem studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will also acquire a battery of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in a&#xD;
      subset of 45 more homogeneous depressed subjects, and 45 matched healthy controls at baseline&#xD;
      and at 8 weeks. There is a growing body of evidence implicating morphometric and physiologic&#xD;
      abnormalities, measureable by MRI, in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder. We&#xD;
      will assess both baseline differences between depressed subjects and healthy controls,&#xD;
      treatment effects, and search for possible MRI markers predicting treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label study which will be performed at the National Institute of Mental&#xD;
      Health. In all, 82 adult subjects with major depressive disorder, between the ages of 18 and&#xD;
      65 years, will be recruited from the community. In addition, we will perform p11 measurements&#xD;
      in blood cells from 64 healthy control subjects.&#xD;
