      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra-tracheal intubation of a patient is a most delicate medical procedure performed&#xD;
      under often life-threatening conditions in in- and out-of-hospital acute care medicine.&#xD;
      Correct placement of the tube after intra-tracheal intubation is thus absolutely vital.&#xD;
      Incorrect position of the tube can be fatal through loss of the airway or through barotrauma&#xD;
      of the airway and lungs possibly leading to cardiac arrest. The mid-tracheal point of the&#xD;
      trachea is the perfect place for an intra-tracheal tube to be to guarantee ventilatory&#xD;
      support without problems for neonates and children. Supra-sternal palpation of the tube tip&#xD;
      (SSTTP) is a method validated in newborns only, which has a very high accuracy rate in&#xD;
      placing the tube-tip at the mid-tracheal point. In addition, it is easy to learn and without&#xD;
      side effects. In infants and children, SSTTP is widely used in Switzerland although never&#xD;
      validated in a controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate supra-sternal palpation of the endo-tracheal tube tip as a valuable measure to&#xD;
      correctly determine the depth of intubation in infants from one month of age to children up&#xD;
      to eight years of age, when correct depth of the tube-tip is defined as tube-tip being within&#xD;
      plus/minus 0.25cm of the line between the medial points of the claviculae (IMP) for infants&#xD;
      and within plus/mius 0.25 respectively plus/mius 0.38cm for toddlers and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supra-sternal Tube Tip Palpation (SSTTP) is a valid and easy to perform measure to identify&#xD;
      the correct depth of intubation after oral or nasal tracheal intubation in infants, toddlers&#xD;
      and children. Correct depth is defined as tube tip placed within plus/minus 0.25cm of the IMP&#xD;
      for infants and within plus/minus 0.25 respectively plus/minus 0.38cm for toddlers and&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty-four toddlers and children and 18 infants will be enrolled into the study. Three&#xD;
      Respiratory Therapists (RT) from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) will be trained in&#xD;
      SSTTP before the start of the study. Successful training of the RTs will be confirmed by&#xD;
      x-ray before final qualification as &quot;Expert in SSTTP&quot;. All patients with an intubation&#xD;
      requiring a post-manipulation x-ray in the PICU at CHEO will be enrolled into the study. No&#xD;
      randomization will be necessary; all infants and children in need of an intubation will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study. Potential patients will be excluded if there is presence of&#xD;
      anatomical malformation or any other reason that would prevent accurate SSTTP, or if there is&#xD;
      no Expert in SSTTP available. The location of the tip of the tube after SSTTP will be&#xD;
      measured on standard post-intubation x-rays by a radiologist. The tube-tip location&#xD;
      difference will be calculated as the difference between the actual tube-tip location and the&#xD;
      IMP.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &quot;Primary intubations&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All infants and children from 1 month of age up to the end of the seventh year of&#xD;
                  life, who are being intubated for medical reasons on the pediatric intensive care&#xD;
                  unit (PICU) at the Children's hospital of Eastern Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &quot;Secondary intubations&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All infants and children from 1 month of age up to the end of the seventh year of&#xD;
                  life already intubated in the PICU at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario,&#xD;
                  who's tube needs to be exchanged, who's tube needs to be repositioned according a&#xD;
                  previous x-ray or who's tube needs any other manipulation requiring a&#xD;
                  post-manipulation chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &quot;Primary, peracute intubations&quot;. Intubations required at once or within a few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anatomical malformation of the child's or infant's airway, lungs or neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tracheostoma, history of tracheotomy, jugular scars or any other reason that might&#xD;
             prevent accurate supra-sternal palpation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After placement of the tube according to supra-sternal palpation, any difficulties&#xD;
             ventilating the patient or endo-bronchial intubation as per auscultation will lead to&#xD;
             placement of the tube according to previously used criteria. The case will be&#xD;
             described but the patient excluded from determination of the tube tip placement with&#xD;
             x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any case when the study procedures had to be discontinued because the treating&#xD;
             physician or RT felt that care could be disrupted by virtue of the study procedures.&#xD;
             The case will be described but the patient excluded from determination of the tube tip&#xD;
             placement with x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unavailability of an expert in SSTTP at the time point of needed intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For ethical reasons, we will exclude patients who we know will have a detrimental&#xD;
             outcome despite intubation.&#xD;
