    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn about an herbal product called Hoodia gordonii. We want&#xD;
      to know if Hoodia gordonii affects blood pressure, heart rate (pulse), heart pressures, and&#xD;
      the heart's electrical conduction system. To participate in this study you must be a healthy&#xD;
      volunteer with no known medical problems.&#xD;

      If you decide to join this research study you will come in for two visits one week apart.&#xD;
      Each visit will last 8 hours (you will not be required to stay in the exam room for the&#xD;
      entire day). During the first visit you will be assigned, by chance, like the flip of a coin,&#xD;
      to get either Hoodia gordonii or placebo. A placebo is a pill that looks like the herbal&#xD;
      supplement but does not have any active ingredients in it. During the second visit you will&#xD;
      get either Hoodia or placebo, whichever you did not get during the first visit. Neither you&#xD;
      nor your study doctor will know ahead of time if you will get Hoodia or placebo during the&#xD;
      first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose to participate in this study you have the following tests performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Electrocardiogram (ECG): this is a test that measures the electrical activity in the&#xD;
      heart. This test involves placing 10 stickers on the chest and stomach and will last about 1&#xD;
      minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Blood Pressure: this is a test that involves placing a cuff on your arm and inflating it.&#xD;
      Blood pressure cuffs might make you feel uncomfortable when they inflate, but it is not&#xD;
      painful. The cuff will be placed on your arm for approximately 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Hemodynamics: these are tests that measure the pressures in the heart. This test involves&#xD;
      placing 4 stickers (2 on your neck and 2 on your stomach) and is done while lying down. This&#xD;
      test will last about 3 minutes and will be done at the same time as the blood pressure test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each test (A through C) will be performed a total of 10 times (5 times each study visit).&#xD;
      Women of child bearing age will be required to take a urine pregnancy test. Pregnant women&#xD;
      are not eligible to participate in this study. An outline of a study day is provided below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Arrive at the exam room. ECG, Blood Pressure, and Hemodynamics are measured (for&#xD;
           example, 8:00am).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Take the study pill (for example, 8:15am).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Return to exam room 1 hour after taking the study pill to have ECG, Blood Pressure, and&#xD;
           hemodynamics measured (for example, 9:15am).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Return to the exam room 3 hours after taking the study pill to have ECG, Blood Pressure,&#xD;
           and hemodynamics measured (for example, 11:15am).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Return to the exam room 5 hours after taking the study pill to have ECG, Blood Pressure,&#xD;
           and hemodynamics measured (for example, 1:15pm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Return to the exam room 8 hours after taking the study pill to have ECG, Blood Pressure,&#xD;
           and hemodynamics measured (for example, 4:15pm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Return to exam room 1 week later and repeat the day outlined above. Your participation in&#xD;
      this study will last 1 week.&#xD;
