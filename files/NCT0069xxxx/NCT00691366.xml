      The purpose of this research is to study heart rate patterns in people with moderate to&#xD;
      severe atopic dermatitis and how itching affects those patterns.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult men and women who are between 18 and 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis confirmed by published consensus&#xD;
             diagnostic criteria26 (except for healthy control subjects). Severity will be based on&#xD;
             an investigator's global assessment score and will have to be moderate or severe (IGA)&#xD;
             (see Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be in general good health with no other skin disease, disease state or&#xD;
             physical condition which would impair evaluation of their skin or which would increase&#xD;
             their health risk by study participation as determined by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child bearing potential will be required to have a negative pregnancy test in&#xD;
             order to enroll in the study and will be required to maintain adequate birth control&#xD;
             throughout the study. Reliable methods of birth control are: abstinence, oral&#xD;
             contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), DepoProvera, Norplant, tubal ligation, or&#xD;
             vasectomy of the partner (with confirmed negative sperm counts) in a monogamous&#xD;
             relationship. An acceptable, although less reliable, method involves the careful use&#xD;
             of condoms and spermicidal foam or gel and/or a cervical cap or sponge.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must cease using topical agents on the forearm where experimental data is&#xD;
             going to be collected at least 1 week prior. Topical agents can be used on all other&#xD;
             parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be required to cease use of oral antihistamines for a period of one week&#xD;
             prior to and during the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults over age 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children less than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to complete the required measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis with other diseases that would affect the measurement of heart rate&#xD;
             variability as determined by the investigators such as cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
             hypertension, bradycardia (&lt;60 beats per minute) and tachycardia (&gt;100 beats per&#xD;
             minute) amongst others.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis with other skin diseases that would affect the measurement of transepidermal&#xD;
             water loss (TEWL) and skin hydration as determined by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently enrolled in any investigational study in which the subject is receiving any&#xD;
             type of drug, biologic, or non-drug therapy and subjects undergoing treatment with&#xD;
             another investigational drug or approved therapy for investigational use within 28&#xD;
             days prior to study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consistent consumption of more than 4 caffeinated beverages per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current treatment with oral lipophilic beta blockers, antihistamines, opioids,&#xD;
             glucocorticoids, theophylline, anticholinergic medication or inhaled beta-agonists or&#xD;
             anticholinergics or other medications known to interfere autonomic nervous system&#xD;
             physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asthma/Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease or other respiratory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neuropathy causing diseases such as uremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled thyroid disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of illicit drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder27;28.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of chronic urticaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of anaphylactic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to histamine.&#xD;
