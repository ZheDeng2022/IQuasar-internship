      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety of four different doses of radiation therapy&#xD;
      followed by to surgery to remove prostate tumor.&#xD;

      Patients in Groups 1 and 2 will receive 39.6 Gy and 45 Gy (at 1.8 Gy/fraction), respectively,&#xD;
      to the whole pelvis. Patients in Groups 3 and 4 will receive 45 Gy to the whole pelvis,&#xD;
      followed by a boost to the prostate and periprostatic tissue, for total doses of 50.4 and 54&#xD;
      Gy, respectively. The patients will then undergo radical prostatectomy between 4-8 weeks&#xD;
      after completion of radiation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have biopsy-confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a negative bone scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have &quot;high-risk&quot; prostate cancer, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. PSA &gt;/= 20, and/or B. Gleason Score (GS) &gt;/= 8, and/or C. Clinical stage T3 disease per&#xD;
        AJCC Staging Manual, 6th edition; or D. At least two out of three of the following: PSA&#xD;
        10-19.9, GS = 7, or clinical stage = T2b / T2c.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be medically fit to undergo surgery as determined by treating urologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be under 70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  KPS must be &gt;/= 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have a synchronous primary tumor, or a previous cancer unless&#xD;
             disease free for &gt;/= 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have had prior pelvic radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or androgen&#xD;
             deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must freely sign informed consent to enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic disease as demonstrated by bone scan, CT scan or MRI of the pelvis, or&#xD;
             chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically documented positive pelvic lymph nodes. If Pre-operative CT scan or MRI&#xD;
             (ordered at the discretion of the treating physicians) demonstrates lymph nodes which&#xD;
             are suspicious for involvement, then biopsy must be undertaken and nodes proven&#xD;
             negative before patient can enroll on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Declared high-risk for anesthesia by attending anesthesiologist, cardiologist, or&#xD;
             other physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior pelvic radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of androgen deprivation therapy or chemotherapy.&#xD;
