  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have inoperable non-small cell lung cancer are presently treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Despite this combined approach, the vast majority of&#xD;
      patients will have their cancer recur after treatment. A recurrence is not curable at this&#xD;
      time. Because of the sensitivity of surrounding structures to chest irradiation, it has not&#xD;
      been possible to give radiation doses that can cure many of these tumors. Intensity-modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy is a special form of radiotherapy delivery that allows doctors to reduce&#xD;
      the amount of radiation dose to normal tissues and therefore reduce side effects. The&#xD;
      reduction of radiation side effects may allow more radiation to be delivered to tumors,&#xD;
      therefore improving tumor control and possibly longevity of patients. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine whether the combination of custom designed intensity-modulated&#xD;
      radiotherapy (based on individual tumor anatomy) with regular chemotherapy, will be safe&#xD;
      enough to allow further intensification of radiation treatment.&#xD;

      All patients must have a satisfactory IMRT plan prior to starting radiation therapy, which&#xD;
      will commence concurrently with chemotherapy. All patients will be treated to a minimum of 48&#xD;
      Gy in 20 daily fractions over 4 weeks [2.4 Gy per fraction (fx)], to the planning target&#xD;
      volume (PTV) defined by pre chemotherapy CT with PET imaging. This is approximately&#xD;
      biologically equivalent to a dose of 54 Gy in 27# (5 fractions/week). A differential boosting&#xD;
      will then be selected from one of 5 dose escalation schemes. The total individual&#xD;
      radiotherapy dose will be prescribed according to the highest dose level that can satisfy all&#xD;
      of the set radiotherapy planning constraints for the individual's anatomy. The trial will&#xD;
      proceed in 2 phases. In the first phase only the first 3 dose escalation schedules will be&#xD;
      used. Once all of these 3 schedules have been deemed safe then dose levels 4 and 5 will be&#xD;
      opened up to participation.&#xD;
