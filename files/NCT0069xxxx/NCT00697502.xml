      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with TYMS 2R/2R or 2R/3R appear to be more sensitive to fluoropyrimidines,&#xD;
      conferring a higher risk of grade 3-4 fluoropyrimidine related toxicity and a higher response&#xD;
      rate compared with 3R/3R. The genotype 3R/3R is more common in East Asia and is associated&#xD;
      with greater tolerability to fluoropyrimidine as measured by lower toxicity but also lower&#xD;
      response rates. As sensitivity to fluoropyrimidine appears to be affected by TYMS genotype,&#xD;
      we hypothesise that patients with TYMS 3R/3R are more tolerant to standard doses of&#xD;
      capecitabine and require higher doses to overcome fluoropyrimidine resistance. We designed&#xD;
      this study to develop TYMS genotype specific dosing of capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine twice a day for two weeks&#xD;
           followed by one week rest period (intermittent schedule) in patients with the advanced/&#xD;
           and or metastatic cancer based on TYMS genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine a suitable phase II dose of intermittent schedule capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To perform plasma pharmacokinetics of capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the relationship between genes of relevance in the fluoropyrimidine pathway&#xD;
           with pharmacokinetics and toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>Pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed during cycle 1 on days 1 and 14 at the following time points:&#xD;
Baseline (predose), and 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, 5 hr and 6 hr after dosing. Blood samples will be centrifuged at 1500 g and 4oC for 10 min and supernatant plasma removed and stored below -20oC until analysis. Plasma concentrations of capecitabine and its metabolites will be quantified by a validated liquid chromatography with mass-spectrometry detection (LC-MS-MS) method</description>

    <description>Capecitabine (XELODA) is supplied as biconvex, oblong film-coated tablets for oral administration and will be obtained from NUH Cancer Centre pharmacy.&#xD;
Each light peach-colored tablet contains 150 mg capecitabine and each peach-colored tablet contains 500 mg capecitabine. Capecitabine is to be administered orally within 30 minutes after the end of a meal (breakfast, dinner). Tablets should be swallowed with about 200 mL of water (not fruit juices). Capecitabine will be administered for 14 days followed by a 7 day rest period.</description>
