  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), is defined as the difference between the mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure (MAP) and the intraocular pressure (IOP.)It has been hypothesized that&#xD;
      unopposed decreases in MAP, increases in IOP or a combination of the two may result in hypo&#xD;
      perfusion of the eye and can cause an ocular infarction at the level of the retina or optic&#xD;
      nerve, leading to varying degrees of visual loss which is frequently bilateral and&#xD;
      irreversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the prone position and downward head tilting (Trendelenburg position) have been&#xD;
      associated with increases in IOP compared to the supine horizontal position (2,4,5,6), but it&#xD;
      is not known whether the Trendelenburg position during surgery and anesthesia is associated&#xD;
      with POVL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our preliminary Phase I studies using awake volunteers confirmed the increase in IOP&#xD;
      associated with the prone position which is attenuated, although not eliminated, with a 15 cm&#xD;
      head up table elevation. In addition we found evidence of retinal vascular changes consistent&#xD;
      with venous congestion over a one hour period in the prone position in five awake volunteers&#xD;
      using digital retinal imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that general anesthesia decreases IOP. A critical element, however, which has not&#xD;
      been definitively studied is the effect of individual anesthetics, specifically nitrous&#xD;
      oxide, on IOP. It is known that nitrous oxide does increase IOP when inert gases are injected&#xD;
      into the vitreous for treatment of retinal detachment and this phenomenon can last up to six&#xD;
      weeks, resulting in permanent vision loss with its use. It has also been shown that nitrous&#xD;
      oxide increases intracranial pressure (ICP,9) although this effect may be attenuated by&#xD;
      narcotics and additional intravenous anesthetic agents. It also increases cerebral metabolic&#xD;
      rate, potentially aggravating any compromise in blood flow. Several studies showed a&#xD;
      significant association between elevated IOP and ICP. Therefore, it is critical to attempt to&#xD;
      isolate the effect of nitrous oxide on IOP. Because nitrous oxide is used as an adjunct to&#xD;
      other anesthetics, it is the most frequently used of all the inhalation anesthetics and&#xD;
      delineating its effect on this variable will help clinicians decide whether the advantage of&#xD;
      its use outweighs the risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because general anesthesia decreases IOP and there is significant variation between subjects&#xD;
      this study is planned using a within subject design. Patients undergoing open gynecological&#xD;
      procedures such as hysterectomies and patients undergoing orthopedic surgery are ideal&#xD;
      candidates for the proposed study for the following reasons. The majority of patients&#xD;
      undergoing general anesthesia in University Hospital operating rooms require frequent table&#xD;
      position changes which might affect the results. Therefore, we choose to study patients who&#xD;
      will remain in one position for the majority of the operation. The hysterectomy patients&#xD;
      offer a unique benefit because It would also be advantageous to study patients in a position&#xD;
      known to increase IOP in order to better detect differences in anesthetic regimen and isolate&#xD;
      the effects of a specific agent. In addition, patients undergoing orthopedic surgery such as&#xD;
      hand and ankle procedures are commonly in a fixed supine position for the predominance of the&#xD;
      operation. University Hospital conducts a considerably greater number of orthopedic cases&#xD;
      than gynecological cases daily which allows for greater ease in patient enrollment. Measuring&#xD;
      IOP in the supine Trendelenburg position offers significant technical and logistical&#xD;
      advantages compared to the prone position and therefore taking our measurements in this&#xD;
      position is desirable.&#xD;
