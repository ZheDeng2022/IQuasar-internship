  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a common cause of morbidity and death in intensive care units. Clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory signs of systemic inflammation, including changes in body temperature,&#xD;
      tachycardia, or leukocytosis, are neither sensitive nor specific enough for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      sepsis. The diagnosis of sepsis is difficult, because clinical signs are unspecific. These&#xD;
      signs include tachycardia, leucocytosis, tachypnoea, and pyrexia, which are collectively&#xD;
      termed a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS is very common in critically&#xD;
      ill patients, being found in various conditions including trauma, surgery, burns,&#xD;
      pancreatitis, post-cardiac arrest syndrome, cardiac surgery. Microbiological culture can be&#xD;
      used to distinguish sepsis from non-infectious conditions. However, this method lacks&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity, and there is often a substantial time delay. So these signs can&#xD;
      also be misleading because critically ill patients often present with the systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome without infection. This issue is of paramount importance,&#xD;
      since therapy and outcome differ greatly between patients with and those without sepsis;&#xD;
      clinicians are often prone to overuse antibiotic therapy being afraid of not treating a&#xD;
      potential infection or superinfection. Moreover, the widespread use of antibiotics for all&#xD;
      such patients is likely to increase antibiotic resistance, toxicity, and costs. On the&#xD;
      opposite, any delay in administration of antibiotics can be extremely detrimental for the&#xD;
      infected patient with an exponential increase of the odd ratio for death. Search for early&#xD;
      biomarker tools for the diagnosis of infection, initially promising, are quite challenged and&#xD;
      controversial nowadays because they can be more related to the inflammation response,&#xD;
      irrespective to the insult. Furthermore up to 40% of the infections remain strongly suspected&#xD;
      but not bacteriologically documented. Persisting researches are ongoing to find new markers&#xD;
      to better discriminate SIRS related to infection process from to SIRS not related to&#xD;
      infection. Cytokine profiles using multiplex analysis seems more related to the severity of&#xD;
      the SIRS than the trigger of the SIRS (infectious or non infectious diseases). Thus, new&#xD;
      tools have been developed to identify bacteria by detecting their DNA by various techniques.&#xD;
      These techniques have many potential interests over conventional microbiologic tests by&#xD;
      decreasing turnaround time (within a few hours 2-6 hours), reducing inhibitory effects of&#xD;
      prior use of antibiotics, detection of slow or fastidious growing organisms. However these&#xD;
      tests remain to be validated in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the current study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of plasma detection of&#xD;
      bacterial DNA in ICU patients with a clinical suspicion of bacterial infection.&#xD;

&#xD;
      SBP: Systemic blood pressure, MAP: Mean arterial blood pressure,&#xD;
&#xD;
      All codes and definitions are established prior to study initiation. The following&#xD;
      information are recorded: age and sex, admission category (medical, scheduled surgery, or&#xD;
      unscheduled surgery), origin (home, ward, or emergency room), and McCabe score, ICU and&#xD;
      hospital mortality. Severity of illness was evaluated on the first ICU day using the&#xD;
      Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)&#xD;
      score, and Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score. Knaus scale&#xD;
      definitions were used to record preexisting chronic organ failures including respiratory,&#xD;
      cardiac, hepatic, renal, and immune system failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence or absence of infections was documented according to the standard definitions&#xD;
      developed by the Centers for Disease Control; We will determine three groups: 1. patients&#xD;
      with documented infection 2. patients without documented infection and 3. patients with&#xD;
      suspected but non documented infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol Four centers will participate (65 beds overall). Along with clinical&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) measurements used in clinical routine lab&#xD;
      measurements, two blood samples (4.5 mL each) will be collected. CRP and PCT are collected&#xD;
      routinely when patient meet criteria for SIRS in all three ICUs to helps us distinguishing&#xD;
      infectious from non-infectious SIRS. One whole blood on EDTA will be rapidly processed for&#xD;
      bacterial/fungi DNA detection. (frozen until analysis or within 72 hours the sample kept at&#xD;
      4°C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second sample using tubes containing Gel and dipotassium EDTA allowing separation after&#xD;
      centrifugation (1500g for 10 minutes at 4°C) of the plasma from (white and red) blood cells&#xD;
      without any manipulation and thus lowering risk any nurses' occupational exposure. Then the&#xD;
      plasma will be stored at -80°C until analysis. Blood collection will be performed when SIRS&#xD;
      criteria will be met either at admission or later on during the ICU stay (suspicion of&#xD;
      surperinfection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial and Fungal DNA detection The bacterial and Fungal DNA detection will be performed&#xD;
      using the Multiplex PCR pathogen detection VYOOTM (SIRS-Lab GmbH, Jena, Germany). VYOOâ&#xD;
      combines culture-independent pathogen-derived nucleic acids concentration and multiplex&#xD;
      PCR-based species detection. The multiplex PCR delivers results of high therapeutic value&#xD;
      within ~6 hours and detects 34 bacterial and 6 fungal species that cause life-threatening&#xD;
      infections as well as five most frequent resistance markers. In order to ensure highest&#xD;
      clinical validity, the primer selection of the species and the antibiotic resistances bases&#xD;
      on international study results on septic infections. The system was proved to be far less&#xD;
      susceptible for contaminations than blood cultures or alternative NAT protocols and ensures&#xD;
      increased specificity and sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VYOOâ achieves its high sensitivity with the included sample preparation system LOOXSTER®&#xD;
      which bases on SIRS-Lab's proprietary PUREPROVE® technology. LOOXSTER® specifically&#xD;
      concentrates the minute quantity of bacterial and fungal DNA from a huge human DNA&#xD;
      background. Total DNA is applied onto an affinity chromatography column with a&#xD;
      matrix-immobilized DNA binding protein that recognizes definite motives within the pathogen&#xD;
      DNA. More than 90% of the human background DNA is removed. This effect substantially&#xD;
      increases the sensitivity of the downstream multiplex PCR protocol and simultaneously reduces&#xD;
      the time-to-result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogen cells within 5 ml whole blood are disrupted mechanically using glass beads&#xD;
      (0.1/2.5 mm in diameter) and a lysis device (e. g. FastPrep®-24, MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH,&#xD;
      USA). After a proteolytic digestion step, total DNA is isolated using a short spin column&#xD;
      protocol. The total DNA is dissolved in an appropriate buffer and applied to the LOOXSTER®&#xD;
      spin column. The final bacterial plus fungal/human DNA ratio is significantly increased and&#xD;
      the concentrated pathogen DNA is directly used for multiplex PCR. Generated pathogen specific&#xD;
      amplicons are visualized by gel electrophoresis and compared with VYOOâ-specific DNA length&#xD;
      markers for the proof of present pathogens or resistances. An alternative amplicon&#xD;
      attribution is achieved by hybridization (ATâ system, Clondiag), which ensures a higher&#xD;
      degree of specificity and sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokines detection by ELISA Dosage of plasma cytokines (IL-6, 8, 10) will be performed by&#xD;
      ELISA methods using commercially available kits (R&amp;D systems, Minneapolis, MN) or by Bio-Plex&#xD;
      Multiplex Cytokine Assay (BioRad Lab., Hercules, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endotoxin &amp; Peptidoglycan detection For endotoxin dosage, we used Limulus Amebocyte Lysate&#xD;
      (LAL) reagent water (LRW) (Biowhittaker) and non-pyrogenic pipettes and tips (Costar). The&#xD;
      samples will be diluted with LRW in non-pyrogenic 96-well culture plates (Costar). Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected in endotoxin free tubes containing a gel that after centrifugation&#xD;
      makes a barrier between the cellular pellet and the plasma (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,&#xD;
      NJ). The plasma will be then transferred to non-pyrogenic tubes and kept at -20°C until&#xD;
      tested. Detection of bacterial endotoxin in plasma is hindered by its yellow coloration that&#xD;
      interferes with the Limulus amebocyte lysate test and gives an absorbance at 405 nm, but also&#xD;
      by the presence of inhibitors. We overcame the background absorbance of plasma using a&#xD;
      Diazo-coupling Limulus amebocyte lysate assay that gives a magenta coloration (Associates of&#xD;
      Cape Cod Inc.). Furthermore, in order to inactivate the inhibitors, plasma were diluted 1:4&#xD;
      in LRW and heated for 30 min at 60°C as it has been shown that this dilution and heating&#xD;
      procedure allow optimal endotoxin detection in plasma. After heating, 50 μl of diluted plasma&#xD;
      were transferred in 96-well culture plate and incubated with the same volume of Limulus&#xD;
      amebocyte lysate for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction will be stopped, as specified by the&#xD;
      manufacturer, by successive addition of 50 μl of sodium nitrite in HCl, 50 μl of ammonium&#xD;
      sulfamate and 50 μl of N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine (NEDA) that form a diazotized magenta&#xD;
      derivative. The optical density will be read at 570 nm and endotoxin concentration will be&#xD;
      determined by comparison with an endotoxin standard curve. The detection limit of the test is&#xD;
      0.02 EU/ml of endotoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peptidoglycan will be measured according to a newly experimental procedure set up in Dr.&#xD;
      Cavaillon's laboratory. The technique that detects peptidoglycan from both Gram-positive and&#xD;
      Gram-negative bacteria has already been shown to detect peptidoglycan in plasma from patients&#xD;
      with sepsis. Because a patent has been applied no further technical information can be&#xD;
      presently provided in the present version but will be added as soon as possible.&#xD;
