  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective study was conducted to collect data from approximately 100 patients from 6&#xD;
      months to 18 years of age who were stung by a scorpion but were not treated with antivenom.&#xD;
      The study consisted of a review of hospital records of patients who were admitted for&#xD;
      intensive care management of scorpion envenomation, at the only two hospitals in North&#xD;
      America known to admit children routinely for scorpion sting management without antivenom.&#xD;
      The standard of care consisted of symptomatic and supportive care, including airway&#xD;
      maintenance, fluid and electrolyte support and, if necessary, sedation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objective was to document the clinical syndrome of scorpion envenomation in the&#xD;
      absence of antivenom treatment in pediatric patients. This was done to establish historical&#xD;
      control data on the time from sting to the time of resolution of signs of envenomation. These&#xD;
      historical control data are intended to be used for comparison with Alacramyn treated&#xD;
      patients in two prospective studies being conducted in Mexico and the U.S.for which a control&#xD;
      population could not otherwise be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of clinically important systemic signs of envenomation was determined&#xD;
      based upon overall investigator assessment of the last signs of any respiratory compromise,&#xD;
      any pathological agitation or other indicator of continuing illness (e.g., continuing need&#xD;
      for sedative administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate comparison of these historical data with prospective open label trials,&#xD;
      periodic assessments of the overall presence or absence of clinically important signs was&#xD;
      performed. Periodic assessments were also performed for each individual component indicator&#xD;
      of respiratory compromise and of pathological agitation, when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research nurse reviewed hospital discharge diagnoses for all pediatric charts coded for&#xD;
      &quot;scorpion sting&quot;. For these cases demographic, diagnostic, and therapeutic data were entered&#xD;
      on the case report form (CRF) as well as data necessary to assess compliance with study&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physician subinvestigator reviewed the research nurse's findings for the key outcome&#xD;
      indicators, which consisted of clinically important systemic signs of scorpion envenomation&#xD;
      and adjunctive sedation treatment (dose and timing of dose) when medical judgment was&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
