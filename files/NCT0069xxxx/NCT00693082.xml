  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to explore the effects of flaxseed supplementation and&#xD;
      determine whether it is a feasible and potentially effective dietary intervention among women&#xD;
      with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Women, ages 18-45, with clinically confirmed PCOS&#xD;
      (N=20) will be scheduled for baseline measures and then instructed and given supplies&#xD;
      necessary to follow a flaxseed supplemented (30 g/day) diet for a period of three months,&#xD;
      whereupon follow-up measures will be taken. Subjects will be asked to resume their typical&#xD;
      (unsupplemented) diet for another three months and a second set of follow-up measures will be&#xD;
      taken. Baseline levels of bioavailable and total testosterone, fasting insulin, glucose, and&#xD;
      triglycerides (TG), total/LDL/HDL cholesterol, body weight, degree of hirsutism and acne, and&#xD;
      menstrual cyclicity will be compared to levels at 3 and 6 month follow-up. The overall&#xD;
      hypothesis (based upon our work in men at risk for prostate cancer and data from one&#xD;
      case-study conducted in a woman with confirmed PCOS) is that during the time women receive&#xD;
      flaxseed supplementation they will experience reduced serum levels of testosterone, and total&#xD;
      and LDL cholesterol, as well as clinical evidence of hirsutism. Given the pilot nature of&#xD;
      this study, statistical analyses will be limited to simple descriptive statistics. We have&#xD;
      observed no negative side effects, other than minor gastro-intestinal occurrences (i.e.,&#xD;
      temporary increased flatulence, borborygmi, increased number of stools, etc.) associated with&#xD;
      flaxseed supplementation in our previous studies either with short or long-term use. Flaxseed&#xD;
      supplementation will be discontinued if indicated and the events reported to the&#xD;
      institutional review board.&#xD;
