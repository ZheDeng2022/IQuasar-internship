    <textblock>
      The broad objective of this proposal is to identify functional neuroanatomical correlates of&#xD;
      impairments in sustained attention during smoking abstinence. We will measure changes in&#xD;
      performance and regional blood oxygenation levels using fMRI while smokers and non-smokers&#xD;
      complete a task designed to assess sustained attention-or the continuous monitoring of&#xD;
      stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis is that smoking abstinence will result in impaired sustained attention&#xD;
      accompanied by decreases in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal in regions&#xD;
      associated with sustained attention including right fronto-parietal cortex, thalamus and&#xD;
      reticular activation system. Abstinence may also result in performance-related increases in&#xD;
      activation in brain regions associated with effortful processing including the anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex. We also hypothesize that smokers during the satiated state will exhibit&#xD;
      brain activity more similar to that of non-smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to task related brain responses, we will also measure changes in absolute&#xD;
      regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and hypothesize that abstinence will result in&#xD;
      significant decreases in regions associated with arousal (e.g., reticular activation system);&#xD;
      information processing (e.g., thalamus); and emotional regulation (e.g., anterior cingulate&#xD;
      cortex, prefrontal cortex).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Following an extended training period in which performance will become stable, smokers will&#xD;
      be tested in the 4 Tesla MRI scanner (GE LX NVi system) 24 hours after quitting smoking, and&#xD;
      tested satiated, while non-smokers will be tested in the scanner once under normal&#xD;
      conditions. This design will provide an assessment of how tobacco abstinence alters&#xD;
      information processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included smoker participants will smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day of a brand delivering&#xD;
      at least 0.5 mg nicotine (by FTC method) for at least two years and have afternoon end tidal&#xD;
      carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations of at least 10 ppm (confirming they are inhalers).&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for non-smoker participants is that they should have smoked less than 50&#xD;
      cigarettes in their lifetime, have not smoked or used any nicotine products during the last 6&#xD;
      months, and have afternoon end tidal CO of less than or equal to 5 ppm. In order to reduce&#xD;
      variability and ensure comparable stimulus exposure, participants will be required to be&#xD;
      right-handed, and have at least 20-30 corrected vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a screening session, all aspects of the study will be described to subjects and&#xD;
      informed consent will be acquired. Breath and saliva samples will be collected in order to&#xD;
      verify smoking status; and paper-and-pencil measures of smoking history, nicotine dependence,&#xD;
      and mood will be collected. Each subject will also complete a Brain Imaging and Analysis&#xD;
      Center (BIAC) approved fMRI subject screening form. For females of child bearing potential, a&#xD;
      blood sample will be taken for pregnancy testing. For all participants, a urine sample will&#xD;
      be taken for illicit drug testing. Finally, each subject will be escorted to the hospital&#xD;
      where they will view and be placed in a mock fMRI scanner for a short time in order to&#xD;
      increase familiarity with study procedures. Subjects who meet all selection criteria will be&#xD;
      scheduled for the remainder of sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will learn and practice a sustained attention task. The planned sustained&#xD;
      attention task, called the rapid visual information processing task (RVIP) requires&#xD;
      participants to identify series of three odd or three even numbers among a series of numbers&#xD;
      presented one at a time on a computer monitor. A control task in which participants press a&#xD;
      button when they see a '0' will also be practiced. Total task time is 15 minutes (practice&#xD;
      version) and each participant will be required to complete as many as 8 practice versions or&#xD;
      until 50% accuracy is achieved on two consecutive attempts. Training may require 2-8 visits&#xD;
      but will not exceed 2 hours and 40 minutes in total duration. One practice version of the&#xD;
      task will be conducted in the mock fMRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the training period, smoker participants will complete two fMRI scans and&#xD;
      non-smokers will complete one fMRI scan in which they will complete 1) undergo a five minute&#xD;
      resting state BOLD scan, 2) two 12.5 minute versions of the RVIP and 3) a 12.5-minute&#xD;
      'cue-viewing' task in which they view pictures of people smoking. For the 'satiated'&#xD;
      sessions, smoker participants will be instructed to smoke as usual before and after the&#xD;
      session. For the 'abstinent' session, smoker participants will be required to quit smoking&#xD;
      for 24 hours prior to the scan and 24 hours following the scan. Quitting will be verified&#xD;
      using CO and salivary cotinine and nicotine levels collected at the time of the scan and a&#xD;
      short session 24 hours after the scan. All smoker participants will be given information&#xD;
      about quitting smoking for 48 hours and we will answer questions about quitting smoking. The&#xD;
      order of the sessions-satiated first vs. abstinent first-will be randomly assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after their second scan, participants will attend a 30-minute office visit in which&#xD;
      they will complete questionnaires and the RVIP task.&#xD;
