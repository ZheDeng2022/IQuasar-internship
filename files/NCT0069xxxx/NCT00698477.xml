      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify hypermethylated genes in paired pretreatment breast tumor tissue and plasma&#xD;
           samples from locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer patients using a known gene&#xD;
           panel which includes APC1, Cyclin D2, RARB, RASSF1A, Twist, Hin1 and GSTP1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rationale: We and others have determined the optimal panel of genes that are able to&#xD;
           detect free DNA in plasma and serum. We will determine if the same panel of genes is&#xD;
           effective for detecting tumor DNA in the plasma of locally advanced and metastatic&#xD;
           breast cancer patients. Further, to determine if the methylation profile of the plasma&#xD;
           DNA for these genes is the same or different from the primary tumor at presentation, we&#xD;
           will analyze the primary tumor DNA from fresh frozen samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify methylation pattern changes in the same subset of patients' plasma samples&#xD;
           at 24 hours after completion of cycle 1 of chemotherapy and within 24 hours before cycle&#xD;
           2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: The optimal timing of sampling for methylation analysis that is reflective of the&#xD;
      tumors response to chemotherapy is not known. How soon methylation changes are observed,&#xD;
      whether they are high within 24 hours, as that tumor responds to chemotherapy, or whether&#xD;
      changes can be observed only some time after one cycle of chemotherapy will be studied. (3)&#xD;
      To also identify methylation pattern changes in breast tumor tissue after one cycle of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: To look for a correlation with plasma methylation patterns&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) To correlate our observed patterns of methylation pre- and post-treatment with clinical&#xD;
      parameters such as clinical and/or radiological response and patient outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In advanced breast cancer, it is often difficult to predict which patients will respond&#xD;
      favorably to systemic therapy to decide on treatment duration or options while minimizing&#xD;
      exposure to toxic effects. Our goal is to examine using locally advanced and metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer tumor tissue and plasma, the methylation profile patterns pre- and post&#xD;
      chemotherapy of a panel of biomarkers most commonly expressed in breast cancer and correlate&#xD;
      them with tumor response and patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that DNA methylation pattern changes at baseline and early into a course of&#xD;
      systemic therapy can predict disease response or progression as well as survival. In the long&#xD;
      term, this could prove clinically useful in limiting exposure to ineffective regimens and&#xD;
      allowing earlier identification of more effective systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core biopsies of breast tumor tissue are taken at baseline and after cycle 1 of&#xD;
      docetaxel/ketoconazole. Plasma samples are drawn at baseline, 24 hours after cycle 1&#xD;
      chemotherapy and 24 hours before cycle 2. Thirty patients' specimens (60 core biopsies and 90&#xD;
      plasma samples) will be utilized. Quantitative multiplex methylation-specific PCR will be&#xD;
      used for analyses of several tumor suppressor genes including APC1, Cyclin D2, RARB, RASSF1A,&#xD;
      Twist, Hin1 and GSTP1. From this data, we will identify a preliminary gene panel associated&#xD;
      with breast cancer which undergoes the most changes in methylation following systemic&#xD;
      therapy. Thirty paraffin-embedded healthy tissue samples from mastectomy specimens and blood&#xD;
      samples from unaffected individuals will serve as normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This preliminary study can be used to determine the clinical utility of DNA methylation in&#xD;
      breast tumor tissue and plasma as a predictive marker for response to chemotherapy and a&#xD;
      prognostic marker for patient outcome. If a relationship is found, we can then further study&#xD;
      if the change in methylation pattern has clinical utility in influencing therapeutic&#xD;
      decision-making which may be further expanded to the adjuvant setting..&#xD;
