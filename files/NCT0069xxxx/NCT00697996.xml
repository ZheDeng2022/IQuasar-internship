      Rituximab will be tested for its safety and potential efficacy in treating B cell dense renal&#xD;
      allograft rejection episodes in children receiving renal transplants at Stanford University&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Twenty kidney transplant recipients who are being cared for at Stanford University and UCLA&#xD;
      and are between the ages of 2-21, can be considered for participation in this research if&#xD;
      they are having an acute rejection episode. After a biopsy is done and the diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      rejection is made, ten patients will be randomly enrolled in the group to be treated with&#xD;
      Rituximab and steroid pulses. Ten children will be enrolled as the control group, receiving&#xD;
      standard of care for acute transplant rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment will be based on a 1:1 randomization scheme. That means two patients will be&#xD;
      assigned to the group of patients receiving steroid pulsing and 4 doses of Rituximab. The&#xD;
      third patient would be assigned to the group receiving steroid pulses and adjustment in&#xD;
      immunosuppression medications which is the standard of care at Stanford University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of Rituximab that will be given is 375 mg/m2 and is administered through an IV.&#xD;
      Additional doses of Rituximab will be administered on a weekly basis. A total of four doses&#xD;
      will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the acute rejection does not resolve by one-week, patients in both groups have the option&#xD;
      of receiving polyclonal antibody therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:Patients must meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for&#xD;
        study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pediatric renal allograft recipients aged 2-21 years with biopsy proven acute&#xD;
             rejection episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent and comply with the requirements of&#xD;
             the study protocol (patients &gt;18 years of age or parents)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than 30% decline in baseline renal function as indicated by a rise in the&#xD;
             serum creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver function, as indicated by AST or ALT &lt;2x upper limit of normal unless&#xD;
             related to primary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum pregnancy test (for women of child bearing age)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women of reproductive potential must agree to use an acceptable method of&#xD;
             birth control during treatment and for twelve months (1 year) after completion of&#xD;
             treatment.&amp;#xA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:Patients will be excluded from the study based on the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks of screening or 5 half-lives&#xD;
             of the investigational drug (whichever is longer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous Treatment with Rituximab (MabThera® / Rituxan®)&#xD;
&#xD;

             antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of HIV (positive HIV, HIV conducted during screening if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C (Hep B/C at screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of recurrent significant infection or history of recurrent bacterial&#xD;
             infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection (including&#xD;
             tuberculosis or atypical mycobacterial disease, but excluding fungal infections of&#xD;
             nail beds) or any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment&#xD;
             with IV antibiotics within 4 weeks of screening or oral antibiotics within 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to screening&#xD;
