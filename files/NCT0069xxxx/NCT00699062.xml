  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The distal lung contributes to asthmatic airway remodeling which is observed from early onset&#xD;
      of the disease. Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) play important role in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      airway remodeling and antileukotrienes work to exert a certain degree of anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effect. The cysteinyl leukotriene antagonist Montelukast has been in vivo shown to&#xD;
      significantly inhibit ovalbumin induced airway smooth muscle hyperplasia and subepithelial&#xD;
      fibrosis in sensitized mice. This study aims to evaluate if Montelukast could reverse airway&#xD;
      remodeling in asthma patients by a non-invasive approach-HRCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accumulated data have suggested that the distal lung, which includes airways of &lt; 2mm in&#xD;
      diameter and lung parenchyma, contribute to asthma pathogenesis and symptoms. In addition to&#xD;
      persisting inflammation, distal lung undergoes remodeling, as demonstrated by the reduced&#xD;
      elastic fiber content and abnormal alveolar attachments, with the latter thought to result in&#xD;
      a loss of elastic recoil and a reduction in FEV1.0. Furthermore, recent studies have shown&#xD;
      that airway remodeling is observed from early onset of the disease and may, therefore, be&#xD;
      characteristic of asthma. Amounting evidence has revealed that airway remodeling of asthmatic&#xD;
      airways accounts for a large component of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and excessive&#xD;
      airway narrowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since remodeling processes occur in parallel to, or may even be obligatory for, the&#xD;
      establishment of persistent inflammation, the pathogenesis of airway remodeling and the&#xD;
      implications of therapeutic interventions that are designed to diminish airway remodeling&#xD;
      remain important areas of both research and clinic. Inhale corticosteroid (ICS) is mainstay&#xD;
      for the treatment of asthma, however, ICS provides very little benefit for airway remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) play important role in the pathogenesis of airway remodeling&#xD;
      and antileukotrienes work to exert a certain degree of anti-inflammatory effect. The&#xD;
      cysteinyl leukotriene antagonist Montelukast, for example, has been in vivo shown to&#xD;
      significantly inhibit ovalbumin induced airway smooth muscle hyperplasia and subepithelial&#xD;
      fibrosis in sensitized mice. Montelukast, a systemically delivered leukotriene receptor&#xD;
      antagonist, has been strongly recommended to treat asthma by several guidelines. Clinically,&#xD;
      the systemically acting oral agent montelukast has been shown to improve proximal and distal&#xD;
      lung physiology. In particular, improvements in distal lung function correlate with&#xD;
      improvements in asthma symptoms. The in vivo experiments performed in rodent animal&#xD;
      challenged by OVA have shown that Montelukast can reverse airway remodeling, as well as&#xD;
      inhibit inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the occurrence of airway remodeling in human being, bronchial biopsy samples&#xD;
      obtained with a bronchoscope are subjected to histological examination. However, bronchial&#xD;
      biopsy is invasive and causes considerable pain, while assessment of the peripheral small&#xD;
      airways and of changes in the deep submucosal tissue and airway smooth muscle in large&#xD;
      airways is technically difficult. This technique does not allow the longitudinal analysis of&#xD;
      airway wall dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive evaluation of airways by means of imaging with high-resolution computed&#xD;
      tomography (HRCT) has therefore been tried as an alternative procedure, and was found to have&#xD;
      the potential to evaluate airways in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease. The&#xD;
      measurement of airway wall thickness by HRCT in patients with asthma has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      correlate with the severity of asthma. Computed tomographic imaging of the airways by HRCT&#xD;
      has been widely applied to investigate the alterations in the structure of the airways termed&#xD;
      airway remodeling in patients with airway obstructive diseases (see references 1-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far to our knowledge, there is no study aiming to evaluate if Montelukast could reverse&#xD;
      airway remodeling in asthma patients by HRCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our encouraging preliminary data performed in 4 patients with moderate to severe asthma&#xD;
      according to GINA definition who received oral Montelukast for 3 months demonstrate with or&#xD;
      without combination of ICS+LABA that there were significant improvements in airway wall&#xD;
      thickness and air trapping evaluated by measurement of HRCT and lung function in patients&#xD;
      with oral Montelukast as compared with those without oral Montelukast. We adopted WA% and&#xD;
      WA/BSA to reflect the degree of airway thickness as published methods. We found that the&#xD;
      patients who received oral montelukast for 3 months experienced improvements in airway&#xD;
      remodeling. WA/BSA and WA% significantly decreased compared to the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposal presented is to further examine, in a relatively large number of&#xD;
      patients, that Montelukast can improve the structural changes in the large airways and air&#xD;
      trapping by means of HRCT, and their relationship with pulmonary function in patients in&#xD;
      moderate to severe asthma.&#xD;
