  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pollution of the operating room environment by anesthetic agents had been questioned,&#xD;
      studied and documented in the past. These investigations demonstrated the existence of&#xD;
      teratogenic effects in animals and the possibility of a decrease in mental performance,&#xD;
      reduced fertility, fetal loss, spontaneous abortion and addictive potential in humans with&#xD;
      chronic exposure to trace amounts of anesthetic agents. These findings led to the&#xD;
      establishment of exposure limits and industry standards by consumer protection agencies, such&#xD;
      as National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). However, these standards&#xD;
      applied to inhalation anesthetic agents that were excreted from the lungs of patients during&#xD;
      expiration. These concerns about operating room pollution weaned away with the introduction&#xD;
      of intravenous anesthetic agents, such as propofol, because it was believed propofol was&#xD;
      excreted by systems other than the lungs. Recent research points to the contrary and&#xD;
      demonstrates the excretion of propofol vapor in the expired gases of patients. Furthermore,&#xD;
      animal experiments in our laboratory establish the existence of a biological mechanism&#xD;
      responsible for addiction in animals exposed to trace amounts of propofol. We propose to&#xD;
      study the exposure levels of anesthesia care providers in the operating room, during propofol&#xD;
      use, under standardized conditions. Our findings will help to establish preventive measures&#xD;
      for propofol addiction in anesthesia care providers.&#xD;

      This clinical project will be carried out in the operating rooms of the University Hospital&#xD;
      and the Doctors Office Center. The study will be done during routine surgery where a&#xD;
      laryngeal mask airway will be used to maintain airway during general anesthesia in 20 adult&#xD;
      patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II. Routine&#xD;
      anesthetic care standards will be applied in intravenous line placement and monitoring of&#xD;
      patients. General anesthesia will be induced with a bolus dose of propofol (2mg.kg-1) and&#xD;
      maintained with an intravenous infusion of propofol (100-200 mcg.kg-1.min-1). Patients will&#xD;
      be allowed to breathe spontaneously 40% oxygen in air. Adjuvant intravenous medications will&#xD;
      be given for amnesia, analgesia and infection prophylaxis as per routine anesthetic practice.&#xD;
      The ambient propofol concentration will be measured, using a proton transfer reaction mass&#xD;
      spectrometer (PTR-MS), at a distance of 25cm from the patient's face. The measurement of&#xD;
      ambient propofol concentration will begin before the administration of propofol to the&#xD;
      patient and will continue till the patient leaves the operating room. The use of PTR-MS&#xD;
      device will not interfere with the anesthetic management of patient. In an unforeseen&#xD;
      circumstance, where the anesthesiologist determines the use of PTR-MS does interfere with the&#xD;
      anesthetic care of the patient, the device will be immediately removed and the measurement of&#xD;
      ambient propofol concentration will be suspended for the case. The set-up and usage of PTR-MS&#xD;
      will be performed by a research team that does not take part in the clinical management of&#xD;
      the patient. The PTR-MS is a device that depends on the proton transfer reaction to quantify,&#xD;
      in parts per billion (ppb) by volume, volatile organic compounds in air at extremely low&#xD;
      concentrations and in real time. The mean and peak ambient propofol concentration will be&#xD;
      determined during each case and a time weighted average (TWA) will be calculated for an&#xD;
      eight-hour period at the end of the study. In addition, after receiving written informed&#xD;
      consent from anesthesia care providers, blood samples will be drawn from them and propofol&#xD;
      concentrations will be measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) within 24hr.&#xD;
      The blood samples will constitute 3ml on two occasions, one early in the morning before&#xD;
      anesthesia care starts and one after eight hours of anesthesia care. HPLC is a device that&#xD;
      uses a spectrofluorometric detector to estimate trace amounts of propofol in blood in&#xD;
      ng.ml-1. The blood estimation of propofol will also be conducted by a research team that does&#xD;
      not take part in the clinical management of patients.&#xD;
