  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protocol AMP-024 is a Phase 2 study of imexon plus docetaxel for patients with previously&#xD;
      treated lung cancer that has spread in the body. Docetaxel is approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) as a second line therapy for this cancer. The imexon is administered on&#xD;
      days 1-5 and the docetaxel on day 1 of every 3 week cycle. The objective of the protocol is&#xD;
      to determine if the combination of imexon plus docetaxel is safe and effective.&#xD;
