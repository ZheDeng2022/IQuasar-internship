  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, done in collaboration with Cornell University in New York, will explore the&#xD;
      potential role of the body s immune response to gluten in ataxia. Celiac disease is an&#xD;
      autoimmune disorder that is triggered by the ingestion of wheat gluten and related proteins&#xD;
      in genetically susceptible individuals. Some people with celiac disease also develop ataxia,&#xD;
      which is a loss of muscle coordination, leading to imbalance. The cause of the associated&#xD;
      ataxia is not well understood, but it is suspected to be related to the immune response&#xD;
      towards gluten in these patients. Preliminary results indicate that antibodies in people with&#xD;
      celiac disease can react with brain proteins, which might have a role in the associated&#xD;
      neurologic deficits. The aim of this study is to characterize the immune response in the&#xD;
      ataxia that is associated with celiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older with 1) ataxia and no celiac disease, 2) ataxia plus celiac&#xD;
      disease and 3) matched healthy control subjects will be enrolled at the NIH. People with&#xD;
      celiac disease only will be enrolled at Cornell University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants have a blood sample drawn for various tests of immune function as well as&#xD;
      genetic tests. Healthy volunteers also have a history and physical examination if they have&#xD;
      not had one done at NIH in the past year. Some patients may require additional clinical&#xD;
      evaluations for clinical or diagnostic reasons.&#xD;

      Objective: To understand the role of the immune system in the neurologic complications of&#xD;
      celiac disease (CD) or gluten sensitivity (GS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: We plan to study 15 patients with CD and ataxia, 15 patients with&#xD;
      hereditary ataxia, and 30 healthy matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Four groups of patients will be enrolled into the study. The first group will consist&#xD;
      of patients with CD and ataxia, the second group will consist of CD patients without&#xD;
      neurological manifestations, the third group will consist of patients with hereditary&#xD;
      cerebellar ataxia without CD, and the final group will consist of healthy 30 race matched&#xD;
      volunteers. The second group will not be recruited at the NIH. Standardized enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques will used to assess the presence of synapsin I in the&#xD;
      groups of patients. Using affinity assays, cross-reactivity of antibodies to gliadin and&#xD;
      synapsin 1 will be evaluated. Antibody epitope mapping will be performed on those antibodies&#xD;
      that cross-react with synapsin 1 and gliadin. HLA class II genotypic and phenotypic&#xD;
      frequencies will be assessed and compared with the matched volunteers as an exploratory&#xD;
      measure to look for genetic risk and protective factors in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: our outcome measures are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. To determine whether there is an association between antibody reactivity to synapsin I and&#xD;
      neurological deficits of CD/GS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. To characterize the cross-reactive antibodies in patients by determining subclass and&#xD;
      affinity&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. To map the epitope(s) of synapsin I that are targeted in patients with cross-reactive&#xD;
      antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. To explore HLA association in the subset of patients with CD and ataxia&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We plan to evaluate serum and blood from patients with gluten sensitivity (including both&#xD;
        biopsy-proven CD, and biopsy-negative cases with high anti-gliadin antibody titer)&#xD;
        accompanied by cerebellar ataxia. Serum samples will be acquired prior to initiation of a&#xD;
        gluten-free diet. Therefore, several inclusion criteria exist based on the study group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH CD PLUS CEREBELLAR ATAXIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient meets criteria for CD based on the modified ESPGAN criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has ataxia with or without neuropathy based on clinical evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is free from other neurological and psychiatric deficits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All other known causes for ataxia have been ruled out through routine clinical&#xD;
             evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is at least 18 years old and is willing to participate in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is not taking medications that are commonly known to have immune&#xD;
             modulating effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is not on a gluten free diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH HEREDITARY CEREBELLAR ATAXIA WITHOUT CD:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient tested negative for serologic markers of CD (i.e. antigliadin,&#xD;
             antireticulin, and antiendomysial antibody testing as performed under protocol&#xD;
             93-N-0202)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has ataxia on routine clinical examination and no other neurological or&#xD;
             psychiatric problems&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a known autosomal dominant ataxia (i.e., SCA, DRPLA, Friedreich s&#xD;
             ataxia, and etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MATCHED-CONTROLS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They should not have CD and or ataxia based on clinical evaluation and history&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serologic testing for antigliadin, antireticulin, and antiendomysial antibodies should&#xD;
             reveal negative results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They should be race and age-matched with patients with CD and the ataxia group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They should have no neurological or psychiatric conditions based on clinical&#xD;
             evaluation and history&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They should not have any rheumatological or autoimmune conditions in them or in their&#xD;
             first degree relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They should be at least 18 years of age and be able to provide consent for&#xD;
             participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They should not be on any immune modulating medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Final diagnosis of CD will strictly follow the modified criteria of the European Society&#xD;
        for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN) and recommendations of the recently&#xD;
        held National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Celiac Disease.&#xD;
        Assessment and diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia will be made by magnetic resonance imaging of&#xD;
        the brain, clinical examination and genetic testing for spinocerebellar ataxias and&#xD;
        Friedreich s ataxia. Additional routine testing will be done if necessary to exclude other&#xD;
        causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy and disease control groups will be evaluated for CD and for neurological deficits.&#xD;
        Only symptom-free, antibody-negative individuals will be recruited into these control&#xD;
        groups. Exclusion of neurological deficits and psychiatric illness in healthy and disease&#xD;
        control subjects will be by history and neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For all groups, if other neurological and psychiatric diagnoses are present, the individual&#xD;
        will not qualify to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL GROUPS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is already on a gluten-restricted diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is taking known immune modulating therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have other neurological condition (except for neuropathy) or psychiatric condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not willing to have blood drawn&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is known to have immune dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Being pregnant leads to numerous physiological changes. It is unclear if antibody&#xD;
             characteristics are influenced by these changes.&#xD;
