      The purpose of this research study is to learn if your own immune cells can be activated and&#xD;
      multiplied in order to help your body fight off the tumor cells in your brain. The safety of&#xD;
      this procedure will also be studied. This procedure, called CMV-autologous lymphocyte&#xD;
      transfer or CMV-ALT is investigational which means that it is not approved by the US Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) and is still being tested in research studies. Autologous&#xD;
      lymphocyte transfer or ALT means that you will receive your own immune cells back (and not&#xD;
      from another donor) as a treatment after they have been activated and grown to large numbers&#xD;
      in a clinical lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that the body's immune (protection) system can attack tumor cells and kill&#xD;
      them. Immune cells called T-lymphocytes (T-cells) can recognize special proteins on the&#xD;
      surface of tumors as a signal to attack and fight the cancer. In most patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer, the immune system does not adequately destroy the tumor because the white blood cells&#xD;
      or T-cells are not stimulated enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before your T-cells can become active against tumor cells, they require strong stimulation.&#xD;
      There are special &quot;stimulator&quot; cells in the body called Dendritic Cells (DCs) that can take&#xD;
      up proteins released from cancer cells and present pieces of these proteins to T lymphocytes&#xD;
      to create this strong stimulation. Dendritic cells taken from your blood will be &quot;pulsed&quot; or&#xD;
      loaded with genetic material called RNA (ribonucleic acid), which stimulates the DC to change&#xD;
      the RNA into a protein called pp65. This protein is produced by a common virus called&#xD;
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) that 70-80% of us have been exposed to in our lifetime. Recently, we&#xD;
      have found that this virus is present in many malignant brain tumors. Brain tumors are very&#xD;
      aggressive and, for reasons we do not yet understand, are difficult for the body to attack.&#xD;
      The CMV virus is a target in the tumor that, if attacked by your immune systems cells, may&#xD;
      prevent your tumor from growing. We have found that we can grow immune cells to very large&#xD;
      numbers from the blood of people who have evidence of prior exposure to this virus. You will&#xD;
      therefore be tested to determine if you have pre-existing antibodies to this virus in order&#xD;
      to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use your DCs to activate and grow immune cells from your blood to large numbers in a&#xD;
      clinical laboratory. These CMV-specific immune cells, called CMV-ALT, will be returned to&#xD;
      your body when they have become activated. It is hoped that these cells will seek out and&#xD;
      kill tumor cells that express the CMV viral protein and not attack normal cells. The transfer&#xD;
      of immune cells that stimulates your immune system is called adoptive immunotherapy. We will&#xD;
      evaluate two doses of immune cells in this study (Dose 1 and Dose 2). Depending on when you&#xD;
      are enrolled in this study you will receive either Dose 1 or 2. The first six patients&#xD;
      enrolled on this study will receive Dose 1 (the lower dose) and the next six patients will&#xD;
      receive Dose 2 (the higher dose). We do not know at this time if either dose is more&#xD;
      effective or safer to administer which is why we are testing both doses. Dose 2 will be a&#xD;
      larger number of immune cells if the treatment is found to be safe in the first six patients&#xD;
      treated during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will also see, in some randomly selected patients, if giving an injection of&#xD;
      the DC pulsed with pp65 RNA into the skin improves the function of the CMV-ALT treatment or&#xD;
      not. You will receive three injections under the skin of either some of the same DC that were&#xD;
      used to stimulate your immune cells in the clinical laboratory or three injections of saline&#xD;
      (salt solution) under the skin starting with the infusion of the CMV-ALT. It is unknown if a&#xD;
      DC injection will be beneficial to the immune cells or not so the responses will be compared&#xD;
      in patients who receive DC versus saline injection with their CMV-ALT. After these three&#xD;
      injections, blood will be collected to compare the responses between patients that received&#xD;
      saline to those that received DC injections.&#xD;

      Six CMV seropositive patients with newly-diagnosed GBM will be randomized to receive CMV-ALT&#xD;
      (3 x 107/Kg) with or without vaccine with CMV-DCs (2 x 107). All patients will undergo a&#xD;
      leukapheresis after resection for harvest of PBLs for CMV-ALT and CMV-DC generation. Patients&#xD;
      will then receive RT and concurrent TMZ at a standard targeted dose of 75 mg/m2/d. Patients&#xD;
      with histologically or clinically-proven progressive disease during radiation, dependent on&#xD;
      steroid supplements above physiologic levels at time of vaccination, and are unable to&#xD;
      tolerate TMZ will be replaced. If sufficient CMV-specific T-cells can't be expanded or ALT&#xD;
      doesn't meet release criteria, the patient will be replaced and their cells may be used to&#xD;
      offer them another DC vaccination study, such as ATTAC Pro00003877. Remaining patients will&#xD;
      then receive the initial cycle of TMZ at a standard targeted dose of 200mg/m2/d for 5 days 3&#xD;
      + 1 weeks after completing RT and will be randomized to receive CMV-DCs or saline&#xD;
      simultaneous with CMV-ALT as vaccine #1. While the standard targeted dose of 200mg/m2/d for 5&#xD;
      days TMZ treatment is recommended, TMZ regimen may be adjusted at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating neuro-oncologist. Patients with MRI changes consistent with pseudoprogression who&#xD;
      continue on TMZ will receive CMV-ALT with vaccinations as scheduled. Peripheral blood will be&#xD;
      drawn at 0 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 1 week post vaccine #1 for T-cell&#xD;
      kinetics. DCs or saline will be given intradermally and divided equally to both inguinal&#xD;
      regions. Vaccines #2 and #3 will occur at 2 week intervals. All patients will then undergo&#xD;
      leukapheresis again for immunologic monitoring with specific assessment of baseline&#xD;
      antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the initial dose of CMV-ALT is safe and the combination of CMV-DCs is safe and does not&#xD;
      produce an inferior CMV pp65-specific immune response, a 3rd cohort of patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled and receive a higher dose of CMV-ALT (3 x 108/Kg) along with vaccine with CMV-DCs (2&#xD;
      x 107). If the combination is unsafe or inferior only the CMV-ALT will be given. If CMV-ALT&#xD;
      (3 x 108/Kg) is safe a 4th cohort of 3 patients will be enrolled and receive the same&#xD;
      treatment as the 3rd cohort except the T-cells will be labeled with 111In and cultured ex&#xD;
      vivo with 13C-glucose and their proliferation, persistence, and migration followed by&#xD;
      peripheral blood sampling, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT ), and MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial 3 vaccines, patients will then receive subsequent TMZ cycles every 4 weeks&#xD;
      for at least 6 cycles and up to 12 cycles after RT. TMZ will be given on days 1-5 of a 28 day&#xD;
      cycle. Patients will then be imaged bimonthly and followed until death. This study will be&#xD;
      halted if any 2 patients in any cohort of 3 experience a drug-related Grade IV or&#xD;
      irreversible Grade III toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of standard care for these patients, upon tumor progression, participants may undergo&#xD;
      stereotactic biopsy or resection. As this is not a research procedure consent will be&#xD;
      obtained separately. However, if tissue is obtained, it will be used to confirm tumor&#xD;
      progression histologically and to assess immunologic cell infiltration and pp65 antigen&#xD;
      escape at the tumor site. Patients consenting to biopsy or resection will also be offered&#xD;
      intratumoral vaccination with CMVpp65 LAMP-loaded, 111In-labeled DCs at the time of surgery&#xD;
      to determine if they migrate to cervical lymph nodes.&#xD;
