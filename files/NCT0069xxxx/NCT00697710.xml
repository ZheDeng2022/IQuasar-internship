    <description>Pharmacokinetic endpoints included Cmax, Tmax, T1/2,12hr, T1/2,z, and AUC0-12h for each dose level of S-777469 based on the sampling schedule. Time to achieve steady state was determined for each dose level. Serum protein binding of S-777469 was determined for all cohorts. Plasma and urine concentrations of S-777469 was determined for single dose and multiple doses for all cohorts. The plasma and urine samples were used for determination of concentrations of metabolites of S-777469. Plasma and urine samples for single dose and multiple doses for Cohort B was used for metabolite profiling.</description>
