  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) persists as one of the more common complications of&#xD;
      surgery. Although rarely life-threatening, it is the postoperative outcome that is most&#xD;
      unfavorable to patients, even more undesirable than pain. Orthognathic surgery corrects&#xD;
      conditions of the jaws and face related to structure, growth, sleep apnea, bad bite, or&#xD;
      congenital malformations. The bones of the face and jaws are cut and placed in a new&#xD;
      position. There is a high rate of PONV in orthognathic surgery (56%). It is particularly&#xD;
      challenging to the patient as their jaws are kept closed together with wires or elastic&#xD;
      bands. Nausea in a patient with restricted mouth opening can be psychologically unnerving and&#xD;
      puts them at risk for fluid in their lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gan and colleagues showed a higher efficacy of aprepitant over ondansetron in preventing PONV&#xD;
      and nausea severity after open abdominal surgery. From this study, the FDA approved the use&#xD;
      of aprepitant for PONV prevention in patients &gt;18 years of age. Gan suggested further&#xD;
      investigation in different populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our randomized, double-blind, prospective study will compare the efficacy of aprepitant PO&#xD;
      versus ondansetron IV in a high risk setting for PONV: adolescents undergoing orthognathic&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will involve 200 consecutive, adolescent patients (ages 15-25) who will undergo at&#xD;
      least a Le Fort 1 osteotomy (upper jaw surgery) under general anesthesia and require hospital&#xD;
      admission for at least one night. We will exclude patients who are currently taking&#xD;
      medications that have interactions with aprepitant (pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole,&#xD;
      cisapride), those who have a known vomiting disorder such as bulimia, and those who have&#xD;
      vomited for any reason within 24 hours of surgery. The procedure will be performed by 5&#xD;
      surgeons and general anesthesia will be administered by 3 anesthesiologists at one&#xD;
      institution. A study coordinator, who will not be involved in the treatment, will create the&#xD;
      randomization schedule in order to ensure blindness. The patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      either of two groups: 1) aprepitant 40 mg PO 2) ondansetron 4 mg IV. Appropriate verbal and&#xD;
      written consent will be obtained by the priniciple investigator or surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the procedure, all patients will receive a pill (aprepitant or aprepitant&#xD;
      placebo) at least 1 hour prior to induction of anesthesia and an IV infusion (ondansetron or&#xD;
      saline) over 2-5 minutes prior to intubation. The timing and doses of medications will be&#xD;
      consistent with manufacturer's recommendations. An established protocol will ensure every&#xD;
      patient will receive the same anesthetic regiment. Patient's fluid status will be closely&#xD;
      monitored and hydrated appropriately according to known fluid balance calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed based on criteria set by Gan et al and will be based on the&#xD;
      presence/absence of a vomiting episode, use of rescue medication and subjective evaluation of&#xD;
      nausea. Patients will be monitored continuously in the PACU and on the hospital floor by the&#xD;
      caring team (nurse, resident, anesthesiologist, surgeon) for any emetic episode or use of&#xD;
      rescue therapy. An emetic episode is defined as an act of vomiting (oral expulsion of stomach&#xD;
      contents) or retching (non-productive vomiting). Nausea will be assessed at intervals of 0,&#xD;
      2, 6, 24 hours after surgery with T0 being time of extubation. Patients will rate nausea on a&#xD;
      11-point verbal rating scale, with 0 being &quot;not nausea&quot; to 10 being &quot;the worst nausea.&quot;&#xD;
      Rescue medication will be offered if the patient has more than one episode of vomiting or&#xD;
      retching, if the patient has nausea lasting longer than 15 minutes, or if the patient&#xD;
      requests it for established nausea or vomiting.&#xD;
