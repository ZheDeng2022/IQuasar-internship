  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children treated with radiation therapy for brain tumors are at risk for cognitive problems.&#xD;
      These problems have typically been demonstrated on global cognitive measures including&#xD;
      measures of intellectual functioning (IQ). Identification of specific areas of impairment can&#xD;
      assist in isolating vulnerable brain areas and developing targeted interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we assess brain tumor survivors, solid tumor controls and healthy sibling&#xD;
      controls using measures of working memory (online maintenance and manipulation of&#xD;
      information) in order to identify a specific cognitive process that may underlie the observed&#xD;
      decline in IQ. We are also exploring relationships among working memory performance with IQ,&#xD;
      clinical characteristics and a specific genetic factor of interest.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional controlled study of brain tumor survivors treated at St. Jude with&#xD;
      conformal radiation therapy. Brain tumor survivors (n= 50, solid tumor survivors (n=40), and&#xD;
      healthy sibling controls (n= 40) are evaluated once only with laboratory measures of&#xD;
      cognitive skills (working memory, episodic memory and estimated IQ) and parental&#xD;
      questionnaires (executive and adaptive functions). We also use buccal (cheek) swabs to gather&#xD;
      samples for DNA extraction. We hypothesize: brain tumor survivors will perform significantly&#xD;
      worse than solid tumor and healthy controls on measures of working memory, working memory&#xD;
      will correlate significantly with IQ, working memory will be associated with parent report of&#xD;
      executive functions and a specified genotype related to dopamine metabolism will be&#xD;
      associated with working memory impairment.&#xD;
