  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are few therapies suitable for the treatment of psoriasis on the face and skin folds.&#xD;
      As these areas are sensitive, irritation and other adverse reactions are more common than&#xD;
      elsewhere on the body. The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of once&#xD;
      daily treatment for up to 8 weeks of an ointment containing calcipotriol 25 mcg/g plus&#xD;
      hydrocortisone 10 mg/g with calcipotriol 25 mcg/g in the ointment vehicle, hydrocortisone 10&#xD;
      mg/g in the ointment vehicle and the ointment vehicle alone in patients with psoriasis&#xD;
      vulgaris on the face and on the intertriginous areas (= double-blind phase). Furthermore, the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy will be evaluated for up to 60 weeks treatment as required of&#xD;
      calcipotriol 25 mcg/g plus hydrocortisone 10 mg/g ointment in psoriasis vulgaris on the face&#xD;
      and intertriginous areas (= open-label phase).&#xD;

    <description>The (sub) investigator made an assessment of the disease severity of the face using the 6-category scale below.&#xD;
Clear, Almost clear, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Very severe&#xD;
The assessment was made considering the condition of psoriasis vulgaris of the face at the time of the evaluation, not in relation to the condition at a previous visit.&#xD;
For subjects with a baseline (Visit 1) severity of moderate or worse - &quot;controlled disease&quot; of the face was defined as clear or almost clear according to the IGA of disease severity of the face.&#xD;
For subjects with a baseline (Visit 1) severity of mild - &quot;controlled disease&quot; of the face was defined as clear according to the IGA of disease severity of the face.</description>

    <time_frame>At Week 8 (end of treatment for double-blind phase)</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Success&quot; was defined as a TSS score of 0 or 1.&#xD;
For each clinical sign, a single score, reflecting the average severity of all psoriatic lesions on the face was determined according to the scale below:&#xD;
Redness 0 = none (no erythema) 1 = mild (faint erythema, pink to very light red) 2 = moderate (definite light red erythema) 3 = severe (dark red erythema) 4 = very severe (very dark red erythema) Thickness 0 = none (no plaque elevation) 1 = mild (slight, barely perceptible elevation) 2 = moderate (definite elevation but not thick) 3 = severe (definite elevation, thick plaque with sharp edge) 4 = very severe (very thick plaque with sharp edge) Scaliness 0 = none (no scaling) 1 = mild (sparse, fine-scale lesions, only partially covered) 2 = moderate (coarser scales, most of lesions covered) 3 = severe (entire lesion covered with coarse scales) 4 = very severe (very thick coarse scales, possibly fissured)&#xD;
The sum of the three scores constituted a TSS ranging from 0 to 12</description>

    <description>The (sub)investigator made an assessment of the disease severity of the intertriginous areas using the 6-category scale below.&#xD;
Clear, Almost clear, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Very severe The assessment was made considering the condition of psoriasis vulgaris of the intertrigi-nous areas at the time of the evaluation, not in relation to the condition at a previous visit.&#xD;
For subjects with a baseline severity of moderate or worse - &quot;controlled disease&quot; of the intertriginous areas was defined as clear or almost clear according to the IGA of disease severity of the intertriginous areas.&#xD;
For subjects with a baseline severity of mild - &quot;controlled disease&quot; of the intertriginous areas was defined as clear according to the IGA of disease severity of the intertriginous areas.</description>

    <time_frame>At Week 8 (end of treatment for double-blind phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of the subject's psoriasis vulgaris on the intertriginous areas was evaluated in terms of the three clinical signs: redness, thickness and scaliness. All the defined intertriginous areas were rated separately using the same scale as for the investigator's assessment of clinical signs (redness, thickness and scaliness) of the face.&#xD;
For each clinical sign, a single score, reflecting the average severity of all psoriatic lesions on the face was determined according to the scale below:&#xD;
Redness 0 = none&#xD;
= mild&#xD;
= moderate&#xD;
= severe&#xD;
= very severe&#xD;
Thickness 0 = none&#xD;
= mild&#xD;
= moderate&#xD;
= severe&#xD;
= very severe&#xD;
Scaliness 0 = none&#xD;
= mild&#xD;
= moderate&#xD;
= severe&#xD;
= very severe&#xD;
A mean score was calculated for each sign (redness, thickness and scaliness) based on scores of all the defined intertriginous areas with psoriasis at baseline and the sum of these mean scores constituted the TSS.&#xD;
&quot;Success&quot; was defined as a TSS score of 0 or 1.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 1245 subjects were enrolled (informed consent signed and CRF started). Five subjects left the study during washout (2 screening failures, 2 lost to follow-up and 1 unacceptable adverse event). One subject attended Visit 1 but was not randomized (voluntary withdrawal). Therefore, 1239 of the enrolled subjects were randomized in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The Randomized double-blind phase of the study lasted up to 8 weeks, and was followed by a 52-week Open-label period in which participants had the opportunity to receive Calcipotriol 25 mcg/g plus 10 mg/g Hydrocortisone ointment.</pre_assignment_details>

For each clinical sign, a single score, reflecting the average severity of all psoriatic lesions on the face was determined according to the scale below:&#xD;
Redness 0 = none (no erythema) 1 = mild (faint erythema, pink to very light red) 2 = moderate (definite light red erythema) 3 = severe (dark red erythema) 4 = very severe (very dark red erythema) Thickness 0 = none (no plaque elevation) 1 = mild (slight, barely perceptible elevation) 2 = moderate (definite elevation but not thick) 3 = severe (definite elevation, thick plaque with sharp edge) 4 = very severe (very thick plaque with sharp edge) Scaliness 0 = none (no scaling) 1 = mild (sparse, fine-scale lesions, only partially covered) 2 = moderate (coarser scales, most of lesions covered) 3 = severe (entire lesion covered with coarse scales) 4 = very severe (very thick coarse scales, possibly fissured)&#xD;

        <description>The severity of the subject's psoriasis vulgaris on the intertriginous areas was evaluated in terms of the three clinical signs: redness, thickness and scaliness. All the defined intertriginous areas were rated separately using the same scale as for the investigator's assessment of clinical signs (redness, thickness and scaliness) of the face.&#xD;
For each clinical sign, a single score, reflecting the average severity of all psoriatic lesions on the face was determined according to the scale below:&#xD;
Redness 0 = none&#xD;
= mild&#xD;
= moderate&#xD;
= severe&#xD;
= very severe&#xD;
Thickness 0 = none&#xD;

= moderate&#xD;
= severe&#xD;
= very severe&#xD;
Scaliness 0 = none&#xD;
= mild&#xD;
= moderate&#xD;
= severe&#xD;
= very severe&#xD;
A mean score was calculated for each sign (redness, thickness and scaliness) based on scores of all the defined intertriginous areas with psoriasis at baseline and the sum of these mean scores constituted the TSS.&#xD;
&quot;Success&quot; was defined as a TSS score of 0 or 1.</description>
