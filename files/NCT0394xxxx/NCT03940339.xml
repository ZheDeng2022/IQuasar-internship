      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterolisthesis presents with tightness of hamstring muscle which is a major contributing&#xD;
      factor for low back pain and disability. Suboccipital Myofascial release decreases the&#xD;
      tension in the fascia and helps to amend the muscle imbalance. There is a presence of&#xD;
      superficial backline between suboccipitalis and hamstring muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to find out the effect of sub occipital myofascial release on&#xD;
      hamstring tightness along with pain and disability associated with it in Anterolisthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit individuals with Anterolisthesis between the age of 35- 55.&#xD;
      Pathologies which will limit or interfere with the test outcome shall be excluded. The&#xD;
      samples will be collected using criterion based sampling. Procedure will be explained prior&#xD;
      to the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normality of the collected data will be established by Shapiro Wilk Test. Based on the&#xD;
      normality, descriptive statistics data will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation or&#xD;
      median and intra quartile range. Within group comparison will be done by paired t test or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed rank test and between group comparison will be done through independent t&#xD;
      test or Mann Whitney U test.&#xD;

      1. Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anterolisthesis refers to an anterior displacement of a vertebra over subjacent vertebra&#xD;
           causing low back pain, radiculopathy and hamstring tightness. Hamstring tightness causes&#xD;
           improper patterns in the lumbopelvic region. There is a dura matter which connects&#xD;
           suboccipitalis and hamstring muscle and reduction in the tone of suboccipitalis will&#xD;
           thus cause decrease in tone of hamstring muscle. Myofascial release is a manipulative&#xD;
           treatment that attempts to release tension in fascia and has an effect to decrease&#xD;
           soreness of muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.Problem statement: Generally in patients with anterolisthesis a single component is&#xD;
           considered as a treatment, this study thus aims to be a bridge filling the gap in the&#xD;
           scientific cognizance&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2.Purpose of the study:The target of the study is to see the outcome of sub&#xD;
           occipitalis myofascial release on tightness of hamstring muscle, pain and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3.Objectives of the study: To evaluate the efficacy of suboccipital myofascial release&#xD;
           and conventional physiotherapy treatment in tightness of hamstring muscle, pain and&#xD;
           disability&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total male (n) and female (n) patients between the age of 35 and 55 years with grade 1 and 2&#xD;
      Anterolisthesis will be selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      suitable sample will be randomly allocated into 2 groups - experimental and control group&#xD;
      respectively. The popliteal angle test will be carried out to assess hamstring length and&#xD;
      modified oswestry disability index will be used to quantify disability for low back pain.&#xD;
      Visual analogue scale will be used to measure intensity of pain. All the necessary measures&#xD;
      will be taken among the participants of experimental group.The MFR technique will be given in&#xD;
      the upper cervical region with the patient in supine position. The MFR will be given for&#xD;
      three repetitions per session, three times per week for the period of four weeks. The control&#xD;
      group will be receiving conventional physiotherapy treatment for hamstring tightness which&#xD;
      includes static stretching, modified hold-relax stretching and contract relax technique.&#xD;

    <description>Popliteal angle is an assessment of the tone of the hamstring muscles. The thigh is flexed on the abdomen with one hand and then the other hand straightens the leg by pushing on the back of the ankle until there is firm resistance to the movement. Popliteal angle is measured in degrees.</description>
