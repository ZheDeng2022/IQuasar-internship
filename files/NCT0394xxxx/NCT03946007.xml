  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Tremendous anti-tumor effects have been achieved using immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors for melanoma and NSCLC with long lasting responses of more than 2 years in a&#xD;
      substantial subgroup of patients. However, we are still largely unaware of the health-related&#xD;
      quality of life of these patients. We should carefully and thoroughly assess the long-term&#xD;
      burden of disease and treatment toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Primary Objective: to investigate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of&#xD;
      patients surviving 2 years or more after the first cycle of an immune checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
      for melanoma or NSCLC. Secondary Objectives: to assess neurocognitive function, endocrine&#xD;
      function, cardiovascular risk, physical fitness, mood disorders, sexual problems, work&#xD;
      participation in patients surviving 2 years or more after the first cycle of immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor; to assess quality of life of the caregivers of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Observational cross-sectional study. Study population: Patients (age ≥18 years)&#xD;
      with melanoma or NSCLC ≥2 years since treatment with at least one cycle of immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor (CTLA-4 inhibitor, PD-(L)1 inhibitor, or both).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured using the&#xD;
      EORTC Quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30). Secondary study parameters: possible late&#xD;
      effects (neurocognitive dysfunction, endocrine disorders, dermatologic complaints, sexual&#xD;
      disorders and infertility, increased cardiovascular risk, and fatigue), physical fitness,&#xD;
      psychosocial issues related to work/education, mood disorders (anxiety and depression),&#xD;
      patient and treatment-related factors potentially influencing development of late effects,&#xD;
      well-being, and quality of life of caregivers.&#xD;

      Participation in the study will include one study visit of approximately 2.5 hours. If&#xD;
      possible, the study visit will be combined with a regular follow-up visit. Vena puncture is&#xD;
      the only invasive procedure, with low risk of adverse effects. Blood will be drawn after an&#xD;
      overnight fast. To minimize the duration of the visit, patients will be offered to fill out&#xD;
      the questionnaires at home. Individual adverse test results will be reported to a&#xD;
      participants' treating physician to enable treatment or follow-up as indicated. The results&#xD;
      of the full study group will be used to guide future interventions and support for melanoma&#xD;
      and NSCLC patients.&#xD;

        An estimated 80 adult patients with advanced melanoma and 250 patients with NSCLC are&#xD;
        treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in the UMCG each year. Around 20% of these&#xD;
        patients are expected to survive ≥2 years since their first cycle of immune checkpoint&#xD;
        inhibitor. Patients will be recruited and study measurements will be performed within 3&#xD;
        year after start of study. We expect to include 25 melanoma and 50 NSCLC patients per&#xD;
        treatment year.&#xD;
