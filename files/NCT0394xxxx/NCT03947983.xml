    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) to motivate self-management&#xD;
      behaviors of weight monitoring and physical activity in older adults with heart failure (HF).&#xD;
      Half of the participants will receive the SCDG app and weight monitoring and physical&#xD;
      activity sensors and the other half will receive only the weight monitoring and physical&#xD;
      activity sensors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to obtain initial efficacy data and undertake a&#xD;
      comprehensive feasibility assessment of a SCDG intervention that synchronizes with a&#xD;
      Bluetooth-enabled weight scale and activity tracker to activate game rewards and feedback&#xD;
      based on older adult heart failure (HF) participants' real-time weight monitoring and&#xD;
      exercise behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCDG will involve a narrative, the goal of which is to help an avatar in the game avoid&#xD;
      rehospitalization by using game points, earned via the participant's real-time behaviors, in&#xD;
      game tasks that help maintain the avatar's optimal HF health status. Real-time behaviors of&#xD;
      weight-monitoring and physical activity will be tracked by an off-the-shelf sensors and app&#xD;
      (Withings). The data from the Withings sensors will then be routed to our SCDG app. The&#xD;
      digital game paired with sensors will enable objective tracking of real-time behaviors such&#xD;
      as physical activity, and weight monitoring, and provide personalized, contextually relevant&#xD;
      feedback (e.g., reduce fluid intake or call doctor for weight gain) to motivate engagement in&#xD;
      and generate habit formation of heart failure related self-management behaviors. The goal of&#xD;
      this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of the SCDG concept with an optimal number of&#xD;
      sensors in a small study so as to lay a foundation for scaling this concept to include more&#xD;
      relevant sensors in longer, larger studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the initial efficacy of the SCDG intervention for primary outcome of rate of&#xD;
      engagement in HF self-management behavior of weight-monitoring and secondary outcomes of&#xD;
      physical activity engagement, HF self-management-knowledge, and self-efficacy, HF-functional&#xD;
      status, hospitalization, cognitive ability, depression and quality of life will be evaluated.&#xD;
      For this study, 44 older adults diagnosed with the New York Heart Association's HF&#xD;
      classification I to III from out-patient HF settings in central Texas will be recruited, and&#xD;
      randomized to either the SCDG intervention group that will receive sensors tracking weight&#xD;
      monitoring and activity and play the SCDG on a mobile smartphone for 12 weeks or a control&#xD;
      group that will receive sensors and an app tracking activity and weight monitoring, and&#xD;
      standardized written HF educational modules.&#xD;

    <description>In the 19-item Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ) adapted for heart failure, each item can receive a value ranging from 1 - 7, as selected by the participant. The scale has 2 sub-scales: autonomous and controlled motivation. Calculating the scores for the sub-scales will consist of averaging the items on that subscale. They are:&#xD;
Autonomous Regulation: 2, 3, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 19. Scores for Autonomous Regulation can range from 8 to 56. High scores indicate high autonomous motivation or intrinsic motivation for behavior engagement.&#xD;
Controlled Regulation: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17. Scores for Controlled Regulation can range from 8 to 56. High scores indicate high controlled motivation or extrinsic motivation for behavior engagement.&#xD;
Scoring for RAI will consist of subtracting the average for Controlled Regulation from the average for Autonomous Regulation. Higher RAI scores indicate higher autonomous or intrinsic motivation for behavior engagement.</description>

          <title>Intervention Group</title>
          <description>The intervention group will receive a sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) app and weight monitoring and physical activity sensors&#xD;
Sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG): The SCDG will involve a narrative, the goal of which is to help an avatar in the game avoid rehospitalization by using game points, earned via the participant's real-time behaviors, in game tasks that help maintain the avatar's optimal heart failure (HF) health status. Real-time behaviors of weight-monitoring and physical activity will be tracked by an off-the-shelf sensors and app (Withings). The data from the Withings sensors will then be routed to our SCDG app.&#xD;
The digital game paired with sensors will enable objective tracking of real-time behaviors such as physical activity, and weight monitoring, and provide personalized, contextually relevant feedback (e.g., reduce fluid intake or call doctor for weight gain) to motivate engagement in and generate habit formation of heart failure related self-management behaviors.</description>

Sensor Only: Real-time behaviors of weight-monitoring and physical activity will be tracked by an off-the-shelf sensors and app (Withings). This group will also be provided with standardized evidence-based heart failure (HF) educational material.However, the data from the Withings sensors will not be routed to the SCDG.</description>

            <title>Intervention Group</title>
            <description>The intervention group will receive a sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) app and weight monitoring and physical activity sensors&#xD;
Sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG): The SCDG will involve a narrative, the goal of which is to help an avatar in the game avoid rehospitalization by using game points, earned via the participant's real-time behaviors, in game tasks that help maintain the avatar's optimal HF health status. Real-time behaviors of weight-monitoring and physical activity will be tracked by an off-the-shelf sensors and app (Withings). The data from the Withings sensors will then be routed to our SCDG app.&#xD;
The digital game paired with sensors will enable objective tracking of real-time behaviors such as physical activity, and weight monitoring, and provide personalized, contextually relevant feedback (e.g., reduce fluid intake or call doctor for weight gain) to motivate engagement in and generate habit formation of heart failure related self-management behaviors.</description>

The data from the Withings sensors will then be routed to our SCDG app.&#xD;
The digital game paired with sensors will enable objective tracking of real-time behaviors such as physical activity, and weight monitoring, and provide personalized, contextually relevant feedback (e.g., reduce fluid intake or call doctor for weight gain) to motivate engagement in and generate habit formation of heart failure related self-management behaviors.</description>

Sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG): The SCDG will involve a narrative, the goal of which is to help an avatar in the game avoid rehospitalization by using game points, earned via the participant's real-time behaviors, in game tasks that help maintain the avatar's optimal HF health status. Real-time behaviors of weight-monitoring and physical activity will be tracked by an off-the-shelf sensors and app (Withings). The data from the Withings sensors will then be routed to our SCDG app.&#xD;
The digital game paired with sensors will enable objective tracking of real-time behaviors such as physical activity, and weight monitoring, and provide personalized, contextually relevant feedback (e.g., reduce fluid intake or call doctor for weight gain) to motivate engagement in and generate habit formation of heart failure related self-management behaviors.</description>

          <title>Intervention Group</title>
          <description>The intervention group will receive a sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) app and weight monitoring and physical activity sensors&#xD;
Sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG): The SCDG will involve a narrative, the goal of which is to help an avatar in the game avoid rehospitalization by using game points, earned via the participant's real-time behaviors, in game tasks that help maintain the avatar's optimal HF health status. Real-time behaviors of weight-monitoring and physical activity will be tracked by an off-the-shelf sensors and app (Withings). The data from the Withings sensors will then be routed to our SCDG app.&#xD;
The digital game paired with sensors will enable objective tracking of real-time behaviors such as physical activity, and weight monitoring, and provide personalized, contextually relevant feedback (e.g., reduce fluid intake or call doctor for weight gain) to motivate engagement in and generate habit formation of heart failure related self-management behaviors.</description>

          <title>Control Group</title>
          <description>The control group will receive only the weight monitoring and physical activity sensors&#xD;
Sensor Only: Real-time behaviors of weight-monitoring and physical activity will be tracked by an off-the-shelf sensors and app (Withings). This group will also be provided with standardized evidence-based HF educational material.However, the data from the Withings sensors will not be routed to the SCDG.</description>
