  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, the investigators have successfully employed a radiotracer (18F-sodium fluoride) as&#xD;
      a marker of necrotic inflammation in human atherosclerosis. The investigators aim to further&#xD;
      the mechanistic understanding of atherothrombosis by studying the activation of glycoprotein&#xD;
      IIb/IIIa receptors in cardiovascular thrombus using the novel platelet radiotracer (18F-GP1).&#xD;
      Binding of 18F-GP1 to activated platelets in venous and arterial thrombi has already been&#xD;
      demonstrated in pre-clinical studies and a phase 1 trial in man. If successful, this study&#xD;
      would define the role of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor within in vivo thrombosis across&#xD;
      a range of cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular thrombotic conditions were estimated to account for 1 in 4 deaths worldwide in&#xD;
      2010 and are the leading cause of global mortality. Divided into arterial and venous&#xD;
      thromboses, ischaemic heart disease and ischemic stroke comprise the major arterial&#xD;
      thromboses and deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism comprise the major venous&#xD;
      thromboses. Although both arterial and venous thrombi differ in both aetiology and&#xD;
      pathophysiology, many commonalities remain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombosis begins with damage to the vascular wall. Physiological haemostasis is triggered&#xD;
      when underlying collagen is exposed to circulating platelets which bind directly to collagen&#xD;
      with collagen-specific glycoprotein surface receptors. After an initial signalling cascade&#xD;
      involving release of platelet binder von Willebrand Factor, platelets become activated which&#xD;
      allows adherence to the site of injury. Following activation, phospholipase A2 modifies the&#xD;
      integrin membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) increasing platelet ability to bind&#xD;
      fibrinogen. The activated platelets then change shape from spherical to stellate, and the&#xD;
      fibrinogen cross-links with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa aiding aggregation of more platelets and&#xD;
      completing primary haemostasis. Secondary haemostasis involves activation of the coagulation&#xD;
      cascade through extrinsic and intrinsic pathways and ends with cross linked fibrin deposition&#xD;
      and a mature thrombus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The haemostatic process is fluid and dynamic with the expression of activated membrane&#xD;
      proteins and coagulation factors changing throughout. Platelet expression of GP IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      falls as a thrombus matures hence why it is a pharmacological target for antithrombotic&#xD;
      therapies. The investigators aim to explore the expression and distribution of GP IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      receptors in a range of thrombotic conditions listed below spanning across both arterial and&#xD;
      venous systems. Improving understanding of how clinical presentation relates to platelet&#xD;
      activation over a range of conditions is crucially important when deciding appropriate&#xD;
      anti-thrombotic regimes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.1 Coronary Heart Disease and Myocardial Infarction Coronary heart disease is the leading&#xD;
      cause of death worldwide and is responsible for 17.5 million or 46% of all non-communicable&#xD;
      deaths in 2012. The majority of the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is attributable to&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Atherosclerosis is the central process by which the&#xD;
      heart arteries narrow and harden due to the deposition of fatty plaques within the artery&#xD;
      wall. This process can result in damage to the lining of the artery which can cause a&#xD;
      thrombus (clot) to form within the artery which can partially or completely occlude the flow&#xD;
      of blood to the heart muscle thereby precipitating myocardial infarction. This is the&#xD;
      commonest form of a heart attack and responsible for a large proportion of sudden cardiac&#xD;
      deaths. Thrombus in myocardial infarction is classically thought to be composed of&#xD;
      predominantly platelets. However, recent research has shown that 56% of thrombus in MI is&#xD;
      composed of fibrin with only 17% platelets. Ischaemic time correlated positively with&#xD;
      thrombus fibrin content and negatively with thrombus platelet component. This illustrates the&#xD;
      dynamic interaction between platelets and fibrin over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.2 Bioprosthetic heart valve thrombosis Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis is an increasingly&#xD;
      recognised complication of valve replacement. Patient risks include early prosthesis failure&#xD;
      requiring redo operation plus stroke or other systemic embolism. A meta-analysis has&#xD;
      estimated the incidence of bioprosthetic thrombosis to be 0.03 per 100 patient years with the&#xD;
      risk of embolism being highest in the first 3 months post implantation. The composition of&#xD;
      prosthetic valve thrombosis varies depending on valve type and time from insertion.&#xD;
      Interestingly in the MISTRAL-C randomised controlled trial, 50% of acute thromboembolic&#xD;
      events within 3 days of transcatheter aortic valve insertion were platelet-fibrin thrombus,&#xD;
      not calcific debris from the aortic root. Thromboembolism was less common in those on&#xD;
      anticoagulant rather than antithrombotic treatment suggesting a fibrin predominance. Similar&#xD;
      results were found in a large registry of over 25,000 patients undergoing surgical&#xD;
      bioprosthetic valve insertion. Warfarin plus aspirin was more effective than aspirin alone in&#xD;
      preventing thromboembolic events and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.3 Venous thromboembolic disease Pulmonary embolism is a common cardiovascular condition&#xD;
      with a high morbidity and mortality. Embolisation of a venous thrombosis from the deep veins&#xD;
      of the lower limbs or pelvis is the aetiology in more than 90% events. Thrombus formation is&#xD;
      triggered by intravascular activation of coagulation and thrombin-mediated intraluminal&#xD;
      fibrin deposition. Red blood cells (RBCs) are thought to be incorporated into venous thrombi&#xD;
      via passive trapping in the growing fibrin network, culminating in the production of a RBC&#xD;
      and fibrin rich venous thrombus. Treatment for both DVT and PE reduces mortality and&#xD;
      secondary prophylaxis with anticoagulation is effective at preventing further events. The&#xD;
      clinically most frequently applied imaging test for visualisation of suspected PE is CT&#xD;
      pulmonary angiography (CTPA). For DVT, a range of imaging modalities can be used (US, CT or&#xD;
      MR) with ultrasound the most common first line investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.4 Stroke and Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) Stroke and TIA are leading causes of&#xD;
      preventable death and morbidity worldwide. Thrombus composition is thought to depend on&#xD;
      source (cardiac chamber or head or neck artery) and time from event. Fibrin-dominant thrombus&#xD;
      is likely to be more refractory to thrombolytic drugs as is the presence of chronic&#xD;
      histopathologic features in clots such as endothelialisation and calcification. Diagnosis is&#xD;
      based on clinical presentation followed by CT or MRI of the brain with US or MR assessment of&#xD;
      carotid stenosis performed thereafter to ascertain future event risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.5 COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      Consistent clinical concerns have been raised in published literature, news outlets and&#xD;
      social media regarding thromboembolic events affecting the microvasculature as well as large&#xD;
      vessels. This has received widespread attention and led to the reported use of prophylactic&#xD;
      or therapeutic anticoagulation regimes, or even fibrinolysis, outwith standard protocols and&#xD;
      indications in the absence of firm evidence of clinical benefit, such is the concern. Given&#xD;
      its sensitivity for detecting activated platelets, which our pilot data has suggested may be&#xD;
      superior to other imaging modalities in some settings, 18F-GP1 PET-CT may offer a suitable&#xD;
      method to examine the posited association between COVID-19 and thromboembolic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Understanding Platelet Biology As platelet aggregation is a major component of both&#xD;
      arterial and venous thrombi, the investigators propose to explore whether a radiolabelled&#xD;
      ligand (18F-GP1) of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) receptor can detect activated&#xD;
      platelets on thrombus. GPIIb/IIIa receptors mediate platelet adherence and aggregation. They&#xD;
      are expressed in greater numbers and assume a more ligand binding conformation on activation&#xD;
      which binds protein ligands including von Willebrand factor and Fibrinogen. This allows for&#xD;
      platelet bridging and aggregation. Accordingly, they represent an attractive target for acute&#xD;
      thrombus imaging. We hope to identify activated platelets in the five groups presented above.&#xD;
      Identification of activated platelets in all conditions will further enhance our&#xD;
      understanding of the role of this receptor in both arterial and venous thrombosis and how&#xD;
      anti-thrombotic therapy influences expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition Three intravenous platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      inhibitors have been studied extensively and are available for clinical use: abciximab,&#xD;
      tirofiban, and eptifibatide. Abciximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the&#xD;
      receptor, while tirofiban and eptifibatide are high affinity non-antibody receptor&#xD;
      inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiplatelet therapy with intravenous GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors has been evaluated in patients&#xD;
      with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in those undergoing intracoronary stent implantation&#xD;
      and stroke but not DVT/PE or prosthetic valve implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-analyses have evaluated the use of intravenous glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors in&#xD;
      a variety of settings related to coronary disease. The impact of the intravenous GP IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      inhibitors on clinical outcomes was assessed in a pooled analysis of 21 trials involving&#xD;
      various groups of patients with ischemic heart disease. The GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor reduced the&#xD;
      combined end point of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or urgent revascularization&#xD;
      at 30 days in the following groups of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those with an ST elevation MI (STEMI) treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary&#xD;
           angioplasty (PTCA) However, these trials were performed largely before the routine use&#xD;
           drug eluting stents and dual oral antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a platelet P2Y12&#xD;
           receptor blocker. In summary, the role of P2Y12 inhibitors has decreased the role of GP&#xD;
           IIb/IIIa therapy in coronary heart disease, although it continues to be important in&#xD;
           some subgroups of patients. We aim to explore the expression of activated platelets&#xD;
           within both stable and unstable coronary disease and how PCI and use of anti-thrombotic&#xD;
           drugs (P2Y12 and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors) mediate expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stroke disease, a single randomised controlled trial (SaTIS) performed in moderate&#xD;
      ischaemic stroke demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality at 5 months with tirofiban&#xD;
      when compared to placebo. Importantly there was no difference in major haemorrhage.The&#xD;
      investigators aim to explore the expression of GPIIb/IIIa in stroke and TIA and explore how&#xD;
      it may differ in the embolised thrombus when compared with the culprit plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of GPIIb/IIIa inhibition in recent bioprosthetic valve insertion and DVT/PE is&#xD;
      unknown. We aim to explore activated platelet expression in both conditions to gain insight&#xD;
      as to whether GPIIb/IIIa inhibition may be a potentially useful treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Background of 18F-GP1 GP1 is a ligand of the fiban class of molecule which has a high&#xD;
      affinity for the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor; highly expressed on activated platelets. It&#xD;
      is an excellent target for imaging arterial thrombi with a large activated platelet&#xD;
      component. After a 2 step radiofluorination subsequent purification process 18F-GP1 can be&#xD;
      used for PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-GP1 has undergone pre-clinical and phase 1 clinical evaluation demonstrating a high&#xD;
      affinity to GPIIb/IIIa, the key receptor for platelet aggregation. It binds in a stable and&#xD;
      specific manner to in vivo arterial, venous and intracardiac human thrombus. Binding is&#xD;
      crucially not altered by anticoagulation therapy (aspirin and heparin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recent phase 1 study 18F-GP1 demonstrated a high detection rate of thromboembolic foci&#xD;
      in 20 patients with recently formed deep vein thrombi (DVT) and pulmonary thromboemboli. The&#xD;
      tracer also performed favourably with regards to its metabolism, pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      dosimetry profile. There were no significant adverse events in any of the 20 recruited&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6 Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to examine the expression of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intracoronary thrombus following spontaneous myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intracoronary thrombus following routine stent insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bioprosthetic heart valve thrombosis (surgical or transcatheter valves).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Venous thromboembolic disease in those with recently confirmed deep vein thrombosis and&#xD;
           pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Carotid and cerebral thrombus in those with stroke and TIA. This would enhance our&#xD;
           understanding of the incidence, consequences and natural history of platelet activation&#xD;
           within cardiovascular thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7 Research Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPIIb/IIIa receptor expression is varied by thrombotic condition including venous (DVT/PE)&#xD;
      versus arterial (MI/stroke), in situ (MI) versus embolic (stroke, PE) and prosthetic material&#xD;
      (stents and valves) versus diseased native tissue (MI, stroke, DVT/PE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.8 Rationale for Study To date, the investigators have successfully employed a radiotracer&#xD;
      (18F-sodium fluoride) as a marker of necrotic inflammation in human atherosclerosis. Binding&#xD;
      of 18F-GP1 to activated platelets in venous and arterial thrombi has already been&#xD;
      demonstrated in pre-clinical studies and a phase 1 trial in man. If successful, this study&#xD;
      would define the role of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor within in vivo thrombosis across&#xD;
      a range of cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
