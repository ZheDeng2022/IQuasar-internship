      The hypothesis is that consumption of pulse-based foods (i.e. containing chickpeas, lentils,&#xD;
      and split peas) during the workday will improve insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, blood&#xD;
      lipids, body composition, and blood pressure in sedentary office workers.One-hundred office&#xD;
      workers from a university campus will participate in a cross-over study where they will be&#xD;
      randomized (i.e. assigned by chance) to receive pre-packaged pulse-based lunches and snacks&#xD;
      to replace their usual lunches/snacks during the work day OR to continue consuming their&#xD;
      usual diets for two months. After the first dietary intervention, they will undergo a 1-month&#xD;
      &quot;wash-out&quot; and then participate in two months of the opposite dietary intervention. The main&#xD;
      outcome to be assessed is change in glucose and insulin (i.e. blood sugar control) determined&#xD;
      during an oral glucose tolerance test. Secondary outcomes include changes in body&#xD;
      composition, lipids, and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pulse-based diet phases, participants will be supplied with a ready-to-eat lunch&#xD;
      and two snacks to eat during each workday. These will contain a total of 150g/d dry weight&#xD;
      (250g/d wet weight) pulses&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sedentary behaviour has been deemed the &quot;new smoking&quot; based on multiple and potent negative&#xD;
      impacts on health. Moreover, sedentary behaviour is a strong predictor of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      risk and cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have show that pulse-based meals derived&#xD;
      from lentils, beans, chickpeas, and peas are effective for alleviating risk factors&#xD;
      associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease in clinical populations including older&#xD;
      adults, overweight and obese individuals, and women with polycystic ovary syndrome; however,&#xD;
      to date, there have been no nutrition-based interventions for alleviating risk factors for&#xD;
      diabetes specifically targeting office workers exposed to long periods of sitting. Although&#xD;
      people are aware of the health benefits of pulses, a major barrier to increased consumption&#xD;
      continues to be a lack of knowledge on how to prepare pulse-based meals. This proposed study&#xD;
      is designed to overcome this barrier. The main goal of this research study is to determine&#xD;
      whether improvements in cardio-metabolic health can be realized by giving people pulse-based&#xD;
      lunches and snacks to replace their regular workplace lunches and snacks. In this randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, 100 office workers from the University of Saskatchewan will participate in&#xD;
      a cross-over study where they will be randomized into one of two diets for 2 months: Receive&#xD;
      pre-packaged pulse-based lunches and snacks to replace their usual lunches/snacks during the&#xD;
      work day OR to continue consuming their usual diets for two months. After a one-month&#xD;
      washout, they will cross-over to the other condition. The primary outcome measure, Matsuda&#xD;
      Index (determined by blood glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose tolerance test),&#xD;
      will be assessed before each diet phase and at the end (i.e. two months) of each diet phase.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures (body composition, waist girth, lipids, blood pressure will also&#xD;
      be assessed.&#xD;
