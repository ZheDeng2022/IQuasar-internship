      This research study involves Niraparib as a possible treatment for triple negative breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved niraparib for this specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Niraparib is a type of drug called a &quot;PARP inhibitor&quot;, which blocks DNA (the genetic material&#xD;
      of cells) damage from being repaired or may prevent damage from occurring in the first place.&#xD;
      In cancer treatment, inhibiting PARP may help kill cancer cells by not allowing the cancer&#xD;
      cells to repair its DNA damage or prevent DNA damage from occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is studying people who have triple negative breast cancer because this cancer type&#xD;
      is shown to have DNA repair mechanisms that may benefit from combined PARP inhibitor and&#xD;
      radiation, and may help prevent recurrence of cancers in the chest wall and lymph nodes of&#xD;
      the affected side.&#xD;
