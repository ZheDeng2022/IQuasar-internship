  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scope of this study is the methodological development and optimisation of sodium MRI&#xD;
      (23Na-MRI) protocols for breast cancer imaging. The study further proposes to utilise&#xD;
      biomarkers obtained from 23Na-imaging (cell integrity), FDG-PET (metabolism),&#xD;
      multi-parametric MRI (perfusion, vascularity, cellularity, morphology) to generate parameter&#xD;
      maps specific for physiological processes in breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomised, exploratory study on ≤20 healthy female volunteers&#xD;
      (&gt;18 years), and ≤45 female patients (&gt;18 years) diagnosed with primary breast cancer.&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers (n≤20) will be scheduled to undergo an 23Na-MR examination. Patients&#xD;
      scheduled for primary surgery (n≤30) will undergo a single MR examination, involving&#xD;
      23Na-imaging prior to their planned surgery. Immunohistochemical analysis will be performed&#xD;
      on surgical tissue specimens to determine tissue markers of interest for correlation with the&#xD;
      imaging findings. Patients undergoing neo-adjuvant therapy (n≤15) will undertake up to two&#xD;
      (2) combined PET/MR examinations with FDG (18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose) and 23Na-MRI.&#xD;
      Patient imaging will occur at two time points prior to their planned surgery: (i) baseline&#xD;
      (prior to initiation of treatment) and (ii) mid-treatment (after 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy).&#xD;
      Histopathological analysis will be performed on pre-treatment biopsies for histological&#xD;
      markers of interest for correlation with the imaging findings.&#xD;
