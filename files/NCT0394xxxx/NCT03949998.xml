  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In about 15% of adult concussion cases, symptoms last longer than 2 weeks and can largely&#xD;
      impact the individual's ability to work, be physically active and participate in everyday&#xD;
      life. These symptoms are often partially related to unresolved neck muscle tightness and&#xD;
      other neck-related symptoms. Dry needling is a technique that uses acupuncture needles to&#xD;
      release muscle knots, decrease neck muscle tightness and decrease neck pain. As far as the&#xD;
      investigators are aware, there have been no studies looking at the effects of dry needling on&#xD;
      symptoms of chronic concussion. This study will compare the effects of dry needling to&#xD;
      traditional hands-on physiotherapy treatment of the neck for concussion-related symptoms.&#xD;
      Participants with chronic concussion symptoms will receive either dry needling, hands-on&#xD;
      manual physiotherapy or both. Concussion symptoms, symptom severity, neck range of motion and&#xD;
      pain with pressure over neck muscles will be compared before and after treatment, and the day&#xD;
      after treatment. The investigators expect that the greatest improvement in all of these will&#xD;
      be seen in the group receiving both interventions, both immediately after treatment and the&#xD;
      following day. If dry needling can immediately improve concussion symptoms, patients may&#xD;
      better tolerate therapeutic exercise and experience quicker resolution of chronic symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will be tested in clinic once, for approximately a half hour. For all&#xD;
      groups, outcome measures relating to concussion symptoms, cervical range of motion and pain&#xD;
      pressure thresholds will be taken prior to and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the DN group, four muscles (upper fibres trapezius, cervical multifidus, levator scapulae&#xD;
      and suboccipitals) will be palpated by a physiotherapist trained in dry needling. If a&#xD;
      palpable trigger point is found, the physiotherapist will perform dry needling until a local&#xD;
      twitch response is elicited. If a trigger point is not found, no dry needling will take&#xD;
      place. In this way, up to 8 total muscles will be needled during the session. The participant&#xD;
      will be in prone for the above procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MT group, soft tissue release will be performed on the above four muscles bilaterally.&#xD;
      Cervical traction (unilateral grade 3 oscillatory distraction technique, any cervical segment&#xD;
      between C0/C1 and C7/C7, 3-5 sets of 30 seconds) and mobilization (unilateral&#xD;
      inferior-medial-posterior or superior-anterior-lateral, grade 3 oscillatory, any cervical&#xD;
      segment between C0/C1 and C7/C7, 3-5 sets of 30 seconds ) will also be performed if the&#xD;
      physiotherapist deems it necessary, specific to the spinal level noted to be involved. In the&#xD;
      DN+MT group, MT interventions will be performed first, followed by DN, of the four above&#xD;
      muscles. Immediately following intervention, the outcome measures will all be re-tested. The&#xD;
      participants will also be instructed to fill out the SCAT-5 Step 2 upon waking the next&#xD;
      morning. Additionally, if one or more of the cervical motions caused pain during initial&#xD;
      testing, they will be asked to repeat the motion and report the current level of pain on the&#xD;
      VAS scale.&#xD;
