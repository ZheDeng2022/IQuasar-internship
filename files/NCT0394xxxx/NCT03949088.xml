  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is aimed at comparing different strategies of UF profiling, dialysate&#xD;
      sodium individualization and sodium profiling (even combining one with the other) and at&#xD;
      evaluating the effectiveness of a new UF profile which has an ascending/descending shape. The&#xD;
      goal of the study is to provide better dialysis tolerance and lower rates of intradialytic&#xD;
      hypotensive events by the application of this UF profile design in combination with a neutral&#xD;
      sodium balance.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, crossover trial. The study will be performed in 2 phases.&#xD;
      Each phase will be divided in several sub-phases (see &quot;4.1 Study phases&quot;). Phase 1 will&#xD;
      consist of 9 weeks of treatment (27 HD sessions) for each patient; phase 2 will consist of 11&#xD;
      weeks of treatment (33 HD sessions) for each patient. Each subject will be used as his/her&#xD;
      own control. Dry weight, anti-hypertensive medications and dialysis parameters will not be&#xD;
      modified during the study phases, except for UF rate and dialysate sodium concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study phases&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 - First phase: validation of the new UF profile with a standard dialysate sodium&#xD;
      concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. run-in: constant Na concentration, constant UF rate - 2 weeks (6 sessions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 2-step descending Na profile, linear descending UF profile - 3 weeks (9 sessions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. washout: constant Na concentration, constant UF rate - 1 week (3 sessions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 2-step descending Na profile, ascending/descending UF profile - 3 weeks (9 sessions)&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 - Second phase: combination of UF profiles and individualized dialysate sodium&#xD;
      concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. run-in: standard constant Na concentration, constant UF rate - 2 weeks (6 sessions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. individualized constant Na concentration, constant UF rate - 2 weeks (6 sessions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. individualized 2-step Na profile, linear descending UF profile - 3 weeks (9 sessions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. washout: individualized constant Na profile, constant UF rate - 1 week (3 sessions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. individualized 2-step Na profile, ascending/descending UF profile - 3 weeks (9 sessions)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 1 patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (1), (2), (3), (4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (1), (4), (3), (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 2 patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (1), (2), (3), (4), (5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (1), (2), (5), (4), (3) Patients who will be included in phase 1 will undergo at least a&#xD;
           2-week washout period before entering phase 2. During these 2 weeks dry weight and&#xD;
           anti-hypertensive therapy may be re-evaluated and re-assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dialysis prescription&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will undergo a standard HD with the following prescription:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood flow: individualized from 250 to 350 mL/min (this value will be established for&#xD;
           each patient at the beginning of the run-in phase on the basis of previous evaluations&#xD;
           and maintained unchanged for the whole duration of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dialysate flow: 500 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dialysate composition: HCO3- 34 mmol/L, K+ 3 mmol/L, Ca2+ 1.25 mmol/L, Mg2+ 0.5 mmol/L,&#xD;
           Cl- 111.5 mmol/L, acetate 3.0 mmol/L, glucose 1 g/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dialysate temperature: 36Â°C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HD session duration: 4 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  during each dialysis session patients will be allowed to drink an amount of maximum 150&#xD;
           mL of water, tea or coffee and they will be allowed to eat a snack&#xD;
&#xD;
      UF profiles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;linear descending&quot; UF profile: this profile provides a constantly decreasing UF rate&#xD;
           during dialysis, starting at a UF rate 1.33 fold the average UF rate (33,25% of total UF&#xD;
           rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;ascending/descending&quot; UF profile: this profile can be divided in 2 different phases.&#xD;
           The first one includes 3 ascending steps during the first hour of treatment, each step&#xD;
           lasting 20 minutes (during the 1st step UF rate is set at 15% of total UF rate, during&#xD;
           2nd step at 25% of total UF rate, during 3rd step at 35% of total UF rate). During the&#xD;
           following 3 hours UF rate is shaped as a linear descending UF profile, with a constantly&#xD;
           decreasing UF rate, starting at a UF rate 1.33 fold the average UF rate (33,25% of total&#xD;
           UF rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dialysate sodium&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - First phase&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;standard&quot; concentration: the investigators will consider as &quot;standard&quot; a dialysate&#xD;
                sodium concentration of 140 mmol/L, which is the concentration usually prescribed&#xD;
                in our dialysis facility&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  dialysate sodium profile will be shaped as a descending 2-step ramping, each step&#xD;
                consisting of half the total treatment duration (2 hours), with a 6 mmol/L&#xD;
                difference between the concentrations defined for each of the two steps.&#xD;
                Considering a monocompartimental model with variable dialysate sodium, the profile&#xD;
                will be set on the basis of an &quot;equivalent sodium&quot;. This value will correspond to&#xD;
                the dialysate sodium concentration expected to produce the same diffusive balance&#xD;
                that a fixed standard concentration (140 mmol/L) would provide: 144 mmol/L for the&#xD;
                first 2 hours, 138 mmol/L for the last 2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Second phase&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;individualized&quot; concentration: for each patient dialysate sodium concentration&#xD;
                will be established on the basis of the mean of the sodium plasma values measured&#xD;
                through pre-HD sampling during the run-in phase (2 repeated measurements before&#xD;
                each HD session, for a total of 12 values for each patient). Plasma values will be&#xD;
                obtained through a direct potentiometry analysis. Dialysate sodium concentration&#xD;
                will be set at the patient's average plasma sodium concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  dialysate sodium profile will be shaped as a descending 2-step ramping, each step&#xD;
                consisting of half the total treatment duration (2 hours), with a 6 mmol/L&#xD;
                difference between the concentrations set for each of the two steps. Considering a&#xD;
                monocompartimental model with variable dialysate sodium, the profile will be set on&#xD;
                the basis of an &quot;equivalent sodium&quot;. This value will correspond to the dialysate&#xD;
                sodium concentration expected to produce the same diffusive balance that a fixed&#xD;
                individualized concentration (equal to the patient's average plasma sodium&#xD;
                concentration) would provide: &quot;average + 4&quot; mmol/L for the first 2 hours, &quot;average&#xD;
                - 2&quot; mmol/L for the last 2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of &quot;dry weight&quot;, &quot;UF volume&quot; and &quot;interdialytic weight gain&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dry weight will be estimated through standard clinical criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  total UF volume (net fluid to be removed) will be calculated before each session as the&#xD;
           difference between patient's weight and his/her dry weight. A limit of 12.5 mL/kg/h will&#xD;
           be considered as maximal total UF volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IDGW will be calculated as the difference between patient's weight at the beginning of&#xD;
           dialysis and the weight registered at the end of the previous session UF and IDGW will&#xD;
           be respectively corrected for pre-HD weight (UF %) and dry weight (IDWG %), thus&#xD;
           obtaining measures that will be more relevant to each specific patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome and definition of &quot;intradialytic hypotension&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the incidence of intradialytic hypotensive episodes. Hypotensive&#xD;
      events and symptoms (headache, cramps, nausea and vomiting) will be recorded and analyzed as&#xD;
      both number of occurrences and time of occurrence from the beginning of the HD session. IDH&#xD;
      will be defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;symptomatic IDH&quot;: decrease in SBP â¥ 20 mmHg or in MAP â¥ 10 mmHg associated with&#xD;
           symptoms (KDIGO definition)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;asymptomatic IDH&quot;: drop in BP (SBP â¥ 20 mmHg or MAP â¥ 10 mmHg) within a 20 minutes&#xD;
           interval, regardless of symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  for patients whose SBP is &lt; 100 mmHg at the beginning of treatment, the investigators&#xD;
           will consider as IDH any decrease of SBP â¥ 10%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions in case of hypotensive events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trendelenburg position&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  temporary stop of UF (10 minutes), then restarted at a UF rate equal to &quot;total UF - 100&#xD;
           mL&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  online infusion of 150 mL of saline solution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  discontinuation of the session&#xD;
&#xD;
      BV monitoring Relative blood volume will be evaluated through the BVM system integrated in&#xD;
      the dialysis machine. RBV will be recorded every 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcome measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pre-, intra- (after every hour of treatment) and post-HD plasma sodium levels will be&#xD;
           determined by direct potentiometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded every 20 minutes, or more frequently if&#xD;
           needed for clinical necessities, by machine-integrated BPM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  achievement of UF will be considered as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  achievement of dry weight: % target UFDW = UF vol / (preHD weight - dry weight) x&#xD;
                100&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IDWG removal: % target UFWG = UF vol / IDWG x 100&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;UF failure&quot; will be defined as % target UFDW &lt; 70%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;session failure&quot; will occur when treatment will have to be discontinued before 75% of&#xD;
           the prescribed time (before 3 hours of treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kt/V will be estimated through the system integrated in the machine (total body water&#xD;
           calculated using Watson's equation)&#xD;
