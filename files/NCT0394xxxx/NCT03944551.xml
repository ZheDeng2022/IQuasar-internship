  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in Mali, Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumonia is a respiratory infection of the lungs caused by bacteria or virus. Some children&#xD;
      can develop signs of severe pneumonia and as a result, have difficulty breathing and low&#xD;
      levels of oxygen in the blood. In some cases this can progress to death. Patients with signs&#xD;
      of severe pneumonia require admission to the hospital for treatment and the treatment&#xD;
      includes delivery of oxygen. Currently, in the hospital, oxygen is available for delivery by&#xD;
      nasal cannula to children. In this case, oxygen is given through a small plastic tube which&#xD;
      delivers oxygen through the nose. However, the amount of oxygen that can be given is limited&#xD;
      because of the size of the tube and the amount of oxygen that can go through. However, a new&#xD;
      device known as the bubble CPAP machine delivers oxygen through the nose in a way that helps&#xD;
      the airways to stay open. This is known to provide better support to children less than 1&#xD;
      year of age who have difficulty breathing with signs of severe pneumonia. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of bubble CPAP in Children up to 5 years of age with&#xD;
      with signs of severe pneumonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes two cohorts. One cohort will participate in an interventional clinical&#xD;
      trial and the other cohort will participate in an observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cohort will include 600 children with signs of severe pneumonia, 1 year up to 5&#xD;
      years of age. Signs of severe pneumonia include fast breathing, difficulty breathing and who&#xD;
      are very sick (not able to drink, vomiting, having seizures, are very sleepy or with severe&#xD;
      malnutrition). Two out of every three children will receive oxygen with the bubble CPAP and&#xD;
      one out of every three children will receive treatment with oxygen with regular nasal&#xD;
      cannula. The treatment assignment will be determined randomly. We will follow up participants&#xD;
      during their entire hospitalization. During this time we will collect information on the&#xD;
      child's illness, test results and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second cohort will include 450 children with signs of severe pneumonia, under 1 year of&#xD;
      age. In Mali, bubble CPAP is currently given as standard of care (when possible) for children&#xD;
      with signs of severe pneumonia, under 1 year of age; therefore, children in this cohort will&#xD;
      already be receiving bubble CPAP as standard of care prior to enrollment. The only research&#xD;
      activities will be to follow the children during their hospitalization and collect&#xD;
      information about their clinical condition, test results, treatment and the amount of oxygen&#xD;
      required during the hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remainder of the information in this ClinicalTrials.gov registration will refer only to&#xD;
      the Intervention Cohort.&#xD;

Severe hypoxemia (Saturation of oxygen SpO2 &lt;85%) after being on one of the study groups treatments for 2 hours&#xD;
Increased in respiratory rate by any amount or if respiratory rate remains unchanged after initiation of treatment as follow:&#xD;
≥ 40 breath/min in a child aged 12-23 months&#xD;
≥ 30 breaths/min in a child aged 2-5 years&#xD;
Signs of persistent severe respiratory distress defined as head nodding, severe chest indrawing, stridor, apnea, nasal flaring and or grunting.&#xD;

    <description>Those assigned to the bCPAP group will receive a Total flow oxygen at a rate of 2 liters per kilogram to a maximum of 10 liters per minute using the appropriate nasal prongs for the age and size of the patient. The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) provide by bCPAP will start at 8cm HO2. The FIO2 will be adjusted to obtain a saturation of oxygen of 90% or greater.</description>
