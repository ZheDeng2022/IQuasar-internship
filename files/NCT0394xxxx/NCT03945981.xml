  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces morbidity and mortality for&#xD;
      individuals infected with HIV. Suppressing viral replication with ART also reduces the&#xD;
      potential for transmission of HIV. Hence, ART is recommended for all persons with HIV viremia&#xD;
      regardless of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count. This is an open-label single arm&#xD;
      which will evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety using a fixed dose combination (FDC)&#xD;
      of Dolutegravir (DTG) plus Lamivudine (3TC) as a first line regimen of a rapid Test and Treat&#xD;
      model of care over 48 weeks. Participants with new and confirmed diagnosed HIV-1 who are&#xD;
      willing to start study treatment immediately following diagnosis will receive 50 milligram&#xD;
      (mg) DTG + 300 (mg) 3TC FDC as first line therapy without waiting for screening laboratory&#xD;
      results, at the Screening/Day 1 Visit. The total duration for the study will be 52 weeks and&#xD;
      4 weeks of follow up period if required. This study will be conducted in United States (US)&#xD;
      with approximately 120 participants.&#xD;

    <description>Participants were classified as &quot;HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL&quot; using an ITT-E missing = Failure analysis. Participants were classified as 'HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 c/mL' if the last viral load within the Week 24 visit window was &lt;50/c/mL, regardless of the ART regimen they were on at the time of viral load assessment (in other words switch from DTG plus 3TC fixed-dose combination [FDC] to another ART was not penalized) and as HIV-1 RNA &gt;= 50 c/mL in all other cases (i.e. last viral load within Week 24 visit window &gt;= 50 c/mL, on study but having missing viral load data at Week 24, discontinued early from study due to lost to follow-up (LFU), withdrew consent or any other reason).

        <description>Participants were classified as &quot;HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL&quot; using an ITT-E missing = Failure analysis. Participants were classified as 'HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 c/mL' if the last viral load within the Week 24 visit window was &lt;50/c/mL, regardless of the ART regimen they were on at the time of viral load assessment (in other words switch from DTG plus 3TC fixed-dose combination [FDC] to another ART was not penalized) and as HIV-1 RNA &gt;= 50 c/mL in all other cases (i.e. last viral load within Week 24 visit window &gt;= 50 c/mL, on study but having missing viral load data at Week 24, discontinued early from study due to lost to follow-up (LFU), withdrew consent or any other reason). Confidence intervals (CI) were calculated based on the Exact Clopper-Pearson method.

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Genotypic Resistance</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for genotypic resistance testing post-Baseline when Confirmed Virologic Failure criteria were met or in other occasion as needed (e.g. at time of study withdrawal when HIV-1 RNA &gt;= 400 c/mL). New mutations were tabulated by drug class: integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and protease inhibitor (PI). Number of participants with treatment-emergent resistance associated mutations to any class (INSTI, NNRTI, NRTI, PI) from post-Baseline genotypic resistance data up to Week 48 have been presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Maximum Post-Baseline Emergent Chemistry Toxicities Under Treatment With DTG + 3TC FDC</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected up to Week 48 for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, carbon dioxide (CO2), creatinine kinase (CK), creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from creatinine adjusted for body surface area (BSA), glucose, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia and phosphate. Any abnormality was graded according to DAIDS toxicity scales from Grade 1 to 4 (1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe, 4=Potentially life threatening). Higher grade indicates more severity. Only those participants with maximum post-Baseline emergent chemistry toxicities in any of the chemistry parameters have been presented.</description>

        <description>CD4+ cells are type of white blood cells that fight infection and as HIV infection progresses, the number of these cells decline. Blood samples were collected at specified time points to assess CD4+. It was evaluated by flow cytometry. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1). Change from Baseline was defined as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>
