  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parallel to epidemic obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence has&#xD;
      markedly increased during the last years, and recent data point out that one of three adults&#xD;
      courses with this disease. NAFLD etiopathogeny is multifactorial, an inadequate diet&#xD;
      characterized by high fructose content and deficient consumption of omega-3 fatty acids,&#xD;
      scarce physical activity, excess abdominal visceral fat (AVF), insulin resistance, and&#xD;
      genetic susceptibility have shown to be relevant determinants. Although NAFLD can progress to&#xD;
      cirrhosis and hepatic carcinoma, its most frequent complications are type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (DM2) and coronary artery disease (CAD); therefore, NAFLD is considered a multisystemic&#xD;
      disease and a public health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no specific pharmacological treatment is available for NAFLD, hence, modifications&#xD;
      in life style, including weight loss by caloric restriction and increased physical activity,&#xD;
      are still the treatment of choice for this type of patients. Recent studies indicate that the&#xD;
      supplementation of the diet with omega-3 fatty acids of marine origin (eicosapentanoic acid&#xD;
      [EPA]/docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and the Mediterranean-style diet (rich in omega-3,&#xD;
      antioxidants, and fiber) are efficient for NAFLD treatment, because they diminish the&#xD;
      intrahepatic fat content and improve the metabolic profile, even in non-caloric restriction&#xD;
      diets. However, the socioeconomic and cultural characteristics make the consumption of these&#xD;
      food difficult in some populations, which has led to the search of alternative vegetal&#xD;
      sources rich in these nutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, there is evidence in animal models suggesting that chia (Salvia hispanica L.) could&#xD;
      be an alternative able to reduce the intrahepatic fat content, its effect on NAFLD has not&#xD;
      been studied in humans. Hence, the objective of this study was to analyze whether the&#xD;
      consumption of an isocaloric diet supplemented with 25 g/day of chia can diminish NAFLD and&#xD;
      the metabolic anomalies that accompany the disease.&#xD;

      Participants were chosen from the control group of the Genetics of the Atherosclerotic&#xD;
      Disease (GEA, for its initials in Spanish) study, performed at the Institute National of&#xD;
      Cardiology &quot;Ignacio Chávez&quot; in Mexico City, Mexico. The protocol was approved by the Research&#xD;
      and Ethics Committee of the Instituto Nacional de Cardiología &quot;Ignacio Chavez&quot; under the&#xD;
      number 16-980. Candidates that accepted to participate in the study signed voluntarily the&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to know eating habits and standardize macronutrient dietary composition, 24-hour&#xD;
      dietary recalls will be applied in the first visit, considering two weekdays and one day of&#xD;
      the weekend. Patients will be instructed to maintain constant their physical activity&#xD;
      throughout the study. To standardize macronutrient dietary composition, an isocaloric diet&#xD;
      (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 15% protein diet) will be indicated two weeks before starting&#xD;
      chia supplementation. After this, participants will be instructed to keep up this&#xD;
      macronutrient composition during all the intervention period. 30 packages of 25 g of chia&#xD;
      seeds will be provided to each patient monthly, with the instruction to mill one package per&#xD;
      day, pointing out on the relevance of consume the milled chia accompanied by with water,&#xD;
      salads, cereal, or other dishes, from breakfast through lunch but always before 6:00 PM. To&#xD;
      favor treatment adherence and record adverse events (loss appetite loss, constipation,&#xD;
      diarrhea, flatulence and nausea, allergy or chía chia intolerance), patients will be&#xD;
      contacted once a week during the intervention. Adherence will be determined by counting empty&#xD;
      chia packages, and evaluation of alpha linolenic acid (ALA) concentration in plasma, which is&#xD;
      the chia's seeds main fatty acid compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric evaluation, laboratory test, and computed tomography studies will be made at&#xD;
      baseline and after the 8-wk intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional intervention and food intake evaluation In order to know eating habits and&#xD;
      standardize macronutrient dietary composition, 24-hour dietary recalls will be applied in the&#xD;
      first visit, considering two weekdays and one day of the weekend. Patients will be instructed&#xD;
      to maintain constant their physical activity throughout the study. To standardize&#xD;
      macronutrient dietary composition, an isocaloric diet (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 15%&#xD;
      protein diet) will be indicated two weeks before starting chia supplementation. After this,&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to keep up this macronutrient composition during all the&#xD;
      intervention period. 30 packages of 25 g of chia seeds will be provided to each patient&#xD;
      monthly, with the instruction to mill one package per day, pointing out on the relevance of&#xD;
      consume the milled chia accompained by with water, salads, cereal, or other dishes, from&#xD;
      breakfast through lunch but always before 6:00 PM. To favor treatment adherence and record&#xD;
      adverse events (loss appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence and nausea, allergy or&#xD;
      chía chia intolerance), patients will be contacted once a week during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence will be determined by counting empty chia packages, and evaluation of alpha&#xD;
      linolenic acid (ALA) concentration in plasma, which is the chia's seeds main fatty acid&#xD;
      compound. Participants wre excluded when the adherence was lower tan 80% according to the&#xD;
      package counting, or when plasma ALA concentration increased less than 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric evaluation, laboratory test, and computed tomography studies will be made at&#xD;
      baseline and after the 8-wk of diet intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric evaluation: Weight and height will be recorded using a calibrated scale and&#xD;
      wall stadiometer, with an accuracy of 0.1 Kg kg and 0.1 cm, after removing excess clothing&#xD;
      and shoes. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2). Waist&#xD;
      circumference will be measured with a non-stretch tape, at the midway between the lowest rib&#xD;
      and the iliac crest without clothes around the waist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests: After 10-h fasting and 20 min in sitting position, venous blood will be&#xD;
      collected in assay tubes without anticoagulant and in tubes with K2-EDTA (1.8 mg/mL).&#xD;
      Glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)&#xD;
      concentrations will be determined using direct standard enzymatic colorimetric methods on a&#xD;
      COBAS c311 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Low density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      (LDL-C) concentration was estimated using the De Long formula. The reproducibility and&#xD;
      precision of these determinations in our laboratory is assessed by the Center for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention Lipids Standardization Program (LSP-CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA). Plasma&#xD;
      free fatty acids (FFA) will be measured by an enzymatic-colorimetric assay (Wako Diagnostics,&#xD;
      Chuo-Ku Osaka, Japan). Total fatty acids, including ALA will be extracted according to Folch&#xD;
      method, and analyzed in a Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph equipped with an SP2330 capilar&#xD;
      column (25m x 0.25 mm x 0.25). Fatty-acid concentrations will be calculated in relation to&#xD;
      heptadecanoic acid methyl ester as internal standard, fatty acids peaks will be identified by&#xD;
      using the Supelco 37 component FAME Mix (CRM47885). A plasma control sample will be run in&#xD;
      each extraction assay, to obtain an ALA inter-assay coefficient variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography study: Computed tomography (CT) is a validated method for measuring&#xD;
      visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and evaluate non alcoholic fatty liver disease. In the present&#xD;
      study, these measurements will be obtained using a 64-slice scanner (Somatom Cardiac&#xD;
      Sensation 64, Forcheim, Bavaria, Germany). To determine the liver and spleen attenuation&#xD;
      index, a single slice CT scan is obtained at the level of T11-T12 or T12-L1. Fatty liver is&#xD;
      defined as a liver/spleen attenuation ratio lower than 1.0. To calculate the amount of total&#xD;
      abdominal tissue (TAT) and VAT, a single slice scan is obtained at the level of L4-L5, the&#xD;
      area is expressed in square centimeters (cm2). Subcutaneous abdominal tissue (SAT) was&#xD;
      calculated by subtracting the VAT from the TAT area.&#xD;
