  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health literacy (HL) is the ability to access, understand, evaluate and apply information in&#xD;
      order to communicate with health professionals and understand health instructions but also,&#xD;
      promote, maintain and improve health throughout life. Health literacy is known as a health&#xD;
      determinant. An association has been shown between low health literacy and low health&#xD;
      outcomes such as increased number of unscheduled hospitalization or emergency visits, low&#xD;
      medication adherence and poor health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These have been particularly demonstrated with cardiovascular diseases, which combine risk&#xD;
      factors (emergency hospitalization, reduction in the length of hospital stays, and complex&#xD;
      secondary preventive drug treatments). Despite many scientific international literature about&#xD;
      health literacy and health outcomes, no information is available in France on the prevalence&#xD;
      of low health literacy level of patients, notably cardiovascular patients. The investigating&#xD;
      team's hypothesis is that knowing the prevalence of low HL levels in cardiovascular patients&#xD;
      would help to better tailored a communication intervention dedicated to the needs of these&#xD;
      low-HL patients with the final aim of increasing their adhesion to preventive drugs and&#xD;
      behavioural recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of the present study is to estimate the prevalence of low HL level among&#xD;
      patients discharged after acute myocardial infarction or acute decompensation of chronic&#xD;
      heart failure. Secondary aims are to assess factors associated with the level of HL and&#xD;
      identify barriers and facilitators of low HL patients to understand medical information on&#xD;
      their disease. The results of this study will guide the design of the intervention of an&#xD;
      interventional study on HL of cardiovascular patients.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Health Literacy Screening (BHLS) of patients hospitalized for a cardiovascular disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Health literacy will be measured thanks to the questionnaire Brief Health Literacy Screening (BHLS). This questionnaire is composed of 3 questions and is known to screen quickly patient health literacy. The 3 responses are summed to generate a score between 3 and 15, where higher scores indicated higher health literacy. Low health literacy is defined as Brief Health Literacy Screen less than or equal to a score of 9.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The HLQ explores more dimensions of health literacy such as social support relationship with caregivers, health information evaluation or ability to engage with caregivers. It consists of 44 items. Participants are asked to rate &quot;How strongly do you disagree or agree with the following statements?&quot;. The options provided were: 'strongly disagree', 'disagree', 'agree' and 'strongly agree', which were scored from 1 to 4, respectively. In 2nd part of the HLQ, participants were asked &quot;How easy or difficult are the following tasks for you to do now?&quot; The options for these scales were 'cannot do', 'very difficult', 'quite difficult', 'quite easy' and 'very easy', which were scored from 1 to 5, respectively. The higher the score the higher the health literacy of a patient.</description>

    <description>It is a cross-sectional study coupled with a qualitative ancillary study conducted within patients hospitalized for one of the two acute cardiovascular diseases (acute coronary syndrome or acute heart failure). All patients hospitalized at Hospices Civils de Lyon for one of these two diseases and whom are going back home will be enrolled. Few patients will be interviewed during the follow-up visit at 1-month post hospitalisation. Caregivers from cardiology units will also be interviewed.</description>
