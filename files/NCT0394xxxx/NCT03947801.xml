  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our proposed study is a 5-d double-blind randomised cross-over trial, seeking to simulate a&#xD;
      training identification camp in competitive adolescent soccer players&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate whether increased protein consumption by&#xD;
      Greek yogurt, compared to an isoenergetic carbohydrate (CHO) control supplement, consumed&#xD;
      immediately following exercise training, prior to sleep and between breakfast and lunch, for&#xD;
      a week during an intense training period (high volume, high intensity) will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attenuate the pro-inflammatory response (cytokines, acute phase proteins)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced the severity of muscle damage and impairment (creatine kinase)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintain performance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Increase bone turnover (in favour of formation)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized, double-blinded, cross-over trial. The protocol will&#xD;
      consist of an information session, two identical training camps consisting of 5 consecutive&#xD;
      days of intensified soccer training, differing only by nutritional intervention, and&#xD;
      identical pre-and post-training session testing. Each testing block will be separated by 28-d&#xD;
      to allow for an adequate wash-out and recovery period, during which participants would resume&#xD;
      their regular soccer activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests and measurements will be performed within eight-weeks. Specifically, participants&#xD;
      will attend 1 information session, two identical pre- and post- training/testing sessions and&#xD;
      two identical soccer specific training camps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information session:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week prior to the initial soccer specific training camp, participants will be informed of&#xD;
      all tests and procedures that will take place and be familiarized with all testing protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and Post-training testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be tested twice: on the day before (pre) and day following (post) the&#xD;
      5-d soccer specific training camp. Specifically, Participants, will arrive at the University&#xD;
      for pre- and post-training testing in the morning at the same time. Body composition&#xD;
      measurements will be performed (e.g., standing/seated height, mass, % body fat) followed by&#xD;
      fasted venous blood and saliva sampling. A standardized breakfast would then be provided&#xD;
      followed by an adequate rest and digest period before performance testing (~1.5h).&#xD;
      Performance testing would include a battery of soccer specific tests that cover, power&#xD;
      (counter-movement jump, broad jump), speed (10m and 20m sprint), agility (modified 5-0-5) and&#xD;
      aerobic capacity (beep-test). During both pre-and-post-testing sessions participants would&#xD;
      consume the same standardised breakfast and perform the same tests in the same order for&#xD;
      consistency amongst trials which would be repeated between the two testing blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soccer training:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simulated 5-d soccer-specific training will be structured to mimic a heavy-volume,&#xD;
      high-intensity training camp. Training sessions would occur at the same time each day in the&#xD;
      evening for consistency. Drills/exercises will be administered by a certified technical&#xD;
      soccer coach and knowledgeable training staff. Each session will began with a 15 min dynamic&#xD;
      warm-up followed by 90 min of soccer-specific training, ending with a 15 min cool-down. The&#xD;
      90 min of soccer-specific training will be performed at maximal effort and consist of&#xD;
      agility, sprinting and plyometric exercises as well as ball-handling, small-sided games&#xD;
      (rondo) and shooting. Following each training session rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will&#xD;
      be measured as an indicator of internal load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food/Drink supplement consumption:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, three servings of 160 g of 0% plain GY (~115 kcals, 17 g protein, ~11.5 g&#xD;
      carbs, 0 fat), or 30 g of isoenergetic CHO (~115 kcal, 0.04 g protein, ~28.6 g carbs, 0 fat)&#xD;
      will be provided to participants immediately following the training session, 1 h prior to&#xD;
      bedtime, as well as one serving between breakfast and lunch on the subsequent day. The yogurt&#xD;
      will be sweetened or flavored with a non-caloric vanilla flavouring to match the taste of the&#xD;
      control supplement. The CHO control supplement group will be an isoenergetic dose of a&#xD;
      maltodextrin-based semi-solid pudding. This product will be made from non-fat vanilla pudding&#xD;
      powder (1 part), maltodextrin (4 parts) and water. This product has been designed to resemble&#xD;
      the consistency and texture of Greek yogurt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: Participant Screening and Medical History, Training History, Food frequency&#xD;
      Questionnaire (FFQ), sessional RPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric and body composition measurements: height, seated height, body mass and body&#xD;
      fat percentage (%) using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA, InBody520; Biospace Co.,&#xD;
      Ltd., Seoul, S. Korea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatic maturity: maturity offset (years from the age of peak height velocity) will be&#xD;
      calculated based on height, seated height and weight measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise performance: will be examined prior to, as well as following each training&#xD;
      intervention week. These tests are common in soccer and athletes are familiar with them. To&#xD;
      limit confounding exercise influence on both biochemical and performance parameters,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to refrain from other activities outside those prescribed to them&#xD;
      during the training sessions and 48h prior to the initial pre-assessment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood and saliva samples: will be collected on 4 separate occasions (24h prior and 24h&#xD;
      following the last training session of each training intervention week). To control for&#xD;
      circadian rhythm, the exercise session and related blood and saliva samples will be conducted&#xD;
      at the same time of day. Saliva samples will be used to examine endocrine response. Venous&#xD;
      blood samples will be used to examine inflammatory markers (cytokines - IL-6, IL-10 and&#xD;
      TNF-Î±), c-reactive protein (CRP), IGF-I and indicators of muscle fatigue/damage (CK).&#xD;
      Secondary measures may include irisin, oxidative stress (TBARS and ROS) and bone turnover by&#xD;
      examining circulating markers of bone formation (PINP, Osteocalcin, BAP, OPG) and of bone&#xD;
      resorption (CTX, TRAP, RANKL).&#xD;
