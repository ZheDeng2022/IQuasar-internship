  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study aimed at testing a commonly available and inexpensive chemical (hydrogen&#xD;
      peroxide) for efficacy in sensitising large cancerous lumps in the breast to a standard&#xD;
      course of radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced or recurrent breast cancer.&#xD;
      Laboratory research and initial clinical trials in Japan suggest that 4 to 6 injections of a&#xD;
      radiation sensitiser ('KORTUC') based on very dilute (0.5%) hydrogen peroxide injected into&#xD;
      cancers under local anaesthetic twice a week during radiotherapy greatly increases the&#xD;
      effectiveness of standard doses of radiotherapy alone. The side effects are limited to&#xD;
      mild/moderate discomfort at the injection site for up to 24 hours reported by Japanese breast&#xD;
      cancer patients in whom this treatment has been tested. Complete tumour shrinkage in 70/71&#xD;
      (98%) primary breast cancers up to 5 cm diameter have been reported by Japanese&#xD;
      collaborators.&#xD;

      Aim: To test a slow release gel containing a commonly available and inexpensive chemical&#xD;
      (hydrogen peroxide) for safety and activity in sensitizing large cancerous lumps in the&#xD;
      breast or armpit to a standard 3-week course of radiotherapy in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or recurrent breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Laboratory research and initial clinical trials conducted in Japan raises the&#xD;
      possibility that a simple and inexpensive treatment based on a very dilute (0.5%) hydrogen&#xD;
      peroxide injected into cancers under local anaesthetic greatly increases the effectiveness of&#xD;
      standard doses of radiotherapy. The side effects appear to be limited to mild/moderate&#xD;
      discomfort at the injection site for up to 24 hours in one-third of patients. Rapid, complete&#xD;
      and durable tumour disappearance has been reported in 49/55 bulky breast cancers in Japanese&#xD;
      women treated using this approach, a response that is at least 3 times the success rate of&#xD;
      radiotherapy alone in our own patients and in a contemporary Japanese control population. The&#xD;
      inventor, Prof Ogawa of Kochi University, has approached the investigators to lead the&#xD;
      further clinical evaluation and commercial development, starting with the proposed early&#xD;
      phase trials testing safety and anti-cancer activity described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methods: After numbing the skin with local anaesthetic, a specialist doctor&#xD;
      (radiologist) or trained radiographer will use ultrasound to guide the injection of a small&#xD;
      volume of dilute (0.5%) hydrogen peroxide solution into the tumour twice a week during 3&#xD;
      weeks of standard radiotherapy. The drug is suspended in a natural gel (1% sodium&#xD;
      hyaluronate, licensed for treating stiff knee joints) that ensures its slow release over 48&#xD;
      hours. The injection procedure lasts for 10-15 minutes altogether. Tiny oxygen bubbles are&#xD;
      released from the hydrogen peroxide which help the radiologist guide the injection of drug to&#xD;
      the proper places under the skin. We have recently completed a safety study confirming the&#xD;
      mildness of side effects in 12 patients, and we now wish to test activity against cancer in a&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial in 184 patients. Patients participating in Phase II will either&#xD;
      have standard radiotherapy or the same radiotherapy plus the drug under test. Neither the&#xD;
      patient nor the doctor will choose who has which treatment, which is allocated randomly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and public involvement: Independent Cancer Patient Voice, a patient advocate group in&#xD;
      the field of cancer, is collaborating with the investigators on the research plan, commenting&#xD;
      and advising on the content and clarity of the written proposal. This group plays a prominent&#xD;
      role in promoting UK clinical research, being represented on the Trial Management Groups of&#xD;
      several national randomised cancer clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination: The results of this study will be presented at scientific meetings and at&#xD;
      meetings of the patient advocate group in order to judge if the results for safety and&#xD;
      activity are promising enough to justify taking the research further.&#xD;
