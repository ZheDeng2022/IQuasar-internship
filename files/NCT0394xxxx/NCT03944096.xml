  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this 24-week, single center, randomized, double-blind study, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with active&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis refractory to methotrexate&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease, characterized by painful synovium&#xD;
      inflammation, bony erosions, immune activation. Gut microbiota plays an important role in&#xD;
      pathophysiology of RA. FMT(fecal microbiota transplantation) is the engraftment of microbiota&#xD;
      from a healthy donor into a recipient to achieve restoration of the normal gut microbial&#xD;
      community structure.This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of FMT with methotrexate in&#xD;
      patients with active RA refractory to methotrexate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy of FMT with MTX for the treatment of signs and symptoms of RA&#xD;
           in patients refractory to MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the safety of FMT with MTX for the treatment of signs and symptoms of RA in&#xD;
           patients refractory to MTX DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, 24-week, double-blind, parallel group study, and 30 patients&#xD;
      with active RA refractory to MTX will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following 2&#xD;
      parallel treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. FMT from healthy donor plus methotrexate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. autologous FMT(from the participant himself/herself) plus methotrexate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escape:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On week 16, all participants with inadequate response, defined as a &lt;20% improvement of&#xD;
      swollen and tender joint counts from baseline can switch type and dose of DMARDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ACR20 response rates at 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary endpoint： 1）ACR50 and ACR70 response at 16, 24 weeks，ACR20 response at 24&#xD;
           weeks. 2）DAS 28 (CRP) and DAS 28 (ESR) at 16 and 24 weeks. 3) EULAR response rates at 16&#xD;
           and 24 weeks. 4) Health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) at 16 and 24 weeks. 5) Patient&#xD;
           assessment of arthritis pain at 16 and 24 weeks. 6) Patient and physician global&#xD;
           assessment of arthritis at 16 and 24 weeks&#xD;

    <description>FMT One FMT is performed at baseline by gastroscopic guidance. The same FMT is repeated 4 weeks later. The transplant consists of 50 g mixed feces obtained from 3-5 non-related healthy donors. The donor feces is suspended into NaCl (0.9%) and glycerol (10%), and will be stored at minus 80 degrees celsius until use. The total volume of the suspension is 150 mL and its temperature will be 37 degrees celsius when infused into ileus of the recipient.&#xD;
