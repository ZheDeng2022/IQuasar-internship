  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to study the benefits of a probiotic product, STP4 for vaginal health&#xD;
      properties, primarily prevention of vaginal candidiasis, among pregnant women in second and&#xD;
      third trimester pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Probiotic are live microorganisms that grant health effects to the host if consumed in&#xD;
      sufficient amounts. Probiotic bacteria, which beneficially affect the host by improving the&#xD;
      intestinal microbial balance, may affect the immune response, thus boosting the body system&#xD;
      to combat against diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal candidiasis can occur randomly in pregnant women. Vaginitis has been considered as&#xD;
      one of the most common gynaecological condition affecting women worldwide. The prevalence of&#xD;
      vaginitis was reported to be varied from 5% to 50% among different study populations across&#xD;
      major continents such as the United States of America, Europe and South Asia. Vaginal&#xD;
      candidiasis is one of the most common gynecological problems seen in primary care with&#xD;
      Candida albicans account for 90% of the infection. The over-growth of this fungus in the&#xD;
      vagina leads to a burning sensation in the vagina vulva, the production of heavy white/yellow&#xD;
      curd-like discharge and/or an itchy vulva, pruritus, dyspareunia, dysuria, irritation,&#xD;
      soreness of the vulva and other discomforting symptoms that will ensure frequent hospital&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the past several decades, the many published surveys of vaginal flora specimens&#xD;
      obtained from asymptomatic women have clearly shown that C. albicans may be present without&#xD;
      the typical symptoms of yeast vaginitis. Moreover, the majority of women who have vaginal&#xD;
      yeast also carry the organism in the gut. The typical rate of yeast carriage varies among&#xD;
      populations and increases both after puberty and during pregnancy, which suggests an&#xD;
      important role for pregnancy in cases of vaginal candidiasis. Probiotics are preferred&#xD;
      compared to antibacterial drugs, such as clindamycin and metronidazole used for bacterial&#xD;
      vaginosis treatment due to infection recurrence and drug resistance. It is a main concern&#xD;
      that overuse of antibiotics could result in the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is vital to find other alternatives to treat vaginal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STP4 is manufactured under a HACCP and ISO 22000 certified manufacturing plant. The HACCP&#xD;
      Codex Alimentarius is applied for the production of powdered Probiotics and Lactic Acid&#xD;
      Bacteria used as food ingredients and the production of probiotics fermented solution used as&#xD;
      food ingredients. The manufacturing plant also has been certified by Taiwan Quality Food&#xD;
      (TQF) Scheme which they have met the requirement by Food Industry Research and Development&#xD;
      Institute with the scope of processing of Ambient stable products. STP4 does not contain any&#xD;
      porcine or bovine ingredients and has obtained the HALAL certification from Taiwan Halal&#xD;
      Integrity Development Association (THIDA), Taiwan, which is recognized by JAKIM, Malaysia.&#xD;
      STP4 capsules several strains of lactobacilli. The strains are Lactobacillus plantarum LP115,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus helveticus LA25, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LRH10, Lactobacillus paracasei LPC12,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus fermentum LF26, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis LDL114. One capsule&#xD;
      contains not less than 9.5 CFU of lactobacilli. The other ingredients are maltodextrin added&#xD;
      with the ingredients and capsule shell made of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 80 pregnant women (second and third trimester pregnancy) will be recruited&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
