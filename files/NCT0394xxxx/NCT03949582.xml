  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diet is the cornerstone treatment to manage blood sugar in people with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
      Fibres like guar gum and protein are macronutrients that have an effect in blood sugar&#xD;
      levels. Mycoprotein is a fungi-based food high in both dietary fibre and protein shown to&#xD;
      have a role in regulating blood sugar levels in healthy. However, little is known about the&#xD;
      effects of mycoprotein on blood sugar levels in people with T2D. We are interested in South&#xD;
      Asian because they have a different blood sugar response to the same food than a Caucasian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of the study is to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of mycoprotein in different formats (soup or mince) in blood sugar levels and&#xD;
           appetite in South Asian and Caucasian with Type 2 Diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of the combination of mycoprotein with guar gum in different formats (soup or&#xD;
           mince) in blood sugar levels and appetite in South Asian and Caucasian with T2D.&#xD;

      This is a double-blind crossover RCT. A total of 48 participants (24 Caucasian and 24 South&#xD;
      Asian) with T2D and non insulin treated will be recruited. Participant will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to one of these two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Test food in form of soup and Group 2: Test food in form of mince. Once allocated in&#xD;
      one of the groups, participant will consume in a random order 6 different test foods (soy,&#xD;
      chicken, mycoprotein with and without guar gum) in a determined format (either as in soup or&#xD;
      mince).&#xD;

Questions assessed are:&#xD;

&quot;how strong is your desire to eat?&quot;&#xD;
&quot;how much food do you think you could eat?&quot;&#xD;
&quot;how full do you feel?&quot;&#xD;
&quot;what is your level of satiety?&quot;&#xD;
For questions 1 to 4 the desirable outcome considered as &quot;good result&quot; for the test food mycoprotein are values less than 30 milimetres, and for questions 5 and 6, values above 60 milimetres.</description>
