      Introduction: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow&#xD;
      obstruction, which is clinically manifested by dyspnea and leads the patient to a vicious&#xD;
      cycle of sedentary lifestyle. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an important therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy to break this cycle. Cardiovascular diseases are frequent in patients with (COPD)&#xD;
      and are associated with higher mortality. The effects of (PR) on cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
      in patients with (COPD) have been little studied so far. Objectives: To evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of pulmonary rehabilitation compared to the control group on cardiovascular risk factors in&#xD;
      patients with (COPD). Methods: A randomized clinical trial will be conducted. Patients with&#xD;
      (COPD) will be divided into two groups: Group I (GI): group that will be rehabilitated, with&#xD;
      3 weekly sessions, for 8 weeks and Group II (GII): control group, without intervention. In&#xD;
      both groups, a baseline evaluation will be performed, which will be repeated after 9 weeks&#xD;
      and consists of: clinical and laboratory parameters, endothelial function (FMD) and brachial&#xD;
      ankle index (ABI). Outcomes commonly used in the assistance to assess (PR) will also be&#xD;
      measured. Expected Results: The study is expected to improve understanding of the impact of&#xD;
      (PR) on cardiovascular variables in patients with (COPD).&#xD;

      Measures and instruments Before the rehabilitation program, a baseline evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed, which will include: anthropometric evaluation, Framingham cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      score calculation, (mMRC) scale completion, and International Physical Activity Questionnaire&#xD;
      (IPAQ). Baseline lung function data will be obtained from patients' medical records. The&#xD;
      severity of (COPD) will be determined by spirometric classification of the Gold consensus,&#xD;
      Body-mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise (BODE) and Gold (ABCD) scale. To&#xD;
      evaluate exercise capacity, a 6-minute (s) walk test (6MWT), an incremental cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise test (ECT) on a cycle ergometer, and a cardiopulmonary exercise test with a constant&#xD;
      load on a cycle ergometer will be performed. All patients will undergo evaluation of&#xD;
      endothelial function and (ABI) (brachial ankle index). Laboratory tests, exercise tests,&#xD;
      evaluation of endothelial function and (ABI) will be performed before and after the pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation program. Two visits will be necessary to carry out the tests: on the first&#xD;
      visit blood will be collected for laboratory tests, the questionnaires will be answered,&#xD;
      anthropometric data collected and the incremental (ECP) will be performed; at the second&#xD;
      visit, the (ABI) and endothelial function will be measured and the constant load (TECP) will&#xD;
      be performed. There will be a minimum of 48 hours between visits. The incremental (ECP) will&#xD;
      be performed only at baseline. In the anthropometric evaluation will be determined the weight&#xD;
      and the height, being calculated the body mass index through the formula; weight (kg) /&#xD;
      height2 (m). Laboratory Tests Total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides, C-reactive&#xD;
      protein, fasting glycemia, Glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), Glutamic-pyruvic&#xD;
      transaminase (GPT), urea and creatinine and protein C will be collected baseline and after&#xD;
      intervention. Pulmonary function Results of spirometry, pulmonary diffusion by carbon&#xD;
      monoxide (DLco) and lung volumes (plethysmography) will be recorded, which are performed in&#xD;
      the care routine and will be obtained from the patients' records. Exercise tests The (6MWT)&#xD;
      will be performed in a 30 meter corridor, with continuous monitoring of peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2) and heart rate. Before and after the test the respiratory rate and the&#xD;
      intensity of the dyspnea will be determined. The distance covered in 6 minutes will be&#xD;
      recorded. The test will be performed in accordance with the guidelines and predicted values&#xD;
      previously described. The maximum incremental (TECP) limited by symptoms will be performed on&#xD;
      an electromagnetic bicycle using a ramp protocol. After 2 minutes of standing monitoring, the&#xD;
      patient will pedal for 2 minutes without load. The load ramp will be individualized so that&#xD;
      the incremental test lasts between 8 and 12 minutes. The incremental (TECP) will be performed&#xD;
      according to the recommendations of the. The constant load test will be performed with 75% of&#xD;
      the maximum load reached in the incremental (TECP). During the tests performed on the&#xD;
      exercise bicycle, the electrocardiographic tracing and (SpO2) will be continuously monitored.&#xD;
      Significant desaturation will be considered when (SpO2) falls ≥ 3%. Endothelial function will&#xD;
      be non-invasively assessed by flow-mediated dilatation in the brachial artery using a&#xD;
      high-resolution ultrasound imaging device (SONOSITE®, M-Turbo, Sony). Brachial ankle index,&#xD;
      the assessment of the systolic arterial pressure of the brachial arteries and posterior&#xD;
      tibial arteries will be performed bilaterally using a portable vascular Doppler, with a&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer positioned 3 cm above the cubital fossa in the upper limbs and 3 cm above&#xD;
      the medial malleolus in the lower limbs. The randomization will be performed through an&#xD;
      online software at www.random.org, then will be stored in a stealth location. A blinded&#xD;
      investigator will generate a numerical sequence of the randomized patients who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. The study was not done with the total number of patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      (COPD). Those divided into two groups: intervention and control.&#xD;
