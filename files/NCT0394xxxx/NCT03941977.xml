      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the technique of percutaneous grafting with bone substitute in the knee as&#xD;
           to its applicability and technical feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the results regarding functional improvement and prevention of the evolution of&#xD;
           joint cartilage degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods Twenty patients from the Knee Group clinic who meet the criteria will be&#xD;
      selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging will be analyzed on the PACS server. Through the resonance will be&#xD;
      performed evaluation of the size of the bone edema in volume and its proportion in relation&#xD;
      to the size of the affected condyle or tibial plateau and the cartilage of the femoro-tibial&#xD;
      joint. The lesions will then be mapped in the coronal and sagittal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs will be taken in antero-posterior, profile, Rosenberg knee and lower limb views.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the patients will be performed by the visual analog pain scale and by the KOOS,&#xD;
      IKDC and SF-36v1 indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Surgical Technique After the mapping the patient will be submitted to the&#xD;
      procedure. The procedure consists in the application of a bone substitute based on injectable&#xD;
      calcium phosphate in the area of bone edema previously mapped with the aid of radioscopy to&#xD;
      guide. After confirming the proper positioning of the guidewire, a trephine is introduced&#xD;
      through which the product will be injected. GRAFTYS HBS® (Graftys, Aix en Provence, France)&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures will be performed in a surgical center, with conventional antisepsis and&#xD;
      asepsis techniques and under spinal anesthesia. The patient will be hospitalized and must be&#xD;
      discharged on the first postoperative day. After the procedure the patients will be under&#xD;
      partial load as tolerated for two weeks with free range of motion and will start&#xD;
      physiotherapy after 2 weeks of the procedure. During hospitalization the patient will receive&#xD;
      analgesia with intravenous Dipirone 1g every 6 hours associated with Tramadol 100mg&#xD;
      intravenously every 8 hours if severe pain. After discharge the patient will receive&#xD;
      analgesia with dipyrone 1g orally every 6 hours associated with Tramadol 100mg orally every 8&#xD;
      hours if severe pain, and Tramadol used by the patient was quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be re-evaluated at 1, 3, 12, 24 and 48 weeks with the same previous&#xD;
      criteria and at 12 months new MRI with the same previous protocol will be performed.&#xD;

      Initial assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients included in the study were submitted to the initial evaluation, in which the&#xD;
      following exams and scales were performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance of the affected knee, according to IOTHCFMUSP standard radiology&#xD;
           protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Panoramic radiography of lower limbs to measure limb alignment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-ray in antero-posterior incidence with load and knee profile;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional ranges of subjective IKDC, KOOS and SF-36v1;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analog visual pain scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiographs were evaluated and classified by a specialist radiologist in musculoskeletal,&#xD;
      according to the Kellgren-Lawrence classification. The radiographs were not identified as to&#xD;
      the moment of accomplishment, before or after the procedure. However, in many cases it was&#xD;
      possible to identify signs of the procedure in the image, making the evaluator blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MRI images, the location of the bone edema was evaluated in relation to the affected&#xD;
      bone (femur or tibia) and affected compartment (medial or lateral). The extent of edema&#xD;
      divided into three levels according to the percentage of affected area of the coronal section&#xD;
      of the femoral condyle or tibial plateau was also evaluated, with grade 1 being less than&#xD;
      25%, grade 2 between 25% and 50%, and grade 3 greater than 75 %. In the subchondral bone was&#xD;
      also recorded the presence of fracture line, cysts and impactions / collapses of the&#xD;
      articular surface. In the presence of impaction this was measured in millimeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and functional evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were evaluated by the functional scales: KOOS and subjective IKDC. Quality of&#xD;
      life was also assessed by the SF-36v1 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were followed in outpatient clinics at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 weeks after the&#xD;
      surgical procedure. Functional scales were repeated in all consultations. The quality of life&#xD;
      scale was repeated at 24 and 48 weeks. Radiographs and MRI were repeated after 48 weeks of&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of surgical technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging of the patients was mapped in the surgical center to define the&#xD;
      area of the lesion, as well as planning of the injection site at the center of the lesion,&#xD;
      trajectory and cannula entry point. The cannula trajectory was defined by prioritizing an&#xD;
      appropriate angle of attack for the entry point and larger distances of intraosseous&#xD;
      trajectory, in order to avoid extravasation of the bone substitute through the cannula inlet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures were performed under spinal anesthesia, in a surgical center. The patients&#xD;
      were placed in dorsal decubitus on a radiolucent table, with a cushion below the ipsilateral&#xD;
      hip, for better control of the external rotation of the limb and a cushion also under the&#xD;
      ipsilateral knee, aiding in the lateral incidence of fluoroscopy, avoiding the overlap of the&#xD;
      knee image contralateral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The material for the procedure was:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An 8G metal cannula with distal and lateral exit orifice at the tip&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metal cannula of the cannula with introductory tip with cut&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metal cannula embolus with blunt tip&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High Flow Disposable Three-Way Infusion Faucet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Five 1mL syringes with thread at the tip&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One syringe to prepare the Graftys HBS® bone substitute&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to preoperative planning, with the help of fluoroscopy in front and profile&#xD;
      incidences, the cannula entry point was demarcated, with the placement of the cannula on the&#xD;
      skin. Incisions of 5 mm in length were performed with a n11 scalpel blade at the point of&#xD;
      entry into the skin. The cannulae were introduced, with fluoroscopy control, towards the&#xD;
      center of the previously determined lesion. The progression was done manually or with the aid&#xD;
      of hammer, when greater resistance was found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the introduction of the cannula, oblique incidences of fluoroscopy were performed to&#xD;
      avoid perforation of the opposing cortex. The introduction of the cannula was performed very&#xD;
      carefully when approaching the opposite cortical, with the possibility of using the blunt tip&#xD;
      for cannula, making it difficult to perforation of the cortical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bone substitute was then prepared by mixing the solid content with the liquid to liquid /&#xD;
      pasty state and transferred to 1 ml syringes. Transfer to smaller diameter syringes is&#xD;
      important to achieve an injection flow with lower pressure application. The bone substitutes&#xD;
      when subjected to higher pressures pass into a separation phase in which the liquid separates&#xD;
      from the solid part, making it impossible to deliver the material in the desired area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1 ml syringes were connected to the cannulae already positioned at the site determined&#xD;
      for filling. The bone substitute was injected, interleaving the passage of a metal plunger&#xD;
      through the cannula, between each syringe. Through the fluoroscopy it was possible to&#xD;
      visualize the distribution of the product in the bone marrow, ensuring that the application&#xD;
      was according to the mapping of the lesion and controlling the presence of possible&#xD;
      extravasations. The amount of product injected was defined by the control of filling the area&#xD;
      of the lesion by fluoroscopy. In cases of intra-articular extravasation, the injection was&#xD;
      interrupted. After the injection was completed, it was waited 5 minutes before removal of the&#xD;
      cannula, to reduce the reflux of the material through the inlet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative care&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were hospitalized until the day after the procedure. Full load was allowed as&#xD;
      tolerated for two weeks, with free range of motion. During hospitalization, patients received&#xD;
      analgesia with intravenous dipyrone 1g every 6 hours, associated with intravenous tramadol&#xD;
      100mg every 8 hours if they presented severe pain greater than 7. After discharge, patients&#xD;
      received analgesia with dipyrone 1g orally 6 in 6 hours, associated with tramadol 100mg&#xD;
      orally every 8 hours, if severe pain, for a week, and the tramadol used by the patient in&#xD;
      this period was quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical incision stitches were removed at the first outpatient appointment 1 week after&#xD;
      surgery. The patients did not undergo physiotherapy or any type of rehabilitation after the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
