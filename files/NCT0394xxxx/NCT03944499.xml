  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study comprises two phases: Phase 1a and Phase 1b. The purpose of the study is to observe&#xD;
      the safetyï¼Œ tolerability and efficacy of FS-1502.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as an open label, single arm, Phase 1a/1b study with a dose-escalation&#xD;
      phase to evaluate FS-1502 in patients with HER2 expressed advanced malignant solid tumors&#xD;
      (phase 1a) and an expanded cohort (phase 1b) to evaluate FS-1502 in patients with metastatic,&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer. The primary aim of the phase 1a portion of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the safety and tolerability of FS-1502. The primary aim of the phase 1b portion is&#xD;
      to demonstrate efficacy.&#xD;

    <description>Dose-Escalation Phase (Phase 1a)ï¼š FS-1502 dose-escalation will be proceeded on standard 3+3 design with starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg, IV, once per 28 days, 28 days as a cycle in the V1.2 and V2.0 regimens; IV, once per 21 days, 21 days as a cycle in the V3.0 regimens..&#xD;
Dose level 1: 0.1 mg/kg; Dose level 2: 0.2 mg/kg; Dose level 3: 0.4 mg/kg; Dose level 4: 0.6 mg/kg; Dose level 5: 0.8 mg/kg; Dose level 6: 1.0 mg/kg; Dose level 7: 1.3 mg/kg. If 1.3mg/kg is still tolerated safely and in line with linear kinetic characteristics, and combined with the results of PK, PD, safety and effectiveness, a comprehensive assessment is made to determine whether to continue the dose escalating. The subsequent dose increase ratio is 33% (the dose increase ratio can be adjusted according to the previous data results) until MTD or RP2D.&#xD;
