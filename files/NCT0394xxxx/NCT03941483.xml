  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of postsurgery treatment with ASP1128&#xD;
      in subjects at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) following CABG and/or valve surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also investigate the safety and tolerability of postsurgery treatment with&#xD;
      ASP1128, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of ASP1128 in subjects at risk for AKI following&#xD;
      CABG and/or valve surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will comprise a screening visit, followed by CABG and/or valve surgery on Day 1,&#xD;
      double-blind treatment period and a follow-up period up to Day 90 in subjects with&#xD;
      moderate/severe risk of AKI (acute kidney injury) at 2-22 hours post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with low risk of AKI at 2-22 hours post-surgery assessment will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      observational cohort to evaluate subject characteristics and biomarkers for exploratory&#xD;
      objectives.&#xD;
