      This study attempts to reduce social inequality in cardiovascular health by performing an&#xD;
      interventional screening trial on how best to decrease cardiovascular disease (CVD) among&#xD;
      people with low social status&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although CVDs have decreased, they are still among the most predominant cause of morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in the western world, incl. Denmark, where about 420,000 people have recognized&#xD;
      CVD symptoms. Due to an aging population, the decline has not reduced CVD admissions and&#xD;
      healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark, the CVD related hospital admission costs are DKK 4.6 billion and the&#xD;
      pharmaceutical cost DKK 2.4 billion. The Danish National Board of Health has reported that&#xD;
      CVD carries the second largest socioeconomic difference in burden of disease. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      population-based health checks and screening for risk factors has proven not efficient.&#xD;
      Consequently, screening of asymptomatic CVD is discussed intensively. In the investigators&#xD;
      first unique CVD screening RCT (2008-11), the VIVA trial, they randomized more than 50.000&#xD;
      65-74 year old men for population-based ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm&#xD;
      (AAA), peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and hypertension. In case of positive finding,&#xD;
      preventive medical actions were initiated. A significant reduction in overall mortality by 7%&#xD;
      after 5 years was observed (paper submitted). Using a non-contrast CT scan, instead of the&#xD;
      ultrasound based screening approach, has the opportunity to identify aneurysms in the entire&#xD;
      aortic, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and arterial fibrillation, so individualized risk&#xD;
      assessment and initiation of preventive actions on those with sign of early asymptomatic CVD&#xD;
      is possible. The investigators therefore initiated a second trial (DANCAVAS) in 2014&#xD;
      randomizing 45.000 65-74 year old men with the potential of a huge beneficial effect on&#xD;
      health, quality of life (QoL) and survival. However, screening is impaired by lower social&#xD;
      class, and adherence to initiated prevention could be impacted as well. Consequently, they&#xD;
      want to conduct a third RCT (FISICH) to test a number of add-ons to screening that&#xD;
      potentially balance the benefits across socio economic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perspective is to establish a clear decision foundation for public health care policy&#xD;
      incl. benefits, cost effectiveness and impact on social inequality of alternative variants of&#xD;
      population screening for CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses The primary hypothesis is that an extensive circulatory screening and intervention&#xD;
      programme reduces social inequality in cardiovascular health and fulfills the WHO criteria&#xD;
      for screening. However, this reduction can be even more pronounced, if factors reducing the&#xD;
      social selection to attend screening and adherence to preventive actions initiated are&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test whether prebooking and/or supplemental informative pictures of the screening&#xD;
           session and consultation improves attendance rate in general, and particular among those&#xD;
           with the lowest educational level, lowest income level, and psychiatric disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate whether confrontation of imaging of own arterial lesions at consultation&#xD;
           after screening and/or an e-mail 3 and 12 months after the consultation in case of&#xD;
           positive findings improves adherence to suggested cardiovascular preventive actions, and&#xD;
           whether it influences quality of life, in general and especially concerning those with&#xD;
           the lowest educational level, lowest income level, and psychiatric disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      In FISICH-I 20.000 60-64 year old men are randomized to the control group, while another&#xD;
      5.000 are randomized to the screening and intervention program for CAC, aortic and iliac&#xD;
      aneurysms, atrial fibrillation, PAD, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia. There&#xD;
      is no exclusion criteria. The screening setup is similar to DANCAVAS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A small questionnaire on life style, medical history, and the QoL a.o. will be enclosed&#xD;
           with the invitation. Non-responders are re-invited once.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The participant will be informed at attendance to the screening visit, and their consent&#xD;
           will be obtained together with the questionnaire, weight, height, and waist&#xD;
           circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The CT scan will cover the area from the mandibular bone distally to the proximal third&#xD;
           of the femur. Calcium scores for the common carotids, coronary arteries, aorta, and&#xD;
           common iliac, and femoral arteries will be calculated. The aorta are visualized, and the&#xD;
           diameter is measured in ascending, arcus, descending and abdominal, and if possible in&#xD;
           the iliac arteries. Further the heart rhythm during the CT scan is evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Bilateral blood pressure will be recorded three times after 5 minutes of supine rest,&#xD;
           and concurrently the ankle blood pressure are measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The HbA1c and lipid parameters will be measured. Biobank blood samples are then taken,&#xD;
           centrifuged, labelled, cooled, and stored at -80 degrees Celsius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visit after screening If the CAC is above the median or if an aneurism of&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease are detected the participant is informed of the finding and its&#xD;
      implications at a follow-up visit. At this visit, the patient will be recommended suitable&#xD;
      prophylactic measures, including smoking cessation, walking/exercise, a lowfat diet.&#xD;
      Additionally to start treatment with aspirin 75 mg/day and atorvastatin 40 mg/day. If an&#xD;
      aneurism is large the patient is referred vascular surgical assessment for the repair.&#xD;
      Otherwise, an annual check-up of the aneurism including a CT scan will be offered. If no&#xD;
      positive findings (CAC above the median, aneurysm or PAD) are detected, the participants will&#xD;
      be informed of the findings by e-mail or ordinary post as preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent of the above findings, the patients will be encouraged to see their GP for&#xD;
      further assessment if potential undiagnosed hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg),&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (HbA1c &gt;48 mmol/mol), or significant isolated hypercholesterolemia&#xD;
      (total-cholesterol &gt;8.0 mmol/l) are observed, as possible continuous medical treatments will&#xD;
      be better managed by the GPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GPs will be informed by a letter of all negative and positive results and the initiated&#xD;
      actions. Additionally in the FISICH-I trial, four further randomizations are performed. In&#xD;
      the written invitations to the screening examination two further randomizations are&#xD;
      performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prebooking versus active booking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  +/- addition of illustrations of the examinations during the screening session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations and Randomisations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be performed in SPSS by providing each individual a random number from&#xD;
      1-20. Those numbered +16 will be invited to participate in the screening program. Those&#xD;
      numbered 17 and 18 will be prebooked, while those numbered 19 and 20 will have to book&#xD;
      themselves through web-booking, email or phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those with an equal number (18 and 20) will receive supplemental informative pictures of the&#xD;
      screening session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of positive finding a new random number from 1-4 is given. Those numbered 3 and 4&#xD;
      will be confronted with imaging of their own arterial lesions, whilst others will receive&#xD;
      standard information. Those with an equal number (2 and 4) will receive a SMS, e-mail and&#xD;
      phone call 3 &amp; 12 months after the consultation. If all groups after randomisations are&#xD;
      equally sized,- 182 will only be additionally randomized to be remembered prescription&#xD;
      renewal after 3 and 12 months, and 182 will only have been randomized to the standard of&#xD;
      booking (Control group for all invited). If 12 months compliance to initiated preventive&#xD;
      medication is 66%, then with 0.05 significance level, and 80% power, the smallest difference&#xD;
      detectable is 15%, which seems clinical relevant. However, merged analyses adjusting for the&#xD;
      other interventions will be performed reducing the smallest detectable difference and reveal&#xD;
      potential synergistic combinations. Similar group comparisons will be performed for all&#xD;
      randomized interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline variables Age, smoking, previous or current stroke, ischemic heart disease, PAD,&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, use of statins, useof&#xD;
      antithrombotics, body mass index, systolic- and diastolic blood pressure, ankle brachial&#xD;
      index, marital status, highest educational level, personal- andin house income, psychiatric&#xD;
      morbidity defined as any diagnosis and/or use of medications for mental illness, and QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and outcome variables from national registries The CPR number assigned to Danish&#xD;
      citizens enables individual-level linkage to multiple nation-wide healthcare and&#xD;
      administrative registries which have proved valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry-based information on outpatient visits, hospitals admissions and procedures (The&#xD;
      Danish National Patient Registry), relevant prescribed drugs dispensed (The Danish National&#xD;
      Prescription Registry), socio economic status etc. (Registries at Statistics Denmark) and&#xD;
      primary care service use (National Health Insurance Service Registry) will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcomes are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Attendance to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One-year adherence to initiated lipid-lowering and/or antithrombotic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. QoL,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Baseline characteristics will be analysed using conventional summary&#xD;
      statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attendance rates adjusted for invitation layout and booking-method, as well as compliance one&#xD;
      year after initiation (def.: received a prescription 9-12 months after the consultation)&#xD;
      adjusted for image-confrontation and post-consultation phone call are compared by logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis.&#xD;
