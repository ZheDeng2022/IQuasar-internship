      Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, single blinded (Philips hair counter) study in healthy&#xD;
      women of skin types I up to and including V.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy of hair removal with the Emerald IPL-device will be investigated for&#xD;
      treatment in face of subjects with ST I - IV and for treatment in face, axilla, bikini area,&#xD;
      and legs of subjects with ST V.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-clinic, the study subjects will undergo twelve IPL-treatments bilaterally at the qualified&#xD;
      areas (face and / or axilla, bikini line, and legs) with the Emerald IPL device applied by a&#xD;
      device operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hair re-growth in each area will be evaluated separately and across all skin types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 4 bi-weekly treatments, one follow-up visit will be organized two weeks after the&#xD;
      4th treatment. After the completion of the full treatment cycle (12 treatments), subjects&#xD;
      will be followed for 1 and 3 months (short-term follow-up) and for 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
      (long-term follow up).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hair grows in cyclic phases: anagen, catagen and telogen. These phases impact on how the&#xD;
      process of light-based hair removal works. The hair grows during the anagen phase, which has&#xD;
      the longest duration in the hair growth cycle. Hair growth ends with the transition from&#xD;
      anagen into the catagen phase, a short transition phase to prepare for the resting phase, the&#xD;
      telogen, which ends with shedding of the hair and the start of the hair growth cycle. During&#xD;
      telogen phase, the hair follicle remains inactive. Each hair follicle is independent and goes&#xD;
      through the growth cycle at different times. As presented in table 5 [11], the duration of&#xD;
      the growth cycle of the upper lip, axilla and bikini line are different from that of the&#xD;
      legs. In general, the telogen and anagen phase's durations of the cycle are longest for the&#xD;
      legs (i.e., 24 and 16 weeks, respectively) and the shortest for upper lip (i.e. 6 weeks for&#xD;
      both phases). Therefore, hair response to the IPL treatment will be evaluated by body area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of permanent hair reduction will be measured following the definition of&#xD;
      permanent hair reduction according to the FDA as follows: &quot;Permanent hair reduction is&#xD;
      defined as the long-term, stable reduction in the number of hairs re-growing after a&#xD;
      treatment regime, which may include several sessions. The number of hairs re-growing must be&#xD;
      stable over time greater than the duration of the complete growth cycle of hair follicles,&#xD;
      which varies from four to twelve months according to body location. Permanent hair reduction&#xD;
      does not necessarily imply the elimination of all hairs in the treatment area.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to promote permanent hair reduction, the aim is to expose all hairs at least&#xD;
      once to an IPL flash and therefore treatment will cover the full duration of a hair growth&#xD;
      cycle). The longest relevant full hair growth cycle is on the legs (40 weeks, excluding&#xD;
      approximately 2 weeks for the catagen phase). Therefore, a treatment duration of 10 months&#xD;
      (approximately 38weeks) has been selected: a full IPL treatment cycle consists of 4 initial&#xD;
      treatments, once every 2 weeks, followed by 8 maintenance (monthly) treatments, once every 4&#xD;
      weeks. The hair growth cycle on face (upper lip) is the shortest (12 weeks, 6 weeks in&#xD;
      anagen, 6 weeks in telogen phases). The initial treatments in 2 weeks interval are expected&#xD;
      to be most beneficial for face treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, there are two cohorts for enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects with Skin Type I-IV for treatment of Face only. (N=53)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects with Skin Type V for treatment of all body areas: Face, Axilla, Bikini line and&#xD;
           leg. (N=19)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visits are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit: The volunteers are screened to identify subjects who meet all of the&#xD;
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Device settings are selected based on skin tone&#xD;
      and comfort evaluation..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 1-4 (TX1-TX4): Four treatments and the collection of safety and efficacy data are&#xD;
      scheduled to occur every 2 weeks/ 14 days; Visits 5 (Initial Treatment 2wk Follow-up): Safety&#xD;
      and efficacy data are collected 2 weeks/ 14 days after 4th treatment to demonstrate hair&#xD;
      removal performance 8 weeks after baseline.&#xD;
