  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment with pamrevlumab or placebo in combination with either gemcitabine plus&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel (G/NP) or FOLFIRINOX in the treatment of locally advanced, unresectable&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study treatment arms;&#xD;
      pamrevlumab with either G/NP or FOLFIRINOX, placebo with G/NP or FOLFIRINOX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject may receive up to six cycles of treatment (each treatment cycle is 28 days).&#xD;
      Tumor tissue will be collected during resection to determine surgical outcome and for&#xD;
      biomarker analysis. Tumor response will be evaluated by changes in CT scan, FDG-PET, CA 19-9,&#xD;
      and NCCN® guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects randomized will have a safety follow-up visit approximately 28 days after the&#xD;
      last dose of study treatment and a final safety follow-up phone call at approximately 60 days&#xD;
      after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who complete 6 cycles of treatment will be evaluated for surgical exploration for&#xD;
      possible R0 or R1 resection. Surgery will occur at least 4 weeks after the last dose&#xD;
      (allowing for a wash-out period from treatment) and only after receipt of the recommendation&#xD;
      from the central review board with regards to surgical eligibility. Surgery will occur no&#xD;
      longer than 8 weeks after the last dose. Subjects who undergo surgery will be evaluated for&#xD;
      surgical complications for at least an additional 90 days following discharge from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are ineligible for surgical exploration (i.e. subjects who did not complete 6&#xD;
      cycles of treatment or do not meet any of the protocol defined criteria or had a&#xD;
      contraindication to surgery) will continue in the Follow-up period and receive treatment as&#xD;
      per standard of care (SOC) for each institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed for disease progression (if not previously detected) or&#xD;
      recurrence following resection (local progression or metastatic disease). Subjects will also&#xD;
      be followed for any additional anti-cancer therapy received for their pancreatic cancer. All&#xD;
      subjects will be followed for survival (until death) or until the last subject to complete&#xD;
      treatment reaches 18 months post-treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 uses for the questions 1 to 28 on a 4-point scale. The scale scores from 1 to 4: 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;), 2 (&quot;A little&quot;), 3 (&quot;Quite a bit&quot;) and 4 (&quot;Very much&quot;). Half points are not allowed. The range is 3. For the raw score, less points are considered to have a better outcome.&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-C30 uses for the questions 29 and 30 on a 7-points scale. The scale scores from 1 to 7: 1 (&quot;very poor&quot;) to 7 (&quot;excellent&quot;). Half points are not allowed. The range is 6. First of all, raw score has to be calculated with mean values. Afterwards linear transformation is performed to be comparable. More points are considered to have a better outcome.</description>
