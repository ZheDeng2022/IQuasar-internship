  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of low back pain (LBP) is increasing and prognostic factors for developing LBP&#xD;
      are unclear. Based on questionnaires, different prognostic factors are being explored over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite massive efforts of trying to find predictors and prevention for LBP, it remains to be&#xD;
      clarified, why some individuals develop severely disabling low back pain while others never&#xD;
      experience noteworthy back pain. There is no evidence that numbers of chronically affected&#xD;
      individuals have diminished; rather, the incidence of LBP has increased continuously over the&#xD;
      last 20 years which is also reflected in rising numbers of lumbar surgical treatments. The&#xD;
      prevalence and burden increase with age and prevention of LBP in an aging population seems&#xD;
      more urgent than ever. As LBP is undoubtedly a multifaceted disorder that tends to fluctuate&#xD;
      throughout life, there is a need for longitudinal research, exploring the effect of both life&#xD;
      style and psychosocial factors on the development of chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify whether a history of low back pain during adolescence&#xD;
      represents an increased risk of experiencing low back pain later in life.&#xD;

    <measure>Brief illness perception questionnaire (IPQ-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>measured once at study baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Actual IPQ-B score. Generic questionnaire developed to measure illness perception. The IPQ-B contains eight items and one causal scale. Items 1-8 are rated using a 0-to-10 response scale, item 9 is a memo field. Five of the items assess cognitive illness representations: consequences (Item 1), timeline (Item 2), personal control (Item 3), treatment control (Item 4), and identity (Item 5). Two of the items assess emotional representations: concern (Item 6) and emotions (Item 8). One item assesses illness comprehensibility (Item 7).&#xD;
A low score on items number 1,2,5,6 and 8 indicates that the illness is perceived as benign while a low score on the items 3, 4 and 7 indicates that the illness is perceived as threatening. By reversing these three items it is possible to compute an overall score. A higher score reflects a more threatening view of the illness.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D (3 likert scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>measured once at study baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L essentially consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) (0-100). The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' (100) and 'Worst imaginable health state' (0). This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
