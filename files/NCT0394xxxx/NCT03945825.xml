      This is a Phase I, randomized, double blinded, clinical trial in up to 240 males and&#xD;
      non-pregnant females, 18-45 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of either the 2018/2019 seasonal Fluzone or Flublok Quadrivalent Influenza&#xD;
      Vaccine (QIV) manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur (SP) given without adjuvant or with one of two&#xD;
      adjuvant formulations, AF03 or Advax-CpG55.2. Eight Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit&#xD;
      (VTEU) sites will be included in the study. Study duration is approximately 18 months, and&#xD;
      subject participation duration is 12 months. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to&#xD;

      or Advax-CpG55.2 adjuvant; 2) to assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody&#xD;
      responses against 2018/2019 QIV strains from baseline (Day 1) to approximately Day 29 after&#xD;
      receipt of 2018/2019 Fluzone and Flublok with and without AF03 or Advax-CpG55.2 adjuvant; 3)&#xD;

      Vaccine (QIV) manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur (SP) given without adjuvant or with one of two&#xD;
      adjuvant formulations, AF03 or Advax-CpG55.2. Subjects will be stratified by prior receipt of&#xD;
      licensed, seasonal influenza vaccine (defined as receipt of at least one of the 2017/2018&#xD;
      and/or 2018/2019 influenza vaccines) and will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment arms&#xD;
      to receive a single dose of one of the two seasonal 2018/2019 QIV vaccine formulations with&#xD;
      or without one of the two adjuvants (Day 1). On approximately Day 90, each subject will&#xD;
      receive a single dose of the seasonal 2019/2020 QIV. Groups 1, 2 and 3 will receive 2019/2020&#xD;
      Fluzone QIV and Groups 4, 5 and 6 will receive 2019/2020 Flublok QIV. Eight Vaccine and&#xD;
      Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU) sites will be included in the study. Study duration is&#xD;
      approximately 18 months, and subject participation duration is 12 months. The primary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are: 1) to assess the safety and reactogenicity of 2018/2019 Fluzone&#xD;
      and Flublok with and without AF03 or Advax-CpG55.2 adjuvant; 2) to assess the serum&#xD;
      hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses against 2018/2019 QIV strains from&#xD;
      baseline (Day 1) to approximately Day 29 after receipt of 2018/2019 Fluzone and Flublok with&#xD;

      baseline (Day 1) to approximately Day 29 after receipt of 2018/2019 Fluzone and Flublok with&#xD;
      and without AF03 or Advax- CpG55.2 adjuvant. The secondary objectives of this study are: 1)&#xD;
      to assess protocol specified adverse events of special interest (AESI), medically-attended&#xD;
      adverse events (MAAEs), including new-onset chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs) and&#xD;
