  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This upstream communication study may aid in our understanding of the nature of the&#xD;
      parent-adolescent relationship and how we can use this relationship to promote better oral&#xD;
      health of the parents and adolescents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the proliferation of social media as a tool for health communication, this proposed&#xD;
      pilot study will be conducted with adolescents and their parents in the greater Richmond&#xD;
      area, including Petersburg, and examines whether disseminating oral health information to&#xD;
      adolescents via Facebook will have a greater impact on their sharing of the message to their&#xD;
      parents than providing them the information in written format- using a pamphlet. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that parents in the Facebook arm of the intervention will be more likely to&#xD;
      report receiving the oral health message from their child than those in the pamphlet arm.&#xD;
      Further, this study investigates whether parents whose adolescents re provided the&#xD;
      information via Facebook will have greater increase in intent to schedule dental appointments&#xD;
      and dental appointment scheduling behaviors than parents whose children are in the pamphlet&#xD;
      group. We hypothesize that parents in the Facebook group will report greater increase in&#xD;
      dental appointment scheduling than those whose adolescents are in the pamphlet group. Lastly,&#xD;
      we would like to explore whether parents and adolescents in the Facebook arm will have&#xD;
      greater increase in oral health knowledge and greater decreases in perceived barriers to oral&#xD;
      health activities, both which may be related to increases in parents' dental appointment&#xD;
      scheduling.&#xD;
