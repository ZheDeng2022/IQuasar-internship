      A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator, multi-centers, non-inferiority&#xD;
      design clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of YYD601 in ERD patients (phase 3).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase 3 clinical trial is designed as randomized, active-comparator, double-dummy,&#xD;
      multi-center for ERD patients, who take YYD601 40mg or Nexium 40mg for 8 weeks. Each part is&#xD;
      assessed by 'LA grade' measured through the endoscopy, target goal is to confirm the&#xD;
      non-inferiority of YYD601 40mg to Nexium 40mg.&#xD;
