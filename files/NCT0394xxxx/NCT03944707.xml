  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a proof-of-concept study to evaluate the efficacy of LOU064 in patients with&#xD;
      inadequately controlled asthma. All subjects were randomized with 3:2 ratio to receive LOU064&#xD;
      100 mg once daily or LOU064 matching placebo for 12 weeks with standard background therapy of&#xD;
      budesonide 80 µg/formoterol 4.5 µg two inhalations twice a day (b.i.d).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a non-confirmatory, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, subject- and&#xD;
      investigator-blinded, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LOU064 in&#xD;
      patients with inadequately controlled asthma who were on a standardized background therapy of&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroid plus long acting beta-2 agonist (ICS/LABA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a Screening period of up to 2 weeks to assess eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a Run-in period of minimum 3 weeks and maximum 5 weeks where patients discontinued their&#xD;
           current asthma therapy and were placed on budesonide 80 μg/formoterol 4.5 μg delivered&#xD;
           by dry powder inhaler, two inhalations twice a day (b.i.d).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a Treatment period of 12 weeks. All subjects were randomized 3:2 to receive LOU064 100&#xD;
           mg once daily or placebo for 12 weeks with standard background therapy of budesonide 80&#xD;
           μg/formoterol 4.5 μg, two inhalations b.i.d.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a Follow-up period of 3 weeks following the last dose of study drug. Results from the&#xD;
           interim analysis did not provide sufficient evidence of efficacy of LOU064 in&#xD;
           inadequately controlled asthma and the sponsor decided to terminate early the study in&#xD;
           April 2020. The median duration of exposure (12.0 weeks for LOU064 and 11.7 weeks for&#xD;
           placebo) was close to the treatment target, as most of the subjects had completed&#xD;
           treatment when the study was terminated.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pre-dose FEV1 at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation, measured through spirometry testing. Pre-dose FEV1 is defined as average of the two FEV1 measurements taken 45 min and 15 min pre-dose.&#xD;
The baseline pre-dose FEV1 is defined as the average of the FEV1 measurements performed 45 min and 15 min prior to dosing on Day 1.&#xD;
A positive change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 is considered a favorable outcome.&#xD;
Change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 was analyzed using a Bayesian model for repeated measures, adjusting for effects of treatment*visit interaction and baseline pre-dose FEV1. A weakly informative prior was considered for the placebo response.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Observed Blood Concentrations (Cmax) of LOU064 at Steady State</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after dosing on Days 15 and 85</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were calculated based on LOU064 blood concentrations determined by a validated liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method with a lower limit of quantification of 1 ng/mL. Cmax was determined using non-compartmental methods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Reach Maximum Blood Concentrations (Tmax) of LOU064 at Steady State</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after dosing on Days 15 and 85</time_frame>
    <description>PK parameters were calculated based on LOU064 blood concentrations determined by a validated LC-MS/MS method with a lower limit of quantification of 1 ng/mL. Tmax was determined using non-compartmental methods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to 24 Hours (AUC0-24h) of LOU064 at Steady State</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after dosing on Days 15 and 85</time_frame>
    <description>PK parameters were calculated based on LOU064 blood concentrations determined by a validated LC-MS/MS method with a lower limit of quantification of 1 ng/mL. AUC0-24h was determined using non-compartmental methods. The linear trapezoidal rule was used for AUC0-24h calculation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Asthma Symptom Questionnaire-5 Score (ACQ-5) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-5 is a five-item, self-completed questionnaire, which is used as a measure of asthma control of a participant. Patients were asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week and to respond to the symptom questions on a 7-point scale (0=no impairment, 6=maximum impairment). The questions are equally weighted and the overall ACQ-5 score is the mean of all 5 questions, therefore between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled).&#xD;
The baseline values of ACQ-5 were collected at the baseline visit. A negative change from baseline in ACQ-5 is considered a favorable outcome. Change from baseline in ACQ-5 score was analyzed using a Bayesian model for repeated measures, adjusting for effects of treatment*visit interaction and baseline ACQ-5 score. Non-informative priors were considered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Morning and Mean Evening Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 9-12</time_frame>
    <description>PEF (Peak Expiratory Flow) is a person's maximum speed of expiration. All participants were instructed to record PEF twice daily before taking any medication using an electronic peak expiratory flow device (ePEF), once in the morning and once approximately 12 h later in the evening at home. At each timepoint, the participant was instructed to perform 3 consecutive manoeuvres within 10 minutes. These PEF values were captured in the e-PEF/diary. For each day the best value in the morning and in the evening were considered and mean values on 4-week intervals were derived.&#xD;
The baseline values of PEF were the mean values in the run-in period. A positive change from baseline in PEF is considered a favorable outcome. Change from baseline in mean morning and mean evening PEF were analyzed using a Bayesian model for repeated measures, adjusting for effects of treatment*weeks interaction and baseline PEF values. Non-informative priors were considered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Puffs of SABA Taken Per Day During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were given a short acting β2-agonist (SABA; salbutamol, known also as albuterol) to use as rescue medication throughout the study along with an electronic diary (eDiary) to record rescue medication use. Participants recorded in the eDiary, once in the morning and once in the evening, the use of rescue medication (number of puffs of SABA taken in the previous 12 hours). The total number of puffs of SABA taken per day was calculated and the mean daily use of puffs of SABA over 12 weeks was derived.&#xD;
The baseline values of number of puffs of SABA taken per day were defined as the average from all non-missing records taken during the run-in period. A negative change from baseline is considered a favorable outcome.&#xD;
Change from baseline in number of puffs of SABA taken per day was analyzed using a Bayesian model, adjusting for effects of baseline SABA use, baseline FEV1, baseline asthma daytime symptom score and treatment. Non-informative priors were considered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daytime and Nighttime Asthma Symptom Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 9-12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded asthma symptoms twice daily in the eDiary. Daytime asthma symptoms were assessed before bed and nighttime symptoms on awakening.&#xD;
Daytime asthma symptom score included 4 questions. Overall score (0 to 6) was calculated as the average of the 4 questions with higher values indicating more asthma symptoms.&#xD;
Nighttime asthma symptom score included 2 questions. Overall score (0 to 3.5) was calculated as the average of the 2 questions with higher values indicating more asthma symptoms.&#xD;
Mean values of both scores were calculated over 4-week intervals during the treatment period.&#xD;
The baseline values of both asthma symptoms scores were defined as the average score during the run-in period. A negative change from baseline is a favorable outcome.&#xD;
Change from baseline in daytime and nighttime asthma symptom score were analyzed using a Bayesian model for repeated measures, adjusting for effects of treatment*weeks and baseline scores. Non-informative priors were considered.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in 19 investigative sites in 5 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After the screening, participants went through a Run-in period of 3-5 weeks where they discontinued their current asthma therapy and were placed on budesonide 80 μg/formoterol 4.5 μg delivered by dry powder inhaler. Afterwards, patients were randomized in 3:2 ratio to receive LOU064 or placebo and continued to use the budesonide/formoterol inhaler.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pre-dose FEV1 at Week 12</title>
        <description>FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation, measured through spirometry testing. Pre-dose FEV1 is defined as average of the two FEV1 measurements taken 45 min and 15 min pre-dose.&#xD;
The baseline pre-dose FEV1 is defined as the average of the FEV1 measurements performed 45 min and 15 min prior to dosing on Day 1.&#xD;
A positive change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 is considered a favorable outcome.&#xD;
Change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 was analyzed using a Bayesian model for repeated measures, adjusting for effects of treatment*visit interaction and baseline pre-dose FEV1. A weakly informative prior was considered for the placebo response.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Asthma Symptom Questionnaire-5 Score (ACQ-5) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The ACQ-5 is a five-item, self-completed questionnaire, which is used as a measure of asthma control of a participant. Patients were asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week and to respond to the symptom questions on a 7-point scale (0=no impairment, 6=maximum impairment). The questions are equally weighted and the overall ACQ-5 score is the mean of all 5 questions, therefore between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled).&#xD;
The baseline values of ACQ-5 were collected at the baseline visit. A negative change from baseline in ACQ-5 is considered a favorable outcome. Change from baseline in ACQ-5 score was analyzed using a Bayesian model for repeated measures, adjusting for effects of treatment*visit interaction and baseline ACQ-5 score. Non-informative priors were considered.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Morning and Mean Evening Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)</title>
        <description>PEF (Peak Expiratory Flow) is a person's maximum speed of expiration. All participants were instructed to record PEF twice daily before taking any medication using an electronic peak expiratory flow device (ePEF), once in the morning and once approximately 12 h later in the evening at home. At each timepoint, the participant was instructed to perform 3 consecutive manoeuvres within 10 minutes. These PEF values were captured in the e-PEF/diary. For each day the best value in the morning and in the evening were considered and mean values on 4-week intervals were derived.&#xD;
The baseline values of PEF were the mean values in the run-in period. A positive change from baseline in PEF is considered a favorable outcome. Change from baseline in mean morning and mean evening PEF were analyzed using a Bayesian model for repeated measures, adjusting for effects of treatment*weeks interaction and baseline PEF values. Non-informative priors were considered.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Puffs of SABA Taken Per Day During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Participants were given a short acting β2-agonist (SABA; salbutamol, known also as albuterol) to use as rescue medication throughout the study along with an electronic diary (eDiary) to record rescue medication use. Participants recorded in the eDiary, once in the morning and once in the evening, the use of rescue medication (number of puffs of SABA taken in the previous 12 hours). The total number of puffs of SABA taken per day was calculated and the mean daily use of puffs of SABA over 12 weeks was derived.&#xD;
The baseline values of number of puffs of SABA taken per day were defined as the average from all non-missing records taken during the run-in period. A negative change from baseline is considered a favorable outcome.&#xD;
Change from baseline in number of puffs of SABA taken per day was analyzed using a Bayesian model, adjusting for effects of baseline SABA use, baseline FEV1, baseline asthma daytime symptom score and treatment. Non-informative priors were considered.</description>

        <description>Participants recorded asthma symptoms twice daily in the eDiary. Daytime asthma symptoms were assessed before bed and nighttime symptoms on awakening.&#xD;
Daytime asthma symptom score included 4 questions. Overall score (0 to 6) was calculated as the average of the 4 questions with higher values indicating more asthma symptoms.&#xD;
Nighttime asthma symptom score included 2 questions. Overall score (0 to 3.5) was calculated as the average of the 2 questions with higher values indicating more asthma symptoms.&#xD;
Mean values of both scores were calculated over 4-week intervals during the treatment period.&#xD;
The baseline values of both asthma symptoms scores were defined as the average score during the run-in period. A negative change from baseline is a favorable outcome.&#xD;
Change from baseline in daytime and nighttime asthma symptom score were analyzed using a Bayesian model for repeated measures, adjusting for effects of treatment*weeks and baseline scores. Non-informative priors were considered.</description>
