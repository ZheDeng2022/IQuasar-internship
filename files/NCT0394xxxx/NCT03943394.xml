      The term &quot;therapy-related&quot; leukemia is descriptive and is based on a patient's history of&#xD;
      exposure to cytotoxic agents. Although a causal relationship is implied, the mechanism&#xD;
      remains to be proven. These neoplasms are thought to be the direct consequence of mutational&#xD;
      events induced by the prior therapy Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes / acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (t- MDS / t-AML) is now considered a single entity, called therapy-related myeloid&#xD;
      neoplasms based on the current World Health Organization WHO classification2,. It is a&#xD;
      well-recognized clinical syndrome occurring as a late complication following Cytotoxic agents&#xD;
      and ionizing radiotherapy in the treatment of most cancer types: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL),&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), sarcoma, and ovarian and&#xD;
      testicular cancerThe incidence of t-MDS/AML following conventional therapy ranges from 0.8%&#xD;
      to 6.3% at 20 years. The median time to development of t-MDS/AML is 3 to 5 years, with the&#xD;
      risk decreasing markedly after the first decade Two types of t-MDS/AML are recognized in the&#xD;
      WHO classification depending on the causative therapeutic exposure: an alkylating&#xD;
      agent/radiation-related type and a topoisomerase II inhibitor-related type. Alkylating&#xD;
      agent-related t-MDS/AML usually appears 4 to 7 years after exposure to the mutagenic agent&#xD;
      .The reciprocal translocation t(8;9) (p22;p24) between the short arm of chromosome 8 and the&#xD;
      long arm of chromosome 9 is a recurrent abnormality that fuses the Janus activated kinase 2&#xD;
      (JAK2) to the human autoantigen pericentriolar material 1 gene (PCM1) , with breakage and&#xD;
      reunion at bands 8p11 and 9q3410Due to PCM1-JAK2 gene fusion, the coiled-coil domains of PCM1&#xD;
      mediate an oligomerization that brings together the linked JAK2 domains resulting in a&#xD;
      constitutively activated tyrosine kinase domain of JAK2The most common mechanism for JAK2&#xD;
      activation in hematologic malignancies is the point mutation at position 617 (V617F).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consequences of JAK2 activation are neoplastic transformation and abnormal cell&#xD;
      proliferation in various malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  So, translocations involving the JAK2 locus are considered of oncogenic importance in&#xD;
           acute leukemias and myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with this abnormality present with broad clinical spectrum ranging from chronic&#xD;
           to acute hematological diseases with myeloid or lymphoid appearance&#xD;

      The term &quot;therapy-related&quot; leukemia is descriptive and is based on a patient's history of&#xD;
      exposure to cytotoxic agents. Although a causal relationship is implied, the mechanism&#xD;
      remains to be proven. These neoplasms are thought to be the direct consequence of mutational&#xD;
      events induced by the prior therapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes / acute myeloid leukemia (t- MDS / t-AML) is now&#xD;
      considered a single entity, called therapy-related myeloid neoplasms based on the current&#xD;
      World Health Organization WHO classification2,. It is a well-recognized clinical syndrome&#xD;
      occurring as a late complication following Cytotoxic agents and ionizing radiotherapy in the&#xD;
      treatment of most cancer types: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), sarcoma, and ovarian and testicular cancer3,4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm and the timing of its development&#xD;
      after a primary diagnosis depend on the exposure to specific agents as well as the cumulative&#xD;
      dose and dose intensity of the preceding cytotoxic therapy 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of t-MDS/AML following conventional therapy ranges from 0.8% to 6.3% at 20&#xD;
      years. The median time to development of t-MDS/AML is 3 to 5 years, with the risk decreasing&#xD;
      markedly after the first decade 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two types of t-MDS/AML are recognized in the WHO classification depending on the causative&#xD;
      therapeutic exposure: an alkylating agent/radiation-related type and a topoisomerase II&#xD;
      inhibitor-related type. Alkylating agent-related t-MDS/AML usually appears 4 to 7 years after&#xD;
      exposure to the mutagenic agent .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately two-thirds of patients present with MDS and the remainder with AML with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic features. Patients frequently present with cytopenias. Multilineage dysplasia&#xD;
      is often present 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this classic form of therapy-related leukemia that follows treatment with alkylating&#xD;
      agents and/or radiation therapy, the blood and bone marrow findings resemble those seen in&#xD;
      primary MDS, although the degree of dysgranulopoiesis and dysmegakaryocytopoiesis is&#xD;
      typically greater 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to alkylating agent t-MDS/AML, AML secondary to topoisomerase II inhibitors often&#xD;
      does not have a preceding myelodysplastic phase, and presents as overt acute leukemia, often&#xD;
      with a prominent monocytic component. The latency period between the initiation of treatment&#xD;
      with topoisomerase II inhibitors and the onset of leukemia is brief, with a median of 2 to 3&#xD;
      years 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reciprocal translocation t(8;9) (p22;p24) between the short arm of chromosome 8 and the&#xD;
      long arm of chromosome 9 is a recurrent abnormality that fuses the Janus activated kinase 2&#xD;
      (JAK2) to the human autoantigen pericentriolar material 1 gene (PCM1) , with breakage and&#xD;
      reunion at bands 8p11 and 9q341010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCM1 encodes a large protein of 228kDa containing several potential coiled-coil domains in&#xD;
      its aminoterminal part. This protein is localized in cytoplasmatic granules referred to as&#xD;
      centriolar satellites. It is supposed to play a crucial role in the assembly of centrosomal&#xD;
      proteins, microtubule organisation, and in the progression of cell cycle11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to PCM1-JAK2 gene fusion, the coiled-coil domains of PCM1 mediate an oligomerization that&#xD;
      brings together the linked JAK2 domains resulting in a constitutively activated tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase domain of JAK212, 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JAK2 is a member of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2). These&#xD;
      non-receptor tyrosine kinases play a significant role in various signal transduction pathways&#xD;
      that regulate cellular survival, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The protein&#xD;
      is formed of seven domains. The JH2 domain (pseudokinase domain, kinase-like domain) is&#xD;
      located in exon 14 and has an essential negative autoregulatory function14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common mechanism for JAK2 activation in hematologic malignancies is the point&#xD;
      mutation at position 617 (V617F).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consequences of JAK2 activation are neoplastic transformation and abnormal cell&#xD;
      proliferation in various malignancies15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  So, translocations involving the JAK2 locus are considered of oncogenic importance in&#xD;
           acute leukemias and myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with this abnormality present with broad clinical spectrum ranging from chronic&#xD;
           to acute hematological diseases with myeloid or lymphoid appearance 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a kind of cytogenetic technique that allows the&#xD;
      visualization of defined nucleic acid sequences in particular cellular or chromosomal sites&#xD;
      by hybridization of complementary fluorescently labeled probe sequences within intact&#xD;
      metaphase or interphase cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fluorescent probes are nucleic acid labeled with fluorescent groups and can bind to&#xD;
      specific DNA/RNA sequences. Fluorescence microscopy can be used to find out where the&#xD;
      fluorescent probe is bound to the chromosomes17.&#xD;
