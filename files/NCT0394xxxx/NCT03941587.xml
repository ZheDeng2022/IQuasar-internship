  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an individualized dosing&#xD;
      schedule comprising Aflibercept and RF-PDT in patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy&#xD;
      (PCV). The objective is to compare the visual improvement from baseline to month 12, in eyes&#xD;
      with PCV treated with Aflibercept monotherapy versus combination of Aflibercept with reduced&#xD;
      fluence photodynamic therapy (RF-PDT)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide.&#xD;
      In its exudative or wet form, choroidal neovascularization (CNV) causes an exudative&#xD;
      maculopathy resulting in sudden loss of vision with severe effects on patients' quality of&#xD;
      life. Intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents (anti-VEGF)&#xD;
      have become the mainstay of treatment for AMD CNV and has been shown to have favorable&#xD;
      outcomes in most AMD CNV subtypes. In the Asian population, however, a particular subtype&#xD;
      called polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), which affects about 50% of exudative&#xD;
      maculopathy, has been shown to have less favorable response to anti-VEGF therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best treatment option for PCV has remained unclear. Current best evidence is from 2&#xD;
      recent randomized controlled trials, the EVEREST II trial which compares the efficacy of&#xD;
      ranibizumab with or without photodynamic therapy (PDT) for treatment of PCV and the PLANET&#xD;
      trial which compares Aflibercept monotherapy against a rescue PDT when Aflibercept is deemed&#xD;
      ineffective. Both trials have reported significant improvement in visual outcomes, however&#xD;
      there remain significant unanswered questions and unmet needs regarding the use of&#xD;
      Aflibercept and PDT as the best treatment for PCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aim to compare the efficacy of combination Aflibercept with RF-PDT (at&#xD;
      baseline) and Aflibercept monotherapy. This particular strategy has not been studies before&#xD;
      and represents the amalgamation of unanswered questions from the best evidence to date for&#xD;
      the treatment of PCV.&#xD;
