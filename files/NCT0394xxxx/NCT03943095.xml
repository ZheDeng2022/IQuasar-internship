  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory study will characterize the efficacy profile of an experimental dual active&#xD;
      5 percent (%) potassium nitrate/0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice, compared to a single&#xD;
      active 0.454% stannous fluoride desensitizing dentifrice, over an 8-week treatment period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, 8-week, randomized, controlled, examiner-blind, two treatment&#xD;
      arm, parallel design, stratified (by maximum Baseline Schiff sensitivity score of the two&#xD;
      selected test teeth), Phase II, exploratory clinical study in healthy participants with DH.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the combination of two antisensitivity active ingredients with&#xD;
      complementary modes of action (potassium nitrate: nerve desensitization; stannous fluoride:&#xD;
      dentin tubule occlusion) will deliver superior anti-sensitivity efficacy, compared to either&#xD;
      active alone.&#xD;

    <description>Evaporative air sensitivity was assessed on facial surfaces of eligible incisor,canine and pre-molar teeth by directing a one second application of air from standard dental syringe held perpendicular to tooth surface, approximately 1-2 millimeter (mm) coronal to the gingival margin from a distance of approximately 1 centimeter (cm).Participant response to the stimulus was evaluated using the Schiff sensitivity scale, an examiner-based index scored immediately following administration of the evaporative air stimulus.0=Does not respond to air stimulation;1=Responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus;2=Responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus;3=Responds to stimulus,considers stimulus to be painful, requests discontinuation of the stimulus.

        <title>Mean Schiff Sensitivity Score (Average of the Two Selected Test Teeth) at Baseline (Day 0)</title>
        <description>Evaporative air sensitivity was assessed on facial surfaces of eligible incisor,canine and pre-molar teeth by directing a one second application of air from standard dental syringe held perpendicular to tooth surface, approximately 1-2 millimeter (mm) coronal to the gingival margin from a distance of approximately 1 centimeter (cm).Participant response to the stimulus was evaluated using the Schiff sensitivity scale, an examiner-based index scored immediately following administration of the evaporative air stimulus.0=Does not respond to air stimulation;1=Responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus;2=Responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus;3=Responds to stimulus,considers stimulus to be painful, requests discontinuation of the stimulus. Score range 0-3; a decrease in Schiff sensitivity score indicates an improvement.Mean was calculated once by selecting two test teeth which were located in different quadrants of mouth.</description>

        <title>Mean Schiff Sensitivity Score (Average of the Two Selected Test Teeth) at Day 56</title>
        <description>Evaporative air sensitivity was assessed on facial surfaces of eligible incisor,canine and pre-molar teeth by directing a one second application of air from a standard dental syringe held perpendicular to the tooth surface, approximately 1-2 mm coronal to the gingival margin, and from a distance of approximately 1 cm. Participant response to the stimulus was evaluated using the Schiff sensitivity scale, an examiner-based index scored immediately following administration of the evaporative air stimulus. 0=Does not respond to air stimulation;1=Responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus;2=Responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus;3=Responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. Score range 0-3; a decrease in Schiff sensitivity score indicates an improvement. Mean was calculated once by selecting two test teeth which were located in different quadrants of mouth.</description>

        <title>Mean Tactile Threshold (Average of the Two Selected Test Teeth) at Day 28</title>
        <description>Tactile sensitivity was assessed for eligible incisor, canine and pre-molar teeth using a constant pressure probe (Yeaple probe),starting at 10 g and rising in increments of 10 g until the tactile threshold or maximum force for that visit is reached. The probe tip was placed perpendicular to the facial surface of tooth and drawn slowly across the exposed dentine.After each application, the participant was asked to indicate whether they experienced any pain or discomfort (yes/no response). The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold (g). At Baseline,the maximum force is 20 g; at all subsequent visits, 80 g. If no sensitivity was found at the upper limit,the tactile threshold is recorded as greater than (&gt;) 20 g (baseline) or &gt;80 g (all other visits). An increase in tactile threshold indicates an improvement.Mean was calculated once by selecting two test teeth which were located in different quadrants of mouth.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score at Day 56</title>
        <description>Evaporative air sensitivity was assessed on the facial surfaces of teeth by directing one second application of air from dental syringe held perpendicular to tooth surface, approximately 1-2 mm coronal to gingival margin and from a distance of approximately 1 cm. Participant response to stimulus was evaluated using Schiff sensitivity scale following administration of the evaporative air stimulus.0=Does not respond to air stimulation;1=Responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus;2=Responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus;3=Responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, requests discontinuation of stimulus. Score range 0-3;a decrease in Schiff sensitivity score indicates improvement. Adjusted mean change from baseline are derived from analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model which included treatment as a factor and baseline Schiff sensitivity score as a covariate with change from baseline as dependent variable.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Day 0) in Tactile Threshold on Day 56</title>
        <description>Tactile sensitivity was assessed for eligible teeth using constant pressure probe (Yeaple probe),starting at 10 g and rising in increments of 10 g until tactile threshold for that visit is reached. The probe tip was placed perpendicular to facial surface of tooth and drawn slowly across exposed dentine. After each application, participant was asked whether they experienced any pain or discomfort (yes/no response).The pressure setting at which participant gives two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold (g).At Baseline, the maximum force was 20g;at all subsequent visits,80g.If no sensitivity was found at the upper limit, the tactile threshold was recorded as &gt;20 g (Baseline) or &gt;80 g (all other visits).An increase in tactile threshold indicates an improvement. Adjusted mean change from baseline are derived from ANCOVA model which included treatment as factor and baseline tactile senstivity as covariate with change from baseline as dependent variable.</description>
