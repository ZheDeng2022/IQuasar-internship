  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are evaluating whether 15-26 year old males and females need a 3rd dose of the human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, or whether 2 doses provide similar protection as 3 doses from&#xD;
      the 9 types of HPV that it protects against.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying an amended dosing regimen of an approved drug (Gardasil 9) in&#xD;
      the population for which it is approved (vaccine is approved for ages 9-45 years and&#xD;
      participants in this study will be 15-26 years of age.) The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      examine a delayed dosing schedule. The current recommendation is to administer the vaccine in&#xD;
      3 doses (administered at 0, 1-2 months and 6 months) to those 15-26 years of age but only 2&#xD;
      doses (0 and 6 months) if given at 9-14 years of age. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized study to determine if 2 doses will elicit an immune response similar to the&#xD;
      standard 3 doses in those 15-26 years of age. Participants in the study group will receive 2&#xD;
      doses of Gardasil 9 at 0 and 6 months. Participants in the control group will receive 3 doses&#xD;
      of Gardasil 9 at 0, 1-2 months and 6 months. All participants (Target Accrual n=512) will&#xD;
      have 5 mLs of blood drawn at 0, 7, and 12 months. Following the 12 month blood draw,&#xD;
      participants randomized to 2-doses will receive the 3rd dose. Potential participants will be&#xD;
      recruited in the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) clinics where providers have given&#xD;
      the PI permission to directly contact patients. The investigators will also display signs and&#xD;
      use email announcements at UTMB and other college campuses and will advertise the study&#xD;
      online or by mail. The investigators will call UTMB patients if their provider gave&#xD;
      permission to contact the patient, or if the patients gave prior consent to contact through&#xD;
      the UTMB system. Potential participants (and their parents, if under 18 years of age) will be&#xD;
      screened with inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible and interested parents and patients will&#xD;
      sign informed written consent. Patients under 18 years of age will sign written assent. At&#xD;
      the initial visit, eligible, consented participants will have their blood drawn, be&#xD;
      randomized into either the study or control group, and receive a dose of the HPV vaccine.&#xD;
      Participants will be re-screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria at subsequent&#xD;
      visits. All participants will receive compensation administered through a ClinCard following&#xD;
      each of the 3 blood draws.&#xD;

             to seek prenatal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of 6 or more lifetime sexual partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of any immunodeficiencies (HIV+, chemotherapy treatment, status splenectomy)&#xD;
             or autoimmune disorders (lupus, thyroid disorder, psoriasis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of bleeding or platelet disorders such as hemophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Currently taking medication which can suppress immune function including systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids, radiation therapy, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate,&#xD;
             cyclosporine, leflunomid, TNF-alpha antagonists, monoclonal antibody therapies, or&#xD;
             intravenous immunoglobulin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known allergies to any components of the vaccine, including aluminum, yeast or&#xD;
             Benzonase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Febrile at ≥100°F in the 24 hours prior to vaccination. This will be reviewed before&#xD;
             each Gardasil 9 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Received any non-study inactive vaccines within the past 14 days or any live vaccines&#xD;
             within the past 30 days. Those excluded for this reason will be re-screened under the&#xD;
             same study number at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Plan to move out of the Galveston/Houston area in the 13 months following study entry.&#xD;
