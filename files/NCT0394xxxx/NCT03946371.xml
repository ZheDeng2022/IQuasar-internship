  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the relation between the volume of subglottic secretion before airway&#xD;
      extubation and the risk of extubation failure in the ICU patient.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 10 and 20% of patients develop extubation failure (10.7% in our ICU at 2018), which&#xD;
      is related to an increased in-hospital death rate, infections, higher costs and longer&#xD;
      hospital stays. Tracheal secretions, LVEF&lt;30%, MV &gt; 7d, Weak of cough are identified as risk&#xD;
      factors of extubation failures but are not completely performants. Avoiding reintubation&#xD;
      remains an important clinical goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subglottic secretion drainage above the cuff of an endotracheal tube is recognized as an&#xD;
      effective method to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in critically ill patients.&#xD;
      The subglottic secretion drainage is used in a regular way in our ICU. Volume of subglottic&#xD;
      secretion is not analysed in the scientific literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that high volume of subglottic secretion before extubation is&#xD;
      associated with high risk of extubation failure and à high risk of pneumonia post extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All planned extubations in the intensive care unit after 2 days minimal of mechanic&#xD;
      ventilation are recorded on a designated form and standard variables charted. All data will&#xD;
      be collected retrospectively after the extubation event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included patients will be assigned a unique identification number (UID) by the&#xD;
      investigator, who will secure the patient identifiers in an encrypted electronic file. The&#xD;
      cause of extubation failure will be recorded (as identified by the attending physician on&#xD;
      service, who is not involved in the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical analysis, group that fail extubation, will be compared, with the group that&#xD;
      was an extubation success. Standard demographics (age, sex), patient disease related factors&#xD;
      (diagnosis, duration of intubation, secretions), care factors (cuff leak test, p/f ratio&#xD;
      prior to extubation,LVEF&lt;30% ), and post extubation care (post extubation respiratory&#xD;
      support, stridor, blood gas, pneumonia) along with any complication during extubation and&#xD;
      reintubation and reasons for reintubation will be collected and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As two groups are being compared, bivariate analyses utilizing Chi-square tests or univariate&#xD;
      logistic regression for categorical variables and Student t -tests for interval variables,&#xD;
      will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will perform an interim analysis at the end of 12 months and a final analysis&#xD;
