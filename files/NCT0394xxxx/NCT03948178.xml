  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study provides an opportunity for subjects in the REFALS (3119002; NCT03505021) study to&#xD;
      continue treatment with oral levosimendan. The study will also provide more information about&#xD;
      long-term safety and effectiveness of oral levosimendan in patients with ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label study, so that all eligible subjects that complete the double-blind&#xD;
      REFALS study (48-weeks of treatment) will have the opportunity to receive oral levosimendan&#xD;
      treatment. The primary objective, in addition to continuing treatment for subjects enrolled&#xD;
      in the REFALS study, is to evaluate long-term safety of oral levosimendan in ALS patients.&#xD;
      Another important objective is to explore long-term effectiveness of oral levosimendan in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is open only to patients taking part in the REFALS study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written or verbal informed consent (IC) for participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who completed 48 weeks of treatment according to the REFALS study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to swallow study treatment capsules at the time of completing 48 weeks dosing in&#xD;
             the REFALS study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Development (or significant worsening from baseline of the REFALS study) of serious&#xD;
             cardiovascular disease (e.g.: myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmia,&#xD;
             stroke, or second or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulse/heart rate repeatedly &gt;100 bpm after 5-minute rest at baseline. If the&#xD;
             pulse/heart rate is &gt;100 bpm in the first recording, then a second recording must be&#xD;
             done after another 5 min rest to confirm pulse/heart rate &gt;100 bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;90 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30ml/min or creatine &gt;170 µmol/l at 48&#xD;
             week visit of the REFALS study, or on dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe hepatic impairment at the discretion of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of reproductive age without a negative pregnancy test and without a commitment&#xD;

             associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine devices and long acting&#xD;
             progestin agent), if sexually active during the study, and for 1 month after the last&#xD;
             dose of the study treatment. Women who are postmenopausal (1 year since last menstrual&#xD;
             cycle), surgically sterilised or who have undergone a hysterectomy are considered not&#xD;
             to be reproductive and can be included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject judged to be actively suicidal by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other clinical significant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal,&#xD;
             neurological or psychiatric disorder or any other major concurrent illness that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator could interfere with the interpretation of the study&#xD;
             results or constitute a health risk for the subject if he/she took part in the study&#xD;
