  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to investigate the efficacy of L DLPFC accelerated TMS&#xD;
      (aTMS) in patients with depression in Singapore and to assess the whether a 1-week course of&#xD;
      treatment is as effective as a 4-week course of non-accelerated treatment and if additional&#xD;
      aTMS or different aTMS treatments will be more efficacious in non-responders to initial aTMS&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique for stimulating brain&#xD;
      activity using transient magnetic field to induce an electrical current in the brain&#xD;
      producing firing of focal groups of brain cells. TMS is beginning to emerge in routine&#xD;
      clinical practice as a treatment for depression. The predominant hypothesis is that depressed&#xD;
      patients benefit from left sided high-frequency TMS (LHF-TMS) over the left dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)(1). A major limitation of rTMS is the large amount of time taken&#xD;
      for a standard protocol (38 minutes a day for 20-30 working days). The optimal type and&#xD;
      duration of TMS is still uncertain , as is the optimal strategy for continuing or changing&#xD;
      type of rTMS if there is poor initial response.(1) One potential strategy to improve the&#xD;
      acceptability of rTMS is to compress or accelerate the administration of rTMS (aTMS) by&#xD;
      administering multiple sessions of rTMS over a shorter period of time to have equivalent&#xD;
      efficacy in shorter period of time. Various studies of aTMS (2-9) have been safely conducted&#xD;
      with anywhere from 2 (3) to 10 (2) sessions of rTMS a day for a total of 9 (5) - 20 (4, 7)&#xD;
      sessions of TMS over 2 (2) to 9 (8) days. These studies showed that aTMS was safe and&#xD;
      efficacious, with no significant side effects reported and a high level of patient&#xD;
      acceptability and significant improvements in subjects' depression after the aTMS. However,&#xD;
      there is no data on whether subjects who do not response to aTMS will benefit from more of&#xD;
      the same TMS or from changing the mode of rTMS. The only study investigating this issue&#xD;
      investigated normal rTMS, not aTMS, and did not find a significant difference in response to&#xD;
      different forms of rTMS in initial non-responders (10). Our own observations and some&#xD;
      preliminary evidence suggest that there may be a delayed response to TMS in some patients&#xD;
      (11, 12). Thus, instead of the usual practice of giving 4-6 weeks stimulation (every weekday)&#xD;
      and assessing for response at the end of the stimulation period, the same outcome may be&#xD;
      achieved by giving a shorter period of stimulation (eg 1 weeks), waiting 2-4 weeks, then&#xD;
      assessing response and the need for further TMS treatment. Further, giving more than 1&#xD;
      treatment per day has been shown to be effective (13) and may lead to more efficient&#xD;
      treatment, i.e. fewer days to response and less requirement for patient attendance at the&#xD;
      treatment centre (2-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will contribute to existing knowledge by being possibly the first group in&#xD;
      South East Asia to investigate the immediate and delayed efficacy of aTMS in the local&#xD;
      population (i.e. in an Asian setting) as well as whether continuing or changing the type of&#xD;
      rTMS is more efficacious in subjects who do not respond to initial aTMS.&#xD;
