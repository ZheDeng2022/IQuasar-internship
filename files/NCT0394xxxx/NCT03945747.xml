      In type 1 diabetes (T1DM), automated insulin delivery (AID) systems such as the hybrid closed&#xD;
      loop artificial pancreas (HCL AP) combine the use of an insulin pump, continuous blood sugar&#xD;
      monitor, and control algorithm to adjust background insulin delivery to improve time in&#xD;
      target blood sugar range. Systems such as the predictive low glucose suspend system (PLGS)&#xD;
      pause insulin delivery to try and reduce low blood sugars. We aim to complete a pilot study&#xD;
      involving recruitment of youth ages 7 to 18 years from the following groups with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes: control participants consisting of youth on either multiple daily insulin&#xD;
      injections or conventional insulin pump therapy that plan to continue with their current&#xD;
      treatment modality, youth being transitioned to the HCL AP system, and youth being&#xD;
      transitioned to the PLGS system. Individuals will be recruited into each of the&#xD;
      aforementioned study groups based on their own expressed desire to either continue on&#xD;
      MDI/standard insulin pump therapy or transition to either the HCL AP or PLGS systems. The&#xD;
      decision to either continue with current therapy or transition therapy will remain entirely&#xD;
      up to the participant and their family and will be based on personal preference and insurance&#xD;
      coverage for that individual. We will not be randomizing the participants to any given&#xD;
      treatment group during this study but rather will be recruiting based on the participant's&#xD;
      decision. We would like to complete a physical exam with pubertal staging, collect blood and&#xD;
      urine samples to evaluate cardiometabolic and renal markers, and complete a DXA scan to&#xD;
      evaluate total lean and fat mass. After 3-6 months of either continuation of current&#xD;
      treatment with either multiple daily insulin injections or conventional insulin pump therapy&#xD;
      or transitioning to the HCL AP or PLGS systems, we would like to repeat the previously&#xD;
      described blood, urine, and imaging tests for comparison. We are interested in examining the&#xD;
      impact of the HCL AP and PLGS systems on maintaining blood sugars in target range, insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, and markers of cardiometabolic and renal function. We hypothesize that pauses in&#xD;
      insulin delivery, as seen in the setting of automated insulin delivery systems, will result&#xD;
      in improvements in insulin sensitivity, cardiometabolic markers, and renal function markers.&#xD;

      Background: Over 1.25 million Americans have type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), significantly&#xD;
      increasing the risk of early death from cardio-renal disease. Per the American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association, only 14% of children with T1DM meet glycemic targets [Wood et al. Diabetes Care&#xD;
      2013; 36:2035-37]. This is a severe and pervasive problem, as a child diagnosed with T1DM&#xD;
      today is expected to live up to 17 years less than non-diabetic peers. It is established that&#xD;
      time outside of goal glycemic target range increases the likelihood of developing micro- and&#xD;
      macro-vascular diabetic complications including diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, metabolic risk factors beyond glycemic control&#xD;
      including insulin resistance and obesity are also increasingly recognized to contribute to&#xD;
      the increased risk of DKD and CVD. Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems such as the&#xD;
      hybrid closed loop artificial pancreas (HCL AP) combine use of an insulin pump, continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitor (CGM), and a control algorithm to adjust background insulin delivery to&#xD;
      improve time in target range. AID systems such as the predictive low glucose suspend (PLGS)&#xD;
      system pause insulin delivery to try to reduce hypoglycemia. AID systems are now seeing&#xD;
      markedly increased commercial use; however, the long-term effects on insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI), cardio-metabolic markers, and kidney function have not yet been&#xD;
      studied. Preliminary basic science research suggests that periods of rest from insulin&#xD;
      exposure provided by AID systems may have positive effects on DKD and CVD risk. In this&#xD;
      proposal we intend to investigate the gap in knowledge between glycemic changes seen with AID&#xD;
      systems and the impact on markers of long-term complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To examine the effects of the AID systems on glycemic control and insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity as compared to traditional insulin pumps and multiple daily injections in youth&#xD;
      with T1DM Hypothesis 1.1: Treatment with the AID systems improves glycemic control in youth&#xD;
      with T1DM Hypothesis 1.2: Treatment with the AID systems increases insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      decreases insulin requirement in youth with T1DM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To examine the effects of the AID systems on kidney function and metabolic&#xD;
      markers as compared to traditional insulin pumps and multiple daily injections in youth with&#xD;
      T1DM Hypothesis 2.1: Treatment with the AID systems improves metabolic markers in youth with&#xD;
      T1DM Hypothesis 2.2: Treatment with the AID systems improves kidney function in youth with&#xD;
      T1DM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study is a pilot study aimed at recruiting youth ages 7 to 18 years from the&#xD;
      following 3 groups with T1DM: control participants on either multiple daily injections or&#xD;
      conventional pump therapy, youth being transitioned to a HCL AP system, and youth being&#xD;
      transitioned to a PLGS system. Exclusion criteria include non-T1DM, non-insulin blood glucose&#xD;
      altering medications, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or a ketogenic diet. We plan to complete a&#xD;
      physical exam with pubertal staging, collect information on recent insulin usage and dosages,&#xD;
      fasting serum and urine samples, and a DXA scan before the participant transitions to either&#xD;
      a HCL AP or a PLGS system, if applicable. Following 3-6 months of treatment we will then&#xD;
      collect the identical data as at baseline. Outcome measures include CGM data, total daily&#xD;
      insulin dose, time suspended from insulin delivery, height, weight, BMI, waist circumference,&#xD;
      hip circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, c-peptide, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL,&#xD;
      triglycerides, adiponectin, and DXA scan to evaluate cardio-metabolic markers and calculate&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, as well as serum creatinine, cystatin c, copeptin, and urine&#xD;
      microalbumin to evaluate kidney health and calculate GFR by Zappitelli and FAS equations.&#xD;
