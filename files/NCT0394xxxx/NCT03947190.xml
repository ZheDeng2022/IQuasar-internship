      This is a phase IIb clinical trial in malaria-exposed individuals to assess the&#xD;
      immunogenicity, safety and efficacy of the two vaccines in the context of controlled human&#xD;
      malaria infection, P. falciparum sporozoite challenge (PfSPZ Challenge).&#xD;

      A total of 64 participants will be enrolled for challenge and divided into four groups as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 participants to receive R21/Matrix M (R21/MM) with intradermal PfSPZ Challenge;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 participants to receive viral-vectored ME-TRAP with intradermal PfSPZ Challenge;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 participants to receive R21/MM with direct venous inoculation PfSPZ Challenge; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  14 participants comprising of the control group with intradermal PfSPZ Challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests and clinical assessments will be conducted to screen out participants with health&#xD;
      conditions that may impact participation in the study.&#xD;
