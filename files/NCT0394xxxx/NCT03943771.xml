  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators aimed to estimate the effect of showing and handling a three-dimensional&#xD;
      modelization of a patient's kidney presenting with tumor the day before his nephron-sparing&#xD;
      surgery. The main outcome measure was the effect on anxiety assessed via the STAI score. 2&#xD;
      types kidney models (virtual and printed) will be evaluated as compared to usual information,&#xD;
      using a randomization.&#xD;

      Announcement of serious illnesses and especially cancerous diseases has major impacts on&#xD;
      one's psychological field. Need of surgery can create even other fears due to its unknown&#xD;
      nature. Use of tools to decrease anxiety and enhance understanding prior to surgery is a key&#xD;
      point in comprehensive care that is way not enough promoted for now. In the field of surgery,&#xD;
      available methods to deal with pre-operative anxiety are massively represented by anxiolytics&#xD;
      drugs, only few other devices were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technological development in healthcare has seen the rising of three-dimensional media,&#xD;
      especially in surgery, for procedure planning. There is no doubt that this tool is effective&#xD;
      in helping surgeons regarding the studies published within the past few years but there is no&#xD;
      such evidence concerning the benefit for patients. Some authors report improvement of&#xD;
      patients understanding and great satisfaction referring to the usefulness of this tool. But&#xD;
      none of these papers evaluated anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of our research is to measure the effect of a personalized three-dimensional model&#xD;
      of patients' kidney on pre-operative anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose investigators will randomly assign a total of 66 patients planned to have a&#xD;
      nephron-sparing surgery for kidney tumor in 3 different groups. Inside the 2 interventional&#xD;
      groups, patients' kidneys will be modelized in three dimensions, one group will then be&#xD;
      3D-printed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third group will be control with usual preoperative information. The day before surgery,&#xD;
      3D models will be presented to their respective owner. All patients will have to complete a&#xD;
      survey evaluating their anxiety level and also their understanding of renal anatomy and&#xD;
      surgical procedure.&#xD;

    <description>The day before surgery, all the patients will be visited by a member of the investigator team for preoperative consultation and will be given a questionnaire evaluating their anxiety based on STAI and VAS scores. The two experimental groups will be offered their renal modelization to be manipulated (virtually or physically) before the questionnaire.&#xD;
A second survey assessing basic renal anatomy and surgery understanding will also be completed by the patients.&#xD;
Anxiolytics prescription prior to surgery will be collected inside the medical file.</description>
