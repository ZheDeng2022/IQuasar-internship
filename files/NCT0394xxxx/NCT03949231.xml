  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was designed to investigate the survival outcomes, response rates, and safety of&#xD;
      patients with Barcelona-Clinical Hepatocellular Carcinoma (BCLC)-C-stage liver cancer by&#xD;
      hepatic artery versus vein infusion of PD1/PDL1 inhibitor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver cancer is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide, but the mortality rate ranks&#xD;
      third. China has a large population base, with more than 400,000 new cases each year, and&#xD;
      more than half of the world's new liver cancer and deaths. More than 70% of liver cancer&#xD;
      patients in China are diagnosed at mid-to-late stage and have lost the chance of surgery.&#xD;
      Only 10%-15% of newly diagnosed patients can undergo radical resection, and the recurrence&#xD;
      rate after 5 years is as high as 50%-80%. So far, sorafenib is still the only standard&#xD;
      treatment that can prolong the overall survival of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. SHARP's&#xD;
      latest research shows that sorafenib can only extend patients with advanced liver cancer for&#xD;
      2.8 months, and many adverse reactions; regofenib can be used in patients with advanced liver&#xD;
      cancer after taking sorafenib resistance, but the overall efficiency is still low. It is&#xD;
      difficult to be widely used in patients with advanced liver cancer, and more alternative&#xD;
      therapies are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD1/PDL1 inhibitor is widely used in treatment of various cancers in China now. The hepatic&#xD;
      arterial chemotherapy infusion for advanced liver cancer, through the &quot;first pass effect&quot; of&#xD;
      drug treatment, can significantly increase the local drug concentration of the tumor, improve&#xD;
      the efficacy, reduce systemic adverse reactions, meanwhile Folfox regimen has been confirmed&#xD;
      by the hepatic arterial chemotherapy infusion program. To the investigator's knowledge, no&#xD;
      studies have been developed on the survival benefit of hepatic arterial infusion of&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic agents in patients with advanced liver cancer. This phase III clinical&#xD;
      trial was designed to compare the effects of PD1/PDL1 inhibitor via IA and IV on the survival&#xD;
      benefit of patients with advanced liver cancer, including ORR, DCR, median survival time, and&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;
