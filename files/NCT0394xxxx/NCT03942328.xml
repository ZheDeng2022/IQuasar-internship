  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies the side effects of autologous dendritic cells and a vaccine&#xD;
      called Prevnar in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery after&#xD;
      undergoing standard high-dose external beam radiotherapy. Autologous dendritic cells are&#xD;
      immune cells generated from patients' own white blood cells that are grown in a special lab&#xD;
      and trained to stimulate the immune system to destroy tumor cells. A pneumonia vaccine called&#xD;
      Prevnar may also help stimulate the immune system. Giving autologous dendritic cells and&#xD;
      Prevnar to patients with liver cancer after radiotherapy may help doctors determine if it is&#xD;
      possible to stimulate the body's own immune system to fight against the tumor, and to see if&#xD;
      this immune stimulation can be done safely.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluation of safety and tolerability of an autologous dendritic cell (DC) vaccine&#xD;
      delivered by intra-tumoral injection in patients with primary liver cancer treated with&#xD;
      high-dose conformal external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess feasibility in patients with liver cancer treated with high-dose conformal EBRT&#xD;
      followed by autologous DC vaccine injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess overall response rate in patients with liver cancer treated with high-dose&#xD;
      conformal EBRT followed by autologous DC vaccine injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess progression free survival in patients with liver cancer treated with high-dose&#xD;
      conformal EBRT followed by autologous DC vaccine injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess clinical benefit rate in patients with liver cancer treated with high-dose&#xD;
      conformal EBRT followed by autologous DC vaccine injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess time to response in patients with liver cancer treated with high-dose conformal&#xD;
      EBRT followed by autologous DC vaccine injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess duration of response in patients with liver cancer treated with high-dose&#xD;
      conformal EBRT followed by autologous DC vaccine injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To assess overall survival in patients with liver cancer treated with high-dose&#xD;
      conformal EBRT followed by autologous DC vaccine injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADIOLOGIC STUDY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the radiologic response over time of primary liver tumors treated with high-dose&#xD;
      conformal EBRT followed by autologous DC vaccine injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To monitor patients' immune response after vaccine therapy. II. To assess the immune&#xD;
      response to pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo standard of care high-dose EBRT for 5 or 15 fractions over 1-3 weeks (cycle&#xD;
      1). Patients then receive autologous dendritic cells intratumorally (IT) on day 1 of cycles&#xD;
      2-8, and pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 of cycles 2-4&#xD;
      only. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 7 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 1 year (beginning at week 36 or 12 weeks after last autologous dendritic cell dose&#xD;
      whichever is earlier). Patients are then followed every 3 months until disease progression,&#xD;
      and then every 6 months until 5 years after registration.&#xD;

    <description>Change in immunologic correlates before and after vaccination treatment will be evaluated and summarized both quantitatively and graphically. Each of the correlative endpoints will be summarized individually, but will also be evaluated in terms of their relationships to one another; i.e., will use Spearman rank correlation coefficient to assess the correlations between baseline levels as well as between changes before and after treatment in these immunologic markers. In addition, these immunologic markers will be correlated with cancer and treatment related outcomes (e.g. response, adverse events). Relationships will also be explored graphically using scatter plots.</description>
