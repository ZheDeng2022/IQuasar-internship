  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple observational studies show an association between fetal and post-natal aflatoxin&#xD;
      exposure and reduced linear growth. However, the effects of confounding factors such as&#xD;
      socio-economic status, food insecurity and nutrient deficiencies due to monotonous diets have&#xD;
      not been ruled out. This trial will quantify the causal role of infant aflatoxin ingestion on&#xD;
      post-natal growth by performing a cluster randomized trial in children 6-18 months of age in&#xD;
      the Dodoma Region of Tanzania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All health facilities in one district in Dodoma will be randomized to the control or&#xD;
      intervention arm. Infants will be recruited into the study over one year to account for&#xD;
      seasonal variation in AF exposure. Both arms will receive infant and young child feeding&#xD;
      education, a thermos flask and plastic measuring scoops. The intervention arm will receive a&#xD;
      low-aflatoxin pre-blended porridge flour containing maize and groundnut (ratio 4:1&#xD;
      respectively) and low-aflatoxin groundnut flour, whereas in the control arm the same porridge&#xD;
      mix will be promoted through education, but acquired by the household. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      length-for-age Z-score at 18 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of a very low AF complementary feeding&#xD;
      intervention on LAZ using a cluster randomized design (CRT), while promoting a nutritionally&#xD;
      adequate diet to all infants between 6-18 months of age. The hypothesis is that ingestion of&#xD;
      AF can reduce infant length and that a reduction of AF exposure will result in improved&#xD;
      length for age z-scores (LAZ). The primary outcome is LAZ, which will be measured at 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unit of randomization is government-run health facilities (health centers, dispensaries&#xD;
      and hospital, 52 clusters in total) in the Kongwa District. Mothers and infants will be&#xD;
      recruited into the trial based on 42 day EPI visit attendance, which has very high (&gt;95%)&#xD;
      coverage in Kongwa District. Recruitment of infants will be performed for one complete&#xD;
      calendar year capture variability in exposure by season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critical to casual inference is the intervention's ability to create a contrast of AF&#xD;
      consumption between the control and intervention groups, without creating differential macro-&#xD;
      or micro-nutrient intake or differences in feeding and care practices that could affect&#xD;
      stunting between arms. To reduce the risk of introducing these biases, the investigators&#xD;
      designed the intervention to include: 1) education to improve infant feeding and care&#xD;
      practices in both arms, and 2) behavior change communication on the use of blended infant&#xD;
      porridge flours in both arms. Participants in the intervention group will receive&#xD;
      low-aflatoxin blended infant porridge flour and groundnut flour, made in accordance with&#xD;
      Tanzanian food and mycotoxin regulations. Those in the control group will not receive any&#xD;
      flour, but will be advised to feed their infants a blend similar in ingredients and ratio to&#xD;
      what the intervention group will receive. Both groups will receive a thermos flask to store&#xD;
      porridge and a small plastic measuring scoop to measure porridge flour for preparation of the&#xD;
      porridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated using a one-sided test of independent sample means, with a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 1.2 Z, type I error of 0.05, power of 0.90, design effect of 2.0 and&#xD;
      assuming a coefficient of variation of .144 for varying cluster size, based on previous&#xD;
      year's data for EPI attendance at 42 days. Given these parameters our total sample size is&#xD;
      calculated to be 2,322 (1,161 infants per cluster). Conservatively estimating a 20% loss to&#xD;
      follow-up and infant mortality, the total number of infants is 2,787, or 54 infants recruited&#xD;
      per health cluster annually or 4.5 infants per cluster per month. Rounding up, 5 infants per&#xD;
      cluster each month will be recruited for a total of 3,120 potential infants, recognizing that&#xD;
      in approximately 6 of the health facilities, it is unlikely that all 60 infants because of&#xD;
      the size of the population served by the facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in the Kongwa District of Dodoma, Tanzania, where the&#xD;
      investigators have performed formative research (Protocol Identification#: 1703007043) and&#xD;
      confirmed AF contamination in local foods, primarily groundnuts, and that infants are exposed&#xD;
      to aflatoxin. The frequency and level of exposure is similar in range to the West African&#xD;
      observational studies. Kongwa District is a good location to perform this study, as exposure&#xD;
      is high enough to be suspected of contributing to stunting, but low enough as to not cause&#xD;
      aflatoxicosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: Data collection was stopped between April 9 and June 8, 2020 due to the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      outbreak, in accordance with the guidance of the Tanzanian National Institute for Medical&#xD;
      Research. The delivery of the intervention continued during this time.&#xD;

    <description>This arm will receive infant and young child feeding education performed by community health workers and very-low aflatoxin (AF) pre-blended porridge flour, ratio 4:1 maize to groundnut. Provision of this pre-blended flour will be 50 grams/day for 6-8 month olds, 60/day grams for 9-11 months and 75 grams/day for 12-18 month olds (with 10-15 grams added per day to account for any loss). Participants will also receive 1 kg of low-AF groundnut flour each month for 6-18 month olds. Finally, participants will receive a thermos flask to hygienically store porridge and a plastic scoop to measure appropriate amount of porridge flour each day.</description>
