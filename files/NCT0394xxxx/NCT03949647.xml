      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow is the soft material found inside most large bones of the body. Bone marrow&#xD;
      produces red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets that are released into the blood&#xD;
      stream. Inside the marrow, these cells start off as young, immature cells called progenitor&#xD;
      cells. Researchers want to study these cells in healthy people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand how progenitor cells change with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a questionnaire, a physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a bone marrow aspirate. They will be asked to lie on their stomach or&#xD;
      side. A local anesthetic will be injected with a small needle under the skin at the site. A&#xD;
      needle will then be placed through the skin and into the hip bone. A small amount of the&#xD;
      liquid part of the bone marrow will be taken up into the needle. After the needle is removed,&#xD;
      a pressure bandage will be placed on the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to become a repeat volunteer and have a bone marrow aspirate&#xD;
      sample collected once every other year. They will have a physical exam and blood tests before&#xD;
      each collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cells from the collection will be used for genetic testing and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in the study for as long as they remain healthy and willing to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone marrow is soft tissue found inside the large bones of the body. Bone marrow produces red&#xD;
      blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets that are eventually released into the blood&#xD;
      stream. These three cell types are considered mature cells (adult cells) and they come from a&#xD;
      progenitor cell that lives in the bone marrow. This study is designed to provide bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirate and blood cells for research studies by basic investigators within NIA. Volunteers&#xD;
      are screened by a health history questionnaire, a physical examination by the principal&#xD;
      investigator, and blood tests to detect any obvious blood diseases, or bleeding or immune&#xD;
      disorders. A bone marrow aspirate procedure is performed using a needle inserted into the hip&#xD;
      bone to withdraw a small amount of fluid from the bone marrow for studies. NIA Researchers&#xD;
      will use these samples for in vitro research only. In other words, these cells are never&#xD;
      given back to a human. We will not share samples or data with researchers outside NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of healthy males and females aged 18 years and older. Study&#xD;
      subjects are anticipated to be non-patient community volunteers. Individuals will not be&#xD;
      excluded based on gender, race, or ethnicity. The number of subjects to be enrolled will be&#xD;
      2000. This will allow us to try and maintain 200 active participants in this protocol.&#xD;
      Volunteers are screened initially and once every 2 years while on-study by a health history&#xD;
      questionnaire and laboratory testing. Although participants may undergo a bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirate procedure every 56 days in clinical practice, it is our plan to collect longitudinal&#xD;
      data and obtain one sample once every other year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect bone marrow aspirate samples for distribution to NIA research investigators&#xD;
      for their studies of the aging process in progenitor cells. We will be performing bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirate collections of 1-5 samples every other week. We will need to maintain an active&#xD;
      volunteer pool of approximately 200 active volunteers.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Normal healthy males and females, age 18 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Agree to DNA/RNA extraction of collected samples, and analysis and storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Health History Questionnaire, based on the American Association of Blood Banks&#xD;
                  (AABB) guidelines (Attachment 3), is not remarkable for active infection or HIV&#xD;
                  risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Able to speak and read English.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Willingness and ability to come to the NIA Clinical Research Unit at MedStar&#xD;
                  Harbor Hospital in Baltimore every 2 years for a bone marrow aspiration&#xD;
                  procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unable to verify identification of volunteer by state issued ID card, driver s&#xD;
             license, or military ID. Participants earning greater than $600.00/year are issued a&#xD;
             1099 form, therefore, positive identification is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Allergy to Lidocaine (numbing agent) used during bone marrow aspiration procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Test results are positive for viral infections such as RPR, HIV, Hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen or hepatitis C antibodies. For participants who have been treated for&#xD;
             Hepatitis C, screening blood work must show HCV RNA quantitative is not detectable.&#xD;
             Researchers are seeking healthy, pristine cells. Due to the ongoing nature of these&#xD;
             chronic viral and bacterial infections, the blood cell populations will change.&#xD;
             Researchers want to study changing cell populations as a factor of aging only and not&#xD;
             those altered by infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ongoing risk factors for HIV or Hepatitis B or C such as: intravenous drug use,&#xD;
             non-monogamous unprotected intercourse. These viruses weaken the immune system and&#xD;
             cause changes in the white blood cells and their progenitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Major medical illnesses such as any type of liquid or solid tumor cancer, history of&#xD;
             deep vein thrombosis, auto-immune disorders, organ or bone marrow transplant, or&#xD;
             liver, kidney, heart or lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A medical finding that shows a participant could not safely go through this procedure.&#xD;
             (such as Parkinson s disease, dementia or any uncontrolled behavior that would place&#xD;
             the participant s safety at risk)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Bleeding conditions such as hemophilia or von Willebrand s disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Significant abnormalities are found in the results of blood tests such as elevated&#xD;
             liver enzymes (2x normal for MedStar Harbor Hospital Clinical Laboratory parameters),&#xD;
             abnormal kidney function, positive viral titers, GFR &lt;30.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. On any medication that can alter blood cell function such as chronic steroid use,&#xD;
             histamine-2 blockers, antivirals or past or present chemotherapy (complete list&#xD;
             located in the Cytapheresis Screening manual stored in the NIA Cytapheresis Unit).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Radiation therapy past or present.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Inability of researchers to access iliac crest from conditions such as wounds, rashes,&#xD;
             or large deposits of adipose tissue that makes localization of the iliac crest&#xD;
             difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Organ transplant or any graft such as tissue, bone or skin as we don t know how this&#xD;
             impacts progenitor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, eligible participants may not be able to participate in a specific bone marrow&#xD;
        aspiration procedure but might be eligible at a later date. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers: Females who are pregnant or who have had a pregnancy in&#xD;
             the last 6 weeks are temporarily deferred. They may resume participation in the study&#xD;
             6 weeks after delivery or cessation of lactation and have been cleared by their&#xD;
             obstetrician or primary care physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Medication: Volunteers taking the following medications would be deferred for 2 weeks&#xD;
             after course has been completed and volunteer is feeling well: Antibiotics,&#xD;
             antifungals, antimalarials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Temporary steroids (tapers): Deferred for 72 hours after symptoms are resolved and&#xD;
             prescription is completed if taken orally, intravenously, or intramuscular. No&#xD;
             deferral if taken intranasal or for joint injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Hepatitis B immune globulin: Volunteers are deferred 6 months if given after exposure&#xD;
             to hepatitis B to insure the volunteer has not been infected. If administered for&#xD;
             prophylaxis, no deferral is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Live Attenuated Virus Vaccinations: Defer for 4 weeks if symptomfree.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Inactivated (Killed Virus) Vaccinations: Defer for 2 weeks if symptom-free.&#xD;
&#xD;

             immediately if symptom-free.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Smallpox Vaccine: Deferred until the scab has separated from the skin spontaneously or&#xD;
             21 days from date of immunization, whichever is longer, if volunteer had no other&#xD;
             symptoms or complications. Visual verification of absence of vaccine scab is required.&#xD;
             If scab was otherwise removed (not spontaneously separated), defer for 2 months after&#xD;
             vaccination date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Experimental Medication or Unlicensed (Experimental) Vaccine is usually associated&#xD;
             with a research protocol and the effect on bone marrow is unknown. Deferral is one&#xD;
             year unless otherwise indicated by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Infection or Fever: Deferred until 2 weeks after antibiotics are completed and&#xD;
             volunteer is feeling well.&#xD;
&#xD;

             normal activities by primary care physician or surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Close contact with someone else s blood, accidental needle-stick, treatment for&#xD;
             syphilis or gonorrhea-Volunteers are deferred for 6 months to insure they have not&#xD;
             been infected. Viral/serology testing will be repeated and verified as negative prior&#xD;
             to bone marrow aspiration procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Received money, drugs or other payment for sex or having sexual contact with a&#xD;
                  prostitute or anyone else who takes money or drugs or other payment for sex&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Has used needles to take drugs, steroids or anything NOT prescribed by their&#xD;
                  doctor or had sexual contact with anyone who has ever used needles to take drugs&#xD;
                  or steroids, or anything NOT prescribed by their doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Had sexual contact with or living with anyone who has hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Had a tattoo using non-sterile needles or reused ink.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Had a body piercing that used non-sterile needles or multi-use equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Had close contact with someone who had a smallpox vaccination such as touching the&#xD;
             vaccination site, handling bedding or clothing that has been in contact with an&#xD;
             unbandaged vaccination site to insure they have not been infected: Deferral is 2&#xD;
             months if volunteer is symptom-free.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Anemia/Leukopenia/Thrombocytopenia:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Volunteers with a hemoglobin of &lt;12.0 for men, &lt;11.0 for women or hematocrit &lt;38&#xD;
                  for men, &lt;36 for women may return in 8 weeks to repeat labs to verify anemia.&#xD;
                  Eligible for procedure once values have returned to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. White blood cell count &lt;3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Platelet count &lt;150,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Whole blood donation (450 mL) or bone marrow aspiration procedure: Deferred 56&#xD;
                  days from date of last donation as mandated by AABB guidelines. e. Double unit&#xD;
                  red cell donation: Deferred for 112 days (16 weeks) as mandated by AABB&#xD;
                  guidelines.&#xD;

             mandated by AABB guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
             g.There will be no deferral for leukocyte apheresis donation as&#xD;
&#xD;
             we believe it is safe to perform leukocyte donationapheresis and&#xD;
&#xD;
             bone marrow aspiration on the same day on normal healthy volunteers. For research&#xD;
             purposes, we will perform bone&#xD;
&#xD;
             marrow aspiration first if both procedures are done on the same&#xD;
&#xD;
             day.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Received blood transfusion: Deferral is for 12 months to ensure volunteer has not&#xD;
             acquired an infectious disease. Annual laboratory testing will be repeated prior to&#xD;
             bone marrow aspiration procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. It is less than six weeks since participation in another research study which is felt&#xD;
             by the Principal Investigator to be incompatible with this study. (for example:&#xD;
             studies that collect blood, investigational drug studies, vaccine trials, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Travel:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Malaria-endemic countries: Volunteers who are residents of such countries will be deferred&#xD;
        for 3 years after departure from the country if they remain free from unexplained symptoms&#xD;
        suggestive for malaria. Residence is defined as a continuous stay of longer than 5 years in&#xD;
        a country or countries having any malaria-endemic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers who are not prior residents of malaria-endemic countries and travel to a&#xD;
        malaria-endemic area will be deferred for 12 months after departure from that area. The&#xD;
        duration of travel to a malaria-endemic area is defined as more than 24 hours to less than&#xD;
        5 years. Note that a passage greater than 24 hours through a malaria-endemic area while on&#xD;
        route to a malaria-free area is considered a sufficient possible exposure to trigger&#xD;
        deferral.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (A complete list of malarial-endemic countries is kept in the Cytapheresis Screening Manual&#xD;
        and is stored in the NIA Apheresis Unit.)&#xD;
