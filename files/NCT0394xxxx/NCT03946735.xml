  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 52 individuals with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) (68% female, mean age = 35.67)&#xD;
      were allocated to a CBT group or to a control group. The intervention group was given one&#xD;
      session of therapy per week over a duration of 8 weeks, while the control group did not&#xD;
      receive any intervention and was placed on a waiting list. Self-reported social anxiety,&#xD;
      perfectionism, and rumination were measured before the CBT intervention, after the&#xD;
      intervention, and two months after the intervention for both groups.&#xD;

    <description>Week one involved introducing CBT and assessing the negative effects of perfectionism, rumination, and social anxiety. Week two allowed participants to specify stressful social activities, stressful social situations, and enjoyable activities. Week three to week six allowed participants to identify automatic thoughts and thinking errors (for example, all or nothing thinking, self-criticism, dysfunctional schemas for self-evaluation, and unrealistic standards). Assignments were provided to participants with the content of exposure to anxiety evoking situations in the treatment sessions and at home. Achievable behavioural goals were set for participants in the treatment sessions and at home.</description>
