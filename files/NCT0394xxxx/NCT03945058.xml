  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of death in US. It is associated with abnormal&#xD;
      vascular function termed endothelial dysfunction. It is also associated with increased stress&#xD;
      on the blood vessels and high levels of inflammation. Vagus nerve stimulation can help&#xD;
      improve inflammation, vascular function and vascular stress. The investigator has recently&#xD;
      completed a study showing that 1 hour of noninvasive vagus stimulation can improve vascular&#xD;
      health. However, it is unknown if 4 weeks of stimulation will be beneficial in systolic heart&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if transcutaneous vagal stimulation (TVS) will lead&#xD;
      to improvement in the function of the inner lining of participants' arteries, memory, and in&#xD;
      the levels of certain chemical markers of arterial function in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive either TVS or a sham stimulation and undergo 4&#xD;
      weeks of stimulation. Vascular function will be assessed by several non-invasive&#xD;
      measurements, including Flow Mediate Dilation (FMD), Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA), EndoPAT, and&#xD;
      Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI). Participants' memory will also be measured through&#xD;
      electronic assessments and blood will be collected and analyzed for arterial function&#xD;
      chemical markers.&#xD;

      Visit 1: Following tests(to assess vascular function) will be done: 1. FMD 2) LSCI 3) EndoPAT&#xD;
      and 4) Pulse wave analysis (PWA). Patients will rest for 10 minutes between each test. They&#xD;
      will be trained to use PARASYMTM unit for TVS. Blood collected, serum/plasma will be stored&#xD;
      at -80F. Whole blood will be collected in PAXgene tubes. Patients will be instructed to apply&#xD;
      TVS to either ear lobule (SHAM) or Tragus(experimental arm). Baseline characteristics will be&#xD;
      collected including data on ventricular function(LVEF and left ventricular volumes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (4 weeks): Follow up tests(FMD,LSCI,EndoPAT,PWA) and repeat blood collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory cytokines and vascular function assays will be performed.&#xD;
