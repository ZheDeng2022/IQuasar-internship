      Using a highly innovative methodology, the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to pilot test, for the first time, an optimization trial approach to&#xD;
      develop and refine the decision partnering skills of family caregivers of persons with&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed advanced cancer. Using a 2x2x2 full factorial design, 40 family caregivers of&#xD;
      persons with newly-diagnosed advanced cancer will be randomized to receive one or more nurse&#xD;
      coach-delivered decision partnering training components, based on the Ottawa Decision Support&#xD;
      Framework and Social Support Effectiveness Theory4: 1) psychoeducation on effective decision&#xD;
      partnering principles (1 vs. 3 sessions); 2) decision partnering communication training (yes&#xD;
      vs. no); and 3) Ottawa Decision Guide training (yes vs. no).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A priority focus in palliative care, oncology, and geriatrics is preparing the 2.8 million&#xD;
      U.S. family caregivers of persons with cancer to effectively partner with patients in&#xD;
      healthcare decision-making from diagnosis to the end of life. Over 70% of patients with&#xD;
      cancer report involvement by relatives, friends, and partners in healthcare decisions,&#xD;
      including choices about cancer treatments, surgery, transitions and location of care,&#xD;
      accessing palliative and hospice care, and many others. Hence, there is a critical need to&#xD;
      train cancer family caregivers to be supportive of patient decision-making; however, few&#xD;
      palliative care interventions exist that enhance skills in effective decision partnering.&#xD;
      Patients making healthcare decisions with unprepared family caregivers may experience&#xD;
      inadequate family decision support leading to heightened distress and receipt of&#xD;
      care/treatments inconsistent with their values and preferences. This in turn may increase&#xD;
      distress for family caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Becoming better decision partners with patients is one among several skills targeted within&#xD;
      our evidence-based model of early concurrent oncology palliative care for family caregivers.&#xD;
      Decision partnering relevant content for family caregivers has included principles of&#xD;
      effective social support, communication, and Ottawa Decision Guide training; however it is&#xD;
      unknown which of these components and component interactions influences patient and caregiver&#xD;
      decision-making outcomes. Traditional research approaches typically treat interventions as&#xD;
      &quot;bundled&quot; treatment packages, making it difficult to assess definitively which aspects of an&#xD;
      intervention can be reduced, eliminated, or replaced to improve efficiency. Using traditional&#xD;
      research methods (e.g., two-arm randomized controlled trials that test new features one at a&#xD;
      time) requires conducting multiple studies, which is an exorbitantly expensive and time&#xD;
      consuming process. This paradox prompts us to consider methodologies that may offer a more&#xD;
      efficient way to test multiple intervention components simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a highly innovative methodology, the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to pilot test, for the first time, an optimization trial approach to&#xD;
      develop and refine the decision partnering skills of family caregivers of persons with&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed advanced cancer (CASCADE: CAre Supporters Coached to be Adept DEcision&#xD;
      partners). Using a 2x2x2 factorial design, 40 family caregivers of persons with&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed advanced cancer will be randomized to receive one or more nurse&#xD;
      coach-delivered decision partnering training components, based on the Ottawa Decision Support&#xD;
      Framework and Social Support Effectiveness Theory4: 1) psychoeducation on effective decision&#xD;
      partnering and social support principles (1 vs. 3 sessions); 2) decision support&#xD;
      communication training (yes vs. no); and 3) Ottawa Decision Guide training (yes vs. no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's conceptual foundations incorporate Rini's Social Support Effectiveness Theory&#xD;
      and the Ottawa Decision Support Framework. Caregiver decision partnering training is designed&#xD;
      to modify family caregiver skills, including their ability to: 1) provide effective social&#xD;
      support through psychoeducation on key social support principles that will optimize emotional&#xD;
      and informational support to patients; 2) elicit patient decisional needs, including patient&#xD;
      values, preferences, and coping through better decision support communication, enhancing the&#xD;
      quantity of decision-making conversations; and 3) provide structured decision support using&#xD;
      an evidence-based tool (i.e., the Ottawa Decision Guide, see Appendix) to help patients&#xD;
      clarify choices and guide deliberation through Ottawa decision guide training, reducing&#xD;
      patient decision conflict. Modification of these skills and improvement in patient mediating&#xD;
      outcomes is hypothesized to lead to more positive decisional influence from the patient's&#xD;
      perspective and better patient and caregiver mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of using a highly innovative experimental&#xD;
      design to enroll and retain 40 caregivers for 24 weeks to complete 1 or more components of&#xD;
      caregiver decision partnering training. Feasibility: â‰¥80% of participants will adhere to and&#xD;
      complete assigned intervention components and study-related assessments. Acceptability:&#xD;
      Through post-intervention qualitative interviews, the investigators will elicit feedback from&#xD;
      caregiver participants on intervention experiences and clinical trial procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Explore the preliminary efficacy of individual decision partnering training components&#xD;
      and component interactions on patient and caregiver outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks after&#xD;
      baseline, including a) patient-reported positive decision influence (primary) using Rini's&#xD;
      Decision Influence Scale and b) patient and caregiver mood (depression/anxiety symptoms)&#xD;
      using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: Explore mediators and moderators (e.g., sociodemographics, coping, social&#xD;
      support, decisional conflict) of the relationship between intervention components and patient&#xD;
      and caregiver outcomes.&#xD;
