  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The standard first line treatment in SCCAC is the association of 5-FU with cisplatin&#xD;
           reaching a percentage of survival at 5 years of about 32% (Faivre 1999); in a recent&#xD;
           case series of patients affected by SCCAC, the combination of 5-FU and cisplatin as&#xD;
           first line treatment produced 34.4% objective response rate (ORR) and a 5 years survival&#xD;
           rate of 15% (Sclafani 2017);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No standard second line treatment exists for SCCAC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cetuximab in association with irinotecan has demonstrated promising results in&#xD;
           pretreated patients affected by SCCAC (Lukan 2009). In addition, it was recently tested&#xD;
           in stage I-III SCCAC in association with cisplatin plus 5-FU and radiotherapy. Despite&#xD;
           not reaching their pre-specified endpoints both studies reported an interesting activity&#xD;
           in local control of disease, leading to hypothesize that cetuximab warrant further&#xD;
           investigation in new strategies (Garg 2017, Sparano 2017);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-PD1 treatments such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab showed promising activity in&#xD;
           metastatic refractory SCCAC in terms of response rate and disease control with&#xD;
           acceptable toxicity profiles (Morris 2017, Ott 2017);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The induction of immunogenic cell death was recently shown for cetuximab-based regimens&#xD;
           (Pozzi 2016) and PD-L1 blockade should lead to NK cells activation enhancing cetuximab&#xD;
           ADCC (Concha-Benavente 2015, Concha-Benavente 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of these considerations, the investigators designed the present randomized phase&#xD;
      II trial of avelumab alone or avelumab plus cetuximab for previously treated unresectable&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic SCCAC.&#xD;
