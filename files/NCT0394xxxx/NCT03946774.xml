  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High protein low carbohydrate diets have become popular in recent years to help facilitate&#xD;
      weight loss. It is controversial if these diets are associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to administer high and low protein shakes to participants and&#xD;
      measure effects on circulating monocytes, immune cells critical to the development of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. In order to study circulating monocytes, blood&#xD;
      will be collected from the study participants just prior to drinking the shake, and then 1&#xD;
      and 4 hours after drinking the shake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess functional effects on monocytes, investigators will perform a series of&#xD;
      assays comparing the results between individuals who drank high protein vs low protein&#xD;
      shakes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death globally with obesity as of one of&#xD;
      the dominant modifiable risk factors. Obesity is also a precursor to several other&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Almost all&#xD;
      weight loss efforts utilize dietary modification with high protein/low carbohydrate diets&#xD;
      serving as one of the most popular approaches. Despite the metabolic benefits of high dietary&#xD;
      protein, recent studies have raised a concerning association with increased risk of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Although this remains controversial, there is&#xD;
      some animal data showing evidence of dietary protein's proatherogenic role. These data are&#xD;
      correlative and no mechanistic studies have been undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The downstream events after protein ingestion involve digestion of the protein into amino&#xD;
      acids, increases in blood amino acids, and distribution to target tissues. Mouse models have&#xD;
      definitively shown that circulating monocytes and macrophages of arterial blood vessels are&#xD;
      particularly sensitive to this amino acid load with robust activation of the mTOR (mammalian&#xD;
      target of rapamycin) signaling pathway. This in turn leads to inhibition of essential&#xD;
      degradative processes of the macrophage such as autophagy and promotes release of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, macrophage function in vascular beds becomes pathogenic&#xD;
      leading to atherogenesis and cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translation of these mechanistic studies in animal models to human is the next obvious&#xD;
      step in this research. However, no studies have elucidated the mechanisms of monocyte&#xD;
      activation and function following administration of high dietary protein in humans. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a pilot study to bridge an important gap in translational research&#xD;
      which will elucidate the mechanisms by which dietary protein affects human monocyte function&#xD;
      and the risk of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Specifically, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the acute activation of mTOR signaling and downstream sequelae in circulating&#xD;
      monocytes following the administration of protein shakes. This study will address the&#xD;
      hypothesis that humans exposed to high dietary protein will have significantly higher&#xD;
      post-prandial monocyte mTOR activation with concomitant development of impaired degradative&#xD;
      capacity and a proinflammatory state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An understanding of these mechanisms has broad implications in the evaluation and future&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this can provide a valuable clinical tool for health care providers in educating&#xD;
      patients on dietary changes to ameliorate cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
