  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that combination anlotinib with toripalimab will improve&#xD;
      progression-free survival relative to historical controls in patients with Unresectable or&#xD;
      Metastatic Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-institution, open-label, single-arm Phase II study to determine the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of anlotinib in combination with Toripalimab compared with historical controls as&#xD;
      first-line treatment in patients with Unresectable or Metastatic Undifferentiated Pleomorphic&#xD;
      Sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the primary endpoint is survival outcome, progression-free survival (PFS) sample size&#xD;
      calculation is based on a single-arm survival design. The investigators will employ early&#xD;
      stopping rules for lack of efficacy, based on previously reported historical controls&#xD;
      progression-free rate at 3 months was 57% in MFH and This study predicts that as the&#xD;
      First-Line treatment of Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma, progression-free rate at 3&#xD;
      months is expected to reach more than 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with once a day dosing of anlotinib alone for the first 7 days,&#xD;
      followed by concurrent anlotinib administered once a day at 12mg orally (PO), plus&#xD;
      intravenous administration of toripalimab every 21 days. Patients will be assessed every six&#xD;
      weeks for toxicity. After the first five patients are enrolled, the investigators will assess&#xD;
      safety of the combination. If 2 or fewer patients exhibit dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the&#xD;
      investigators will then proceed with intrapatient titration of anlotinib dosing at each cycle&#xD;
      based on the presence or absence of predefined toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative studies characterizing T-cells in tumor tissue and in peripheral blood will be&#xD;
      performed at three timepoints: 1. pre-treatment, 2. on-treatment on cycle 3 day 1, and 3.&#xD;
      off-study. Additional exploratory imaging investigations, and assessment of circulating tumor&#xD;
      cells are included for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial therapy will last until withdrawal of consent, disease progression and/or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
