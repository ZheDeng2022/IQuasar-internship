  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores whether a commonly used medication called Pantoprazole can help prevent&#xD;
      delayed nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy for early breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed nausea, and occasionally vomiting, can occur after breast cancer chemotherapy,&#xD;
      affecting quality of life. A potential cause of these delayed side effects is that the&#xD;
      chemotherapy may cause stomach irritation. Pantoprazole is commonly used to treat stomach&#xD;
      irritation by reducing stomach acid, which may in turn improve nausea and/or vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing breast cancer chemotherapy before or after primary surgery will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study. They will be asked how much nausea or vomiting they have&#xD;
      with and without Pantoprazole from Day 2 until 5 after they receive chemotherapy. All&#xD;
      participants will still receive all of the usual anti-sickness medications, which are very&#xD;
      effective in preventing sickness in the first 24 hours after treatment, but not for delayed&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from the study may lead to a change in practice with patients using Pantoprazole&#xD;
      to reduce the risks of delayed nausea and vomiting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast Cancer is the most common cancer type in women in New Zealand and has the second&#xD;
      highest mortality (Ministry of Health NZ) Many women with early breast cancer still receive&#xD;
      chemotherapy, before or after surgery and delayed nausea is a particular challenge. Ensuring&#xD;
      tolerable therapy is critical to improving outcomes, by enabling patients to complete optimal&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy and to improve quality of life during therapy. Despite recent advances in&#xD;
      antiemetic regimens, recent trials showed that rates of delayed Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea&#xD;
      and Vomiting (CINV) are is in excess of 50%, with significant impacts on quality of life&#xD;
      during treatment. This suggests that different mechanisms than those targeted by centrally&#xD;
      acting anti-emetics account for such symptoms. There is strong evidence that chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens can result in gastrointestinal mucosal injury and dyspepsia. A number of studies&#xD;
      have shown chemotherapy-induced dyspepsia can be relieved by a proton pump inhibitor, but&#xD;
      none have reported their use as prophylaxis for delayed CINV, which may be a linked symptom.&#xD;
      Proton pump inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of non-malignant dyspeptic conditions&#xD;
      and are the most potent medications at reducing gastric acid secretions. They are considered&#xD;
      safe in short-term use and are commonly used in clinical practice in cancer patients as well&#xD;
      as the wider population. The pharmacokinetics Pantoprazole make it the ideal PPI for this&#xD;
      study. The experience of New Zealand Medical Oncologists is that delayed nausea is often&#xD;
      completely resolved by the delayed use of a PPI when symptoms occur. In this study we hope to&#xD;
      see a 30% difference in the rates of delayed nausea by using a drug which is readily&#xD;
      available and of very low cost. This will be the first time it has been used as preventive&#xD;
      therapy in this setting. If this benefit occurs, it would significantly improve the treatment&#xD;
      journey and may improve compliance to anti-cancer therapies.&#xD;
