  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the self-report adherence and assessment completion rates when&#xD;
      presented with a transdiagnostic, partial assessment multiple times a day when compared with&#xD;
      a monotopic, complete assessment once a day. Specifically, the investigators are testing the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the personalization of diagnostic assessment topics and timing will lead to&#xD;
      improved self-report regiment adherence rates, assessment completion rates, and total&#xD;
      assessments completed during the study period. The study does not test the efficacy of the&#xD;
      personalized assessments as a diagnostic instrument, there is no clinical decision support&#xD;
      provided to clinicians during this study, and there is no treatment provided during this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Broadly, the goal of Introspect Health is to shift clinical practice from reactively treating&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders and mental health issues once manifested to a preventative care model&#xD;
      for integrative mental health in a way that is cost-effective and scalable. One of the&#xD;
      principal areas of struggle in preventative mental health is self-report adherence and the&#xD;
      ability for primary care physicians and non-psychiatrists to perform mental health&#xD;
      surveillance with their patients. This study specifically examines the relationship between&#xD;
      individuals and a novel self-report assessment tool. To do this, the investigators are&#xD;
      performing a randomized controlled trial with two classes of users (the general public and&#xD;
      patients undergoing treatment for mental health issues) for a six week trial comparing the&#xD;
      novel self-report assessment tool to the standard of care assessment tools available to&#xD;
      clinicians. Participants will be randomized to one of the two daily assessment regiments&#xD;
      within the internet-delivered assessment tool: one that is representative of standard of care&#xD;
      monitoring and one that is personalized both in terms of content and timing based on the&#xD;
      participant's intake as well as ongoing participation. Neither the participants nor&#xD;
      researcher will be aware of which arm the individual is randomized. After using the software&#xD;
      for six weeks, the data will be analyzed specifically targeting self-adherence and assessment&#xD;
      completion metrics to evaluate the potential benefits of a transdiagnostic assessment system&#xD;
      over the standard-of-care monotopic assessment system. Assessment scoring is handled by an&#xD;
      automated scoring engine, using the rules set forth by the standards in the assessment&#xD;
      protocols. The study does not test the efficacy of the personalized assessments as a&#xD;
      diagnostic instrument, there is no clinical decision support provided to clinicians during&#xD;
      this study, and there is no treatment provided during this study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants are randomized either into a control group assigned to the standard of care diagnostic assessments once daily or into an experimental group assigned to the novel, personalized assessment system. The content of both assessment systems is the same, but the approach to delivering the assessments differs based on the arm. Each arm will have 25 participants, and any additional participants who register will be assigned to a waitlist.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>One or more times per day, participants in the Experimental Arm will be presented with a variable-length assessment based on the personalization algorithm. The assessment will include a dynamic number of questions based on personalized relevancy, engagement level, and assessment completion metrics. Questions are scored immediately upon submission, regardless of how many questions are answered. As questions are scored, the personalization algorithm takes the previous responses and response times into consideration when determining what and when to ask additional questions.</description>
