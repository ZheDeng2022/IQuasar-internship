        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female ages 40-70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
             receiving the study drug and will agree use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method or abstinence) from the time of screening to a period of 1 year&#xD;
             following completion of the drug treatment cycle. Females of childbearing potential&#xD;
             are defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized, or post-menopausal for&#xD;
             fewer than 2 years. A urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to the&#xD;
             administration of the study drug to confirm negative results. If the urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test is positive, the study drug will not be administered and the result will be&#xD;
             confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at a&#xD;
             central clinical laboratory, whereas urine pregnancy tests will be performed by&#xD;
             qualified personnel using kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the&#xD;
             duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. Monitoring&#xD;
             will include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Any SAEs associated with pregnancy will&#xD;
             be recorded. Radiographic assessment will be deferred if the patient becomes pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiographic medial and/or lateral femorotibial knee OA Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3&#xD;
             accompanied by definite joint space narrowing as agreed upon by two study&#xD;
             coinvestigators. If no agreement, a musculoskeletal radiologist not associated with&#xD;
             the study will make the final grading.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous 3 month or longer trial of one of the following conservative treatments:&#xD;
             activity modification, weight loss, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications or&#xD;
             injection therapy (e.g. cortisone, hyaluronic acid/viscosupplement).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to routinely walk without assistance (e.g. cane, walker).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically stable target knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed general physical evaluation with primary care provider within 12 months of&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fully understanding of the requirements of the study and willingness to comply with&#xD;
             the treatment plan, including fat harvesting, laboratory tests, diagnostic imaging,&#xD;
             repeated knee injections/aspirations, arthroscopic examination and follow-up visits&#xD;
             and assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Can provide written informed consent and complete HIPAA documentation after the nature&#xD;
             of the study is fully explained and prior to any study-related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects taking medications for symptomatic relief of OA under the supervision of&#xD;
             their primary caregiver, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (e.g.&#xD;
             COX-2 inhibitors) may continue to take these medications unless they are otherwise&#xD;
             excluded by the protocol and as long as the dosing has been stable for 4 weeks before&#xD;
             baseline and is anticipated to remain stable until at least 30 days following&#xD;
             completion of the subject's treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
