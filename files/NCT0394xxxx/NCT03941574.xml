  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II clinical study to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of HLX10 monotherapy for the treatment of patients with unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors who have progressed or intolerable after standard&#xD;
      therapy.This study consists of three periods, screening period (28 days), treatment period&#xD;
      and follow-up period (including safety follow-up, survival follow-up).Subjects can be&#xD;
      enrolled into this study only if they meet inclusion criteria and do not meet exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The enrolled subjects will receive an intravenous infusion of HLX10 (3 mg/kg) once&#xD;
      every 2 weeks until the loss of clinical benefit, death, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of&#xD;
      informed consent or other reasons as specified in the protocol, or up to the longest&#xD;
      treatment duration-2 years (52 dosing periods) (whichever occurs earlier).&#xD;
