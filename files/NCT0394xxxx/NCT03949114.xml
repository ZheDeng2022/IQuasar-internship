    <textblock>
      1. A questionnaire on &quot;Cognition and Attitudes of Nurses on Postoperative Deafness in&#xD;
           Neurosurgical Patients&quot; was initially formed through reference literature and expert&#xD;
           opinions. The content includes two dimensions of knowledge and attitude, all of which&#xD;
           are single-choice questions. There are 11 items in the knowledge dimension, 1 point for&#xD;
           the correct answer, 0 point for the wrong answer, and 0 to 11 points for the total&#xD;
           score. The average score is the average score and the score of the score is the average&#xD;
           score. The average score is ≤60%. Knowledge; attitude dimension is 7 items, using the&#xD;
           Likert 4 rating method, &quot;very disagree ~ very agree&quot; count &quot;1 to 4 points&quot;, total score&#xD;
           7 to 28 points. A sample questionnaire survey was conducted among non-severe unit nurses&#xD;
           in the top three hospitals in the province to understand the level of cognitive mastery&#xD;
           of the neurosurgical nurses in the province and the current status of interventions, and&#xD;
           to compare the attitudes of nurses with different academic qualifications, years of work&#xD;
           and work experience to postoperative intervention. And the level of knowledge mastery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who underwent surgery on the neurosurgery in our hospital from December 31,&#xD;
           2010 to December 31, 2019 were used as the control group. After informed notification,&#xD;
           the patients with the enrollment conditions were screened for Fried's debilitating&#xD;
           phenotype and performed. Post-routine care; patients who underwent craniotomy in our&#xD;
           department of neurosurgery from January 1, 2020 to June 31, 2020 were included in the&#xD;
           intervention. Patients who met the criteria for admission were informed and informed&#xD;
           consent was obtained. Develop an early rehabilitation process to guide patients to&#xD;
           systematic early rehabilitation training. To compare the incidence of debilitating,&#xD;
           sputum incidence (Nursing Delirium Screening Scale, Nu-DESC), sputum-related adverse&#xD;
           events, Activity of Daily Living (ADL), patient satisfaction, etc. The clinical&#xD;
           application effect of the early rehabilitation intervention system.&#xD;

      Research method: This project includes two parts of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Research object 1.1.1 Research population: 5 nurses in the top three hospitals in&#xD;
      Zhejiang Province Exclusions: training nurses, rotation nurses, and nurses who have been&#xD;
      working for &lt;1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2 Sample size: 80 people 1.2 Time: January 2019 - June 2019 1.3 Content&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Through self-designed questionnaires (see Attachment 1), the questionnaires cover the&#xD;
           general information of the respondents including gender, age, working years,&#xD;
           professional titles, academic qualifications, etc., including basic knowledge of&#xD;
           postoperative sputum, and current preventive measures , knowledge needs and other&#xD;
           aspects. The questionnaires on postoperative delirium knowledge were divided into two&#xD;
           parts: subjective and objective. It mainly includes the concept of postoperative&#xD;
           delirium, clinical manifestations, contents of nurses' evaluation form, diagnosis and&#xD;
           treatment, risk factors and hazards. For the subjective and objective knowledge points,&#xD;
           the choice is the main form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The questionnaire was distributed on the spot to 80 nurses in the top three hospitals in&#xD;
           Zhejiang Province. The knowledge dimension consisted of 11 items. The correct answer was&#xD;
           1 point, the wrong score was 0 points, and the total score was 0 to 11 points. The&#xD;
           percentage of points and full marks is taken as the average scoring rate. The average&#xD;
           scoring rate is ≤60%, which means that the nurses fail to master the relevant knowledge;&#xD;
           the attitude dimension is 7 items, and the Likert 4 level is used. &quot;Very disagree~very&#xD;
           agree&quot; ~4 points&quot;, the total score is 7 to 28 points. The important information can not&#xD;
           be filled out as a complete questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. According to the working years of less than 3 years, 4 to 10 years, more than 10 years,&#xD;
           the nursing staff can be divided into three levels: low, medium and high. The level of&#xD;
           knowledge and attitude of the nursing staff at different levels are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Method: Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 software. The measurement data&#xD;
      that conforms to the normal distribution is described by the mean value and the standard&#xD;
      deviation, and the measurement data that does not conform to the normal distribution are&#xD;
      described by the median and the interquartile range. The count data is described by a pie&#xD;
      chart or a bar chart. In the stratified analysis, the comparison of the measurement data that&#xD;
      conforms to the normal and the homogeneity of the variance is performed by t test or ANOVA.&#xD;
      The comparison of the measurement data that does not conform to the normality or the&#xD;
      homogeneity of the variance is performed by nonparametric test, and the comparison of the&#xD;
      count data is performed by chi-square test. .&#xD;
&#xD;
