      Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious postoperative complication in&#xD;
      children with congenital heart disease. In this prospective cohort study, we tested the&#xD;
      hypothesis that renal desaturation defined as a 20% decline of renal tissue oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (SrtO2) from the baseline value is associated with AKI in infants undergoing ventricular&#xD;
      septal defect (VSD) repair with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Infants aged 1 months to 12 months and scheduled to undergo VSD repair with CPB were&#xD;
      eligible. SrtO2 was monitored using a tissue near-infrared spectroscopy. Renal desaturation&#xD;
      was defined as a decrease of SrtO2 measurement from the baseline value for more than 20%&#xD;
      lasting for more than 60 s. The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI on postoperative 1-3&#xD;
      days according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes included different stages of AKI, duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      duration of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, renal replacement therapy (RRT), and&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor intraoperative and postoperative tissue&#xD;
      oxygen saturation and to investigate the correlation with postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters were monitored by Mostcare(PRAM, Vygon Health, Padua,&#xD;
      Italy) including cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, stroke volume index, the&#xD;
      maximal slope of systolic upstroke, cardiac cycle efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SrtO2 was monitored using a tissue near-infrared spectroscopy (FORE-SIGHT ELITE tissue&#xD;
      oximeter, CASMED, Branford, Connecticut, USA; now acquired by Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine,&#xD;
      California, USA). A biophotonic sensor was placed on the left flank at the level of T10-L2 to&#xD;
      monitor SrtO2. The tissue oximeter generated a new SrtO2 data every 2 seconds. All these data&#xD;
      were exported from the monitor as the end of surgery. As this is an observational study, the&#xD;
      SrtO2 data were only used for research purpose, not for clinical decision making. The&#xD;
      function of tissue oximeter was checked by a dedicated research personnel in the operating&#xD;
      room. The infant was dropped from the study if the SrtO2 measurements were not available for&#xD;
      more than 5 min during surgery. The baseline SrtO2 was defined as the median value of the&#xD;
      5-minute measurements which were measured following anesthesia induction and during the&#xD;
      period when the cardiac index ≥2.5 L/min/m2. Renal desaturation was defined as a decrease of&#xD;
      SrtO2 measurement from the baseline value for more than 20% lasting for more than 60 s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electronic data streams from the NIRS and other patient monitors will be collected into a&#xD;
      study computer. Data collection will initiate at pre-induction of anesthesia in the operating&#xD;
      room. Only the NIRS values will be blinded from clinical use. Blood samples for determining&#xD;
      biomarkers of ischemic tissue injury will be taken at defined intervals. No other&#xD;
      modifications to clinical practice will occur while conducting the study and the NIRS&#xD;
      monitoring is non-invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI within 3 days after surgery according to the&#xD;
      Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Secondary outcomes including&#xD;
      different stages of AKI, duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, duration of&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality.&#xD;

Acute kidney injury was defined as an increase in serum creatinine to ≥1.5 times baseline within 3 days after surgery. Serum creatinine was recorded within one week before surgery and on postoperative days 1-3. Serum creatinine measured within one week before surgery was defined as serum creatinine baseline.</description>

          <description>SrtO2 was monitored using a tissue near-infrared spectroscopy oximeter. A biophotonic sensor was placed on the left flank at the level of T10-L2 to monitor SrtO2. SrtO2 was measured during surgery. The baseline SrtO2 was defined as the median value of the data recorded over a 5-minute epoch when the infant was induced and mechanically ventilated and had a cardiac index ≥2.5 L/min/m2, but before skin incision.</description>

Acute kidney injury was defined as an increase in serum creatinine to ≥1.5 times baseline within 3 days after surgery. Serum creatinine was recorded within one week before surgery and on postoperative days 1-3. Serum creatinine measured within one week before surgery was defined as serum creatinine baseline.</description>
