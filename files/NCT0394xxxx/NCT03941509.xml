      The study will explore the impact of a nurse-led bundled antimicrobial stewardship&#xD;
      intervention on the appropriateness of antimicrobial use in residential aged care facilities.&#xD;
      The intervention will be assessed in a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      across 14 residential aged care facilities over an 18-month period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will explore the impact of a nurse-led bundled antimicrobial stewardship&#xD;
      intervention on the appropriateness of antimicrobial use in residential aged care facilities&#xD;
      (RACFs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antimicrobial stewardship intervention will include the following components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Education&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Focused on antimicrobial stewardship and appropriate antimicrobial use&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Delivered face-to-face, via workbooks and fact sheets to aged care staff, general&#xD;
                practitioners (GPs), pharmacists, and residents and families. Education will be&#xD;
                delivered by the research coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Aged care-specific guidelines for the assessment and antimicrobial management of&#xD;
                urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections and skin and soft tissue&#xD;
                infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Antimicrobial management recommendations including empirical oral therapy, doses&#xD;
                and duration of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Communication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation for the assessment and antimicrobial management of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nurse-led engagement with residents and families.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Newsletters and online updates to highlight evidence-based prescribing practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Audit and feedback - Surveillance and feedback to prescribers on antimicrobial use and&#xD;
           facility-level antimicrobial susceptibility data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention bundle will first be implemented and tested for feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability over a 3-month period in two RACFs in Victoria, Australia. This tailored&#xD;
      intervention will then be assessed in a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      across 12 RACFs over an 16-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cluster of two facilities will each transition through three phases over the 16 month&#xD;
      trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control phase: baseline data collection. Usual care at each facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transition phase: Delivery of education and integration of the intervention. No data&#xD;
           collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention phase: implementation of the intervention and outcome data collection.&#xD;
           Ongoing education to new and existing staff will be provided as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 16-month trial, the refined intervention bundle will be implemented nationally&#xD;
      across a network of RACFs.&#xD;
