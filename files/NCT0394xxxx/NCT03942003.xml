  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast surgery is a common surgical procedure because of the prevalence of breast cancer.&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia management in breast surgery is difficult due to the content of the&#xD;
      surgical procedure and the complex innervation of the breast. Multimodal approach is&#xD;
      recommended for postoperative analgesia. Therefore, various methods are used. There was no&#xD;
      comparison of these two blocks to control group in the literature. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators planned to investigate the postoperative pain, analgesic usage dose and side&#xD;
      effects of patients undergoing breast surgery under general anesthesia with a rhomboid area&#xD;
      block, pectoral area block.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regional methods and pharmacological treatments are among these methods. The blocks of&#xD;
      serratus, pectoral and rhomboid from the regional blocks are used more safely and with&#xD;
      increasing frequency, especially with the introduction of ultrasonography in the clinic. In&#xD;
      2016, the rhomboid intercostal nerve block was identified and presented in the literature as&#xD;
      a case report. In the rhomboid block, the analgesia created by the local anesthetic on the&#xD;
      anterior thoracic wall was used. For patients who will undergo elective breast surgery, the&#xD;
      routine routinely applied in our clinic is a multimodal approach, which involves conducting a&#xD;
      peripheral nerve block following general anesthesia induction for postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
      All patients before the block are standardized and intravenous vascular access is opened. In&#xD;
      our clinic, all peripheral blocks are performed under sterile conditions accompanied by&#xD;
      ultrasound and stimulator. When applying the Rhomboid nerve block, the patient is tilted to&#xD;
      the side position so that the corresponding breast is at the top. After T7 up to T10 sterile&#xD;
      preparation of the C7 spinous projection, the convex probe shows a rhomboid muscle at the&#xD;
      level of T5 and block is applied with 0.25% bupivacaine (20 cc), 2% lidocaine (10 cc) and 10&#xD;
      cc SF mixture. The PEC I field block is performed by administering 10 cc of local anesthetic&#xD;
      between the pectoralis minor and the major at the 2nd costal position. PEC II field block is&#xD;
      performed using linear USG probe visibly in 3rd and 4th ribs while the patient is in supine&#xD;
      position. In this block, a total of 20 cc 0.25% bupivacaine (10 cc), 2% lidocaine (5 cc) and&#xD;
      5 cc SF mixture were used to block the area between the pectoralis minor muscle and the&#xD;
      serratus muscle. Sensory block is evaluated with cold stimulus (0 = no cold sensation, 1 =&#xD;
      cold feeling severely decreased, 2 = cold feeling slightly reduced, 3 = normal cold feeling).&#xD;
      Patients undergoing breast surgery routinely undergo general anesthesia with propofol 2-3 mg&#xD;
      / kg, fentanyl 1mcq / kg, lidocaine 1 mg / kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg / kg. The postoperative&#xD;
      analgesic needs of the patients will be recorded in the patient-controlled analgesia device.&#xD;
      Postoperative pain, digital evaluation scale (NRS-numeric rating scale; 0 = absence of pain,&#xD;
      10 = unbearable pain) of all patients will be recorded.&#xD;
