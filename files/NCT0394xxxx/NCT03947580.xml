      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Description of the Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was a monocentric, open, randomized, 3-arm clinical trial that took place at the&#xD;
      Department of Orthopaedics of the Karviná Miners' Hospital (Karvinská hornická nemocnice&#xD;
      a.s.). The involvement of a maximum total number of 198 patients with chronic lumbar spine&#xD;
      pain was planned; the patients were randomly and evenly assigned to one of the 3 treatment&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use of the Dvectis Single pad;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use of the Dvectis Double pad;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use of no pad. One sequential interim analysis was planned in the middle of the clinical&#xD;
           trial and after this interim analysis, the trial was stopped early due to proven&#xD;
           efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected period of participation of each patient in the clinical trial was 6 weeks (± 5&#xD;
      days). For an overview of the individual study visits and procedures, study population and&#xD;
      other detailed information, see the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the plan, the assessment subject was asked during Visit 1 and Visit 2 about the&#xD;
      most intensive pain felt in the last 48 hours (PI). The pain was recorded by the subject in&#xD;
      the visual analogue scale (VAS) in CRF under supervision of the investigator. Then the&#xD;
      assessment subject recorded the intensity of their pain independently in the Patient Journal&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Primary Objective, Quantity and Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of using the Dvectis&#xD;
      Single pad in comparison to &quot;use of no pad&quot; in patients suffering from chronic lumbar spine&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PI was the primary quantity. The primary hypothesis was the superiority of Dvectis Single&#xD;
      based on a check, assessed based on the difference in PI (PID) between week 2 and week 6&#xD;
      (PID6).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1. Analysed Populations and Number of Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the statistical analysis, 4 populations were defined in line with the study&#xD;
      protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Population including all randomised subjects (ARS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Population of all patient with intention to treat (ITT);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Population of patients without serious deviation from the clinical trial plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each analysed population was based on a list of its members. Although the treatment group&#xD;
      could have generally been different for each patient in a different population (see the study&#xD;
      protocol and statistical analysis plan), such a case did not occur (as all the patients were&#xD;
      de facto placed in the group to which they were randomized). Therefore the real treatment&#xD;
      group is the same as the randomization treatment group for all patients. This fact is not&#xD;
      discussed further in the document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 The ARS population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included all patients who were involved in the clinical trial and randomized. The ARS&#xD;
      population was used for summaries of demographic quantities and other quantities established&#xD;
      during Visit 1 in order to describe the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 ITT Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this case, this population was identical to the ARS population. According to the plan, ITT&#xD;
      was not supposed to include those ARS patients for whom no PI data were available and those&#xD;
      patients who entered the study repeatedly. However, such circumstances were not detected. The&#xD;
      ITT population represented the primary analysed population for the assessment of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 PPS Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the statistical plan, PPS was to include all ITT patients except for patients&#xD;
      with a serious deviation from the clinical trial plan; a serious deviation includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure to meet one or multiple participation criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Error in treatment allocation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documented use of unauthorized concomitant medication or treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Missing PI0 value;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More than 25% missing PI values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious treatment regimen violation or another serious deviation from the clinical trial&#xD;
           plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitoring reports and discrepancy report implied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No study subject that has not met a participation criterion has been registered;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No study subject with incorrectly allocated treatment has been identified;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No use of unauthorized concomitant treatment has been documented;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There was no PI0 value missing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 45, 53 and 94 ended the study early; the number of PI values missing is over&#xD;
           25% (83%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following patients violated the treatment regimen in terms of non-observance of the&#xD;
           minimum time of sitting on the pad (21, 23, 35, 42, 55, 57, 60, 72, 75, 76, 84, 86, 88).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus there was a serious deviation from the protocol in 16 study subject, i.e. 15.7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PPS population represented the secondary analyzed population for the assessment of&#xD;
      efficacy. Its task was to demonstrate the robustness of the main clinical trial results. For&#xD;
      this reason, comparisons of the tested group efficacy to the control group were used (in&#xD;
      addition to ITT) in final analyses using PI in order to achieve confirmation of the main&#xD;
      clinical trial conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Safety Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the plan, the safety population should have constituted of subjects from ARS,&#xD;
      except for those with whom all contact was lost immediately after Visit 1 and those who were&#xD;
      placed (in reality) in one of the tested groups but were not given a pad.A pad was given to&#xD;
      all patients in the tested groups. All contact was lost with patients 53 and 94 and they were&#xD;
      eliminated from the safety population. Patients in the safety population were analyzed based&#xD;
      on the treatment groups they were really placed in, regardless of what group they had been&#xD;
      randomized to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6. Overview of Analysed Populations and Patient History (Numbers of subjects in treatment&#xD;
      groups and analysed populations)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dvectis Dvectis No treatment Total Single Double&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARS population 35 34 33 102 ITT population 35 34 33 102 PPS population 29 25 32 86 Safety&#xD;
      population 35 33 32 100&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Missing Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ARS population analyses, the missing data were be treated as missing according to the&#xD;
      plan, i.e. stated in summaries as total numbers of missing data; however, they were excluded&#xD;
      from the calculations of other statistics. In reality, only the time of sitting on the pad is&#xD;
      of significance. In all analyses of the PI quantities, the method of imputation of the last&#xD;
      observed value (Last Observation Carried Forward - LOCF) was used, in accordance with the&#xD;
      plan. The plans for a situation when the PI1 would be missing were not used since the&#xD;
      situation did not occur. The use of LOCF generally also leads to a bias but with regard to&#xD;
      the observed decrease in the PI values during the patient's participation in the study in the&#xD;
      tested groups, compared to the reference group, such an approach is obviously conservative.&#xD;
      For evaluation of the Oswestry questionnaire, the use of LOCF was planned primarily at the&#xD;
      level of individual questions as well as the use of the scoring manual procedure accounting&#xD;
      for missing values, if any. This procedure was beyond the data administration and statistical&#xD;
      analysis activities since the questionnaire was evaluated by the investigator, entering only&#xD;
      the total score in the patient record sheets. If the total score was missing, it was&#xD;
      processed similarly to the processing of missing values in the ARS population analysis (i.e.&#xD;
      solely elimination from the analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Sequential and Final Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first sequential analysis was performed according to the interim analysis plan and&#xD;
      resulted in early study stopping due to efficacy. A report of the first sequential analysis&#xD;
      results is included in a separate document. Then the final analysis was performed, which is&#xD;
      presented in this report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Characteristic of Study Subject and Treatment Regimen Compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the description of the study population within the sequential interim analysis, summaries&#xD;
      of demographic quantities were calculated and presented, as established before the start of&#xD;
      the treatment in the scope determined by the statistical analysis plan. The summaries were&#xD;
      presented for the respective treatment groups (for all 3 treatment groups). The significance&#xD;
      of the differences in these characteristics was not tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment regimen compliance was evaluated by a calculation of aggregate statistics for&#xD;
      the average time of the device use in the course of participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analyzed quantities, summary statistics were calculated in the respective treatment&#xD;
      groups and as a total. The analyzed ARS population was used.&#xD;
