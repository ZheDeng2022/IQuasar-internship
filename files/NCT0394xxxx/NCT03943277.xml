  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the general population, increased WBCC and neutrophil count are widely used as markers for&#xD;
      infection during inflammatory states 1. However, 32% of geriatric patients with an infection&#xD;
      do not develop an increase in WBCC 2. The hypothesis is that with inflammation, geriatric&#xD;
      patients have a misadapted response of the immune system (IS) 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our recent retrospective study 4 has shown that total and differential WBCC were not&#xD;
      correlated with infection in a geriatric hospitalized population. Therefore, WBCC does not&#xD;
      seem to be a reliable marker for infection in geriatric hospitalized patients. The&#xD;
      neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and CRP, seem to be better markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the aim of the study to investigate this hypothesis prospectively and assess the role of&#xD;
      aging and chronic diseases (such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and risk factors (CVRF) 5,&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection 6, periodontitis 7, onychomycosis 8 ) in this process and&#xD;
      assess the role of a geriatric assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the usefulness of WBCC in the diagnosis of infection in geriatric patients and to&#xD;
      address the contribution of ongoing chronic co-morbidities and age to WBCC-kinetics during an&#xD;
      acute inflammatory syndrome, young and geriatric hospitalized patients with an inflammatory&#xD;
      syndrome with and without infection will be compared&#xD;

      Study design Observational prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects Number of subjects 200 subjects: Average value CRP: group 1: 55; group 2: 84&#xD;
      Average standard deviation: 70.52 Power 80%: 158 deelnemers Power 90%: 202 deelnemers alpha =&#xD;
      0.05 2-sample T-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute inflammation is defined as a CRP ≥ 10 mg/l. We will include 2 groups of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A) A group with an inflammatory syndrome and infection; infection being defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Viral infection confirmed by nasopharynx swab for: influenza, RSV, parainfluenza,&#xD;
                rhinovirusses, coronavirusses.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Bacterial infection confirmed with positive blood culture, positive articular&#xD;
                punction, positive expectorations, pneumonia on chest radiograph, or infection&#xD;
                documented by abdominal imagery (CT or echo), a positive urine culture with a&#xD;
                confirmed pyelonephritis with a renal echography or a DMSA scintigraphy or specific&#xD;
                clinical symptoms for pyelonephritis and positive hemoculture. A positive urine&#xD;
                culture alone is not considered as urine infection because of the high prevalence&#xD;
                of asymptomatic bacteriuria in geriatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B) A group with inflammatory syndrome and inflammatory diseases without infection:&#xD;
           defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) by CT or ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Microcrystalline arthritis diagnosed by articular punction&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Crush syndrome or rhabdomyolyses defined by history of a fall and raised creatine&#xD;
                kinase in blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Immunosuppressive therapy (NSAIDs, corticosteroids, chemotherapy,&#xD;
      immunotherapy), active cancer, antibiotics before admission, hematological diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replacement of subjects None.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restrictions and prohibitions for the subjects None.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      taken at UZ Brussels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social: age, home, sex, marital status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical: smoking and alcohol habits, streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza vaccination&#xD;
           status, allergies, BMI, medical history, current treatment, reason for current&#xD;
           hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensive geriatric assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CIRS-G (Cumulative Illness Rating Score): to quantify disease burden. It rates each&#xD;
           organ system on a scale of 0 to 4, and differentiates older adults with the highest risk&#xD;
           of and severity of infection, from those with lower infection risk. 20&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Katz scale (ADL: assessment of activities of daily living): It rates 6 tasks of daily&#xD;
           living (bathing, dressing, toilet, transfer, continence and eating) on a scale from 1 to&#xD;
           4. A low score means absence of dependence, and a high score the maximum of dependence&#xD;
           for the task. 21&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MMSE (Mini Mental Status Examination): a 0-30 score of cognitive functions, &lt;24/30&#xD;
           meaning cognitive function impairment. 22 Patients with dementia:the investigators will&#xD;
           request approval to be included in the study to the family of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MUST (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool): to assess nutritional status. It divides&#xD;
           patients into 3 groups: A low risk of malnutrition (score 0). A medium risk of&#xD;
           malnutrition (score 1): then it is recommended to observe the patient for dietary&#xD;
           intake. A high risk of malnutrition (score ≥2): treat the malnutrition. 23&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire for periodontal health. The newly developed questionnaire produces a&#xD;
           reliable assessment of the individual risk of periodontitis (total score) and the need&#xD;
           for periodontal treatment as well as the differentiation between gingivits and&#xD;
           peridontitis. 24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grip strength: Inflammatory states in the elderly are also associated with a decrease in&#xD;
           muscle strength and fatigue resistance, as seen at UZ Brussels by Bautmans et al. The&#xD;
           reduced strength and fatigue resistance in geriatric patients with inflammation are&#xD;
           significantly related with the concentration of circulating CRP levels. 25 In the study,&#xD;
           the investigators will use the martin vigorimeter which is at our disposal at the&#xD;
           geriatrics ward of UZ Brussels, to measure the patients' grip strength and muscle&#xD;
           fatiguability and determine which factors seem to contribute to a decrease in muscle&#xD;
           strength (CRP, CVD, CVR, infection, periodontitis, CMV status, onychomycosis, age). the&#xD;
           investigators will use the Martin vigorimeter (Elmed, Addison, IL) to assess grip&#xD;
           strength and fatiguibility. The investigators will ask the patients to squeeze the&#xD;
           rubber bulb of the vigorimeter as hard as possible in 3 consecutive attempts, to assess&#xD;
           their grip strength. The highest score for each hand is recorded. Fatigue resistance&#xD;
           will be assessed by asking the patient to squeeze the bulb of the vigorimeter as hard as&#xD;
           possible and to maintain this pressure as long as possible; the time (seconds) until the&#xD;
           pressure diminished to half of the maximal grip strength is recorded for each hand.25 26&#xD;
           B) Collection of data from physical examination C) Clinical evaluation of onychomycosis&#xD;
           of the toenails: the investigators will perform a clinical examination of the toenails.&#xD;
           Following parameters are found to be significantly related to positive mycology results&#xD;
           in onychomycosis patients 8: scaling on one or both soles, white crumbly patches on the&#xD;
           nail surface, and an abnormal colour of the nail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Follow up of bacterial and viral culture analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational data from bacterial and viral samples during hospitatalization :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Viral infection confirmed by nasopharynx swab for: influenza, RSV, parainfluenza,&#xD;
           rhinovirusses, coronaviruses&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bacterial infection confirmed with positive blood culture, positive articular punction,&#xD;
           positive expectorations, pneumonia on chest radiograph, or infection documented by&#xD;
           abdominal imagery (CT or echo), a positive urine culture with a confirmed pyelonephritis&#xD;
           with a renal echography or a DMSA scintigraphy or specific clinical symptoms for&#xD;
           pyelonephritis and positive hemoculture. A positive urine culture alone is not&#xD;
           considered as urine infection because of the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria&#xD;
           in geriatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E) Follow up of blood analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational data from blood samples during hospitalization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 0 (at the emergency department): CRP, total and differential WBCC, renal function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1: at hospitalization, within 24h of admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Geriatric patients: CRP, total and differential WBCC, renal function, hepatic function&#xD;
           (transaminases), albumin, prealbumin, protein profile and monoclonal protein, vitamin&#xD;
           B12, folic acid, hemoglobin, hematocrit, TSH, CMV-serology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Young patients: CRP, total and differential WBCC, renal function, albumin, vitamin B12,&#xD;
           folic acid, TSH, CMV-serology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 3: CRP, total and differential WBCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 5: CRP, total and differential WBCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flowchart Questionnaires, blood samples: conducted by Hanne Maes. Supervising MD: Dr.&#xD;
      Nathalie Compté, UZ Brussels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation/blinding Observational study, not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior and concomitant therapy All medication can be continued during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study analysis Statistical analysis the investigators will perform student t-tests or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney rank sum tests to compare geriatric/young patients with and without infection.&#xD;
      To assess the contribution of age, comorbidities and geriatric syndrome in the kinetics of&#xD;
      WBCC, the investigators will perform univariate and multivariate analyses.&#xD;
