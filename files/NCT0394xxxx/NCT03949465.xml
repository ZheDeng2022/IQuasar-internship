  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a neuromodulatory technique that is&#xD;
      effective in major depression. There is preliminary evidence suggesting that rTMS is&#xD;
      effective in peripartum depression as well, however this comes from a number of very small&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to study the effectiveness of rTMS in peripartum depression. The&#xD;
      investigators will do so using an open label design in which participants will receive rTMS&#xD;
      for four weeks. The focus is on clinical improvement in depressive symptoms; however the&#xD;
      investigators will also look at other aspects such as perinatal anxiety and maternal-infant&#xD;
      bonding as measured by self-report questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripartum Depression (PPD) is common and severely disabling. Pharmacological intervention&#xD;
      remains the first line of treatment, however many patients do not experience any benefits&#xD;
      from them. Furthermore, many women are hesitant about pharmaceutical interventions due to the&#xD;
      unknown effects on foetal health and lactation. Hence novel treatment approaches are required&#xD;
      for such patients. Neuromodulation techniques involve selective targeting of brain areas&#xD;
      which are promising avenues for such depressed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an investigational and therapeutic modality that&#xD;
      impacts neurons by delivering patterned energy safely and noninvasively. In response to this&#xD;
      patterned energy, neurons fire, and adapt by changing their connection strengths. This change&#xD;
      in connection strength is believed to be the underlying mechanism whereby rTMS has&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit in conditions such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). There are&#xD;
      preliminary evidences suggesting that it is effective in PPD as well, however this comes from&#xD;
      a number of very small studies and is therefore unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the promising preliminary evidence, the investigators propose to study the&#xD;
      effectiveness of intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation rTMS (iTBS) to the left dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in treating PPD. Participants with PPD will receive iTBS rTMS for&#xD;
      four weeks (20 sessions) in an open label manner. The primary measure will be clinical&#xD;
      improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale (MADRS) with iTBS-rTMS. In addition, the investigators will look at other&#xD;
      aspects such as peripartum anxiety and maternal attachment during treatment and 8 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum.&#xD;
