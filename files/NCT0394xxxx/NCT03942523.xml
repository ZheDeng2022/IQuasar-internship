  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Poor personal hygiene and inadequate sanitation practices among young children in&#xD;
      Low Middle Income Countries such as Pakistan can lead to critical, life-threatening illnesses&#xD;
      such as respiratory infections, diarrheal disease, malnutrition and developmental delays. An&#xD;
      intervention for personal/environmental hygiene practices for primary schoolchildren will be&#xD;
      implemented at schools in urban squatter settlements of Karachi, Pakistan, aiming to improve&#xD;
      the hygiene knowledge and practices (K&amp;P) amongst primary schoolchildren and their mothers&#xD;
      (participants), while identifying facilitating and impeding factors in the adoption of&#xD;
      hygiene practices for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study will be built on quasi-experimental design with mixed methods data&#xD;
      collection approaches. To assess primary grade children and their mothers' hygiene-status,&#xD;
      K&amp;P survey will be held in the pre-intervention phase. This phase also includes qualitative&#xD;
      exploration of mothers' and teachers' perceptions about children's hygiene literacy, factors&#xD;
      facilitating and impeding the adoption of the same among school children, for which in-depth&#xD;
      guides and focus group discussion tools will be used with teachers and mothers respectively.&#xD;
      School physical environmental assessment will be carried out pre-post intervention. This will&#xD;
      be followed by multi-component intervention phase with behavior change strategies to improve&#xD;
      children's and mothers' hygiene K&amp;P. The post-intervention phase will assess the intervention&#xD;
      effectiveness in terms of enhancing hygiene K&amp;P among schoolchildren and mothers, alongside&#xD;
      exploration of mothers and teachers' insights into whether or not the intervention has&#xD;
      brought changes in improving hygiene practices among children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Paired T-test will be done pre-post intervention to measure the differences in&#xD;
      knowledge and practice scores between mothers' hygiene literacy and practices with their&#xD;
      child's knowledge and practices. Similar test will also be run to assess the differences in&#xD;
      children' hygiene knowledge and practice scores pre and post intervention. Thematic analysis&#xD;
      will be used for qualitative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Multi-component intervention aimed at improving personal and environmental&#xD;
      hygiene among primary school children offers an opportunity to design and test various&#xD;
      behavioral change strategies at school and home setting. The study findings will be&#xD;
      significant in assessing the intervention effectiveness in improving children's overall&#xD;
      hygiene.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, communicable diseases are prevalent among school age children and the exposure to&#xD;
      variety of pathogens causing preventable diseases in school population is inevitable.&#xD;
      Underlying factors mainly rests on poor personal hygiene and inadequate sanitation practices&#xD;
      leading to school absenteeism and life threatening illnesses among children (if continually&#xD;
      neglected in the long run). The situation is worse in low and middle income countries due to&#xD;
      inadequate health care facilities leading to compromised health status of school children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among communicable diseases, respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases are regarded as&#xD;
      the deadliest killers of young children. Incidence of diarrheal disease in the initial years&#xD;
      has been linked with impaired cognitive performance in the later childhood. In addition, in&#xD;
      developing countries intestinal helminthic infection is a commonly cited problem among&#xD;
      school-age children. Furthermore, oral health cavity infections are also commonly found in&#xD;
      school going children worldwide. Frequent attacks of infection predispose young children to&#xD;
      malnutrition and can form a vicious circle and retard children's physical and cognitive&#xD;
      development. Moreover, the contextual factors such as poor socio-economic environment further&#xD;
      deteriorate the health status of school children especially in low and middle income&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Pakistani context, alongside pneumonia and diarrhea worm infestation and scabies among&#xD;
      school age children are the commonly reported health issues; manifesting poor personal&#xD;
      hygiene. An evaluation study on water, sanitation and hygiene intervention on school child&#xD;
      performance in two cities showed that almost 48% of government school children avoid going to&#xD;
      school toilets due to poor sanitary condition. In local context, studies are mostly focused&#xD;
      on oral hygiene assessment among children, showing satisfactory knowledge about using tooth&#xD;
      paste. Comprehensive assessment about personal and environmental hygiene assessment among&#xD;
      children, teachers and parents has remained a gap. Poor knowledge and practice of, and&#xD;
      attitudes to personal hygiene have negative consequences on their long term development. This&#xD;
      necessitates the designing and testing of school-based interventions aiming to improve&#xD;
      hygiene behaviors among children, thereby minimizing their potential to capture preventable&#xD;
      illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unfortunate that school health remains a neglected aspect of public health in Pakistan.&#xD;
      In 2005, School Health Program was launched in 17 districts of the country by Ministry of&#xD;
      Education, Pakistan in collaboration with United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural&#xD;
      Organization (UNESCO). The program focused on various components including personal hygiene&#xD;
      and environmental education but its impact was not determined . To the best of our knowledge,&#xD;
      there is paucity of studies in Pakistan on school-based interventions to promote personal and&#xD;
      environmental hygiene of school children, with child's parents and teachers' involvement.&#xD;
      Towards designing school based programs, role of parents and teachers must be considered as&#xD;
      they are the important role models for school going age children. And thus had detrimental&#xD;
      effects in shaping children's overall health and hygiene behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this paper, Investigators present a study protocol using mixed-methods study design to be&#xD;
      implemented in schools of a peri-urban community setting, Pakistan. The proposed study aims&#xD;
      to improve the knowledge and practices of school children towards personal and environmental&#xD;
      hygiene through school based intervention. To our knowledge, holistic assessment of hygiene&#xD;
      among school children has not been studied in the local context. And the intervention to be&#xD;
      implemented (with behavior change communication using adult to child and child to child&#xD;
      approach, assessment of education curriculum on hygiene concepts) has never been studied&#xD;
      before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does school-based hygiene intervention facilitate improvement in knowledge and practices&#xD;
           among primary school children studying in semi urban schools, Pakistan?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the enablers and barriers towards the adoption of personal and environmental&#xD;
           hygiene practices by school children?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions Does improvement in knowledge and practices among the mothers of&#xD;
      primary school children studying in semi-urban schools contributes to improved knowledge and&#xD;
      practices of school children?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design The study will employ a quasi-experimental design (pre-post intervention&#xD;
      without control arm). The proposed study design is chosen as it will facilitate in evaluating&#xD;
      school based interventions in the selected school settings without randomization. Similar to&#xD;
      the randomized trials, quasi-experiments (community based trial) aims to demonstrate&#xD;
      causality between an intervention and an outcome at the defined interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study settings The study will be conducted in District Malir, Gaddap town in Karachi,&#xD;
      Pakistan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection methods The study is built on mixed method data collection approaches to gain&#xD;
      insight of the hygiene literacy and practices among school children, teachers and child's&#xD;
      mothers. Table 1 lists different data collection methods with its purpose and interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study phases The study has been structured into 3 phases - pre-intervention, intervention and&#xD;
      post-intervention.&#xD;
