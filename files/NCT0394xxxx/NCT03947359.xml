  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to deliver scientific data regarding the accuracy of the two different-sized&#xD;
      Fibroscan® probes on patients with different thoracic diameter to gain more knowledge of the&#xD;
      handling and measuring quality of the Fibroscan® as a diagnostic device and also to see if&#xD;
      one probe is enough to measure a wider spectrum of patients leading to cost reduction for&#xD;
      equipment such as additional probes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore the study aims to analyze the effect of food intake on liver-stiffness&#xD;
      measurements with the S-probe on children to shorten fasting periods. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      the fasting periods before a Fibroscan® measurement may be shortened, which is of special&#xD;
      importance in smaller children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Fibroscan® (Echosens, France) is an ultrasound-based, non-invasive and non-painful&#xD;
      diagnostic device which also has no complications and can be repeated easily to measure&#xD;
      liver-stiffness by transient elastography. The company's device was first released and put on&#xD;
      the market in 2003. The device can measure liver stiffness and liver fat content (controlled&#xD;
      attenuation parameter CAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is used for the identification and graduation of liver pathologies such as fibrosis and&#xD;
      cirrhosis and it can be used on adults and children alike. Therefore patients with chronic&#xD;
      liver diseases such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease as well as metabolic&#xD;
      steatohepatitis and different biliary diseases can be examined with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the standard procedure for grading fibrosis and cirrhosis still is the liver&#xD;
      biopsy, however studies have compared the two procedures in context with different liver&#xD;
      conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or hepatitis C and partially demonstrated&#xD;
      that in terms of measuring liver-stiffness the Fibroscan® can rival the liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usually the Fibroscan® measurements are performed using different probes that vary in&#xD;
      frequency and penetration depth depending on the thoracic diameter of the patient. These&#xD;
      probes are then applied in an intercostal space on the right side on the level of the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The company Echosens that is producing the currently used model of the Fibroscan® alongside&#xD;
      its different-sized probes claims that their S-sized probe is to be used for patients with a&#xD;
      thoracic diameter below 75 cm and that their M-sized probe for patients above 75 cm diameter&#xD;
      because otherwise the results would not be accurate. The company claims that using the&#xD;
      M-sized probe on a patient with a thoracic diameter below 75 cm would cause wrong&#xD;
      measurements. However, there is no data or studies that actually have compared the S- and the&#xD;
      M- probe to each other and therefore the accuracy of the statement from Echosens is&#xD;
      scientifically yet to be confirmed. So far only data on comparison of the M and XL-probe have&#xD;
      been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, food intake seems to impact on Fibroscan® -measurements. It has been already&#xD;
      proven in past studies that food intake indeed has an effect on liver-stiffness and therefore&#xD;
      influences the quality of Fibroscan® -measurements. All these studies revealed that it is the&#xD;
      best to measure the patients while in a fasting condition for several hours. However, these&#xD;
      studies all were performed on adults with different kinds of liver-diseases using the&#xD;
      M-probe. So far, no data on the impact of food intake on measurements with the S-probe have&#xD;
      been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since it is to be expected that because of its attributes transient elastography will gain&#xD;
      even more importance as a diagnostic device in the future, it is very significant to produce&#xD;
      as much of valid data as possible.&#xD;
