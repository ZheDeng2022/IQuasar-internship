      This study is a qualitative anthropological research that explores the effects of&#xD;
      Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) for people with moderate and severe dementia living in a care&#xD;
      facility. In particular, the study explores the effects that AAT can have on people with&#xD;
      moderate and later stages of dementia, living in a care facility, on: Behavioural and&#xD;
      Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD); mood (depression); quality of life; activity&#xD;
      (physical). The AAT effects on people with moderate and later stages of dementia will be&#xD;
      compared with effects that other activities provided in the care facility where participants&#xD;
      live, may have on the same participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not test hypotheses.&#xD;

      This study is a qualitative anthropological research that explores the effects of&#xD;
      Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) for people with moderate and severe dementia living in a care&#xD;
      facility. In particular, the study explores the effects that AAT can have on people with&#xD;
      moderate and later stages of dementia, living in a care facility, on: Behavioural and&#xD;
      Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD); mood (depression); quality of life; activity&#xD;
      (physical). The AAT effects on people with moderate and later stages of dementia will be&#xD;
      compared with effects that other activities provided in the care facility where participants&#xD;
      live, may have on the same participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AAT is defined as an activity provided by a handler and his/her animal (e.g., dog, cat,&#xD;
      rabbit, bird, horse) for somebody living with a certain medical condition/illness. AAT is&#xD;
      different than Assistant Dogs/Animal (e.g., guide dogs for the blind), who have a very&#xD;
      specific training. In this research, we will focus mostly on therapy-dogs and therapy-owls&#xD;
      for people with dementia living in care homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted over a period of 12 months. The primary methods that will be&#xD;
      used are participant observation (accompanying and observing volunteers during&#xD;
      animal-assisted therapy meetings and various activities in the care homes) and interviewing&#xD;
      the residents, care homes' staff, volunteers, canine trainers and veterinarians. Additional&#xD;
      data will be collected through document analysis (consulting care home policies and&#xD;
      participants' care plans and medical notes) and auto-ethnography (auto-observations of&#xD;
      interactions between the student and 2 dogs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instruments described in the outcome measures are used as guidance only. As this research&#xD;
      is non-quantitative, the items listed in the scale instruments are not administered like in a&#xD;
      usual clinical testing. The specificity of anthropological research, especially in regard to&#xD;
      the use of its methods (participant observation, triangulated with in-depth interview,&#xD;
      document analysis and auto-ethnography) addresses implicitly the limitations of such&#xD;
      instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the focus of the research remains on the interactions between people with dementia and&#xD;
      therapy-animals, the involvement of the other participants offers different perspectives of&#xD;
      looking at these interactions and at their context. For anthropological research, it is&#xD;
      fundamental that a certain topic/issue is addressed in its context by gathering information&#xD;
      from multiple perspectives. This has been documented as being one of the biggest strengths of&#xD;
      anthropological research investigating a clinical-related topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to understand what are the effects that therapy-animals can have&#xD;
      on people living with dementia (in moderate and severe stages) in a care facility. While it&#xD;
      doesn't aim to compare people living with dementia in their own homes and their potential&#xD;
      interaction with a therapy-animal, the research compares the effects of AAT with other&#xD;
      activities (e.g., music therapy; craft therapy) and in the context of human interactions&#xD;
      (e.g., interactions with other residents; care facility staff members; family members).&#xD;
      Because it is documented that animals' therapeutic effects are possible through bond&#xD;
      transference, the research also looks as part of the context at how the human-animal bond is&#xD;
      formed, how can be transferred and how participants may develop a bond with the&#xD;
      therapy-animal. This will be done by interviewing therapy-animal volunteers; canine trainers;&#xD;
      and veterinarians. While these might appear as two different projects, we argue that this&#xD;
      perspective (how the human-animal bond is formed and its potential therapeutic effect in&#xD;
      being transferred) can offer new and original insights in understanding dementia and its&#xD;
      stages, as well as a more accurate understanding of AAT effects on people with moderate and&#xD;
      severe dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the benefits of Animal-Assisted Therapy have been previously documented, these were&#xD;
      mostly statistical or experimental studies. To date, there is no study that explores the&#xD;
      relationship between therapy-animals and people with dementia using a long-term qualitative&#xD;
      approach. Almost all the studies consulted in preparation for our protocol recommend a&#xD;
      research that approaches AAT for people with dementia in the context of social interactions&#xD;
      and living conditions and from the perspectives described by us. The lack of the context and&#xD;
      of these perspectives have been documented/acknowledged as limitations of previous studies in&#xD;
      understanding the effects of AAT for people with dementia. These limitations are addressed in&#xD;
      our study by looking at them from the diversity of the perspectives we propose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the increased number of people living with dementia, the moral imperative of offering&#xD;
      them activities that enhance their quality of life especially in later stages, as well as the&#xD;
      rising literature documenting the benefits of companion animals, we aim that this research to&#xD;
      contribute to new approaches and policies of care for people with moderate and severe&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;
