  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and its incidence has doubled every 20 years in&#xD;
      France, where this cancer is responsible of more than 1600 deaths each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with early diagnosis have good prognosis and can be generally cured by surgery only.&#xD;
      Advanced melanoma however has a very bad prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loco-regional lymph nodes are usually the first distant localization in metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
      Lymph node dissection is then the recommended treatment, although it's impact on survival has&#xD;
      never been proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the same way, the benefit risk profile of interferon as adjuvant treatment after lymph&#xD;
      node dissection is still much debated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, new treatments either with immunotherapy (ipilimumab, nivolumab) or by the targeted&#xD;
      therapy dabrafenib/trametinib in patients with BRAF mutation have shown an impact on survival&#xD;
      in the adjuvant setting after lymph node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But, it has not yet been established if this strategy has a benefit gain compared to starting&#xD;
      those treatments only in the metastatic setting after watchful follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, if these novel therapies (targeted therapies: TT, immunotherapies : IT)&#xD;
      demonstrated for the first time a real benefit in terms of survival or of responses rates in&#xD;
      melanoma, physicians and patients had to address new problems, such as the management of&#xD;
      unusual adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial and dissociated responses can also be seen with those new treatments. Some patients&#xD;
      will have complete response in some lesions, stabilization in others and progression in a&#xD;
      few. It is to be expected that one of the real key points of this therapy is to be found&#xD;
      here, as this situation is commonly seen, and it would probably be a poor choice to stop a&#xD;
      treatment that is globally effective for progression of only 1 or 2 lesions, in a patient&#xD;
      otherwise stabilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That is the context in which interventional radiology (IR) should be considered as an&#xD;
      extremely efficient option. IR is a real medical revolution in the last 2 decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It provides not only the opportunity to determine the characteristics of residual lesion&#xD;
      (fibrosis, necrosis, metastasis, or sarcoidosis,…) by biopsy, but allows also their targeted&#xD;
      destruction through different technics (cryotherapy, radiofrequency, laser,…).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are fortunate to have in their institution one of the best IR department of&#xD;
      the world (headed by Prof. Afshin GANGI), with a technical platform unique in Europe that&#xD;
      allows IR through ultrasound, scan, petscan and MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of their knowledge, Immunotherapy associated with IR has not been performed so&#xD;
      far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This association could in theory:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Combine immunotherapy with tumoral necrosis, which inherently increases the effects of&#xD;
           immunotherapy by massive tumoral leakage of danger signals and tumoral antigens;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Allow direct injection in targeted zones, where the beneficial effect is desired, and&#xD;
           thus increase the expected immune response;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reduce side effects related to immunotherapy, by reducing quantities injected; which&#xD;
           seems particularly important in the (neo)-adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That's why the investigators are willing to conduct this pilot project, the objectives of&#xD;
      which are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Providing a proof of the feasibility of this association,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtaining preliminary insights on the effects on non-targeted lesions,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adding a translational research to establish the effect on tumor antigenic expression&#xD;
           and the immune response.&#xD;
