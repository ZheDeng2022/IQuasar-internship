      This study will 1) Evaluate the prevalence of elevated (conditional or abnormal) transcranial&#xD;
      Doppler (TCD) velocities in a cross-sectional analysis of children with Sickle Cell Anemia&#xD;
      (SCA) living in Tanzania; 2) Obtain longitudinal data on TCD velocities in this population;&#xD;
      and 3) Measure the effects of hydroxyurea therapy on TCD velocities and associated primary&#xD;
      stroke risk.&#xD;

      Stroke Prevention with Hydroxyurea Enabled through Research and Education (SPHERE) is a&#xD;
      single-center prospective phase 2 pilot study. It will enroll a convenience sample of&#xD;
      children with SCA, obtain cross-sectional baseline data at enrolment, and follow them as a&#xD;
      prospective cohort for a period of 24 months. The cohort will be divided into two arms based&#xD;
      on the initial screening TCD result: 1) those who have a normal (less than 170 cm/sec time&#xD;
      averaged mean velocity (TAMV)) initial screening TCD and will be an observation/control&#xD;
      cohort; and 2) those who have an elevated initial screening TCD (either conditional (170-199&#xD;
      cm/sec) or abnormal (greater than or equal to 200 cm/sec) TAMV) and will be a treatment&#xD;
      cohort that receives open-label hydroxyurea therapy as per the dosing and administration&#xD;
      schedule. Those who are found to have a normal TCD at enrolment and are part of the&#xD;
      observation/control cohort will undergo repeat TCD 12 months after enrolment. If the TCD at&#xD;
      12 months has changed to an elevated velocity (conditional or abnormal), the study&#xD;
      participant can begin study treatment, but will not be included in the primary endpoint&#xD;
      analysis. The primary hypothesis is after 12 months of hydroxyurea therapy, children with&#xD;
      conditional TCD velocities will achieve a mean decrease of &gt;15cm/sec from their baseline TCD&#xD;
      TAMV.&#xD;
