  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were initially RAS wild and failed at least 2&#xD;
      lines of chemotherapy will be enrolled. Anti-EGFR must have been given in 1st line. Those who&#xD;
      remain RAS-wild upon retesting will receive rechallenge with panitumumab and chemotherapy&#xD;

      This is a single arm pilot multicenter prospective study. We will recruit KRAS/RAS wild&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer patients who received at least 2 lines of chemotherapy and the&#xD;
      1st line must include cetuximab/panitumumab combined with chemotherapy. We will repeat RAS&#xD;
      testing after progression on the last line of therapy. RAS testing will be taken via liquid&#xD;
      biopsy using ctDNA or tissue biopsy from either a new tumour lesion or a previously present&#xD;
      lesion which shows evidence of disease progression by radiological imaging. Only RAS-wild&#xD;
      patients upon re-testing will be enrolled and will receive re-challenge therapy with&#xD;
      panitumumab combined with chemotherapy similar to that given at 1st line&#xD;
      (5-fluorouracil/leucoverin combined with oxaliplatin or irinotecan). Those converted to RAS&#xD;
      mutant will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
