      This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of using a Standardized Home Spirometry&#xD;
      (SHS) Method to develop normal range values, to detect a variance (i.e., a value outside of&#xD;
      that normal range), to evaluate a variance with a questionnaire, and to download all data in&#xD;
      normal volunteers prior to evaluation and use on a larger scale for lung transplant&#xD;
      recipients. The Standardized Home Spirometry (SHS) Method consists of a FDA-approved&#xD;
      Bluetooth Spirometry unit, FDA approved Bluetooth Pulse Oximeter and an Android-based Tablet&#xD;
      which is embedded with an investigational Home Spirometry Mobile Medical Software Application&#xD;
      for data and symptom survey collection and transmission over secure WiFi or cellular&#xD;
      connectivity in HIPAA compliant fashion (labeled only with a date/time and machine ID stamp)&#xD;
      to an associated investigational IT Server Dashboard at the Central Monitoring Institute&#xD;
      Server at Washington University in St. Louis.&#xD;

      Study Objective: This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of use of a Standardized&#xD;
      Home Spirometry(SHS) Method using a Home Spirometry Monitoring Kit consisting of FDA-approved&#xD;
      Blue-tooth Spirometry unit, Blue-tooth pulse oximeter and an Android-based Tablet with an&#xD;
      embedded investigational home spirometry mobile medical software application for data and&#xD;
      symptom survey collection and transmission over secure WiFi or cellular data transmission&#xD;
      portal in HIPAA compliant fashion to an associated investigational IT dashboard application&#xD;
      at the Central Monitoring Institute (CMI) Server at Washington University in St. Louis, to&#xD;
      develop normal range values, to detect a variance (i.e., a value outside of that normal&#xD;
      range), to evaluate a variance with a questionnaire, and to download all data to the CMI in a&#xD;
      small pilot of healthy volunteers prior to evaluation and use on a larger scale for lung&#xD;
      transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational IT application will monitor lung function but do nothing more than&#xD;
      collect data. It will adjust monitoring frequency and trigger physician review of home&#xD;
      spirometry results at a more frequent interval but will not be directly involved in decisions&#xD;
      regarding diagnosis or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Type: Non-randomized, single-arm, prospective cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Home Spirometry Monitoring System will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FDA approved Blue tooth Spirometry unit&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FDA approved pulse oximeter&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An Android-based tablet with embedded investigational mobile medical software&#xD;
                application for symptom survey/data collection and data processing and transmission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WiFi or cellular connectivity to be used for data transmission and communication between&#xD;
           an Android Pad and an associated Investigational server dashboard application at the&#xD;
           Central Monitoring Institute&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal Volunteer Monitoring Data is sent in a HIPAA compliant fashion (data with&#xD;
           date/time stamp and device ID only) to a Central Monitoring Institute (CMI) server&#xD;
           maintained at Washington University in St. Louis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will undergo training to activate and use the Home Spirometry Monitoring&#xD;
           System.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data evaluation by a pulmonologist within CMI:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Trend analysis on a monthly basis and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  When a variance is detected with or without potentially associated symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A monthly summary report&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may undergo one Laboratory-based Spirometry Test (if practicable) and&#xD;
           perform a test session using the standardized home spirometry method system at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation may last up to one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized Home Spirometry testing interval at least weekly with an initial testing period&#xD;
      of greater frequency to enable normal range calibration. Volunteers will require initial in&#xD;
      center or remote training with the Standardized home spirometry method &amp; performance of&#xD;
      baseline home spirometry method testing and a (baseline) laboratory-based spirometry test (if&#xD;
      practicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Surveillance Phase: Daily home spirometry method measurements for 4 to 10 weeks to enable&#xD;
      normal range calibration. Volunteers who have either a statistically significant (p-value&#xD;
      &lt;0.01) rate of change in FEV1 or a change in FEV1 rate of decline that exceeds an absolute&#xD;
      value (+/-) of 30 mL/month using home spirometry based FEV1 values obtained during the normal&#xD;
      range development period are not eligible to advance to the Surveillance Phase and may be&#xD;
      discontinued from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance Phase: At least weekly home spirometry method measurements for two to ten months&#xD;
      of participation. An FEV-1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second) variance is defined as an&#xD;
      FEV-1 value that is outside the 95% CI (Confidence Interval) of the participant's normal&#xD;
      FEV-1 reference range that was determined immediately after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an FEV-1 variance is detected by the Android Pad, the IT application automatically&#xD;
      requests that the participant complete a symptom survey. This information when used in&#xD;
      combination with other data will result in initiation of the following actions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an FEV-1 variance is categorized as being suspicious for acute medical illness by the CMI&#xD;
      (i.e., with clinical symptoms consistent with upper or lower respiratory infection/CHF), the&#xD;
      spirometry data and participant survey responses will trigger overview by the CMI laboratory&#xD;
      staff and if deemed suspicious for acute medical illness results will be made accessible to&#xD;
      the participant's designated health professionals. If critical values or clinical symptoms&#xD;
      are obtained consistent with urgent compromise (e.g., evidence of hypoxemia or respiratory&#xD;
      distress), the CMI (PFT (Pulmonary Function Testing) Laboratory staff pulmonologist) will&#xD;
      make timely attempts to reach the participant or participant's health professionals. In this&#xD;
      study, this is expected to be an exceedingly rare occurrence, and most likely would not occur&#xD;
      at all. If acute medical illness has been ruled in, participant spirometry surveillance will&#xD;
      be reinitiated after an appropriate period of treatment, which will be determined by the&#xD;
      participant's managing physician who will notify CMI when the participant has recovered from&#xD;
      their acute illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variance not suspicious for acute medical illness with no apparent clinical symptoms&#xD;
      consistent with infection/CHF: if supplemental questionnaire or clinical data is not&#xD;
      consistent with an acute medical illness, the following actions will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistence Evaluation: Participants will be directed to obtain daily spirometric&#xD;
      measurements along with repeated completion of the questionnaire for a total of 4 consecutive&#xD;
      days CMI Pulmonology Review: Consistently low Spirometry values (persistence) will prompt&#xD;
      early review of these values along with previous Spirometry history by CMI pulmonology staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random Symptom Surveys may also generate (in the absence of a variance) however only Symptom&#xD;
      Surveys prompted by Variances will result in further action as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first two months (approximately) of Surveillance, Volunteers will be directed to&#xD;
      intentionally induce variances, symptoms, incomplete connections/testing/survey, etc., in&#xD;
      order to fully test and assess the functionality of the Mobile Medical Software neural&#xD;
      pathways (IT app and Dashboard server) as directed by the study team. Volunteers will&#xD;
      document test on a test log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA issued a non-significant risk (NSR) device study letter on 12/3/2018 for the Home&#xD;
      Spirometry Mobile Medical Software.&#xD;
