  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cluster headache is a primary headache condition characterized by clusters of one-sided,&#xD;
      high-intensity pain attacks. The headache may be episodic or chronic. Treatment options are&#xD;
      limited and their effects unsatisfactory. An important nerve pathway involved in the pain&#xD;
      attacks has a switching station at the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) located in the depth of&#xD;
      the facial bones. SPG is a known therapy target for cluster headache. The area can be&#xD;
      identified on CT images, but is difficult to access due to its location. Thus, the Multiguide&#xD;
      navigation system has been developed to enable precise delivery of the drugs that target SPG&#xD;
      activity. In Trondheim, two phase 1 / Phase 2 study have been carried out using botulinum&#xD;
      toxin A (Botox®) against SPG in patient with chronic cluster headache and chronic migraine.&#xD;
      The results indicate that such a treatment strategy is safe and beneficial. The current study&#xD;
      is a randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blinded study to investigate whether precise&#xD;
      single-injection of botulinum toxin A reduces the frequency of attacks in chronic cluster&#xD;
      headache .&#xD;
