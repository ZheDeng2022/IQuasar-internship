  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Farming for Life aims to determine the health impacts of providing weekly &quot;prescriptions&quot; of&#xD;
      fresh organic vegetables to adults living with or at risk of type 2 diabetes. Over 4 years,&#xD;
      up to 400 adults diagnosed with or at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes will be engaged&#xD;
      for 3 months each, and receive weekly doses of locally-grown organic vegetable prescriptions.&#xD;
      The end-points for comparison will be changes in blood pressure, weight, waist circumference,&#xD;
      glycemic control [defined as Time in Range (TIR) (70-140mg/dl)] using continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring (CGM), and HbA1c levels (a measure of long-term blood glucose level control) after&#xD;
      3 months compared to baseline measurements. Additional assessments will be made on the impact&#xD;
      of the organic vegetable prescriptions on food security. At an optional Visit 13, offered 6&#xD;
      months after Visit 1, an additional health screening will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence and risk of type 2 diabetes in the US is disproportionately high among low income&#xD;
      and minority groups and is exasperated by high levels of food insecurity. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that improving access to fresh organic vegetables will result in measurable&#xD;
      health outcomes for adults with type 2 diabetes and those at risk of developing the&#xD;
      condition. This represents a promising and potentially cost-effective strategy for improving&#xD;
      diabetes outcomes at a population level, particularly among low income, minority populations&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Farming for Life will recruit adults with or at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (non-insulin treated). Because diabetes rates are disproportionately high in low income and&#xD;
      minority populations, the investigators expect that many participants will be members of&#xD;
      these groups. After obtaining written consent, participants will receive 10 weekly free&#xD;
      &quot;prescriptions&quot; of fresh organic vegetables sourced from local growers. Health measurements&#xD;
      will be conducted by trained clinical staff at baseline and upon completion of the&#xD;
      intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration for the program is approximately 4 years, in which up to 400 participants&#xD;
      may be engaged. Program visits will take place at vegetable distribution centers and clinical&#xD;
      locations (SDRI or other clinical sites). SDRI will ensure provision of appropriately trained&#xD;
      clinical staff and equipment to obtain accurate clinical measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be recruited via bilingual outreach materials. Up to 440&#xD;
      individuals will be enrolled for an anticipated 400 individuals completing the program (8%&#xD;
      anticipated dropout rate). A subset of approximately 120 participants will use CGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible and consented participants in this program will be asked to complete 12 visits, with&#xD;
      an optional 13th visit. Over the course of these visits, participants will collect 10 weekly&#xD;
      organic vegetable prescriptions that are signed by a qualified medical practitioner, as well&#xD;
      as complete health screenings and questionnaires during the first and last visits. For those&#xD;
      using CGM, data will be collected by study staff at an additional Visit 3b, concluding the&#xD;
      first 14 days of participation, and at Visit 12, concluding the final 14 days of&#xD;
      participation. At each prescription pick-up visit, each participant will receive a week's&#xD;
      &quot;dose&quot; of organic vegetables. The outcome data will be collected at Visit 1 after obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent and at Visit 12 after the completion of 10 weeks of prescriptions.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be invited to submit via cell phone, photographs of meals&#xD;
      featuring their prescribed organic vegetables. At an optional Visit 13, offered 6 months&#xD;
      after Visit 1, an additional health screening will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may receive nutrition education in the form of printed material featuring&#xD;
      organic vegetable recipes and nutrition guidance offered at vegetable collection sites.&#xD;
      Recipes will be sourced from the American Diabetes Association Diabetes Food Hub website&#xD;
      (www.diabetesfoodhub.org). Aside from the weekly supply of organic vegetables allocated by&#xD;
      prescription, health measurements, and printed nutrition education materials, there will be&#xD;
      no compensation nor other incentives for program participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Unity Shoppe in Santa Barbara (http://www.unityshoppe.org/) hosted Farming for Life in a&#xD;
      pilot and will be a storage and distribution site. If necessary, additional&#xD;
      appropriately-equipped, Independent Review Board (IRB) approved sites may be used. Visits 1,&#xD;
      12, and 13 will occur at SDRI and, if necessary, additional appropriately-equipped, IRB&#xD;
      approved clinical sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The organic vegetables for this program will primarily be sourced and purchased wholesale&#xD;
      from two or more farms within 100 miles of the vegetable distribution location/s. Organic&#xD;
      vegetables received for prescription distribution will be coded and tracked through an&#xD;
      inventory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 begins with screening and enrollment via the initiation of the informed consent&#xD;
      process. Participant eligibility will be confirmed following review of the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria by program staff. Each participant will be provided with oral and written&#xD;
      information (English and/or Spanish, as appropriate) describing the nature and duration of&#xD;
      the program. Prior to initiation of program-related procedures, the participant will sign and&#xD;
      date the written informed consent and authorization form, authorizing the use and disclosure&#xD;
      of the participant's protected health information (PHI). The participant will also sign the&#xD;
      California Experimental Subject's Bill of Rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled via informed consent, participants will first complete questionnaires on&#xD;
      diabetes management, food security and health. Then participant height, weight, blood&#xD;
      pressure and waist circumference will be measured. HbA1c level will be measured via&#xD;
      finger-stick. A subset of up to 120 participants will then be trained to wear CGM sensors&#xD;
      under supervision of staff. Participants will be informed that the CGM data will be blinded&#xD;
      during each CGM session. The CGM data for each participant who may wear a CGM sensor will be&#xD;
      summarized using software which produces both a statistical and graphic display of data.&#xD;
      Participants will then receive a prescription for 10 weeks of organic vegetables. Finally,&#xD;
      participants will be invited to share photographs of and recipes for meals they prepare with&#xD;
      their prescribed organic vegetables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2-11 will all follow the same format and will include the fulfillment of weekly&#xD;
      prescriptions. The types and quantities of organic vegetables distributed to each participant&#xD;
      will be tracked. For those using CGM, during visit 3 the CGM sensor will be removed, and&#xD;
      during visit 10 a CGM sensor will be inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Visit 12, clinical measurements will be taken and recorded as in Visit 1. For those&#xD;
      using CGM, the CGM sensor will be removed and data will be downloaded from the recorder.&#xD;
      After these measurements, participants will complete questionnaires on diet, food security,&#xD;
      and health as they did in Visit 1. Participants will also complete an Exit Questionnaire to&#xD;
      gauge satisfaction with and experience participating in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At an optional Visit 13, offered 6 months after Visit 1, an additional health screening will&#xD;
      be conducted.&#xD;
