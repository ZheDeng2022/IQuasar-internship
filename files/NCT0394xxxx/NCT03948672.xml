      The purpose of this study is to determine if use of the CleanHands system can improve hand&#xD;
      hygiene/personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance and reduce infections in the hospital&#xD;
      ICUs through reminders to wash hands and use PPE as appropriate.&#xD;

      Experimental design: The investigators plan to perform a randomized cross-over study at&#xD;
      University of Louisville Hospital (ULH) ICUs from July 2019 to June 2020. The study will be&#xD;
      submitted to the University of Louisville IRB for approval before any study activities are&#xD;
      started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance Site: University of Louisville Hospital. The ICU departments will be randomized&#xD;
      to participate in either one of the two research arms: control-then-intervention arm or&#xD;
      intervention-then-control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: All nurses, attending physicians, resident physicians, housecleaning staff,&#xD;
      medical assistants, respiratory therapists, laboratory personnel (lab drawing) within&#xD;
      experiment units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control-then-Intervention arm: In each intensive care unit assigned to the&#xD;
      Control-then-Intervention arm, all participants who regularly access the ICUs will wear the&#xD;
      wristband while at work for 5 months. The functionality of the wristband will not be&#xD;
      disclosed to the healthcare providers. Handwashing compliance data will be automatically&#xD;
      collected, but data will not be shared with the healthcare providers or hospital management&#xD;
      teams. After 5 months, a washout period of 2 months will be introduced to eliminate potential&#xD;
      influences on healthcare providers' behaviors from the sensor system. Then, all healthcare&#xD;
      providers will be educated on the functionalities of the CleanHands system with real time&#xD;
      reminders now turned on. Healthcare providers will then have access to their own and&#xD;
      unit-specific handwashing data. The unit manager and hospital administrators will be able to&#xD;
      access all of these data and advanced analysis to make management decisions on infection&#xD;
      reduction. This phase will last for 5 months. All personnel will be educated not to discuss&#xD;
      the functionalities of CleanHands system with their co-workers to ensure adequate blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention-then-Control arm: In each intensive care unit assigned to the&#xD;
      Intervention-then-Control arm, all participants who regularly access to the ICUs will be&#xD;
      educated on the functionalities of the CleanHands system with real time reminders turned on.&#xD;
      Healthcare providers will then have access to their own and unit-specific handwashing data.&#xD;
      The unit manager and hospital administrators will be able to access all of these data and&#xD;
      advanced analysis to make management decisions on infection control. This phase will last for&#xD;
      5 months. After 5 months, a washout period of 2 months will be introduced to eliminate&#xD;
      potential influences on healthcare providers' behaviors from sensor system installation and&#xD;
      implementation. Then, the real-time reminder functionality of the wristband will be turned&#xD;
      off and no more education will be provided. Handwashing compliance data will be automatically&#xD;
      collected but will not be shared with the healthcare providers. The unit manager and hospital&#xD;
      administrators will now be blinded to the handwashing compliance results. This process will&#xD;
      last for 5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Handwashing compliance data are automatically collected by CleanHands. These&#xD;
      data include all handwashing opportunities (defined as when a wristband is in pre-set&#xD;
      proximity of the controller for 5 seconds or more), total cleaning solution dispensing&#xD;
      counts, rates of&#xD;
