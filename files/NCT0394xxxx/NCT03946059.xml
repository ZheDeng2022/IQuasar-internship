  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine whether particular forms of brain-stimulation, applied to&#xD;
      superior frontal cortex/preSMA can affect cognition and associated frontal theta&#xD;
      oscillations. To perform this study, the investigators first measure brain activity and&#xD;
      cognitive performance using &quot;BrainE&quot;, a cognitive task platform that assesses cognition on&#xD;
      sustained attention, response inhibition, working memory, interference processing and emotion&#xD;
      processing assessments. Next, the investigators apply brain-stimulation over a mid-frontal&#xD;
      region associated with these tasks (mid-line frontal activity overlying superior frontal&#xD;
      cortex/pre-SMA area). Finally, human subjects perform the &quot;BrainE&quot; task assessments again&#xD;
      immediately after the brain-stimulation. The investigators compare the effects of brain&#xD;
      stimulation on average frontal activity evoked across the cognitive tasks, and on the&#xD;
      cognitive performance averaged across tasks. The investigators primarily compare the effects&#xD;
      of two types of brain-stimulation against each other: intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation (a&#xD;
      protocol designed to excite brain activity) and continuous Theta-Burst-Stimulation (a&#xD;
      stimulation protocol designed to inhibit brain activity).&#xD;

      1. Brain/Behavior Recordings: to measure brain activity as described above, the&#xD;
           investigators first ask subjects to engage in a cognitive assessment set while measuring&#xD;
           EEG activity. For this study, the assessment set consists of the following tasks: (1)&#xD;
           sustained attention; (2) response inhibition; (2) visuo-spatial working-memory; (3)&#xD;
           Flanker interference processing, and (4) emotional interference processing. This battery&#xD;
           takes about 30 minutes to complete. 24 channel EEG recordings are performed simultaneous&#xD;
           to the cognitive tasks. Subjects perform the &quot;BrainE&quot; cognitive assessment, then receive&#xD;
           brain-stimulation, and will then immediately be tested on the BrainE assessment again.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Brain-Stimulation: Each subject will be asked to come in twice for this study, separated&#xD;
           by 1 week. On week one they will receive one stimulation protocol, and on the subsequent&#xD;
           week they will receive the other (order determined randomly for each subject). The&#xD;
           intermittent Theta-Burst-Stimulation protocol (iTBS) consists of a similar burst pattern&#xD;
           (3 stimulation pulses 20ms apart; each burst applied every 200ms). However, after 10&#xD;
           bursts (2 seconds of stimulation) there is a pause for 8 seconds. 200 bursts are still&#xD;
           applied, however due to the inter-burst intervals, this paradigm takes 200 seconds. The&#xD;
           continuous Theta-Burst-Stimulation protocol (cTBS) consists of a burst of three&#xD;
           stimulation pulses, applied 20ms apart; with each burst occurring every 200ms. Thus,&#xD;
           every second participants receive 5 bursts. This continues for 40 seconds, such that&#xD;
           participants in total receive 200 bursts or 600 pulses.&#xD;

    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Investigators will assess for each subject whether they have any guess, a priori, as to hypothesized effects of the iTBS vs. cTBS protocols (improve, impair or no change on cognition). Participant/care provider will know which stimulation is being applied (iTBS, cTBS based on labels A &amp; B), but will not know the hypothesized effects of these two protocols. iTBS and cTBS protocols will be masked as &quot;treatment A&quot; and &quot;treatment B&quot;, prior to handing the data over to PI/outcomes assessor. Analyses will thus be performed to assess whether treatment &quot;A&quot; or treatment &quot;B&quot; has an effect on cognition; and whether there are differences between these treatment protocols.</masking_description>

        <title>Post vs. Pre Change in Mid-frontal Theta Oscillations for iTBS vs. cTBS Stimulation</title>
        <description>Change in superior frontal stimulus-evoked theta oscillations were measure on a set of cognitive tasks, specifically selective attention, response inhibition, working memory, interference processing and emotion processing tasks. The evoked EEG response (mid-frontal theta FCz as a source for superior frontal theta) was averaged across all cognitive tasks to yield a global cognitive task-averaged signal that was measured immediately before (Pre) and immediately after (Post) iTBS, and similarly immediately before (Pre) and immediately after (Post) cTBS.</description>
