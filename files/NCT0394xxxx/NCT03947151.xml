  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present investigation aims to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative protocol of&#xD;
      controlled ovarian stimulation for breast cancer patients, who are candidates for fertility&#xD;
      preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, vitrification of oocytes and/or embryos after controlled ovarian stimulation is&#xD;
      the most established method for female fertility preservation. However, this stimulation&#xD;
      induces an increase in serum estrogen levels, which is theoretically problematic in case of&#xD;
      hormone-sensitive tumors such as breast cancer. The majority of oncology teams accept, in&#xD;
      very specific situations (particularly when the tumor has been surgically removed), this&#xD;
      ovarian stimulation, because the expected benefits of fertility preservation far outweigh the&#xD;
      risks. However, everyone agrees that it would be more comfortable to be able to offer&#xD;
      vitrification of oocytes and/or embryos using ovarian stimulation without increasing estrogen&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research, investigators will evaluate the efficacy of degarelix (Firmagon®),&#xD;
      currently indicated for the treatment of prostate cancer, as an innovative ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation procedure. Administered at the beginning of ovarian stimulation, they believe it&#xD;
      should maintain serum estradiol levels at physiological values at the end of stimulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent improvements in freezing techniques have led to the development of fertility&#xD;
      preservation techniques for young women diagnosed with cancer. Currently, vitrification of&#xD;
      oocytes or embryos after controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) represents the only established&#xD;
      method. This COS is based on the daily administration of exogenous Follicle Stimulating&#xD;
      Hormone (FSH) and an ovulation blockage using Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH)&#xD;
      antagonists (0.25 mg/d) initiated after approximately 6 days of stimulation and continued&#xD;
      until ovulation is triggered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to requiring 15 days, COS induces supraphysiological hyperestradiolaemia (5-10&#xD;
      times normal) which can be problematic in case of hormone-sensitive tumors such as breast&#xD;
      cancer. The majority of oncology teams accept, in very specific situations (particularly when&#xD;
      the tumor has been surgically removed), this ovarian stimulation, because the expected&#xD;
      benefits of fertility preservation far outweigh the risks. However, everyone agrees that it&#xD;
      would be more comfortable to be able to offer vitrification of oocytes and/or embryos using&#xD;
      ovarian stimulation without increasing estrogen levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the limitation of serum estradiol concentrations during stimulation represents an&#xD;
      important issue. To this end, stimulation protocols combining aromatase inhibitors have been&#xD;
      proposed. Inhibition of the P450 aromatase enzyme in the granulosa cells of stimulated&#xD;
      follicles prevents the conversion of androgens to estrogens. However, the teratogenic risk of&#xD;
      these molecules, although discussed, limits their use in the indication of COS. Recently, a&#xD;
      new &quot;natos&quot; protocol was proposed to stimulate the ovaries while maintaining physiological&#xD;
      estradiolaemia, without using aromatase inhibitors. Thus, the administration of high doses of&#xD;
      Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonists (3 to 6 injections of 0.25 mg/day) from the&#xD;
      beginning of COS, would allow a strong Luteinizing Hormone (LH) deprivation, thus limiting&#xD;
      the production of androgens according to the 2 cells - 2 gonadotropins theory. In the absence&#xD;
      of a precursor, estradiolemia remains at physiological ranges during the total duration of&#xD;
      COS. However, the relative heaviness of a protocol combining up to 8 daily injections limits&#xD;
      its use in young women who are candidates for fertility preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators therefore propose to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of a new natos-like&#xD;
      COS protocol based on the administration of a long-acting GnRH antagonist, degarelix. This&#xD;
      drug is currently off-label for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of the research is 14 months and participation will be 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signature of the consent, during the first visit (oncofertility counseling), the the&#xD;
      research (consultations and examinations) will be carried out within the Antoine Béclère&#xD;
      hospital. All visits and examinations performed are part of routine care, except for the&#xD;
      injection(s) of degarelix which belongs to the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion visit During the oncofertility consultation, the physician will make sure that the&#xD;
      patient can be included in the research. Once the consent has been signed, the doctor will&#xD;
      schedule the following visits based on the biological results obtained as part of the usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation: between the day of oncofertility counseling and the following 7 days, the doctor&#xD;
      will check that patients are in the early follicular phase of the cycle, Degarelix injection:&#xD;
      1 injection, under the skin (possibly renewable after 5-7 days if the serum LH is ≥2 IU / L&#xD;
      and / or the estradiol is ≥400 pg / mL), Concomitant initiation of ovarian stimulation by&#xD;
      administration of recombinant FSH - Follitropin alfa (usual care). The injections will be&#xD;
      given by the patient or a nurse at home, between 7pm and 10pm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation follow-up visit #1 :&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 5 days of ovarian stimulation, transvaginal pelvic ultrasound (counting of ovarian&#xD;
      follicles and measurement of their diameters) and blood sampling for serum hormone assays&#xD;
      (estradiol, LH, progesterone) will be performed as part of the usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation follow-up visits #2 and #3 Visits #2 and #3: transvaginal pelvic ultrasound&#xD;
      (counting of ovarian follicles and measurement of their diameters) and a blood test for serum&#xD;
      hormone assays (estradiol, LH, progesterone) will be required to monitor the response to&#xD;
      stimulation, as part of routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits are repeated until 4 follicles 16 to 20 mm in diameter are obtained, which is the&#xD;
      criterion for ovulation trigger using 1 injection of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG)&#xD;
      (Ovitrelle 250 mcg, SC) (usual care). Thus visits #2 and #3 are systematic. One or two&#xD;
      additional visits with the same examinations may sometimes be necessary if the trigger&#xD;
      criteria are not met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-six hours after Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) , oocyte retrieval will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit on the day of the oocyte retrieval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a venous blood sample for serum hormone assays (estradiol, LH,&#xD;
      progesterone) as part of the usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocyte collection will be scheduled, and those which are mature will then be frozen (by&#xD;
      vitrification) or fertilized in vitro in case of embryo freezing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit following egg retrieval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood test for serum hormone assays (estradiol, LH, progesterone) will be performed 3-4&#xD;
      days after oocyte retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of research visit Participants will be contacted by phone 2 months after the injection of&#xD;
      degarelix (Firmagon®) to make sure they are fine.&#xD;
