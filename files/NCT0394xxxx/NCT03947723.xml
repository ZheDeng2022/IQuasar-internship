    <textblock>
      Trichiasis is a disorder of misdirected eyelashes in which the lashes grow inward towards the&#xD;
      eye. Trichiasis can occur as a result of chronic inflammation, infection, such as in herpes&#xD;
      or trachoma, trauma, or rare diseases like ocular cicatricial pemphigoid or Stevens-Johnson&#xD;
      syndrome. Trichiasis can result significant pain and corneal compromise, ranging from&#xD;
      punctate erosions to frank abrasions, as the lashes constantly contact and irritate the&#xD;
      ocular surface. Several treatment modalities are available, including mechanical epilation,&#xD;
      electroepilation, cryotherapy, laser therapy, and surgical procedures to redirect the lashes.&#xD;
      Radiofrequency ablation is a type of electroepilation that utilizes radiowaves to heat and&#xD;
      destroy hair follicles. A fine needle is inserted into the follicle and current is applied to&#xD;
      destroy the follicle. The needle allows the energy to be focused into the follicle and limits&#xD;
      scarring of the surrounding tissues, and the follicles are in theory permanently destroyed in&#xD;
      this procedure. Success rates are variable however, ranging from 56 to 90%. Currently, there&#xD;
      is no standardized protocol for performing radiofrequency ablation. Many practitioners choose&#xD;
      their power settings based on experience, and the Ellman Surgitron machine, a commonly used&#xD;
      radiofrequency unit, actually states in their instructions that the power should be titrated&#xD;
      based on user experience. In the literature, settings anywhere from 1 to 3 are seen. In this&#xD;
      study, our purpose is to examine the effects of different power settings in radiofrequency at&#xD;
      the histologic level. The investigators plan to test different power settings on eyelid&#xD;
      tissue that would be normally excised and discarded during eyelid correction surgeries. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to determine if there is an ideal power setting to achieve hair follicle&#xD;
      destruction while minimizing surrounding tissue damage, which could then be used as the&#xD;
      standard power setting for radiofrequency ablation of trichiatic lashes in clinical practice.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that as power increases, the extent and severity of tissue&#xD;
      damage will increase.&#xD;

      Subject fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria and willing to participate in the&#xD;
      study will be enrolled. All participants will receive all 4 treatments at the varying power&#xD;
      settings (low, 1, 1.5, 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be prepped for their surgery in the usual fashion. This portion of the&#xD;
      procedure is not experimental and is an elective surgery that the patients are choosing to&#xD;
      undergo prior to enrolling in the study. This procedure is performed in the operating room.&#xD;
      After adequate anesthesia is achieved, subcutaneous 2% lidocaine with epinephrine with 0.5%&#xD;
      marcaine, and vitrase is injected into the lower eyelids and lateral canthal areas. The face&#xD;
      is prepped and draped in sterile fashion using topical Betadine. A corneal shield will be&#xD;
      placed into the fornix at this time. A lateral canthal incision is then made using a #15&#xD;
      blade. Straight Stevens scissors are used to perform a canthotomy and monopolar cautery was&#xD;
      used to incise the inferior crus of the lateral canthal tendon. Hemostasis is maintained. The&#xD;
      freed lower eyelid is draped over the zygoma. The excess eyelid is then excised&#xD;
      full-thickness with Westcott scissors. (If this excess eyelid skin is at least 5 mm on both&#xD;
      sides, the study will be performed and the treatments will be applied at this point). The&#xD;
      tissue will be marked and divided into 4 equal sections (2 sections on each lid). Each&#xD;
      section will be treated with the designated power setting in the following manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probe will be inserted into the follicle under direct visualization to a depth of&#xD;
      approximately 1.4 mm. The designated power will be applied for 1 second. All lashes in each&#xD;
      segment will be treated. The segments will then be excised and placed into labelled and coded&#xD;
      containers of formalin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention will then be directed back to completing the lateral tarsal strip/eyelid surgery.&#xD;
      The remainder of the surgery will be performed in the usual fashion and is not part of the&#xD;
      experimental portion of the study. One 4-0 Vicryl on P-2 needle is then passed through the&#xD;
      tarsus backhanded anterior inferiorly exiting posterior superiorly within the wound and then&#xD;
      passed back through the periosteum approximately 3 mm from the orbital rim at the level of&#xD;
      the superior crus of the lateral canthal tendon and temporarily tied. This procedure is&#xD;
      repeated in full on the other side. The sides are compared. Once the proper contour and&#xD;
      tightness is achieved, the suture is permanently tied in a horizontal mattress fashion after&#xD;
      passing back through the remnants of the inferior crus. Attention is then turned to the upper&#xD;
      lid, whose lateral mucocutaneous junction is trimmed using Westcott scissors. The gray lines&#xD;
      of the lateral upper and lower eyelids arre reapposed using 6-0 Vicryl. The lateral canthal&#xD;
      incisions are closed with a running 6-0 Prolene suture. Tobradex ointment is applied to the&#xD;
      eye and eyelid. The patient is awakened and extubated and taken to the recovery room in&#xD;
      stable condition. The patients will be examined at their post-operative week 1 and month 1&#xD;
      visits as per the usual standard of care. After the 1 month visit, their participation in the&#xD;
      study is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tissue sections will be sent to the pathology department for sectioning and staining. The&#xD;
      tissue will be sectioned through the follicles. The slides will be stained with hemotoxylin&#xD;
      and eosin and Masson-Trichrome. The extent of tissue damage will be measured as the diameter&#xD;
      of abnormal/damaged tissue in microns. The severity will be graded on a numerical scale from&#xD;
      0-3. The results will be compared among the 4 power settings.&#xD;
