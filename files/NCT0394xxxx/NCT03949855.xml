  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of belimumab and&#xD;
      intravenous rituximab co-administration at inducing a complete remission (CR) compared to&#xD;
      rituximab alone in participants with PM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary membranous nephropathy (MN) is among the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in&#xD;
      adults. MN affects individuals of all ages and races. The peak incidence of MN is in the&#xD;
      fifth decade of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary MN is recognized to be an autoimmune disease, a disease where the body's own immune&#xD;
      system causes damage to kidneys. This damage can cause the loss of too much protein in the&#xD;
      urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs used to treat MN aim to reduce the attack by one's own immune system on the kidneys by&#xD;
      blocking inflammation and reducing the immune system's function. These drugs can have serious&#xD;
      side effects and often do not cure the disease. There is a need for new treatments for MN&#xD;
      that are better at improving the disease while reducing fewer treatment associated side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers will evaluate if treatment with a combination of two different&#xD;
      drugs, belimumab and rituximab, is effective at blocking the immune attacks on the kidney&#xD;
      compared to rituximab alone. Rituximab works by decreasing a type of immune cell, called B&#xD;
      cells. B cells are known to have a role in MN. Once these cells are removed, disease may&#xD;
      become less active or even inactive. However, after stopping treatment, the body will make&#xD;
      new B cells which may cause disease to become active again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Belimumab works by decreasing the new B cells produced by the body and, may even change the&#xD;
      type of new B cells subsequently produced. Belimumab is approved by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (also referred to as lupus or&#xD;
      SLE). Rituximab is approved by the FDA to treat some types of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      and vasculitis. Neither rituximab nor belimumab is approved by the FDA to treat MN. Treatment&#xD;
      with a combination of belimumab and rituximab has not been studied in individuals with MN,&#xD;
      but it is currently being tested in other autoimmune diseases, including lupus nephritis and&#xD;
      Sjögren's syndrome.&#xD;

      This trial is a two-part study (Part A and Part B) of adults with primary membranous&#xD;
      nephropathy (MN), ages 18-75 inclusive. The study will be conducted at multiple sites in the&#xD;
      United States and Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Open-label Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is an open-label, pharmacokinetics (PK) phase to compare belimumab exposure between&#xD;
      participants who have &quot;low&quot; proteinuria (≥ 4 to &lt; 8 g/day) and &quot;high&quot; proteinuria (≥ 8 g/day)&#xD;
      at the Screening Visit, Visit-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will enroll 20 individuals with primary MN: 10 individuals with low proteinuria and 10&#xD;
      individuals with high proteinuria. All Part A participants will receive 200 mg subcutaneous&#xD;
      belimumab weekly for 52 doses (weeks 0-51), unless a dose increase is warranted by the PK&#xD;
      analysis. Trough serum belimumab levels will be obtained weekly following the first 4 doses&#xD;
      of belimumab. Participants will receive rituximab 1000 mg intravenously (IV) at weeks 4 and&#xD;
      6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be followed after the 52 week treatment period on no study medication&#xD;
      until week 156.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Belimumab serum trough levels will be analyzed after all participants receive the first 4&#xD;
      belimumab doses to compare belimumab exposure between the low and high proteinuria groups.&#xD;
      Belimumab serum trough levels will also be analyzed to determine if a different proteinuria&#xD;
      level (instead of 8 g/day) warrants increased belimumab dosing and should be used to define&#xD;
      &quot;high&quot; proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose determinations for participants with high proteinuria in Parts A and B will be made by&#xD;
      an adjudication committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participation phase is 156 weeks (3 years), which includes a treatment phase of 52&#xD;
      weeks and a post-treatment observation phase of 104 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Randomized Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is a prospective, randomized, phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter&#xD;
      clinical trial in adults with primary MN. Part B will commence after the analysis of the PK&#xD;
      data in Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 104 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion into two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by low and high proteinuria as determined by the identified&#xD;
      threshold in Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both arms will receive rituximab 1000 mg IV at weeks 4 and 6. Participants&#xD;
      randomized to the experimental arm will receive subcutaneous belimumab 200 mg weekly for 52&#xD;
      doses (weeks 0-51), unless the results from Part A indicate that participants with high&#xD;
      proteinuria should receive belimumab 400 mg weekly. If the participant's proteinuria&#xD;
      subsequently decreases to below the high proteinuria threshold, the belimumab dose will be&#xD;
      decreased to 200 mg weekly for the remainder of the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the comparator arm will receive subcutaneous belimumab placebo&#xD;
      according to the same dose and schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participation phase is 156 weeks (3 years), which includes a treatment phase of 52&#xD;
      weeks and a post-treatment observation phase of 104 weeks.&#xD;
