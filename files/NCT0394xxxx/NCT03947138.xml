      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of GC3107 in healthy&#xD;
      infants&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 Countries, Korea and Thailand. About 750 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial consists of Part 1 to compare the efficacy and safety between the study&#xD;
      group and the active control group and Part 2 for the final safety assessment. Subject&#xD;
      enrollment for Part 1 and Part 2 will occur at the same time, and subjects who meet the final&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to Part 1 or Part 2 via the IWRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the legally acceptable representative of the subject within 4 weeks after birth consents&#xD;
      to participate in the clinical study in writing at Visit 1, the protocol-mandated examination&#xD;
      and tests will be performed at each visit, and only the subjects who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned randomization numbers and receive a single&#xD;
      intradermal injection of the investigational product. However, the informed consent of the&#xD;
      subject's legally acceptable representative for participation in the clinical trial may be&#xD;
      obtained between 36 weeks of pregnancy of a subject's mother and Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will instruct the subject's legally acceptable representative to record any&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) occurring after administration of the investigational product to assess&#xD;
      the safety of the subject during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects participating in Part 1 will have the tuberculin skin test at Visit 4 for the&#xD;
      efficacy assessment and receive an intradermal injection of 0.1 mL purified protein&#xD;
      derivatives (PPD) reagent. Visit 5 will occur within 48 to 72 hours of the PPD reagent&#xD;
      injection to check the tuberculin skin test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, Visit 6 will be conducted as an on-site visit to check for any solicited local AEs&#xD;
      (abscess, ulcer, scar, and BCG lymphadenitis) and unsolicited AEs occurring until 6 months&#xD;
      (168 days) after administration of the investigational product.&#xD;
