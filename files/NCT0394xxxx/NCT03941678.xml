  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Creatine monohydrate is important for sustaining phosphocreatine stores in tissues such as&#xD;
      muscle and brain. Phosphocreatine is an important source of energy in these tissues.&#xD;
      Supplementation with creatine monohydrate is effective in healthy and clinical populations&#xD;
      for improving muscle and brain function. The purpose of our study is to determined whether&#xD;
      creatine supplementation is effective during resistance training for improving muscle and&#xD;
      brain function in people recovering from stroke.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of creatine supplementation and&#xD;
      supervised resistance training in stroke survivors. It is hypothesized that creatine&#xD;
      supplementation and resistance training will increase whole-body lean tissue mass, limb&#xD;
      muscle thickness, muscle strength, tasks of functionality and cognition and decrease symptoms&#xD;
      of depression and anxiety compared to placebo and resistance training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke is characterized by an abrupt disturbance in cerebral circulation causing a&#xD;
      neurological deficit. It is a major cause of adult neurological disability in North America,&#xD;
      often resulting in significant muscle loss, weakness and functional limitations. Disability&#xD;
      associated with stroke limits independent living and social participation in at least half of&#xD;
      all stroke survivors. A sedentary lifestyle after stroke can increase the risk for recurrent&#xD;
      stroke, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. All factors may adversely affect&#xD;
      independence and quality of life. The majority of stroke survivors have residual impairments&#xD;
      such as hemiparesis, spasticity, cognitive dysfunction, and aphasia, with full recovery&#xD;
      reached in a small portion of these individuals. One of the major consequences of these&#xD;
      impairments is physical inactivity which inevitably contributes to muscle loss, decreased&#xD;
      muscle function (i.e. strength, endurance) and impaired functionality. One intervention which&#xD;
      may help improve muscle mass, muscle function and functionality in stroke survivors is&#xD;
      supervised resistance training. Resistance training does not lead to muscle spasticity in&#xD;
      stroke survivors and has been shown to improve the ability to perform activities of daily&#xD;
      living. Another intervention which may be beneficial for stroke survivors is creatine&#xD;
      supplementation. Creatine has been shown to increase muscle mass, muscle function and tasks&#xD;
      of functionality when combined with resistance training, possibly by influencing cellular&#xD;
      hydration status, high-energy phosphate metabolism, muscle protein kinetics, satellite cells,&#xD;
      anabolic growth factors, and inflammation. Creatine has also shown promise for improving&#xD;
      cognition and symptoms of depression and anxiety; however, no study has examined the combined&#xD;
      effects of creatine supplementation and resistance training in stroke survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a double-blind, repeated measures design. In order to minimize group&#xD;
      differences, participants will be matched according to age, gender, and type of stroke and&#xD;
      then be randomized on a 1:1 basis to one of two groups, creatine monohydrate or placebo&#xD;
      (corn-starch maltodextrin). Creatine and placebo will be similar in taste, color, texture and&#xD;
      appearance. A research assistant will be responsible for randomization and another research&#xD;
      assistant will prepare study kits. Each study kit will contain the participants supplement&#xD;
      for the duration of the study, detailed supplementation instructions, as well as measuring&#xD;
      spoons. For days 1-7, participants will ingest 0.3g/kg of creatine or placebo (0.075 g/kg x 4&#xD;
      times daily). This creatine dosing strategy has been shown to be effective for increasing&#xD;
      intramuscular creatine stores. For subsequent days, participants will consume 0.1 g/kg/day of&#xD;
      creatine or placebo as this creatine dosage is effective for increasing muscle mass. On&#xD;
      training days, participants will consume their supplement within 5 minutes after each&#xD;
      training session. On non-training days, supplements will be consumed at the participants&#xD;
      leisure. Adherence with creatine supplementation, placebo, and resistance training will be&#xD;
      assessed by training and supplementation compliance logs. A retrospective treatment&#xD;
      identification will be administered to all participants upon completion of the study in order&#xD;
      to assess whether participants thought they were administered creatine, placebo, or unsure&#xD;
      about what supplement they consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dependent variables that will be measured at baseline and after the intervention include:&#xD;
      (1) whole-body lean tissue mass (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) (2) muscle thickness&#xD;
      (elbow and knee flexors and extensors; ultrasonography), (3) muscle strength (1-repetition&#xD;
      maximum leg press and chest press), (4) tasks of functionality (berg balance scale, 6-minute&#xD;
      walk test) (5) cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), (6) depression (The Center for&#xD;
      Epidemiologic Studies- Depression Scale) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item).&#xD;
      Participants will also complete a 3-day food log at baseline and during the last week of&#xD;
      supplementation and training to determine whether total calories consumed as well as&#xD;
      macronutrient intake changed over the duration of the study. Participants will be instructed&#xD;
      to record all food and beverages consumption during these 3 days. Food records will be&#xD;
      analyzed using MyFitnessPal.&#xD;
