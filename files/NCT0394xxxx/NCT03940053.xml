      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of arginine in preventing&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cancer is considered to be the leading cause of death among non-infectious diseases and the&#xD;
      most important obstacle to increase life expectancy for every country in the 21st century.&#xD;
      However, even if various interventions such as embolization chemotherapy, systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and targeted therapy are widely used in clinical&#xD;
      practice, the improvement of patients' survival is still limited. Our previous study found&#xD;
      that arginine hydrochloride could significantly promote the apoptosis of liver cancer cells,&#xD;
      and inhibit the progression of HCC by prompting the urea cycle. Therefore, our research group&#xD;
      has carried out this study to evaluate the efficacy of arginine in preventing cancers.&#xD;
