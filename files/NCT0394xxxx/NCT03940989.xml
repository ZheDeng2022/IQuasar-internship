  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent systematic review found that therapeutic interventions that apply principles of&#xD;
      motor learning with intense practice improve functional upper extremity movement in children&#xD;
      with unilateral CP. Evidence of efficacy for any treatment approach aimed at improving motor&#xD;
      function in bilateral CP (the most prevalent form) is lacking. Preliminary investigation&#xD;
      suggests that intensive (90 hours) goal-directed, task-specific training provided in a 3-week&#xD;
      day camp format can improve functional movement of both the upper (UE) and lower extremity&#xD;
      (LE) and postural control in children with BCP. To date, HABIT-ILE has only been provided in&#xD;
      a day camp setting over several weeks. Implementing the dosing schedule of this promising&#xD;
      intensive approach in a hospital setting requires innovative resource allocation (space and&#xD;
      staff); thus, examining alternative delivery models is imperative. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to conduct a multi-center randomized control trial (RCT) to determine whether 90 hours of&#xD;
      HABIT-ILE improves functional motor skills, activity and motivation in children with BCP when&#xD;
      dosed in a camp format at 6-hours/day, 5 days/week for three weeks and 6-hours/day, one&#xD;
      day/week for 15 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the leading cause of childhood motor impairment with 1 in 323 American&#xD;
      children affected. The resulting impaired motor function in individuals with CP limits their&#xD;
      ability to independently perform many functional activities, and participate in academic,&#xD;
      social, and leisure activities. Children with CP are referred to physical, occupational, and&#xD;
      speech therapy at varying intensities (1-3x week) for years, depending on individual needs.&#xD;
      While these therapeutic services are offered regularly, the clinical efficacy and optimal&#xD;
      dosing parameters are being challenged. In a meta-analysis of all available therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions for CP, just 5 had strong enough evidence to recommend implementation into&#xD;
      clinical practice for children with unilateral CP (Novak et al. 2013) and no therapies had&#xD;
      sufficient evidence of efficacy for treatment of upper (UE) or lower extremities (LE) in&#xD;
      children with bilateral CP (BCP). The key features of interventions with proven evidence of&#xD;
      clinical efficacy include: a motor learning approach involving active movement, an&#xD;
      environment to shape desired movements, and a much higher treatment intensity than provided&#xD;
      in weekly therapies. Despite BCP being the most prevalent subtype, the majority of the&#xD;
      research evaluating the clinical efficacy and dosing parameters of therapeutic interventions&#xD;
      has been determined in children with UCP with upper extremity approaches such as Constraint&#xD;
      Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) and Hand-Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy (HABIT) demonstrating&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One promising therapy gaining interest and support for children with BCP is Hand-Arm Bimanual&#xD;
      Intensive Therapy Including the Lower Extremities (HABIT-ILE). HABIT-ILE aims to improve&#xD;
      upper and lower movement control by engaging the UE and LE during combined activities for&#xD;
      many hours every day for 3 weeks. Preliminary investigation has demonstrated that children&#xD;
      with BCP participating in a 90-hour HABIT-ILE day camp achieve improvement within the body&#xD;
      function and structure, activity and participation levels of the International Classification&#xD;
      of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). While intensive therapies, such as HABIT-ILE,&#xD;
      are typically provided in a day camp setting over several weeks, implementing the dosing&#xD;
      schedule of this promising intensive approach in a hospital setting requires innovative&#xD;
      resource allocation (space and staff). In order to establish the efficacy of this approach&#xD;
      for children with BCP, it is essential to further examine the efficacy of the 3-week&#xD;
      HABIT-ILE camp format of delivery in a larger, multisite trial, in addition to examining&#xD;
      whether an alternative model of intensity and resource allocation can demonstrate similar&#xD;
      efficacy. The overall aim of the proposed work is to determine the effectiveness of two&#xD;
      different dosing schedules of an intensive therapeutic intervention that applies motor&#xD;
      learning to upper and lower extremity movement and postural control to improve functional&#xD;
      motor skills, activity, and self-mastery in children with BCP. The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine if there are significant gains and retention in functional motor&#xD;
      skills, activity, and self-mastery in children with BCP receiving 90 hours of HABIT-ILE dosed&#xD;
      in a camp format for 6-hours per day, 5 days per week for three weeks and for 6-hours a day,&#xD;
      one day per week for 15 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine whether the degree of involvement, age and self-mastery predict&#xD;
      the magnitude and maintenance of change seen in children with BCP receiving 90 hours of&#xD;
      HABIT-ILE dosed in a camp format for 6-hours per day, 5 days per week for three weeks and for&#xD;
      6-hours a day, one day per week for 15 weeks.&#xD;
