    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well daratumumab, ixazomib, and dexamethasone with or without&#xD;
      bortezomib work in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as daratumumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as ixazomib, dexamethasone, and bortezomib, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or&#xD;
      by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether giving daratumumab, ixazomib,&#xD;
      and dexamethasone with or without bortezomib may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the ≥ very good partial response (VGPR) rate after 8 cycles in subjects&#xD;
      treated with daratumumab, ixazomib and dexamethasone (DId) versus (vs) daratumumab,&#xD;
      bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) followed by DId among newly diagnosed myeloma patients&#xD;
      (NDMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the proportion of subjects with successful stem cell mobilization after&#xD;
      receiving 3 cycles of treatment in both arms (DId x 8 vs DVd x 3 then DId x 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To establish safety among patients receiving the combination of DId and DVd then DId.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To obtain anti-tumor activity (best response rates: overall response rate [ORR], VGPR,&#xD;
      complete response [CR], stringent complete response [sCR] and minimal residual of disease&#xD;
      [MRD] negativity) in patients treated with these combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Progression free survival (PFS), progression free survival 2 (PFS2), duration of response&#xD;
      (DOR), time to progression (TTP), determine the time to next therapy (TTNT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Engraftment parameters among the autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Determine whether tumor response and PFS may change in subgroups with different&#xD;
      prognosis according to current prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) and orally (PO) on days 1, 8,&#xD;

      cycles 3-8, and ixazomib PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Eligible patients then&#xD;
      undergo stem cell transplant per standard of care. Patients who have at least stable disease&#xD;
      after induction and patients who have undergone transplant continue to Maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive dexamethasone IV and PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, daratumumab&#xD;
      IV on day 1, and ixazomib PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 24&#xD;
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

&#xD;
      INDUCTION CYCLES 1-3: Patients receive dexamethasone IV and PO on days 1, 8, and 15,&#xD;
      daratumumab IV on days 1, 8, and 15, and bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 4, 8, and&#xD;
      11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION CYCLES 4-8: Patients receive dexamethasone IV and PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22,&#xD;
      daratumumab IV on days 1 and 15, and ixazomib PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Eligible patients then undergo stem cell transplant per standard of care. Patients who have&#xD;
      at least stable disease after induction and patients who have undergone transplant continue&#xD;
      to Maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive dexamethasone IV on day 1, daratumumab IV on day 1, and&#xD;
      ixazomib PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 24 months in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
