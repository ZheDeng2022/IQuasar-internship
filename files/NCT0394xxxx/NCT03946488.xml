  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of disability in adults. The improvement of the grasp abilities&#xD;
      remains a challenge in the 50% of post-stroke subjects who have not recovered functional&#xD;
      grasping due to paralysis of the finger's muscles (lack of active opening of the hand).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of functional electrical stimulation of the prehension muscles in order to restore&#xD;
      grasp abilities, called grasp neuroprosthesis (GP), remained confidential in post-stroke&#xD;
      subjects while their development was important in tetraplegic subjects. GP can provide a&#xD;
      correct hand opening with significant functional gain, but one of the major issues&#xD;
      corresponds to the control modalities that are not adapted to the specific impairments of&#xD;
      post-stroke subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project proposes to assess the functional contribution of an innovative autopilot&#xD;
      closed-loop GP targeting the extensor muscles of the fingers. The main hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      use of GP will restore grasping abilities in subjects who have lost this ability due to&#xD;
      post-stroke paralysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the impact of using an autopilot closed-loop GP on the&#xD;
      ability to perform a standardized task of grasping, moving and releasing either a glass&#xD;
      (palmar grasp) or a spoon (key pinch), compared to the absence of GP use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are: (1) to assess the impact of the GP on unimanual&#xD;
      grasp; (2) to assess which are the preferential modes of control; (3) to assess the&#xD;
      psycho-social impacts of GP, and (4) to assess the subject's satisfaction and tolerance to&#xD;
      the characteristics and use of GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to include 20 post-stroke hemiplegic subjects over a period of 9&#xD;
      months as part of a prospective, monocentric, multi-crossover, blinded evaluation study.&#xD;
      Subjects will have active finger extension deficit secondary to stroke, with preservation of&#xD;
      proximal movements. Each subject will be his own control (self-pairing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be evaluated three times, the protocol adding approximately 1½ hours of&#xD;
      daily assessment to routine care already received. The first visit will collect clinical data&#xD;
      after informed consent collection. The second visit will allow to choose the optimal mode of&#xD;
      control of the GP among 8 modalities. The third visit will test the functional gain provided&#xD;
      by the use of GP, by comparing the success or failure of carrying out functional tasks with&#xD;
      inactive and active GP.&#xD;

    <description>The main functional task consist of grasping, moving and releasing either a glass (palmar grasp) or a spoon (key grip): the task (palmar grasp or key grip) preferred by the patient will be chosen.&#xD;
The assessment will consist of 24 trials with the active or inactive neuroprosthesis (12 activated and 12 inactivated), the order of the trials with / without neuroprosthesis being randomized in blocks of at least three trials. In order to limit the fatigue potentially induced by the repetition of stimulations, a pause between each trial will be respected if necessary. The maximum time allowed for the completion of each test will be 1 minute.&#xD;
A success corresponds to a complete completion of the functional task in at least 2/3 of the trials (i.e. 8/12 trials) with the activated neuroprosthesis. The success / failure score will be assessed secondarily from video recordings by a blind evaluator of the activation or not of the neuroprosthesis.</description>
