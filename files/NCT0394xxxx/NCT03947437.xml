  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the LEP-F1 + GLA-SE investigational&#xD;
      vaccine compared to placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial will establish an initial safety profile for the vaccine in a&#xD;
      region endemic for leprosy. The trial will enroll both healthy participants and&#xD;
      paucibacillary leprosy patients receiving standard-of-care therapy. Safety at the lower&#xD;
      vaccine dose will be demonstrated in healthy participants prior to antigen dose-escalation.&#xD;
      Further, safety in all healthy participants will be demonstrated prior to enrolling leprosy&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized within each Group to receive three doses of vaccine or&#xD;
      placebo administered IM on Days 0, 28, and 56. Participants will be monitored for one year&#xD;
      following the last study injection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females ≥ 18 years and ≤ 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For Cohort 1, participants must be in good general health as confirmed by a medical&#xD;
             history and physical exam. For Cohort 2, patients must have confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
             paucibacillary leprosy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on the day of each study&#xD;
             vaccination, must not be breast-feeding, and are required to use one of the following&#xD;
             methods of contraception from enrollment in study until 30 days after last injection&#xD;
             (only if in sexual relationships with men): hormonal (e.g. oral, transdermal,&#xD;
             intravaginal, implant, or injection); double barrier (i.e., condom, diaphragm, or&#xD;
             cervical cap with spermicide); intrauterine device (IUD) or system (IUS); vasectomized&#xD;
             partner (6 months minimum); or abstinence; bilateral tubal ligation (if no conception&#xD;
             post-procedure); tubal occlusion; or bilateral salpingectomy. These precautions are&#xD;
             necessary due to unknown effects that LEP-F1 + GLA-SE might cause in a fetus or&#xD;
             newborn infant. Women are considered non-child-bearing potential if they are&#xD;
             post-menopausal (menopause defined as at least 12 months spontaneous amenorrhea) or&#xD;
             have had documented hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Screening laboratory values within the normal ranges or not clinically significant as&#xD;
             determined by the Investigator and approved by the Medical Monitor: sodium, potassium,&#xD;
             ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, fasting glucose, total&#xD;
             WBC count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Abnormal results may be repeated once for&#xD;
             confirmation at Investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Negative HIV 1/2 antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             (HCV) antibody, and QuantiFERON®-TB Gold (QFT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Normal or not clinically significant urinalysis as determined by the study clinician&#xD;
             or designee. Abnormal results may be repeated at Investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is capable of completing a study memory aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject gave informed consent, is able and willing to make all evaluation visits, is&#xD;
             reachable by telephone or personal contact by the study site personnel, and is willing&#xD;
             to remain in the study area for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For Cohort 1, history of infection with M. leprae.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previous exposure to M. leprae vaccines or experimental products containing GLA-SE.&#xD;
&#xD;

             products within the past 3 months prior to Enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Received any vaccine within 30 days prior to Enrollment or plan to have any&#xD;
             immunizations between Days 0-63 due to the washout period prior to immunology blood&#xD;
             draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Received a blood transfusion within 3 months prior to Enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Donated blood products (platelets, whole blood, plasma, etc.) within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             Enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., oral or injected steroids, such as&#xD;
             prednisone; high dose inhaled steroids) or cytotoxic therapies (e.g., chemotherapy&#xD;

             Investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the&#xD;
             vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Hypertension (systolic &gt; 150 or diastolic &gt; 95).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of significant psychiatric illness with current use of medication.&#xD;
