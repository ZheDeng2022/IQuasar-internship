  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FDA has shown clear interest in strategies that will reduce the public health burden of&#xD;
      tobacco use. One proposed strategy includes banning the sale of fully nicotinized cigarettes&#xD;
      and only allowing VLNCs (Very Low Nicotine Cigarettes) to be sold. While there are concerns&#xD;
      regarding the unintended consequences (e.g., black market sales of fully nicotinized&#xD;
      cigarettes) of such bans, research is needed to understand how smokers and dual users will&#xD;
      act in the potential market. The overall aim of the current research is to understand&#xD;
      purchasing and product choice behaviors of tobacco/nicotine users if the proposed ban were to&#xD;
      go into effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use continues to be the leading cause of preventable death in the US, with the&#xD;
      majority of deaths due to combustible tobacco use. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) may&#xD;
      represent a nicotine delivery device that addresses cravings and nicotine withdrawal and is&#xD;
      much less harmful compared to cigarettes, particularly if completely substituted for&#xD;
      cigarettes. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently set forth plans that include the&#xD;
      possibility of regulating the level of nicotine in combustible cigarettes to make them&#xD;
      non-addictive and disallowing the sale of fully nicotinized cigarettes. While studies have&#xD;
      shown that lowering the level of nicotine in cigarettes leads to high quit rates and would&#xD;
      likely have a positive overall public health impact, there are concerns that doing so will&#xD;
      lead to a black market for purchasing fully nicotinized cigarettes. However, no empirical&#xD;
      evidence currently exists regarding this possible unintended consequence of the proposed&#xD;
      regulation and the current project aims to fill this gap. Current smokers and dual cigarette&#xD;
      and e-cigarette users will complete three in-lab study visits. Following screening and&#xD;
      practice with all study products, participants will complete standardized 10-puff bouts for&#xD;
      three e-cigarettes, the VLNCs (Very Low Nicotine Cigarettes), and their usual brand&#xD;
      cigarette. They will then complete three concurrent choice tasks. The tasks will simulate 1)&#xD;
      the current market, in which e-cigarettes and fully nicotinized cigarettes are available, 2)&#xD;
      the potential future market in which e-cigarettes and VLNC (Very Low Nicotine Cigarettes) are&#xD;
      freely available and nicotinized cigarettes are banned, and 3) the potential future market in&#xD;
      which only tobacco flavored e-cigarettes and VLNCs (Very Low Nicotine Cigarettes) are freely&#xD;
      available and nicotinized cigarettes are banned. Understanding, in an environment where VLNCs&#xD;
      (Very Low Nicotine Cigarettes) are the only cigarettes available, current smokers' and dual&#xD;
      users' product choices will fill an important gap in the research and inform regulation of&#xD;
      these products.&#xD;

      During their PK (Pharmacokinetics) visits, Blood will be collected during specific time&#xD;
      points and plasma will be extracted from the blood. Plasma will be used to analyze the levels&#xD;
      of nicotine in it.&#xD;

      Urine will be collected from female participants in order to confirm their pregnancy status.&#xD;
      Saliva will be collected during their screening visit to analyze for cotinine levels in order&#xD;

        A sample of 40 current cigarette smokers (n=20) and dual e-cigarette and cigarette users&#xD;
        (n=20) who are willing to use/try an alternative nicotine-delivery device will be recruited&#xD;
        via advertisements/ recruitment materials (e.g., craigslist, ads on OSU, OU, and UCO&#xD;
        campuses, OUHSC, email) and referrals. Participants will live in the Oklahoma City, OK&#xD;
        metro area. Participants will be provided information about the study and provide initial&#xD;
        consent for screening via an online screener.&#xD;
