  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the effects of visceral manual therapy associated&#xD;
      with pelvic floor muscle training on urinary incontinence symptoms, vaginal resting pressure&#xD;
      and maximum voluntary contraction of the pelvic floor muscles in women. This is a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with double blinding. Participants will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
      control and experimental. Both groups will undergo a pelvic floor muscle training program&#xD;
      twice weekly for 5 consecutive weeks. Participants in the intervention group will also&#xD;
      receive, once a week, a visceral manual therapy protocol and control group participants will&#xD;
      receive a manual sham therapy protocol.&#xD;

      This study is a double-blind randomized controlled trial with two groups. Participants will&#xD;
      be evaluated by a trained blinded investigator and assigned randomly to the experimental and&#xD;
      control groups. Both groups will undergo a pelvic floor muscle training program twice weekly&#xD;
      for 5 consecutive weeks. Participants in the intervention group will also receive, once a&#xD;
      week, a visceral manual therapy protocol and control group participants will receive a sham&#xD;
      manual therapy protocol. Participants who agree to participate in the survey will sign a Free&#xD;
      and Informed Consent Form and will be informed of the possibility of withdrawing from the&#xD;
      survey at any stage, without penalty. The collection of the evaluation and intervention will&#xD;
      be carried out in a salon Clinic School of Physiotherapy in the Center of Health and Sports&#xD;
      Sciences (CEFID) of the State University of Santa Catarina (UDESC) in the city of&#xD;
      Florianópolis - SC. All personal identification data of the participants will be preserved&#xD;
      according to resolution of the national health council, taking into account the possibility&#xD;
      of scientific dissemination of the results obtained. The risks of these procedures will be&#xD;
      medium, since the participant may present muscle pain after the intervention protocol. To&#xD;
      minimize these risks will be available, if necessary, attendance at the Clinic School of&#xD;
      Physiotherapy. The sample will be selected in a non-probabilistic way for convenience. The&#xD;
      participants will Female volunteers , aged from 18 years with urinary incontinence.&#xD;

    <description>This outcome will be measured through the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form. This is a self-administered questionnaire designed to assess the frequency, severity, and impact of urinary incontinence on the quality of life of patients of both sexes. It consists of four items. The first three assess the frequency, severity, and impact of urinary incontinence on quality of life. From the sum of these three items the total score is obtained, which can vary between 0 and 21 points. The higher the score, greater the severity of the symptoms of urinary incontinence. The overall score can be divided into four severity categories: mild (1-5 points), moderate (6-12 points), severe (13-18 points), very severe (19-21 points). The fourth item does not enter the total score but serves to determine the type of urinary incontinence (stress, urgency or mixed).</description>

    <description>This group performed a supervised Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT) protocol associated with a manual sham therapy (MST) sessions.&#xD;
The PFMT protocol consisted of 20 sessions of 45-60 minutes each, twice a week, totalizing a five weeks treatment.&#xD;
The MST protocol was performed once a week, during five weeks lasting approximately 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>The experimental group performed the same PFMT protocol as the CG, but associated with a Visceral Manual Therapy (VMT) protocol.&#xD;
The VMT sessions were held once a week, for five weeks. Each session lasted approximately 20 minutes.</description>

    <intervention_name>Pelvic Floor muscle training - PFMT</intervention_name>
    <description>Pelvic Floor muscle training is an active exercise-based treatment designed to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. The PFMT protocol was divided into four phases. Proprioceptive (2 weeks): where the woman has gained adequate perception of PFM and control of fast and slow contractions; Simple (1 week): performed with the objective of promoting control of fast and slow contractions associated with small functional exercises; Elaborated (1 week): where the exercise evolved into functional exercises of greater amplitude; and Power (1 week): where the control of the pelvic floor was promoted during efforts. In all sessions, contractions were performed for slow and for fast fibers (the list of exercises and a detailed description of them is in Appendix 1).</description>

    <description>Visceral manual therapy:is a manual treatment intended to the release of visceral fascias. The VMT protocol was based on the work proposed by Vanderheyden-Busquet (2014). To act on the abdominal and pelvic visceral fasciae, the VMT was performed through slow and deep mobilizations, respecting the participant's tissue resistance and painful response, in different regions of the abdômen.</description>
