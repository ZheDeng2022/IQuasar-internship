  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is diffusely accelerated atherosclerosis of a&#xD;
      transplanted heart. Evolocumab (repatha) is an FDA-approved drug for lowering LDL in patients&#xD;
      who have not received a heart transplant. This drug works as a PCSK9-inhibitor. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to measure the impact of PCSK9-inhibitors on serum LDL in heart&#xD;
      transplant patients with CAV after 12 weeks compared to baseline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart transplant remains the treatment of choice for patients with advanced heart failure.&#xD;
      Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is diffusely accelerated atherosclerosis of the donor&#xD;
      heart, and limits long term survival after transplant. The pathophysiology of CAV is complex&#xD;
      and involves smooth muscle proliferation, inflammatory infiltrates, and lipid deposition. To&#xD;
      date, only statin therapy has reduced CAV-related mortality. PCSK9 inhibitors are a new lipid&#xD;
      lowering therapy shown to reduce cardiovascular clinical events in patients with coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. We hypothesize that PCSK9 inhibition via evolocumab will significantly lower&#xD;
      LDL and be well-tolerated in transplant patients with CAV. This phase II, open label, single&#xD;
      center trial with enroll up to 40 heart transplant patients with CAV for treatment with&#xD;
      evolocumab for one year. The primary outcome will be percent change in LDL at 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include change in CAV progression, impact of evolocumab on&#xD;
      immunosuppression regimens and transplant rejection, and change in serum lipids after 52&#xD;
      weeks. Results of this study are intended to provide safety data in heart transplant patients&#xD;
      with CAV and assess secondary outcomes including CAV progression and impact on&#xD;
      immunosuppression and transplant rejection.&#xD;

    <description>Enrolled study participants will be treated with evolocumab (Repatha) 140 mg injected subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 52 weeks. All study participants will receive instruction on correct self-administration by research pharmacists. Study drug will be mailed to patients on a monthly basis for self-administration by patients. The evolocumab dose (140 mg every 2 weeks) will remain constant for the duration of the study. Side effects will be assessed on a quarterly basis. Serious adverse events considered related to treatment, death, and pregnancy will all result in immediate discontinuation of the study drug.</description>
