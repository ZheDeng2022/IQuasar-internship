      The trial used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superior-effect design,&#xD;
      multicenter clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was divided into a test group and a placebo group,the two groups were randomized in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio and planned to enroll 240 patients with type 2 diabetes. After 2 weeks of&#xD;
      screening, all subjects entered the treatment period,which was 24 weeks, and 1 week period of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

      The trial was divided into a test group and a placebo group: the test group was given&#xD;
      trelagliptin succinate tablets, and the placebo group was given placebo. The test group and&#xD;
      the placebo group were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and planned to enroll 240 patients with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes. After 2 weeks of screening, all subjects entered the treatment period,which was&#xD;
      24 weeks, and 1 week period of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were asked to continue their current diabetes diet and physical activity&#xD;
      treatment plan throughout the study period.&#xD;
