  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a compassionate use protocol of BYL719 (alpelisib) treatment for a single patient&#xD;
      with locally advanced lymphangioma positive PI3K alpha H1047R mutation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a single agent, alpelisib will be administered at a starting dose of 350 mg orally once&#xD;
      daily on a continuous dosing schedule and can be adjusted for toxicity per the&#xD;
      recommendations in this protocol. No pretreatment will be given prior to the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan on treating this individual patient for a tentative period of 12 weeks at which time&#xD;
      treating physician will reevaluate the patient's clinical and radiological response and&#xD;
      further duration of treatment will be contingent on that assessment.&#xD;

&#xD;
                  d. Serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia History or current evidence of&#xD;
                  clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation and/or conduction&#xD;
                  abnormality, e.g. congenital long QT syndrome, high-grade/complete AV-blockage:&#xD;
                  per guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  e. Symptomatic pericarditis f. QTcF &gt; 480 msec on the screening ECG (using the&#xD;
                  QTcF formula) currently receiving treatment with medication that has a known risk&#xD;

                  cannot be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting&#xD;
                  treatment with alpelisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may&#xD;
                  significantly alter the absorption of alpelisib (e.g., ulcerative diseases,&#xD;
                  uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel&#xD;
                  resection)&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Patient has other prior or concurrent malignancy (except for the following:&#xD;
                  adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or other adequately&#xD;
                  treated in situ cancer, early gastric or GI cancer resected completely by&#xD;
                  endoscopy procedures or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease&#xD;

                  with alpelisib and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of&#xD;
                  alpelisib:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking&#xD;
                       drug and for 4 weeks* after the final dose of alpelisib and should not&#xD;
                       father a child in this period, but may be recommended to seek advice on&#xD;
                       conservation of sperm. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized&#xD;
                       men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all female physiologically&#xD;
                       capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during&#xD;
                       the IPP and through at least 4 weeks* after the final dose of alpelisib&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Highly effective contraception is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  i. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
                  of the subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception].&#xD;
&#xD;
                  ii. Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or&#xD;
                  without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks&#xD;
                  before starting treatment with alpelisib. In case of oophorectomy alone, only&#xD;
                  when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone&#xD;
                  level assessment iii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate&#xD;
                  post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For&#xD;
                  female patients participating to this IPP, the vasectomized male partner should&#xD;
                  be the sole partner for that patient] iv. Use a combination of the following&#xD;
                  (both a+b):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                       suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not&#xD;
                  allowed as alpelisibBYL719 may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal&#xD;
                  contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  * Please consult your local product labels should any concomitant medications be&#xD;
                  used, as this period may be longer for other potentially genotoxic compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  A female is considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they&#xD;
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have&#xD;
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six&#xD;
                  weeks ago before the treatment start. For females with therapy-induced&#xD;
                  amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of Follicle-Stimulating Hormone&#xD;
                  (FSH) and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  NOTE: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone&#xD;
                  (LHRH) agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for&#xD;
                  induction of ovarian suppression.&#xD;
