  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the the safety and efficacy of ARO-AAT Injection&#xD;
      (also referred to as ARO-AAT) administered subcutaneously to patients with alpha-1&#xD;
      antitrypsin deficiency.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be enrolled to receive multiple subcutaneous injections of ARO-AAT. All&#xD;
      eligible participants will require a pre-dose biopsy completed as part of the study within&#xD;
      the screening window. All participants will undergo an End of Study (EOS) biopsy. Treated&#xD;
      participants will be offered the opportunity to continue treatment in an open label extension&#xD;
      during which they will undergo a final biopsy.&#xD;
