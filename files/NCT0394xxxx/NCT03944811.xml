  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Missing teeth usually result in functional and cosmetic deficits. Traditionally, they have&#xD;
      been restored with dentures or fixed bridges. However, dental implants represent an excellent&#xD;
      alternative which rely on the maintenance of a direct structural and functional connection&#xD;
      between living bone and implant surface, which is termed osseointergration. When sufficient&#xD;
      bone is available in maxilla, implant rehabilitation has shown high success rates of 84-92 %.&#xD;
      Atrophy of the alveolar crest and pneumatization of the maxillary sinus limits the quality&#xD;
      and quantity of residual bone, therefore complicating the placement of implants in the&#xD;
      posterior maxillary area.&#xD;

      Many solutions were suggested to overcome the problem of placing implants in the vertically&#xD;
      compromised bone height in the maxillary posterior region. These solutions include the&#xD;
      placement of short wide implants, long tilted zygomatic implants, vertical ridge augmentation&#xD;
      and elevation of the sinus membrane to increase the available length for implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of short implants (&lt;10 mm in length) is a reasonable solution that reduces the risk&#xD;
      of interference with anatomic structures and claimed to have success rate as high as&#xD;
      conventional implants. However, short implants have faced many challenges due to less&#xD;
      bone-to-implant contact, more crestal bone resorption, and compromised crown-to-implant&#xD;
      ratio. Another treatment option is the use of zygomatic implants. However, many complications&#xD;
      may be associated with zygomatic implants such as oro-antral fistula formation, maxillary&#xD;
      sinusitis, and peri-implant bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vertical augmentation of the resorbed alveolar ridge is another treatment option. It can be&#xD;
      done by onlay grafting, distraction osteogenesis and guided bone regeneration. Although&#xD;
      success rates of various bone grafting techniques are high, there are many inherent&#xD;
      disadvantages which include prolonged treatment times, raised treatment costs and increased&#xD;
      surgical invasion associated with patient morbidity and potential complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these problems, elevation of the sinus membrane techniques were proposed, it can&#xD;
      be performed either through a lateral window, or via a crestal access. The selection between&#xD;
      these two techniques is mainly based on the remaining residual vertical subsinus bone height.&#xD;
      Lateral approach of sinus elevation is indicated when the residual bone height is of 4 mm or&#xD;
      less, while the crestal approach is used in case of residual ridge of 5-6 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many long term studies and systematic reviews have showed that osteotome mediated sinus floor&#xD;
      elevation (OSFE) technique is a highly predictable method for rehabilitation of patients with&#xD;
      atrophied posterior maxilla with survival rates ranging from 92 % to 100 %. However,&#xD;
      endoscopic studies have demonstrated the risk of membrane perforation while performing&#xD;
      transalveolar sinus floor elevation. Moreover, the Summers technique can cause some&#xD;
      complications as headache and paroxysmal positional vertigo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The piezoelectric internal sinus elevation (PISE) technique was first introduced by Sohn in&#xD;
      2009. Using piezoelectric ultrasonic vibration (25-30 kHz), the piezosurgery device cuts only&#xD;
      mineralized structures precisely without cutting soft tissues even in case of accidental&#xD;
      contact. Moreover, the cavitation effect produces a hydropneumatic pressure in the&#xD;
      physiological saline solution that leads to atraumatic sinus membrane elevation. Another&#xD;
      advantage of piezosurgery is its precision as the movement of the piezosurgery knife is very&#xD;
      small, so the cutting precision is great and the patients discomfort is minimal. In addition,&#xD;
      the air-water cavitation effect of the piezoelectric device sustains a blood-free surgical&#xD;
      field which improves visualization of the surgical field. This technique overcomes the&#xD;
      problem of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo caused by malleting during the osteotome&#xD;
      mediated sinus floor elevation.&#xD;
