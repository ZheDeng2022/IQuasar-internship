      In summary, the investigators propose to study elite Croatian breath-hold and SCUBA divers.&#xD;
      The investigators will quantify breath-hold hypoxia- and SCUBA diving-induced pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension and right heart function to investigate the relationships between PFO and IPAVA&#xD;
      blood flow. The investigators will use a placebo-controlled intervention (sildenafil) to&#xD;
      reduce pulmonary arterial pressure in these subjects to examine the impact of the change in&#xD;
      pressure (or absence of change) on the relationships determined above.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (increased lung blood pressure) is a multifactorial disease&#xD;
      without a cure. Investigating reversible forms of pulmonary hypertension induced under&#xD;
      extreme conditions such as a prolonged breath-hold and/or SCUBA diving may help to better&#xD;
      understand why some individuals develop this devastating disease, and others do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary arterial pressure is typically very low in healthy humans. Low oxygen levels&#xD;
      (hypoxia) cause a constriction of the lung blood vessels resulting in smaller diameters, but&#xD;
      lung blood flow stays constant or increases. Having constant flow with smaller vessel&#xD;
      diameters causes pulmonary arterial pressure to increase but it will return to normal once&#xD;
      normal oxygen levels are restored. Moreover, there is an association with patent foramen&#xD;
      ovale (PFO, small hole between the atria in the heart) and excessive pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      pressures in low oxygen conditions. However, the reasons for the exacerbated increase in&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial pressure in these subjects with a PFO (PFO+) is unknown, but may be due to&#xD;
      an exaggerated constriction response to low oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a breath-hold, the oxygen in the lung decreases and in elite breath-hold divers, it&#xD;
      decreases to very low levels. Compared to subjects without a PFO (PFO-), the oxygen may drop&#xD;
      even lower in those PFO+ subjects because deoxygenated blood travels through the small hole&#xD;
      to mix with oxygenated blood, exacerbating the level to which blood oxygen decreases. Thus,&#xD;
      using a breath-hold model of lung hypoxia is one approach to examining a hypoxia-induced&#xD;
      increase in pulmonary arterial pressure - a method critically dependent upon the elite&#xD;
      breath-hold diver's ability to hold their breath for significant durations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses (IPAVA) are vessels within the lung that bypass&#xD;
      capillaries. The investigator's group has investigated the possible roles these unique&#xD;
      vessels may have in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. The investigators have&#xD;
      found that IPAVA blood flow occurs when healthy subjects breathe low oxygen gas. The&#xD;
      investigators have also found that IPAVA blood flow is inversely related to pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial pressure. Specifically, individuals with high pulmonary arterial pressures have low&#xD;
      IPAVA blood flow and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The right ventricle of the heart pumps blood through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Under&#xD;
      resting conditions the right heart performs a minimal amount of work because the pressure in&#xD;
      the lung blood vessels is low. When pulmonary arterial pressure increases, the work of the&#xD;
      right side of the heart has to increase substantially to keep blood pumping through the lung.&#xD;
      Thus, high pulmonary arterial pressures will increase the work of the right heart and may&#xD;
      lead to right heart dysfunction thereby limiting the amount of blood the heart can pump. If&#xD;
      the pressure is high enough to limit the amount of blood flowing through the lung then this&#xD;
      can be detected by a reduction in pulmonary blood flow and/or changes in the function of the&#xD;
      heart during contraction (systole) and relaxation (diastole). Accordingly, an intervention&#xD;
      that reduces pulmonary arterial pressures during a breath-hold may have a beneficial effect&#xD;
      on right heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, during an elite breath-hold dive, where the level of oxygen decreases, the&#xD;
      investigators expect that pulmonary arterial pressures will increase as lung oxygen levels&#xD;
      decrease, and the reduction in oxygen may be even lower in PFO+ subjects. Furthermore, as&#xD;
      blood oxygen levels decrease, IPAVA blood flow will increase in some PFO- subjects thereby&#xD;
      keeping pulmonary arterial pressures low in those individuals. Conversely, PFO+ subjects and&#xD;
      those PFO- subjects with low levels of IPAVA blood flow would be expected to have the&#xD;
      greatest pulmonary pressures. Whether or not this is true is unknown. Therefore, Objective #1&#xD;
      will quantify pulmonary arterial pressure and right heart function and investigate their&#xD;
      relationships with PFO and IPAVA blood flow in elite breath-hold divers while breathing&#xD;
      concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide that mimic breath-hold-induced hypoxia [NOTE: it&#xD;
      is not possible to image the heart during a breath hold because the fully inflated lung&#xD;
      obstructs the ultrasound view of the heart]. Objective #2 will use sildenafil, a drug that&#xD;
      increases nitric oxide bioavailability to dilate lung blood vessels, to decrease pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial pressure while breathing concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide that mimic&#xD;
      breath-hold-induced hypoxia. Investigators will quantify the effect of sildenafil on&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial pressure and right heart function and will determine if it alters the&#xD;
      relationship with IPAVA and PFO blood flow. As mentioned above, because those PFO+ subjects&#xD;
      may have an exaggerated pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to hypoxia, sildenafil may be&#xD;
      either less effective or ineffective in reducing the pulmonary arterial pressure in these&#xD;
      subjects. Objective #3 will compare the elite breath hold diver study data to data obtained&#xD;
      in age, sex and PFO matched subjects who do not have extensive experience with breath hold&#xD;
      diving. To do this control subjects will undergo the same procedures in Objectives #1 &amp; 2&#xD;
      above. These studies will also allow investigators to determine if there are differences in&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia between those with and without breath hold diving&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the heart and lung alterations that occur in breath hold divers outlined&#xD;
      above, it is also known that pulmonary arterial pressure increases after SCUBA diving, but&#xD;
      returns to normal within a few hours. The mechanisms responsible for the increase in&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial pressure are unknown, but are independent of hypoxia. Thus, investigating&#xD;
      the relationship between IPAVA, PFO and SCUBA diving-induced increases in pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      pressures offers an additional avenue for understanding pulmonary arterial hypertension&#xD;
      susceptibility. Although it is unknown why pulmonary arterial pressure increases with SCUBA&#xD;
      diving, it is known that pulmonary hypertension may contribute to right heart dysfunction and&#xD;
      pulmonary edema (lung water accumulation) that can occur in subjects who are swimming and/or&#xD;
      SCUBA diving. Prevention of increased pulmonary arterial pressures during and/or after a dive&#xD;
      may help to prevent excessive right heart dysfunction and pulmonary edema. Thus, Objective #4&#xD;
      will quantify pulmonary arterial pressure and right heart function and investigate their&#xD;
      relationships with PFO and IPAVA blood flow, pre- and post-SCUBA diving. Objective #5 will&#xD;
      quantify the effect of sildenafil (post dive) on pulmonary arterial pressure and right heart&#xD;
      function and will determine if it alters the relationship with IPAVA and PFO blood flow, pre-&#xD;
      and post-SCUBA diving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the investigators propose to study elite Croatian breath-hold and SCUBA divers.&#xD;
      Investigators will quantify breath-hold hypoxia- and SCUBA diving-induced pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension and right heart function to investigate the relationships between PFO and IPAVA&#xD;
      blood flow. Investigators will use a placebo-controlled intervention (sildenafil) to reduce&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial pressure in these subjects to examine the impact of the change in pressure&#xD;
      (or absence of change) on the relationships determined above.&#xD;
