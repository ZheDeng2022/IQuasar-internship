    <textblock>
      This is a prospective,randomized, cross over study comparing the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      nebulizedfurosemide with Intra Venous (IV)furosemide in preterm infants who areventilator-and&#xD;
      oxygen dependent. Reviewing the patient census on Neo data by the Sub Investigator will&#xD;
      identify the potential subjects. Subject will be randomized to either A arm or B arm.&#xD;
      Subjects in the A arm will receive 1 mg/kg of inhaled furosemideQ 24 hours for 3 days. This&#xD;
      will be followed by a washout period of a day followed by 1mg/kg of intravenous furosemide Q&#xD;
      24 hours for 3 days. Subjects in the B arm will receive 1 mg/kg of intravenous furosemide Q&#xD;
      24 hours for 3 days followed by a washout period, which is then followed by 1 mg/kg of&#xD;
      inhaled furosemide Q 24 hours for 3 days.&#xD;
