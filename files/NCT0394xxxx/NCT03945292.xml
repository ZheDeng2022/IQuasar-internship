  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of AROAAT2001 (SEQUOIA) is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      multiple doses of the investigational product, ARO-AAT, administered subcutaneously to&#xD;
      participants with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be enrolled to receive multiple subcutaneous injections of ARO-AAT or&#xD;
      placebo. Eligible participants will require a pre-dose biopsy completed as part of the study&#xD;
      within the screening window. However, any participant with a biopsy result within 1 year of&#xD;
      screening showing no fibrosis does not require a pre-dose biopsy. Only participants who have&#xD;
      liver fibrosis will undergo a post-dose biopsy and may continue treatment in an open-label&#xD;
      extension.&#xD;
