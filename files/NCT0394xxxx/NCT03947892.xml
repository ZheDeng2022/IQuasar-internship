  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the VADS represents the majority of cancers in ENT. Metastatic&#xD;
      lymph node involvement is an important prognostic factor. In N0 patients clinically and&#xD;
      scanographically, the prevalence of cervical lymph node metastasis remains important. Only&#xD;
      the anatomopathological analysis of cervical lymph node dissection confirms the presence of a&#xD;
      micro-metastasis. However, new criteria of interpretation in nuclear medicine seem promising&#xD;
      in the detection of lymph node lesions not detectable in traditional imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to study the positive predictive value (PPV) of CT scans&#xD;
      in the anatomo-pathological analysis of N0 clinical and radiological or N + unilateral neck&#xD;
      ganglia in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to study the positive predictive value of PET-CT in the identification&#xD;
      of infra-clinical lymph node lesions for cancers of the oral cavity classified N0 or N +&#xD;
      unilateral&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are admitted to ORL or maxillofacial consultation with initial clinical examination&#xD;
      according to current recommendations (tumor evaluation, cervical palpation, locoregional&#xD;
      examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dated and signed diagram of the lesion and ganglionic areas will be made during this&#xD;
      consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biopsy for histopathological examination of the lesion will be necessary to confirm the&#xD;
      diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma with P16 analysis. It will be performed during the&#xD;
      consultation under local anesthesia if the lesion is accessible or under general anesthesia&#xD;
      during panendoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will benefit from an assessment of locoregional extension by CT cervicofacial&#xD;
      and thoracic injected (in order to look for possible pulmonary metastases or suspicious&#xD;
      mediastinal lymphadenopathies) as requested in the oncological recommendations and PET-CT. As&#xD;
      part of the extension assessment, a panendoscopy or bronchial fibroscopy and&#xD;
      gastro-oesophageal failure will be performed if risk factors ethanolotagagic are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the lesion is not accessible for a biopsy during the inclusion visit, the patient is&#xD;
      summoned for a panendoscopy. It is an examination under general anesthesia to make a biopsy&#xD;
      of the primary tumor and to search for the absence of synchronous localization. In current&#xD;
      practice, this examination requires overnight hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be reviewed by the ORL or maxillofacial surgeon in consultation after&#xD;
      receiving the anatomopathological findings of the lesion and the entire extension assessment&#xD;
      (CT cervico-thoracic injected and PET-CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On CT PET, an analysis with additional interpretation criteria will be performed (SUVmax, SUV&#xD;
      peak, MTG) on the primary tumor and on the invaded lymph nodes. A ganglion is considered&#xD;
      invaded when its SUV is suppressed at 30% of the SUV of the original lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's file will have been previously presented in a Multidisciplinary Concertation&#xD;
      Meeting, whose treatment will consist of a surgical excision of the primary lesion and a&#xD;
      lymph node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be seen again in consultation at 10 days of his intervention as part of the&#xD;
      follow-up postoperative in order to be able to receive all the anatomopathologic results of&#xD;
      the operative specimen and ganglion dissection. The patient's record will have been&#xD;
      represented in CPR in order to decide whether or not to have an adjuvant treatment based on&#xD;
      the anatomopathological characters (capsular rupture, number of ganglions invaded,&#xD;
      peri-nervous sheath).&#xD;
