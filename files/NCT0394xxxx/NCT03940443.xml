      Introduction: Patients suffering a time-critical medical condition require rapid prehospital&#xD;
      assessment and treatment and most often quick transportation to definitive care. This can be&#xD;
      decisive for patient outcome. In order to minimize time from assessment to treatment, thus&#xD;
      lowering mortality and morbidity, it is important to have a well-coordinated chain of care.&#xD;
      The efficient use of Ground Emergency Medical Services (GEMS) and Helicopter Emergency&#xD;
      Medical Services (HEMS) is essential in such a chain of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim is to describe differences in mortality, morbidity, assessment and&#xD;
      treatment of two time-critical conditions, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI), in patients assessed by GEMS and HEMS respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The project consists of a descriptive observational study and comparative cohort&#xD;
      study. Inclusion criteria are patients considered to be suffering from TBI and acute MI,&#xD;
      which are treated by GEMS or HEMS in the regions of Uppsala, Jämtland/Härjedalen, Dalarna and&#xD;
      Värmland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance: The results expect to be the basis for further studies aiming to&#xD;
      optimize the utilization of GEMS and HEMS.&#xD;

      Background Efficient healthcare can be decisive for patients who suffer an out-of-hospital&#xD;
      time-critical medical condition. If untreated these conditions can compromise health and even&#xD;
      become life-threatening. The most common time-critical conditions assessed and treated in the&#xD;
      prehospital environment are cardiac arrest, chest pain, stroke, severe respiratory&#xD;
      difficulties and severe trauma. In addition to receiving rapid assessment and immediate&#xD;
      treatment, it is also important that these patients are quickly transported to a location&#xD;
      where they can receive the appropriate level of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a person is suffering from an out-of-hospital time-critical medical condition, the&#xD;
      emergency medical dispatch center is alerted when contacted by the use of '112' the emergency&#xD;
      phone number common to European countries. An operator will answer the call and assess the&#xD;
      situation using a medical criteria-based index . The operator will than dispatch the right&#xD;
      resource, either Ground Emergency Medical Services (GEMS) or Helicopter Emergency Medical&#xD;
      Services (HEMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dispatching of HEMS has long been considered as a weak link in the chain of response. The&#xD;
      use of HEMS is region specific and that the mechanism of injury is a poor predictor for HEMS&#xD;
      dispatch. Dispatch criteria should be designed to match specific systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prehospital care in Sweden has developed rapidly over recent decades. Prehospital care&#xD;
      today is a system in which qualified prehospital care providers deliver advanced emergency&#xD;
      healthcare. GEMS vehicles are staffed with at least one registered nurse (RN) and over the&#xD;
      years programs has been developed, which leads to at postgraduate diploma in prehospital care&#xD;
      nursing. GEMS has less access to medical-technical equipment for advanced medical life&#xD;
      support and critical care. The HEMS medical staff consists of a RN with a postgraduate&#xD;
      diploma in prehospital care nursing and a physician, specialized in anaesthesia and intensive&#xD;
      care and HEMS is equipped for advanced life support and critical care interventions. All of&#xD;
      Sweden´s Emergency Medical Services (EMS) organisations require educational programs and&#xD;
      certification for prehospital trauma and emergency medical care on a yearly basis. These&#xD;
      educational programs aim to improve emergency care based on evidence based medicine. Previous&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that EMS provides rapid access to the healthcare system, quality&#xD;
      care on scene, and transport with support en-route to appropriate care if not provided on&#xD;
      scene. An increased survival rate could be identified in trauma patients if transported by&#xD;
      HEMS, compared to GEMS. Another study reported increased survival rate of patients over 55&#xD;
      years of age who suffered minor trauma and where transported by HEMS compared to GEMS.&#xD;
      Previous studies has also shown an advantage in using HEMS in treating patients with acute&#xD;
      MI, initiating treatment as early as possible. The time gained, using HEMS, in treating acute&#xD;
      MI was reported to reduced mortality compared to patients treated by GEMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a steadily growing body of literature that describes the activities in both GEMS and&#xD;
      HEMS and the assessment and treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and acute Myocardial&#xD;
      Infarction (MI). But these studies are not generalisable to the Swedish prehospital&#xD;
      environment, due to the importance of evaluating triage criteria for HEMS activation by local&#xD;
      and regional authorities and the variation of health care system in which GEMS and HEMS&#xD;
      operate. A systematic collection and analysis of incidence and outcomes in prehospital care&#xD;
      of time-critical conditions can therefore increase dispatch accuracy and contribute to&#xD;
      knowledge about which patients should be assessed and treated by GEMS and HEMS, respectively.&#xD;
      This, in turn can lead to cost-effectiveness and better outcomes. Previous studies have been&#xD;
      criticized for the low quality of evidence and variation in study methods, which overall has&#xD;
      resulted in a lack of credibility in the conclusions of the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TBI is a major cause of death, disability and cost to society. The perceived benefit of HEMS&#xD;
      transport of trauma patients, including TBI is driven by the principle that time is a&#xD;
      critical factor in the survival of severely injured patients. For patients with acute MI,&#xD;
      time to treatment should be short as possible because every delay increases mortality. Since&#xD;
      today, from a national perspective, both descriptive data and evidence in the form of studies&#xD;
      comparing GEMS and HEMS are modest, it is very important to describe GEMS and HEMS for&#xD;
      assessment, treatment and outcome of patients suffering from TBI and acute MI. Once a&#xD;
      thorough description of GEMS and HEMS has been completed, hypothesis-generating controlled&#xD;
      studies can be initiated. The project is expected to contribute to optimisation of the&#xD;
      prehospital assessment and treatment of TBI and acute MI and the role of GEMS and HEMS in&#xD;
      Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall aim To describe and to compare morbidity and mortality, assessment and treatment of&#xD;
      TBI and acute MI in patients treated by GEMS and HEMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim Study I To describe the scope and characteristics of GEMS and HEMS assessing and&#xD;
      treating patients with TBI and acute MI in the field of prehospital care and to illustrate&#xD;
      the complexity of the topic. The collected data will be the starting point for study II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II To understand the effects of GEMS compared to HEMS in patients suffering from TBI&#xD;
      and acute MI and what care logistics should we use. Previous collected data from study I will&#xD;
      be used for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study I&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the incidence of mortality and morbidity in the assessment and treatment of TBI&#xD;
           and acute MI of GEMS and HEMS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What types of assessment and treatment are performed in patients with TBI and acute MI?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the field diagnosis accuracy related to final diagnosis? Are there differences&#xD;
           in diagnose accuracy in patients treated and transported with GEMS vs. HEMS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the differences between GEMS vs. HEMS on mortality and morbidity in patients&#xD;
           suffering from TBI and acute MI?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis (study II): HEMS compared to GEMS provides significant time gains resulting in&#xD;
      fewer morbidity and reduced mortality when assessing and treating patients with TBI and acute&#xD;
      MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Study I is a descriptive observation study with quantitative approach. Study II&#xD;
      consists of a comparative cohort study with 30-day follow up. These studies will be reported&#xD;
      according to STROBE´s recommendations for observational studies and cohort studies. The&#xD;
      project will be registered in ClinicalTrials.gov before the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study I consists of patients considered to be suffering a TBI or acute MI and been treated by&#xD;
      either GEMS or HEMS during the period of January 1st, 2018 to December 31st, 2018. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria are GEMS and HEMS prehospital care providers, men and women ≥18 years of age in a&#xD;
      time-critical condition. Exclusion criteria are men and women &lt; 18 years of age in a&#xD;
      non-time-critical condition. Participating counties are located in the middle of Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II consists of patients considered to be suffering from a TBI or acute MI treated by&#xD;
      GEMS prehospital care providers (Reference) (n=2000) and HEMS (Exposed) (n=2000) during the&#xD;
      period of January 1st, 2017 to December 31st, 2018. Inclusion criteria are GEMS and HEMS&#xD;
      prehospital care providers, men and women ≥18 years of age in a time-critical condition.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are men and women &lt; 18 years of age. Participating counties are located in&#xD;
      the middle of Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data for both studies is collected from existing digital and manual&#xD;
      prehospital care reports (digital models: Cosmic, Ortivus, Paratus, TakeCare and manually&#xD;
      written prehospital care reports (PCR)). The participating prehospital care providers will be&#xD;
      the regional council of Uppsala, Jämtland/Härjedalen and Dalarna and the county council of&#xD;
      Värmland. Data retrieved is scene location, time from dispatch to arrival to the patient on&#xD;
      scene, time from dispatch to prehospital assessment/treatment, time from dispatch to patient&#xD;
      arrival at the receiving health care facility, location of the receiving facility, type of&#xD;
      condition, vital signs in the prehospital setting, treatment and survey of the patient.&#xD;
      Searching and extracting data will be done using protocols where the study outcomes are&#xD;
      documented as intended to answer the purpose of the study. Exported data from all patient&#xD;
      record systems are reviewed for quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IBM SPSS Version 25 Statistics Program will be used. The collected data will be processed&#xD;
      with descriptive and comparative analyses as with regression models to evaluate the&#xD;
      significance of variables for medical complications and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposed group: Patients suffering TBI or acute MI and has been treated by HEMS crews&#xD;
      dispatched by an emergency dispatch centre re in all the counties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference group: Patients suffering TBI or acute MI and has been treated by GEMS dispatched&#xD;
      by an emergency dispatch centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible confounders Several confounders are yet unknown but this will be probably clarified&#xD;
      by study I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome The primary outcome is mortality, and will be controlled with measure of time from&#xD;
      dispatch to assessment and treatment to patient arrival at the receiving medical facility The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are comorbidity (diabetes), medical complications (Infection, haemorrhage)&#xD;
      and 30-day mortality. Independent variables: HEMS vs GEMS and these groups will be controlled&#xD;
      for age, sex and possible other variables that will be examined for their impact on&#xD;
      regression models&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the groups (Study II) Exposed group: Patients suffering TBI or acute MI and&#xD;
      has been treated by helicopter emergency medical service crews dispatched by an emergency&#xD;
      dispatch center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference group: Patients suffering TBI or acute MI and has been treated by ground emergency&#xD;
      medical service care providers dispatched by an emergency dispatch center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation: A power calculation is made in study II where comparative analysis are to&#xD;
      be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of project logistics Information on the aim of study I and its implementation&#xD;
      will be provided to the staff at all HEMS bases and to all ambulance stations in the regions&#xD;
      participating in the study. The information will be given primarily to the medical director&#xD;
      and the director of operations responsible for HEMS operations and GEMS. Data extract from&#xD;
      digital PCR systems will be carried out by the operation managers. Manual data collection&#xD;
      from HEMS is carried out by the collaborator of the study on the basis of approval from the&#xD;
      director of operations. Data extracts of patients considered to suffer an TBI or acute MI are&#xD;
      performed based on the outcomes of the study. Data extracts are handed over unidentified to&#xD;
      researcher and is provided in a pre-defined folder on the computer of the responsible&#xD;
      researcher through the server of the region where the computer is encrypted.&#xD;
