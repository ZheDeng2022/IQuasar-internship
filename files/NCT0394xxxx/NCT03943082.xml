  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well a follow-up phone call regarding financial reimbursement program&#xD;
      (FRP) works in improving cancer patients' access to therapeutic cancer clinical trials.&#xD;
      Follow-up phone call intervention regarding FRP may improve recruitment of cancer patients to&#xD;
      cancer therapeutic clinical trials.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are limited financial models that address the economic hardship associated with&#xD;
      clinical research participation and how it might restrict clinical research access. The&#xD;
      Lazarex Foundation offers a financial reimbursement program (FRP) to help patients and&#xD;
      caregivers cover the out-of-pocket costs associated with clinical trial participation for&#xD;
      almost ten years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iMPACT is a pilot study to assess the overall feasibility of conducting a multi-center trial&#xD;
      of the Lazarex sliding scale FRP among sociodemographically diverse patients of all cancer&#xD;
      types enrolling/potentially enrolling in therapeutic clinical trials (TCTs). The study will&#xD;
      formalize informing patients or parents/legal guardians of patients about the Lazarex&#xD;
      sliding-scale FRP in order to evaluate whether operationalizing intensive follow-up about the&#xD;
      Lazarex FRP improves recruitment to cancer TCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients or parents/legal guardians of patients will be offered information about the FRP&#xD;
      at initial time of TCT discussion/consent for the iMPACT study, however, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive an additional follow-up call about the FRP or no follow-up call&#xD;
      (usual care). Participants who are randomized to usual care will be provided a phone number&#xD;
      for the Lazarex Foundation that they or their parent or legal guardian may contact directly.&#xD;
      Therefore all patients or parents/legal guardians of patients in the study have access to FRP&#xD;
      eligibility assessment through the Lazarex Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants or parents/legal guardians of participants will be surveyed at baseline (time of&#xD;
      consent to iMPACT) and interviewed 30 days after consent to iMPACT. If a participant enrolls&#xD;
      in a therapeutic clinical trial, he/she will also be given an additional survey after TCT&#xD;
      participation and interviewed up to 90 days after TCT participation.&#xD;
