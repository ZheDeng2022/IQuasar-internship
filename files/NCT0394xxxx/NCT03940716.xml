  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a randomized control trial design (RCT) to pilot test a multisession&#xD;
      remote therapy behavioral intervention for risky firearm behaviors and associated&#xD;
      behaviors/consequences among adolescents. The study will pilot a state-of-the-art&#xD;
      intervention delivery approaches (e.g., remote therapy, smartphone-based APP intervention&#xD;
      content delivery) for reducing violence and associated behaviors among urban youth. Given the&#xD;
      significant morality and mortality associated with firearm violence, the study will have&#xD;
      significant impact by identifying optimal intervention strategies for future large-scale&#xD;
      behavioral intervention trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this pilot study is to pilot test an m-health intervention, as compared&#xD;
      to enhanced usual care [n=70; 35/group], with eligible youth to assess intervention&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity, as well as trends towards decreased risky firearm&#xD;
      behaviors, substance use, and criminal justice involvement. Specifically, 70 youth (ages&#xD;
      16-24) in the ED screening positive for firearm carriage and smartphone ownership will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned (stratified by age/gender) to either the IntERact group or the control&#xD;
      group. IntERact group participants will receive an Emergency Department (ED) session of&#xD;
      behavioral therapy, followed by five additional remote therapy sessions of behavioral therapy&#xD;
      delivered over the 5 weeks following their ED visit. Behavioral therapy will be comprised of&#xD;
      motivational interviewing (MI), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and strengths-based care&#xD;
      management (CM). In addition, youth in the IntERact group will also receive a smartphone APP&#xD;
      that will be downloaded to their phone. The APP will deliver daily surveys, daily tailored MI&#xD;
      and CBT messages in response to survey results, one-touch access to pro-social supports,&#xD;
      psycho-educational materials, GPS-enabled message alerts, and facilitated access to CM&#xD;
      resources. Youth enrolled in the control group will receive a pamphlet with local violence,&#xD;
      substance use, and mental health resources. A follow-up assessment will be completed in each&#xD;
      group at 4 months post-ED visit. Pilot data will aid in refining and clarifying content and&#xD;
      clinical trial design elements for a future fully powered randomized control trial of the&#xD;
      intervention (i.e., R01 proposal).&#xD;

    <description>Participant satisfaction measures of helpfulness and likability will be assessed for individual intervention sessions and content (measured during post-tests after each session and at the 4-month follow-up).&#xD;
Measures have been used in prior work (Walton 2010) and each item is scored on a 5-point likert scale (1=not at all; 5=extremely) with % of enrolled patients who completed sessions reporting scores of 4 or 5 reporting high likability or helpfulness.</description>
