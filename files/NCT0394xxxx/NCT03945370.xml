  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      McArdle disease, glycogen storage disease type V, is a rare metabolic disease. Affected&#xD;
      individuals are unable to utilize sugar stored as glycogen in muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that ketones can be an alternative fuel substrate for skeletal&#xD;
      muscle when muscle glycogenolysis is blocked as in McArdle disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study investigators will investigate the immediate effects of an oral supplementation&#xD;
      of exogenous ketone bodies (poly-hydroxybuturate) on exercise capacity in patients with&#xD;
      metabolic myopathies, compared with a placebo drink.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      McArdle disease, glycogen storage disease type V, is a rare metabolic disease caused by&#xD;
      mutations in the PYGM gene resulting in absence of the enzyme muscle phosphorylase. Affected&#xD;
      individuals are unable to utilize sugar stored as glycogen in muscle, leading to exercise&#xD;
      intolerance, exercise-induced muscle pain, contractures and rhabdomyolysis, which may cause&#xD;
      renal failure. Currently, there are no satisfactory treatment options for McArdle disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key element of alleviating symptoms in McArdle disease is to provide alternative fuels for&#xD;
      energy metabolism. Investigators hypothesize that ketones can be an alternative fuel&#xD;
      substrate for skeletal muscle when muscle glycogenolysis is blocked as in McArdle disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To investigate the immediate effects of an oral supplementation of exogenous ketone&#xD;
      bodies (poly-hydroxybuturate) on exercise capacity in patients with metabolic myopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplement description: food supplement containing β-hydroxybuturate esters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Placebo-controlled, single-blind, cross-over study. Inclusion: 5-8 patients&#xD;
      with McArdle disease and 3-5 healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time table:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will meet to 2 test days. Subjects will be randomized using a 1:1 assignment ratio&#xD;
      to receive either the keto-drink or placebo drink first. The oral supplement received will be&#xD;
      blinded for the participants and the investigators. On each test day, subjects spend&#xD;
      approximately 4 hours at the laboratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insertion of peripheral brachial venous catheters for extracting blood samples and&#xD;
           stable isotope infusion and hydroxybutyrate infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline blood sampling, medical examination, vital sign measurements, weight and&#xD;
           height.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stable isotope infusion 2 hours before the cycling exercise test. Three stable isotope&#xD;
           tracers [2,4-13C2]-D- β-hydroxybutyrate, [1,1,2,3,3-2H5]-glycerol and [6,6-2H2]-glucose&#xD;
           solutions, are infused via a venous catheter until a steady-state is reached. The tracer&#xD;
           infusions will continue during the cycling test. The tracers (all from Cambridge Isotope&#xD;
           Laboratories, Andover, MA, USA) will be dissolved and injected into a solution of 0.9%&#xD;
           saline (NaCl) through a bacterial filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One Ketone or placebo drink administration 30 minutes before the exercise test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will perform a 40 minutes cycle exercise test at a constant load corresponding&#xD;
           to 60-70% of their VO2max (found in a screening study). During the test, subjects wear a&#xD;
           mask for continuous gas-exchange measurements and ECG electrodes to determine VO2 and&#xD;
           heart rate during constant load cycling (VO2const and HRconst). Blood samples will be&#xD;
           drawn 4 times before, every 10 minutes during exercise and after exercise. During the&#xD;
           test participants will be asked to rate perceived exertion (RPE) on a Borg scale.&#xD;
