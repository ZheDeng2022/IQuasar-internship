      This is a 2-arm, prospective, randomized (2:1 ratio), open-label, multi-centre, phase II&#xD;
      study conducted in patients affected by unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      urothelial cancer receiving niraparib plus best supportive care versus best supportive care&#xD;
      as maintenance therapy after a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of niraparib plus Best&#xD;
      Supportive Care (BSC) vs. BSC alone, as maintenance treatment, in terms of prolongation of&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial&#xD;
      cancer that obtained disease control (objective response or stable disease) with first-line&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;

      This is a 2-arm, prospective, randomized (2:1 ratio), open-label, multi-centre, phase II&#xD;
      study conducted in patients affected by unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      urothelial cancer receiving niraparib plus best supportive care versus best supportive care&#xD;
      as maintenance therapy after a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of niraparib plus Best&#xD;
      Supportive Care (BSC) vs. BSC alone, as maintenance treatment, in terms of prolongation of&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial&#xD;
      cancer that obtained disease control (objective response or stable disease) with first-line&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors sensitivity is based on the&#xD;
      presence of truncating and missense mutations in genes associated with the homologous&#xD;
      recombination pathways. In The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset approximately 34% of bladder&#xD;
      urothelial carcinoma harbored these mutations. Furthermore, in this study we plan to select a&#xD;
      population potentially sensible to niraparib, by enrolling patients responding to platinum,&#xD;
      indeed we know that there is a cross-sensitivity and a cross-resistance between platinum&#xD;
      drugs and PARP inhibitors in urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFS is commonly adopted as primary endpoint in randomized phase II trials. Randomized design&#xD;
      for phase II trials has been increasingly adopted in recent years, to allow a formal&#xD;
      comparison between experimental and standard treatment. This should lead to a better&#xD;
      interpretation of the results obtained with the experimental treatment, that are in most&#xD;
      cases difficult to interpret in the absence of controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of the study is calculated with &quot;relaxed&quot; statistical criteria. The study&#xD;
      design will verify if the experimental treatment (Niraparib) is promising enough to warrant a&#xD;
      phase 3 trial for efficacy compared to observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 65 PFS events are needed to provide 80% power to detect an hazard ratio (HR) of&#xD;
      0.57 (1.75), corresponding to a median increase in progression-free survival from 4 to 7&#xD;
      months, with one-tailed alpha 0.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With an accrual duration of 24 months, and additional 6 months of follow up after the&#xD;
      completion of recruitment, 77 patient need to be randomized (26 assigned to control arm and&#xD;
      51 assigned to experimental arm) to obtain the 65 events needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size of the phase II trial is too small to plan a formal analysis of interaction of&#xD;
      treatment efficacy with type of response at first line treatment (i.e. objective response vs.&#xD;
      stable disease). However, type of response to first line treatment will be among&#xD;
      stratification factor for randomization, so the 2 treatment groups will be balanced.&#xD;
      Exploratory subgroup analysis of treatment efficacy in patient who have obtained objective&#xD;
      response with first line and in patients who have obtained stable disease with first line&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;

    <description>The study will collect information about patient health-related quality of life using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C30. Multi-item scales are computed by calculating the mean raw scores of single items and transforming them linearly so that all scales range from 0 to 100. For single items, only linear transformation is performed. For functioning scales (i.e. those exploring physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning and global health status), the higher the value the better the level of function; for symptoms scales and items, the higher the value the worse the severity of symptoms.</description>
