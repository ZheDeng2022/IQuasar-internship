      The study will be performed as a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial. HFA has been&#xD;

      failure), and numerous studies have shown its efficiency in this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this good evidence for HFA in hypoxic respiratory failure, it has only reluctantly&#xD;
      been used for hypercapnic respiratory failure. HFA has been shown to generate PEEP, despite&#xD;
      not being a closed system, and to improve CO2 clearance by flushing anatomical dead space. It&#xD;
      might also help to reduce inspiratory resistance and facilitate secretion clearance from&#xD;
      humidified gas. A study on COPD patients showed an increase in breathing pressure amplitude&#xD;
      and mean pressure, as well as tidal volume, with a trend towards reduction of carbon dioxide&#xD;
      partial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention consists of HFA using standard equipment at the department. A gas flow of 60&#xD;
      litres per minute and a FiO2 as clinically feasible will be used. Therapy will be continued&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and one of the most&#xD;
      frequently encountered problems at the emergency department. Hypercapnic or hypercarbic&#xD;
      respiratory failure, also dubbed respiratory failure type II, is characterized by failure of&#xD;
      the respiratory system in one of its two gas exchange functions: carbon dioxide (CO2)&#xD;
      elimination. It is thus usually defined via partial pressure of CO2 in the arterial blood gas&#xD;
      (PaCO2), a value greater than 50 mmHg being a commonly used cut-off. Hypercapnic respiratory&#xD;
      failure is often associated with severe airway disorders, such as asthma and chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but might also be found in other conditions, where&#xD;
      respiratory drive is restricted, such as intoxications, neuromuscular diseases or chest wall&#xD;
      abnormities. Hypercapnic respiratory failure, i.e. respiratory failure type II, is often&#xD;
      associated with hypoxemic respiratory failure, i.e. respiratory failure type I, failure of&#xD;
      oxygenation. However, type I failure is also often observed without hypercapnia. Respiratory&#xD;
      failure, both type I and II, may be further classified into either acute or chronic.&#xD;
      Distinction between both forms is often challenging, and, in addition to arterial blood gas&#xD;
      analysis, might require additional tests to identify clinical markers such as polycythemia or&#xD;
      pulmonary heart disease. For practical reasons, acute respiratory failure is often defined as&#xD;
      a condition, in which respiratory failure develops too fast to allow for renal compensation&#xD;
      and an increase in bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels, and thus leading to acidosis (pH less than&#xD;
      7.3). Therapeutic strategies for hypercapnic respiratory failure include non-invasive CPAP&#xD;
      ventilation support, intubation and mechanical ventilation (both assisted and controlled&#xD;
      forms), and, in very severe cases, extracorporeal methods, such as extracorporeal life&#xD;
      support systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive CPAP ventilation support via either helmets, or different kinds of tight masks,&#xD;
      is the current method of choice for the treatment of patients with acute respiratory failure&#xD;
      in the intensive care setting. Eligible patients include those with an intact airway,&#xD;
      airway-protective reflexes, who are alert enough to follow commands, whereas patients who&#xD;
      lack those criteria require immediate endotracheal intubation. Non-invasive CPAP ventilation&#xD;
      support improves both oxygenation (by providing an inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) of&#xD;
      100%, which is not possible via a simple venturi-mask, and the possibility of positive&#xD;
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), preventing collapsing of the alveoli), and decarboxylation&#xD;
      (by increasing tidal volume). It has been shown to decrease both need for intubation and&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality. Non-invasive CPAP ventilation support, however, requires a high grade&#xD;
      of skill from providers, and intensive communication with the patient to explain the&#xD;
      usefulness of a tight-sitting device in the face in a situation of perceived massive dyspnea.&#xD;
      Although severe adverse effects of non-invasive CPAP ventilation support are very rare, pain&#xD;
      and pressure marks may occur. Despite all efforts of care providers, there is a relevant&#xD;
      proportion of patients who do not tolerate ventilation support via a tight mask at all. About&#xD;
      15% of patients not tolerating the therapy, with an additional 25% of patients presenting&#xD;
      with contraindications. These might include general contraindications against non-invasive&#xD;
      techniques, such as aforementioned lack of airway-protective reflexes, but also such specific&#xD;
      for tight masks, such as anatomical abnormities of the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-flow Air via Nasal Cannula (HFA) therapy is usually applied via a wide-bore nasal&#xD;
      cannula. It provides up to 60 litres per minute of a heated and humidified gas mixture (with&#xD;
      an adjustable FiO2). This therapy is much less invasive for the patient, and thus often&#xD;
      better tolerated. HFA has been increasingly used in the last years to treat hypoxic&#xD;
      respiratory failure (i.e. type I failure), and numerous studies have shown its efficiency in&#xD;
      this indication both at the intensive care unit and at the emergency. A recent systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis has concluded in improved patient comfort and reduced dyspnea&#xD;
      scores. Despite this good evidence for HFA in hypoxic respiratory failure, it has only&#xD;
      reluctantly been used for hypercapnic respiratory failure. This might be explained in a large&#xD;
      part by the fact that patients with chronic hypercapnia are known to diminish their&#xD;
      respiratory drive when exposed to hyperoxia. However, evidence has begun to change on this&#xD;
      indication in recent time. HFA has been shown to generate PEEP, despite not being a closed&#xD;
      system, and to improve CO2 clearance by flushing anatomical dead space. It might also help to&#xD;
      reduce inspiratory resistance and facilitate secretion clearance from humidified gas. A study&#xD;
      on COPD patients showed an increase in breathing pressure amplitude and mean pressure, as&#xD;
      well as tidal volume, with a trend towards reduction of pCO2. Based on these findings, the&#xD;
      use of HFA has increased in clinical practice, and a number of case reports and -series&#xD;
      indicate successful use. Fraser et al. successfully investigated the use of HFA in patients&#xD;
      with chronic COPD changes in arterial blood gases during use of HFA in the ED for both&#xD;
      hypercapnic and non-hypercapnic patients were analyzed in previous studies, and found a&#xD;
      significant reduction of pCO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is, however, to date no randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of HFA in&#xD;
      acute hypercapnic respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed as a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial. The study site&#xD;
      is the Department of Emergency Medicine (ED) at the Vienna General Hospital, a leading&#xD;
      academic research center for emergency medicine at a large, tertiary care hospital. Around&#xD;
      90,000 patients are being treated at the department each year, approximately 150-200 of them&#xD;
      suffering from hypercapnic respiratory failure, and requiring non-invasive ventilation&#xD;
      support. The department features its own ICU and intermediate-care unit, with 7 positions&#xD;
      each, for a total of 14 positions capable of providing CPAP therapy. The HFA-device is also&#xD;
      at regular use at the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are temporary not able to give informed consent due to hypercapnia will be&#xD;
      randomized and treated. They will be informed post-hoc as soon as they are able to give&#xD;
      informed consent, and will have the possibility to give consent to the use of their data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A random sequence will be generated by a person not involved in the enrolment of patients&#xD;
      using standard software. Randomisation will be performed in variable blocks of 4 to 6, to&#xD;
      yield an unpredictable allocation yet warranting balanced group sizes. Sequentially numbered&#xD;
      sealed opaque envelopes (SNOSE), containing allocation either to the intervention or the&#xD;
      control group, will be pre-produced. The envelopes will be opened after consent immediately&#xD;
      before the start of the intervention to allow for allocation concealment and reduce the risk&#xD;
      of immediate post-random exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention consists of HFA using standard equipment at the department. A gas flow of 60&#xD;
      litres per minute and a FiO2 as clinically feasible will be used. Therapy will be continued&#xD;
      until a pCO2-level of 50 mmHg or less is reached, or therapy has to be aborted because of&#xD;
      lack of tolerance by the patient or indication for intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control consists of non-invasive CPAP ventilation support using a tight mask and standard&#xD;
      respirator equipment of the Department of Emergency Medicine. A positive airway pressure of&#xD;
      3,67 mmHg and a FiO2 as clinically feasible will be used. Therapy will be continued until a&#xD;
      pCO2-level of 50 mmHg or less is reached, or therapy has to be aborted because of lack of&#xD;
      tolerance by the patient or indication for intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on treating physician's discretion, both intervention and control treatments might be&#xD;
      aborted at any time, and any other therapy (simple Venturi-Mask, HFA, non-invasive&#xD;
      CPAP-ventilation support, intubation, extracorporeal methods) might be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics and demographic variables will include age, sex, smoking status,&#xD;
      prior diseases, especially any history of COPD or asthma, and duration of treatment of those,&#xD;
      medication, body size, pre-hospital treatment. pCO2 levels will be measured using blood gas&#xD;
      analysis at 0 -30 -60 (and every 60 minutes thereafter) minutes after the beginning of the&#xD;
      therapy, and at the end of the therapy. Patient's perception of the therapy will be assessed&#xD;
      after the end of the therapy using a 10-point Likert-Scale from very uncomfortable to very&#xD;
      comfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size considerations are based on the primary outcome pCO2 reduction per hour. The&#xD;
      investigators assume baseline pCO2-levels of 50 to 100 mmHg. Based on the published&#xD;
      literature, the investigators assume that the outcome in the control group is 4±3mmHg/hour.&#xD;
      Based on our clinical judgment the investigators assumed a limit of non-inferiority of 2&#xD;
      mmHg, which lies well within one standard deviation of the outcome. Hence, the investigators&#xD;
      would need 28 experimental subjects and 28 control subjects to be able to reject the null&#xD;
      hypothesis that the lower limit of a two-sided 90% confidence interval of the true difference&#xD;
      between two groups is above the non-inferiority limit, at a power of 80%. Formally the&#xD;
      investigators will have to enroll 56 patients. To allow for potential loss to follow up,&#xD;
      missing data, measurement issues, or other design factors the investigators will increase&#xD;
      actual sample size to 62. In terms of feasibility, the investigators expect approximately 150&#xD;
      to 200 eligible patients within one year, resulting in an expected study-duration of&#xD;
      approximately 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the relatively small sample size, there are no preplanned interim analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data and demographics will be tabulated for the intervention- and control-group to&#xD;
      assess success of randomisation. Reduction of pCO2 per hour will be compared between&#xD;
      individuals in the intervention and individuals in the control group. The investigators will&#xD;
      calculate effects as differences with 95% confidence intervals. This will be done using a&#xD;
      linear mixed model with pCO2 as the outcome, treatment group as a factor variable, and&#xD;
      baseline pCO2 and treatment time as covariates. The investigators will assume non-inferiority&#xD;
      if the two-sided 95% confidence interval lies within predefined limits of non-inferiority. As&#xD;
      a sensitivity analysis the investigators will also test for time/treatment-interaction in the&#xD;
      model. As another sensitivity analysis, the investigators will analyze data during first 6&#xD;
      hours of treatment at maximum. In case of therapy failure, the investigators will use the&#xD;
      last-observation-carried-forward method to 6 hours. Primary analysis will follow the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle. The unit of analysis will be single persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical secondary outcomes will be analysed by calculating relative risks with exact&#xD;
      standard error based 95% confidence intervals. The investigators will assume non-inferiority&#xD;
      if the two-sided 95% confidence interval lies within predefined limits of non-inferiority.&#xD;
      Continuous secondary outcomes will be analyzed like the primary outcome. Length of stay data&#xD;
      are expectedly lognormally distributed, therefore the investigators plan to use&#xD;
      log-transformed values for further calculations. For data analysis the investigators will use&#xD;
      Stata 11. A two-sided p-value less 0.05 is generally considered statistically significant.&#xD;
      Reporting will follow the standards of the CONSORT extension for non-inferiority and&#xD;
      equivalence trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy and Data safety Directly and indirectly patient-related data will be stored&#xD;
      physically and logically separated. In addition, only members of the study-group will have&#xD;
      access to study data. Data will be stored on a secured computer of the department of&#xD;
      emergency medicine and will be accessible only via restricted access for members of the&#xD;
      study-group.&#xD;
