  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, single-center clinical study. The study was designed to investigate&#xD;
      the relationship between plasma HER2 amplification or specific mutations abundance and&#xD;
      clinical response in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were divided into two groups according to ctDNA HER2 amplification status by dPCR&#xD;
      method. Group A consisted of patients with positive HER2 amplification at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment. Plasma HER2 amplification status was measured by dPCR during dynamic monitoring.&#xD;
      GroupB consists of patients with negative HER2 amplification when enrolled. Plasma samples&#xD;
      were collected before treatment and breast cancer hotspot mutations were detected with NGS,&#xD;
      According to the NGS test results, patient's specific mutations were analyzed and selected,&#xD;
      which and plasma HER2 amplification status were measured by dPCR during dynamic monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed to investigate the relationship between plasma HER2 amplification or&#xD;
      specific mutations abundance and imaging assessment in patients with recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer. And also to investigate the proportion of predicting in advance the treatment&#xD;
      efficacy of recurrent or metastatic breast cancer by plasma HER2 ctDNA, as well as the median&#xD;
      time difference between predicted clinical efficacy by changes in abundance of plasma HER2&#xD;
      amplification specific mutations and medical imaging evaluation in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study only focus on ctDNA detection and does not involve any interventions.&#xD;
