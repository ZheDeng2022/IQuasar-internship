  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1&#xD;
      (GLP-1) analogue liraglutide in the treatment of acute minor stroke (National Institute of&#xD;
      Health stroke scale, NIHSS ≤ 3) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) (ABCD2 score ≥ 4&#xD;
      ) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment arm will receive the starting dose of liraglutide of 0.6mg/d subcutaneously&#xD;
      once daily, and the dose will be increased to 1.8mg/d in two weeks, and then continue to&#xD;
      administrate this dose for 90 days. The control arm will not use liraglutide. Other types of&#xD;
      GLP-1 analogues or degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors will be&#xD;
      prohibited. Study visits will be performed at day 7, day 30±3 and at 90±7 day.&#xD;

    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Definition of ischemic stroke: An episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal cerebral, spinal, or retinal infarction. Either of the following is considered to be an ischemic stroke: a new focal neurologic deficit lasting for less than 24 hours and not attributable to a nonischemic cause but accompanied by neuroimaging evidence of new brain infarction; sudden onset of a new focal neurologic deficit, with clinical or imaging evidence of infarction lasting 24 hours or more and not attributable to a nonischemic cause.&#xD;
Definition of hemorrhagic stroke: Rapidly developing clinical signs of neurological dysfunction attributable to a focal collection of blood within the brain parenchyma, ventricular system or subarachnoid space that is not caused by trauma.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of patients with the 90-day new clinical vascular events (ischemic stroke/hemorrhagic stroke/TIA/myocardial infarction/vascular death)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Transient ischemic attack was defined as transient neurological deficits caused by focal brain or retinal ischemia, the clinical symptoms are generally no more than 1 hour, and the longest duration is less than 24 hours, and there is no evidence of a responsible lesion.&#xD;
The clinical definition of myocardial infarction denotes the presence of acute myocardial injury detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers in the setting of evidence of acute myocardial ischemia.&#xD;
Vascular death was defined as death due to stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), systemic hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, sudden death, or arrhythmia.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of patients with the 90-day Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 2</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Rankin scale is used to measure the recovery of neurological function in patients after stroke. The following questionnaire will be used to determine the mRs score:&#xD;
The modified Rankin scale is used to measure the recovery of neurological function in patients after stroke. The following questionnaire will be used to determine the mRs score:&#xD;

No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities.&#xD;
Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance.&#xD;
Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance.&#xD;
Moderately severe disability, unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance.&#xD;
Severe disability, bedridden, incontinent and require constant nursing care and attention.&#xD;
