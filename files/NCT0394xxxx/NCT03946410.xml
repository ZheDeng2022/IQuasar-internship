      This study attempts to reduce social inequality in cardiovascular health by performing an&#xD;
      interventional screening trial on how best to decrease cardiovascular disease (CVD) among&#xD;
      people with low social status.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although CVDs have decreased, they are still among the most predominant cause of morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in the western world, incl. Denmark, where about 420,000 people have recognized&#xD;
      CVD symptoms. Due to an aging population, the decline has not reduced CVD admissions and&#xD;
      healthcare costs. In Denmark, the CVD related hospital admission costs are DKK 4.6 billion&#xD;
      and the pharmaceutical cost DKK 2.4 billion. The Danish National Board of Health has reported&#xD;
      that CVD carries the second largest socioeconomic difference in burden of disease.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, population-based health checks and screening for risk factors has proven not&#xD;
      efficient. Consequently, screening of asymptomatic CVD is discussed intensively. In the&#xD;
      investigators first unique CVD screening RCT (2008-11), the Viborg Vascular (VIVA) trial,&#xD;
      more than 50.000 65-74 year old men were randomised for population-based ultrasound screening&#xD;
      for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and hypertension. In&#xD;
      case of positive finding, preventive medical actions were initiated. A significant reduction&#xD;
      in overall mortality by 7% after 5 years was observed. Using a non-contrast computered&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan, instead of the ultrasound based screening approach, has the opportunity&#xD;
      to identify aneurysms in the entire aortic, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and arterial&#xD;
      fibrillation, so individualized risk assessment and initiation of preventive actions on those&#xD;
      with sign of early asymptomatic CVD is possible. A second trial - The Danish Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Screening (DANCAVAS) trial initiated was initiated in 2014 randomizing 45.000 65-74 year old&#xD;
      men with the potential of a huge beneficial effect on health, quality of life (QoL) and&#xD;
      survival. However, screening is impaired by lower social class, and adherence to initiated&#xD;
      prevention could be impacted as well. Consequently, we want to conduct a third RCT (Fighting&#xD;
      Social Inequality in Cardiovascular Health (FISICH) to test a number of add-ons to screening&#xD;
      that potentially balance the benefits across socio economic groups. The perspective is to&#xD;
      establish a clear decision foundation for public health care policy incl. benefits, cost&#xD;
      effectiveness and impact on social inequality of alternative variants of population screening&#xD;
      for CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that an extensive circulatory screening and intervention programme&#xD;
      reduces social inequality in cardiovascular health and fulfills the WHO criteria for&#xD;
      screening. However, this reduction can be even more pronounced, if factors reducing the&#xD;
      social selection to attend screening and adherence to preventive actions initiated are&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are to&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Estimate benefits of using DANCAVAS screening methodology in men aged 60-64. This&#xD;
      evaluation will be overall, and subgroup-analyzed concerning educational level, income level,&#xD;
      and psychiatric disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods 20.000 60-64 year old men are randomized to the control group, while&#xD;
      another 5.000 are randomized to the screening and intervention program for CAC, aortic and&#xD;
      iliac aneurysms, atrial fibrillation, PAD, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia.&#xD;
      There is no exclusion criteria. The screening setup is similar to DANCAVAS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A small questionnaire on life style, medical history, and the QoL a.o. will be enclosed&#xD;
           with the invitation. Non-responders are re-invited once.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The participant will be informed at attendance to the screening visit, and their consent&#xD;
           will be obtained together with the questionnaire, weight, height, and waist&#xD;
           circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The CT scan will cover the area from the mandibular bone distally to the proximal third&#xD;
           of the femur. Calcium scores for the common carotids, coronary arteries, aorta, and&#xD;
           common iliac, and femoral arteries will be calculated. The aorta are visualized, and the&#xD;
           diameter is measured in ascending, arcus, descending and abdominal, and if possible in&#xD;
           the iliac arteries. Further the heart rhythm during the CT scan is evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Bilateral blood pressure will be recorded three times after 5 minutes of supine rest,&#xD;
           and concurrently the ankle blood pressure are measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The HbA1c and lipid parameters will be measured. Biobank blood samples are then taken,&#xD;
           centrifuged, labelled, cooled, and stored at -80 degrees Celsius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visit after screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the CAC is above the median or if an aneurism of peripheral arterial disease are detected&#xD;
      the participant is informed of the finding and its implications at a follow-up visit. At this&#xD;
      visit, the patient will be recommended suitable prophylactic measures, including smoking&#xD;
      cessation, walking/exercise, a low-fat diet. Additionally to start treatment with aspirin 75&#xD;
      mg/day and atorvastatin 40 mg/day. If an aneurism is large the patient is referred vascular&#xD;
      surgical assessment for the repair. Otherwise, an annual check-up of the aneurism including a&#xD;
      CT scan will be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no positive findings (CAC above the median, aneurysm or PAD) are detected, the&#xD;
      participants will be informed of the findings by e-mail or ordinary post as preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent of the above findings, the patients will be encouraged to see their GP for&#xD;
      further assessment if potential undiagnosed hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg),&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (HbA1c &gt;48 mmol/mol), or significant isolated hypercholesterolemia&#xD;
      (total-cholesterol &gt;8.0 mmol/l) are observed, as possible continuous medical treatments will&#xD;
      be better managed by the GPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GPs will be informed by a letter of all negative and positive results and the initiated&#xD;
      actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment started mid 2017 with sites in Silkeborg, Svendborg, Odense, Vejle and Nykøbing&#xD;
      Sjælland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations and Randomisations&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study with 4 controls per invited subject is planned based upon the mortality reduction in&#xD;
      the VIVA study, a hazard ratio of 0.93 in the screening group is expected. If so, with a 0.05&#xD;
      significance level, and 90% power, we´ll need 5245 experimental subjects and 20980 controls.&#xD;
      The randomisation procedure will be stratified by geographical area (municipalities), as&#xD;
      sociodemographics, attendance, and disease prevalence are expected to differ across areas.&#xD;
      Randomisation will be performed in SPSS by providing each individual a random number from&#xD;
      1-20. Those numbered +16 will be invited to participate in the screening program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, smoking, previous or current stroke, ischemic heart disease, PAD, chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, use of statins, use of antithrombotics, body mass&#xD;
      index, systolic- and diastolic blood pressure, ankle brachial index, marital status, highest&#xD;
      educational level, personal- and in house income, psychiatric morbidity defined as any&#xD;
      diagnosis and/or use of medications for mental illness, and quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and outcome variables from national registries&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CPR number assigned to Danish citizens enables individual-level linkage to multiple&#xD;
      nation-wide healthcare and administrative registries which have proved valid. Registry-based&#xD;
      information on outpatient visits, hospitals admissions and procedures (The Danish National&#xD;
      Patient Registry), relevant prescribed drugs dispensed (The Danish National Prescription&#xD;
      Registry), socio economic status etc. (Registries at Statistics Denmark) and primary care&#xD;
      service use (National Health Insurance Service Registry) will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. All-cause mortality (time to event or censoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Positive findings by screening, in all and by specific condition,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mortality due to CVD (time to death),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Initiation of first redeement of prophylactic pharmaceutical therapy in participants not&#xD;
           in therapy at baseline - split on antithrombotic,- lipid lowering and antihypertensive&#xD;
           agents,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Initiation of prophylactic surgery and avoidance of acute surgery (time to first&#xD;
           procedure concerning AAA, PAD, and coronary revascularization,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Morbidity due to CVD (time to first hospital-based diagnosis and total number of&#xD;
           inpatient days) as a composite measure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Adverse events (time to first hospital-based diagnosis) split on diabetes, intracerebral&#xD;
           haemorrhage, and cancer,&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Safety (30d postoperative mortality) split on AAA, PAD and coronary revascularization,&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. QoL,&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Health care costs and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics will be analysed using conventional summary statistics. Outcomes&#xD;
      representing a time to event are analysed and compared between randomisation groups including&#xD;
      subgroups defined by social status and mentally ill using Cox proportional hazards model. All&#xD;
      outcomes representing density of events are analysed and compared between randomisation&#xD;
      groups including corresponding subgroups using plain incidence rate ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health economic models&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate regression analysis will be undertaken to analyse health care costs (one year&#xD;
      before and after screening) across socioeconomic groups due to pharmacological&#xD;
      over-/undertreatment. A cost-effectiveness analysis with 5 years of follow-up adopting a&#xD;
      health care perspective will be performed to investigate cost-effectiveness of screening&#xD;
      across socioeconomic groups (population heterogeneity). All cause mortality is the primary&#xD;
      outcome and costs include screening costs and primary- and secondary care costs. Finally, a&#xD;
      health economic decision model based on available evidence (literature review and meta&#xD;
      analysis) and original data from the three trials will be developed to inform decision makers&#xD;
      about the (distributional) consequences of implementing different variants of population&#xD;
      screening in Denmark. The specification of the model will be based on a Markov state model&#xD;
      allowing for the analysis of the total number of expected life years and the total health&#xD;
      care costs for a lifetime perspective in different scenarios with different variants of&#xD;
      screening. The modelling of social inequality (tagging who receives the benefit of screening)&#xD;
      is novel in this literature and a unique opportunity given the Danish trials and register&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biobank&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in the DANCAVAS study, a biobank will be organised. 40 mL of blood form each of the&#xD;
      participants are centrifuged, labelled, and stored at -80 degrees Celsius. The purpose of the&#xD;
      biobank is to perform pathophysiological and translational studies, and to facilitate new&#xD;
      knowledge of development and treatment of atherosclerosis. Analyses of (1) atherosclerosis&#xD;
      and (2) inflammation in the vessel wall, (3) diseases in the myocardium, (4) calcium /&#xD;
      phosphate metabolism and (4) proteomics are intended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remaining blood samples are planned to be stored for a ten-year period for future research,&#xD;
      and subsequently data will be anonymous. This is to be approved by the Danish Data Protection&#xD;
      Agency. Prior to future analyses approval by the Region Committee on Biomedical Research&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
