      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of lanreotide given every 4 weeks in participants with advanced&#xD;
           or metastatic paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the toxicity and safety of lanreotide in participants with advanced or&#xD;
           metastatic paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the effects of lanreotide on markers of biochemical activity in participants&#xD;
           with advanced or metastatic paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Assess efficacy by estimating the tumor growth rate while a patient is enrolled on study&#xD;
      and comparing the growth rates on lanreotide to the pre-enrolment growth rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include measurement of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall response rate (ORR) according to RECIST defined as partial response (PR) +&#xD;
           complete response (CR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnitude of reduction in levels of 24-hour urinary metanephrines, catecholamines and&#xD;
           magnitude of reduction in serum chromogranin A, evaluated every two months while&#xD;
           enrolled on study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lanreotide is FDA approved for certain kinds of neuroendocrine tumors. This study seeks to&#xD;
      determine if lanreotide is beneficial for patients with paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the rarity of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma that precludes the conduct of a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial in a timely manner, a novel method for assessing efficacy is being proposed.&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by estimating the tumor growth rate while a patient is enrolled on&#xD;
      study and comparing the growth rates on lanreotide to the pre-enrollment growth rates. The&#xD;
      method of analysis that will be used has been previously described. For this assessment a&#xD;
      minimum of three tumor measurements will be required.&#xD;

    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of the subjects in the analysis population who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Responses are based on assessments per RECIST 1.1. Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.&#xD;
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have change in short axis to less than 10 mm.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% change in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

&#xD;
          2. Patients must give signed informed consent before any study-related activities are&#xD;
             conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients in the United States must have given written authorization for the release of&#xD;
             protected health information in compliance with HIPAA regulations; patients in other&#xD;
             countries must provide appropriate authorization as needed by regulatory authorities&#xD;
             in each country.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant paraganglioma or&#xD;
             pheochromocytoma and either evidence of metastases or unresectability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of recent disease progression (radiological, biochemical, symptomatic) while&#xD;
             the patient was either not receiving any therapy or was receiving a therapy that was&#xD;
             deemed ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Measurable disease defined as that which can be measured in at least one dimension&#xD;
             with a minimum size of 10 mm by CT scan. The patient must also have at least three&#xD;
             baseline radiographic studies obtained in the previous twelve months with at least one&#xD;
             scan obtained within six weeks of enrollment. If a patient being considered for&#xD;
             enrollment on trial has not had three scans performed in the twelve months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment and if in the opinion of the investigator a delay of one month will not&#xD;
             impact the clinical course, then enrollment on protocol and the start of the&#xD;
             lanreotide therapy can be delayed by one month or longer to obtain the additional time&#xD;
             point. If in the opinion of the investigator such a delay may have adverse&#xD;
             consequences then enrollment on the protocol should not be considered as an option&#xD;

             months will a SRS study be required. if an SRS is required, it will be performed&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 24 hours after a previous injection of subcutaneous&#xD;
             octreotide).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients may not have had prior octreotide, long acting release (LAR)-octreotide,&#xD;
