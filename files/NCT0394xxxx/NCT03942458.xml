  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized, open, two-cycle crossover, clopidogrel control,&#xD;
      multiple dosing study. The aim was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic behavior&#xD;
      of different metabolites of CYP2C19 in healthy subjects. The study enrolled 48 patients,&#xD;
      divided into three groups of CYP2C19 fast metabolite, middle metabolite, and slow metabolism,&#xD;
      16 cases in each group. All groups of subjects were administered for 7 days in the first&#xD;
      cycle, once a day (loading dose on the first day, maintenance dose on other days), and&#xD;
      entering the 14-day washout period after the end of the first cycle. The second cycle was&#xD;
      entered, and the second cycle was administered for 7 days, once a day (the first day was&#xD;
      given a loading dose, and the other days were given a maintenance dose). Blood was collected&#xD;
      before and after administration of D1, D7, D22, and D28, and PK/PD was measured.&#xD;
