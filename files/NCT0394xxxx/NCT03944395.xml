      To evaluate effectiveness of voluntary assisted partner notification (VAPN) in real-world&#xD;
      programmatic settings, a non-randomized, stepped wedge study in high volume facilities in 6&#xD;
      high HIV burden focus districts (Blantyre, Zomba, Chikwawa, Machinga, Mangochi and Lilongwe&#xD;
      urban) is proposed. The primary objective is to compare the percentage of contacts tested&#xD;
      during the standard of care (SOC) phase (i.e., using passive family referral services (FRS)&#xD;
      index testing methodology) with the percentage of contacts tested during the SOC plus VAPN&#xD;
      phase, by 1, 2, and 3 months after the initial contact with the index client. Assessment of&#xD;
      feasibility will be achieved through documentation of operational lessons learned during&#xD;
      implementation. Findings will contribute to ongoing policy discussions whether Malawi should&#xD;
      adopt VAPN in its national HIV testing guidelines&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The over-arching goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the&#xD;
      voluntary assisted partner notification (VAPN) intervention in real-world programmatic&#xD;
      settings in high burden facilities in 6 priority districts in Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare effectiveness of standard of care (SOC) (i.e., use of the&#xD;
      family referral services (FRS)) with SOC plus VAPN in reaching contacts of index clients with&#xD;
      HIV testing services. The percentage of contacts who receive HIV testing services within 1,&#xD;
      2, and 3 months of the initial offer of services to the index client will be compared between&#xD;
      the SOC phase and the intervention phase (SOC plus VAPN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate feasibility of implementing VAPN in real-world programmatic settings in high&#xD;
           burden facilities in 6 priority districts in Malawi. Two key quantitative measures of&#xD;
           feasibility will be used as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  What is the cumulative percentage of eligible index clients offered VAPN services&#xD;
                by study end?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To what extent were the interventions implemented with fidelity? For example, a key&#xD;
                measure of the fidelity of the Client Referral VAPN option is to assess what&#xD;
                percentage of contacts, who did not return for their scheduled first appointment at&#xD;
                the clinic, were subsequently traced according to the specified algorithm (i.e., up&#xD;
                to 5 phone calls, and up to 2 home visits)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To monitor trends in HIV diagnostic yield from SOC plus VAPN over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include three options in additional to the FRS as part of the World Health&#xD;
      organisation-recommended index testing approach. The first option is contract referral, in&#xD;
      which the index client can choose to enter into a &quot;contract&quot; with the healthcare provider&#xD;
      whereby he or she agrees to disclose their HIV status to all partners and refer them to HIV&#xD;
      testing services (HTS) within a certain time frame. If the partners do not access HTS within&#xD;
      this period, the providers will contact the partners directly to notify them that they may&#xD;
      have been exposed to HIV; the providers will then offer voluntary HTS while maintaining the&#xD;
      confidentiality of the index client. The second option is that of provider referral, in which&#xD;
      the index client can choose to have the healthcare provider contact the client's partners&#xD;
      directly, provide them with an appropriate health message, and offer them voluntary HTS,&#xD;
      while maintaining the confidentiality of the index client. The third option is dual referral,&#xD;
      in which the index client can choose that a trained provider sits with the client and his/her&#xD;
      partner at a suitable time and location (usually a private room at the health facility) to&#xD;
      provide support as they potentially test together or the index client discloses his/her HIV&#xD;
      status with the provider offering voluntary HTS to the partner.&#xD;
