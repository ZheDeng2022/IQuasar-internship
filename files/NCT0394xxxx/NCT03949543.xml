  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interplay between diet and the gut microbiota has been implicated in the onset of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. The gut microbiota displays diurnal rhythms, which may be influenced&#xD;
      by meal timing. This study aimed to investigate the effect of main meal consumption timing on&#xD;
      the microbiota and the cardiometabolic factors of the host using a cross-over RCT in healthy&#xD;
      adults&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measurements will be: a) changes in gut microbiota composition based on 16S&#xD;
      rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics, b) changes in bacterial functional&#xD;
      capacity) and urinary/faecal metabolomics, c) changes in targeted bacterial metabolites,&#xD;
      d)Inflammatory markers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to explore the effect of the timing of main meal consumption on gut&#xD;
      microbiota and immune response in healthy adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, cross-over RCT in healthy adults. Healthy adult (&gt;18 y)&#xD;
      participants will be recruited from the community by means of an advertisement leaflet (see&#xD;
      associated supporting document-&quot;Advertisement flyer&quot;) and word of mouth. The researcher will&#xD;
      arrange a meeting with those expressing an interest about the study. The researcher will&#xD;
      collect demographic information (e.g. age and gender) and ask the subjects whether they&#xD;
      suffer from any acute or chronic illness (defined as illness which requires regular visits to&#xD;
      health services) (see associated supporting document-&quot;Health Questionnaire&quot;). If they suffer&#xD;
      from a chronic illness they will be excluded. Other exclusion criteria include history of&#xD;
      previous of major gut surgery, unstable weight, use of antibiotics or steroids the last 3&#xD;
      months. Participants will be informed about the study at Human Nutrition, New Lister&#xD;
      Building, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, or at the University of Glasgow main campus social areas&#xD;
      (e.g. Gilchrist). No children will be recruited. Subjects who have expressed an interest&#xD;
      about the study but are not suitable to participate will be acknowledged and will receive an&#xD;
      explanation as to why they have been excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed written consent, participants will be randomly allocated to intervention&#xD;
      groups using the MS Excel &quot;rand()&quot; function. Women will start their intervention on the same&#xD;
      phase of their menstrual cycle to avoid the effect of hormonal changes on study outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary interventions: Participants will be asked to undertake two experimental diets. The&#xD;
      two dietary interventions are identical with the only difference being the timing of the main&#xD;
      meal consumption (dinner and lunch). Participants will follow each diet for a period of one&#xD;
      week with a three week washout period between the two interventions. The wash out period aims&#xD;
      to drive the gut microbiota characteristics back to baseline levels. The diet will provide&#xD;
      the average energy requirements of the participants (Department of Health) and aims to keep&#xD;
      participants' weight stable during the study period. All dietary aspects of the study will be&#xD;
      designed and supervised by the qualified dietitians/nutritionists, who are members of the&#xD;
      research team. Participants will be given a list of meals and snacks to choose from (see&#xD;
      associated supporting document-&quot;Food List Preferences&quot;). All meals will be provided to the&#xD;
      participants free of charge. Meals will be ordered online by the researchers, using the&#xD;
      University of Glasgow Hub, and will be delivered to the participants' residence by the&#xD;
      supermarket staff. Weight and height will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1 Participants will follow a structured diet containing meals of their choice for a&#xD;
      week. The participants will select these meals from a list which the researcher will provide&#xD;
      to them. The timing of the meal will be specified and the participants will have to complete&#xD;
      their meals within 25±5 minutes. The participants will be given written instructions on how&#xD;
      to follow the diet (see associated supporting document-&quot;Instruction Sheet&quot; &amp; &quot;Participant&#xD;
      Study Calendar&quot;). Participants will provide all faecal samples produced during days from noon&#xD;
      of day 5 to noon of day 8. Fasted blood (6 ml) and urine samples will be collected the day&#xD;
      after the end of the Week 1 intervention (i.e. day 8). These will be collected at the Human&#xD;
      Nutrition laboratory, at the New Lister Building, Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Weight and height&#xD;
      measurements will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 2, 3 &amp; 4 During the wash out period, the participants will follow their habitual diet&#xD;
      and no research intervention will take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 5 This will be replication of the dietary intervention and sample collection at Week 1.&#xD;
      The only difference is that lunch meal from Week 1 will swap to dinners in Week 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet compliance: Over the course of the two experimental diets compliance will be monitored&#xD;
      by asking participants to complete a &quot;checklist&quot; with their prescribed diet (see associated&#xD;
      supporting document-&quot;Compliance Questionnaire&quot;). A gentle reminder call or text will be sent&#xD;
      to the participants every 3 days to increase participants' motivation and compliance on the&#xD;
      diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection &amp; analysis: Fresh faecal and urine samples will be collected as described&#xD;
      above. The main outcome measurements will be: a) changes in gut microbiota composition based&#xD;
      on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics, b) changes in bacterial&#xD;
      functional capacity (whole genome shotgun metagenomics) and urinary/faecal metabolomics, c)&#xD;
      changes in targeted bacterial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, sulphide, ammonia,&#xD;
      lactate, succinate, ethanol). Blood lipids, appetite hormones, adipokines, and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers will be measured using ELISA kits. Stool samples will be collected from participants'&#xD;
      homes or delivered to the lab by pre-paid taxi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed analysis: Genomic DNA will be extracted by the faecal samples using in-house&#xD;
      developed assays. The sample will be tested for purity on 1% Agarose gel and the&#xD;
      concentration of nucleic acids will be measured with Nanodrop. Amplification of the V4 region&#xD;
      of the 16S rRNA gene will be performed in house using PCR and High Fidelity Mastermix and&#xD;
      Golay Barcodes. The pooled sample will be sent to the University of Birmingham for 250 bp&#xD;
      pair-end sequencing on MiSeq. The data will be analysed by Dr Gerasimidis PDRA in&#xD;
      Bioinfomatics. Similarly measurements of SCFA will be performed in acidified ether extracts&#xD;
      using Gas Chromatography equipped with an FID detector. Quantification will be performed&#xD;
      against authentic standards. Other bacterial metabolites and cardiovascular markers will be&#xD;
      assayed with colorometric and enzymatic assays and commercially available ELISA kits as these&#xD;
      have been reported previously. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28318688 and&#xD;
      https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26119811&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation: An accurate power calculation is impossible to compute due to lack of&#xD;
      pilot data. Based on a similar study for a mean difference of 5.4 μmol/g of faecal acetate&#xD;
      (SD=5) and 80% power, 20 participants are required. Power calculation will be revised&#xD;
      following recruitment and study completion of the first 7 participants.&#xD;
