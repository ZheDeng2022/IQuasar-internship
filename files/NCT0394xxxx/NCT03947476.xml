  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As an important life sustaining support , mechanical ventilation has greatly promoted the&#xD;
      development of modern intensive care units. However, mechanical ventilation can lead to&#xD;
      ventilator-induced lung injury, including barotrauma, volutrauma, atelectrauma and biotrauma.&#xD;
      All patients undergoing mechanical ventilation are at risk of barotrauma. A multicenter&#xD;
      prospective cohort study of 5183 patients with mechanical ventilation showed that the&#xD;
      incidence of pulmonary barotrauma was 3%. The incidence of pulmonary barotrauma varied&#xD;
      according to the causes of mechanical ventilation: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (3%), asthma (6%), chronic interstitial lung disease (10%), acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (7%) and pneumonia (4%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, it is considered that one of the main causes of barotrauma is the increasing of&#xD;
      transpulmonary pressure. Transpulmonary pressure is the difference between alveolar pressure&#xD;
      and intrapleural pressure. The commonly adopted lung protective ventilation methods include:&#xD;
      limiting plateau pressure less than or equal to 30 cmH2O, using small tidal volume&#xD;
      ventilation (6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight) . All the above methods are to reduce&#xD;
      trans-pulmonary pressure by reducing alveolar pressure. In addition to reducing alveolar&#xD;
      pressure, increasing pleural pressure is another important way to reduce transpulmonary&#xD;
      pressure and the incidence of barotrauma. At present, the main method is the use of&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade. However, there are many shortcomings in of neuromuscular blockade: 1.&#xD;
      Time limit, generally not more than 48 hours; 2. Long-term use of neuromuscular blockade&#xD;
      causes adverse reactions such as myopathy; 3. Neuromuscular blockade are only suitable for&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation patients, but not for non-invasive mechanical ventilation or&#xD;
      high flow oxygen inhalation patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find other methods to reduce&#xD;
      trans-pulmonary pressure and lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators drew inspiration from the early mechanism of &quot;iron lung&quot; ventilator and the&#xD;
      clinical practice of reducing trans-pulmonary pressure and lung injury in obese patients. In&#xD;
      the early stage, the investigators carried out the clinical practice of extrapulmonary lung&#xD;
      protection strategy, that is, to give thoracic band restraint to patients undergoing&#xD;
      non-invasive mechanical ventilation so as to reduce chest wall compliance, which can be&#xD;
      significantly reduced under the same inspiratory pressure and occurrence of barotrauma.&#xD;
      However, the respiratory mechanics mechanism of this method still needs to be further studied&#xD;
      to determine whether it can reduce the incidence of barotrauma by reducing transpulmonary&#xD;
      pressure. It is accessible and inexpensive. The aim of this study was to determine the&#xD;
      changes of transpulmonary pressure in patients with invasive mechanical ventilation before&#xD;
      and after thoracic band fixation by esophageal manometry without spontaneous breathing.&#xD;
