      A Phase II, multi-center, single-arm, non-blinded study combining androgen deprivation&#xD;

      receptor-positive salivary gland carcinoma, not amenable to surgery or radiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II multi-center, single-arm, non-blinded study combining androgen deprivation&#xD;
      therapy (ADT) and pembrolizumab for patients with metastatic or locally recurrent androgen&#xD;
      receptor-positive salivary gland carcinoma, not amenable to surgery or radiation. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will include both those with no prior systemic therapy and those who have failed&#xD;
      prior systemic therapy. Patients who have received previous ADT or immunotherapy will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADT will consist of goserelin acetate every 4 weeks with the first injection given&#xD;
      approximately 2 weeks prior to the first dose of pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be&#xD;
      given on day 1 of 21-day cycles, starting 2 weeks after initiation of goserelin acetate. Each&#xD;
      21-day period is considered a treatment cycle with therapy continuing for up to 35 cycles,&#xD;
      until disease progression, significant toxicity, or patient refusal. Except for fatigue, we&#xD;
      do not expect overlapping toxicities with pembrolizumab and ADT, thus the starting doses will&#xD;
      be the FDA-approved doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a Simon 2-stage phase II trial design. The first stage of the Simon&#xD;
      2-stage design will have a sample size of nine patients. If at least two patients have an&#xD;
      objective response by RECIST 1.1 then enrollment will proceed to stage 2 with an additional&#xD;
      11 patients, to a goal of 20 patients. If less than 4 patients out of 20 respond, then the&#xD;
      combination treatment will be rejected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be staged with CT of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis at baseline and every 12&#xD;
      weeks while on study. Treatment with both ADT and pembrolizumab will continue until disease&#xD;
      progression or intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Archival tumor biopsy tissue must be available at baseline to evaluate for expression of&#xD;
      androgen receptor (AR), PD-L1, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). An optional biopsy&#xD;
      will be performed after 4 doses of pembrolizumab to evaluate immune response to combined&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected at baseline, cycle 1 day 1, cycle 2 day 1 and cycle 3 day 1 to&#xD;
      evaluate for change in lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry.&#xD;
