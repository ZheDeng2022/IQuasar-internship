  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well olaparib works in treating patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed BRCA-mutant ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian cancer before surgery.&#xD;
      Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of daily olaparib given in the neoadjuvant setting in women&#xD;
      with primary advanced high grade non-mucinous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate efficacy of olaparib given in the neoadjuvant setting using response rate (by&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] in subjects with measurable disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate proportion of subjects able to proceed immediately to interval tumor reductive&#xD;
      surgery (without chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine progression-free survival (PFS). IV. Determine complete pathologic response&#xD;
      rate at the time of surgery. V. Determine the toxicity of daily olaparib given in the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant setting. VI. Evaluate the toxicity of chemotherapy given after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      olaparib. VII. Measure longitudinal symptom burden of study subjects treated with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      olaparib and chemotherapy after olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) copy number and level of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and&#xD;
      protein expression in homologous recombination-related pathways before and after treatment&#xD;
      with olaparib in women with primary advanced high grade non-mucinous epithelial ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlate molecular results to clinical endpoints including response and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      After treatment, patients either undergo surgery then receive standard chemotherapy for up to&#xD;
      4 cycles or receive standard chemotherapy within 14 days for up to 4 cycles then undergo&#xD;
      surgery in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity at the discretion of&#xD;
      the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
