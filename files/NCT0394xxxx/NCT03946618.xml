    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to determine if tracking seizure occurrence, seizure probability,&#xD;
      behavioral state, cognition, and mood can be achieved using an implantable brain sensing and&#xD;
      stimulation device (Medtronic RC+S Summit) coupled to an external, handheld, patient&#xD;
      assistant device (PAD) with capability for patient interaction (patient data input). The&#xD;
      system (RC+S &amp; PAD) provides intracranial EEG (iEEG) sensing, electrical brain stimulation,&#xD;
      and machine learning algorithms running on the RC+S and PAD that will be coupled with&#xD;
      electrical brain stimulation (EBS) to prevent seizures and improve quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with epilepsy.&#xD;

      This study will include patients with dominant temporal lobe epilepsy and bilateral temporal&#xD;
      lobe epilepsy. The plan is to have 10 patients take part in this study at Mayo Clinic&#xD;
      Rochester.&#xD;

                  concentrations&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Not a good candidate for resective surgery or at significant risk for verbal&#xD;

                  Criteria 1) seizures per month, on average, with a seizure-free interval not to&#xD;
                  exceed 30 days. Seizures must be separated by a minimum of eight hours not to be&#xD;
                  considered part of a cluster. A cluster of seizures, for the purpose of this&#xD;
                  criterion, shall be considered a single seizure.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness to provide informed consent and participate in the study&#xD;
             protocol. Subject is able to interpret and to respond, in accordance with the study&#xD;
             protocol, to the advisory indicators provided by the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has seizures that are distinct, stereotypical events that can be reliably&#xD;
             counted by the patient or caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject can reasonably be expected to maintain a seizure diary alone or with the&#xD;
             assistance of a competent individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is able to complete regular office visits and telephone appointments in&#xD;
             accordance with the study protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject must have a negative serum pregnancy test within two weeks prior to&#xD;
             entering the study, and, if sexually active, must be using a reliable form of birth&#xD;
             control, be surgically sterile, or be at least two years post-menopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's seizure focus, based upon clinical semiology, intracranial&#xD;
             electroencephalographic (iEEG) findings, and/or neuroimaging, shall demonstrate&#xD;
             bilateral medial temporal lobe epilepsy or unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy of&#xD;
             dominant temporal lobe origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has been informed of his or her eligibility for resective surgery as a&#xD;
             potential alternative to the study, if such surgery is a reasonable option.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject speaks and reads English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) epilepsy evaluation within&#xD;
             the past two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has iEEG documentation of ictal events consistent with his or her predominant&#xD;
             current seizure type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's anatomy will permit implantation of the Medtronic Investigational RC+S&#xD;
             generator within 20 mm of the skin surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject can reasonably be expected to periodically check battery levels and recharge&#xD;
             devices (Implanted neural stimulator (INS), Clinical Telemetry Module (CTM), and EPAD&#xD;
             tablet) alone or with the assistance of a competent individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For 3 months prior to enrollment, subject's anti-seizure medication dosages have not&#xD;
             been stable, or subject has had more than 25 disabling (as defined in Inclusion&#xD;
             Criteria 1) seizures per month, on average, or there was a seizure-free interval&#xD;
             longer than 30 days within the past 3 months. Clinical seizures must be separated by a&#xD;
             minimum of eight hours to not be considered part of a cluster. Cluster seizures are&#xD;
             considered a single seizure event.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a substance abuse history (alcohol, prescription, or illicit medications)&#xD;
             within the preceding two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject participated in another drug or device trial within the preceding 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has been hospitalized for a psychiatric condition within the preceding two&#xD;

             post-ictal psychosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is implanted with pacemaker, implantable cardiac defibrillator, cardiac&#xD;
             management product, or a medical device that interferes with the RC+S device. This&#xD;
             includes, but is not limited to, direct brain neurostimulators, spinal cord&#xD;
             stimulators, vagus nerve stimulators (VNS), and cochlear implants. Patients with a&#xD;
             vagus nerve stimulator implanted but turned off through the duration of the study may&#xD;
             be enrolled, provided their clinical status has been stable for at least one month&#xD;
             with VNS turned off. Alternatively, patients with a VNS may have the previously&#xD;
             disabled VNS removed at time of surgery to implant the Medtronic RC+S.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has been diagnosed with psychogenic or non-epileptic seizures.&#xD;

             electrode placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is on anticoagulants and is unable to discontinue them peri-surgically, as&#xD;
             required by the neurosurgeon or Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has significant platelet dysfunction from medical conditions or medications&#xD;
             (including, particularly, aspirin or sodium valproate). If platelet dysfunction is&#xD;
             suspected, subject can be enrolled only if a hematologist, the Investigator, and the&#xD;
             neurosurgeon judge it to be advisable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is ineligible for cranial surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
