  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is comparing the effect of a long-acting insulin analogue (insulin 287) with&#xD;
      insulin glargine (LantusÂ®) in subjects with type 2 diabetes. In addition, the study is&#xD;
      looking at symptoms of low blood sugar, awareness of low blood sugar and the time and amount&#xD;
      of glucose needed to recover from low blood sugar after injecting 2 and 3 times the basal&#xD;
      dose of insulin 287 and glargine. The purpose of the study is to make a once-weekly&#xD;
      injectable basal insulin treatment for people with type 2 diabetes. Participants will get&#xD;
      insulin 287 as well as insulin glargine - which treatment any participant gets first is&#xD;
      decided by chance. Insulin 287 is a new medicine; insulin glargine can already be prescribed.&#xD;
      The study medicines will be in a pen, and must be injected with a needle in the thigh once&#xD;
      per day (insulin glargine) or once per week (insulin 287). The study will last for minimum 3&#xD;
      months and up to approximately 6 months. Participants will have 21 clinic visits and at least&#xD;
      2 phone calls with the study doctor. The participants' health will be monitored carefully and&#xD;
      blood samples will be taken at the clinic visits.&#xD;
