      This is a phase II, open-label, single-arm, multi-center Study conducted in Canada, the&#xD;
      United States and internationally. Patients with NMIBC CIS with or without resected papillary&#xD;
      disease (Ta, T1) that are considered bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-Unresponsive or who are&#xD;
      intolerant to BCG therapy. BCG-Unresponsive is at least one of the following: At least five&#xD;
      of six doses of an initial induction course plus at least two of three doses of maintenance&#xD;
      therapy; OR, At least five of six doses of an initial induction course plus at least two of&#xD;
      six doses of a second induction course. Patients experiencing disease relapse less than 12&#xD;
      months after finishing the second course of BCG therapy are also considered BCG-Unresponsive.&#xD;
      The Study will consist of 100 patients who will undergo two (2) PDT treatments employing 0.70&#xD;
      mg/cm^2 of TLD-1433 at Day 0 and Day 180.&#xD;

      1. Overall Study Design and Plan: Description&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a phase II, open-label, single-arm, multi-center Study conducted in Canada, the&#xD;
           United States and internationally. Patients with NMIBC CIS with or without resected&#xD;
           papillary disease (Ta, T1) that are considered BCG-Unresponsive or are intolerant to BCG&#xD;
           therapy that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled and treated. The&#xD;
           Study will consist of 100 patients who will receive PDT employing 0. 70 mg/cm^2&#xD;
           (Therapeutic Dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Screening Period&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be qualified for Study entry by review of inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
           during the Screening Period, which will last up to 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-Up Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients enrolled and treated by the treatment procedure will be followed until the&#xD;
           End of Study defined as completion of all required assessments after 12 months of&#xD;
           follow-up post treatment or earlier due to early discontinuation or withdrawal of&#xD;
           informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the Follow-Up Phase, information on efficacy and safety will be collected.&#xD;
           Assessments will be conducted at Day 0, 7, 30, 60, 90, 180, 187, 210, 240, 270 and 360.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Drug and PDT Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      TLD-1433 for intravesical administration is supplied as a lyophilisate for suspension in&#xD;
      Sterile Water for Injection into the bladder and is packaged in the dark in amber USP Type&#xD;
      III glass vials which can be stored at room temperature. Up to 24 hours before&#xD;
      administration, it is reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection to obtain the final&#xD;
      clinical dilution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TLD-1433 will be supplied to each Study site by Theralase. Instillations cannot be done&#xD;
      immediately following biopsy taken by TURBT. Investigators must wait a minimum of 7 days&#xD;
      before dosing patients after a TURBT/biopsy, and/or until any bladder wall integrity issues&#xD;
      have resolved. Dose/volume reductions are not allowed during this Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon determination of the bladder volume (during the screening period) through a voiding&#xD;
      diary or measuring instilled water volume, TLD-1433 to be instilled will be diluted to the&#xD;
      proper concentration. On day 0 (treatment day), patients will be asked to restrict fluid&#xD;
      intake 12 hours before Study Drug instillation. Study drug must be instilled into the&#xD;
      patient's empty bladder. Before instillation, a regular transurethral catheter should be&#xD;
      inserted and the bladder drained. A single instillation of TLD-1433 will be infused&#xD;
      intravesically for approximately 60 minutes, followed by 3 washes with sterile water. The&#xD;
      bladder will be distended using a fourth instillation of sterile water to prevent folds that&#xD;
      may prevent uniform light illumination. The laser technician worksheet must be completed&#xD;
      during the procedure and data must be promptly transferred to the corresponding electronic&#xD;
      Case Report Form (&quot;eCRF&quot;) page.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insertion of the optical fiber with spherical diffuser into the bladder will be monitored&#xD;
      under ultrasonic guidance. The optical fiber with spherical diffuser will be positioned in&#xD;
      the geometric center of the bladder with the aid of TLC-3200 and will be locked into place&#xD;
      using an endoscope holder for continuous irradiation for the total exposure time. Exposure&#xD;
      time will be calculated based on power emitted from the end of the optic fiber. The optic&#xD;
      fiber is inserted through a liquid-tight lock via a catheter into the urethra. The optical&#xD;
      power and treatment time will be determined to provide the correct dose of laser light to the&#xD;
      bladder surface area. Green laser light (wavelength = 532 nm, energy = 90 J/cm2) will be&#xD;
      irradiated from the emitter optical fiber via the spherical diffuser. The bladder volume may&#xD;
      be monitored during the procedure and water instilled or drained, as required, to keep the&#xD;
      bladder volume as consistent as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Dosing Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single whole bladder intravesical PDT with TLD-1433 and the TLC-3200 System is planned. Two&#xD;
      treatment procedures will be performed, a primary treatment at Day 0 and a secondary&#xD;
      treatment at Day 180 post primary treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 PDT Disruption&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NMIBC CIS with or without resected papillary disease (Ta, T1) that are&#xD;
      considered BCG-Unresponsive or who are intolerant to BCG therapy will be treated with this&#xD;
      Protocol. If one or more papillary tumours are seen at the time of cystoscopy for laser light&#xD;
      application (maximum 8 weeks after TURBT), a patient will be rescheduled for a TURBT&#xD;
      procedure to resect the papillary tumour(s) and a new treatment procedure date will be set,&#xD;
      even though previously instilled with TLD-1433.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of this Study is efficacy, evaluated by the Complete Response (&quot;CR&quot;) rate in patients with Carcinoma In-Situ (&quot;CIS&quot;) with or without resected papillary disease at 360 days post primary treatment. CR is defined as at least one of the following:&#xD;
Negative cystoscopy and negative (including atypical) urine cytology.&#xD;
Positive cystoscopy with biopsy-proven benign or low-grade NMIBC and negative cytology.&#xD;
Negative cystoscopy with malignant urine cytology, if cancer is found in the upper tract or prostatic urethra and random bladder biopsies are negative.&#xD;
For patients who are lost to follow-up or withdraw from the Study before recurrence or death, the CR will be censored at last disease assessment; for patients who start new anti- cancer treatment (i.e.: chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy) or undergo a cystectomy, the CR will be censored at the last disease assessment before the start of the new anti-cancer therapy or cystectomy.</description>

    <description>AE summaries will be provided showing the number and percentage of patients who experienced at least 1 AE. These summaries will be presented by body system and preferred term. AEs resulting in discontinuation will be summarized separately. Adverse Events (AEs) will be monitored from the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) until End of Study. The relationship of every AEs to the study drug will be determined and documented by the principal investigator whether considered treatment-related, and classified as related, unlikely, possibly, or probably related. All AEs should be treated appropriately. All AEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization or until End of Study (whichever comes first). The severity of each AE will be evaluated as mild, moderate, or severe.</description>
