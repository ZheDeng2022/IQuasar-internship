  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bowel dysfunction is consistently rated as one of the most common complications affecting&#xD;
      daily life for individuals with spinal cord injury. The overall objective of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate whether the use of specific spinal cord epidural stimulation will affect bowel&#xD;
      function. This study will also examine how alterations in bowel function influence quality of&#xD;
      life outcomes. The results of this study may aid in the development of treatments to help&#xD;
      individuals with spinal cord injuries that have impaired bowel function.&#xD;

      Participants in this study must be enrolled in the TS - EPI study (IRB# 16.0179) which&#xD;
      provides the spinal cord epidural implant and training interventions. You will receive two&#xD;
      sets of interventions, each one lasting 80 sessions for a total of 160 sessions. Assessments&#xD;
      for bowel function and quality of life will be performed as part of this study and are&#xD;
      conducted at baseline/pre-training, post-Intervention 1, post-Intervention 2, and at the&#xD;
      6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Your participation in this study will last up to 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>While lying on your side, while a small, flexible tube, about the size of a thermometer, with a balloon at the end will be inserted into the rectum.&#xD;
The catheter is connected to equipment that measures pressure. A small balloon attached to the catheter may be inflated in the rectum to assess muscle responses.&#xD;
You will be asked to relax, squeeze, and push at various times. The anal sphincter muscle pressures are measured during each of these muscle contraction/relaxation actions.&#xD;
Surface patch EMG electrodes will be placed near the buttocks to evaluate muscle activity of the anal sphincter.</description>

    <description>Complete a short questionnaire about your bowel management. 16 items: date of data collection, gastrointestinal and anal sphincter dysfunction unrelated to SCI, surgical procedures on the gastrointestinal tract, defecation method and bowel-care procedures, average time required for defecation, frequency of defecation, uneasiness, headache or perspiration during defecation, digital stimulation or evacuation of the anorectum, frequency of fecal incontinence, flatus incontinence, need to wear pad or plug, oral laxatives and prokinetics, anti-diarrheal agents, perianal problems, abdominal pain and discomfort and the neurogenic bowel dysfunction score are computed by adding the points given in parenthesis after each relevant variable in the data-set. Total score range is from (0-45). Total neurogenic bowel score (optional): 0-6 Very minor, 7-9 Minor, 10-13 Moderate, 14 or more, Severe neurogenic bowel dysfunction.</description>
