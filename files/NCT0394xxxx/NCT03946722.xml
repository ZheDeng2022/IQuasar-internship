  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1 in 7 couples experience difficulty in conceiving. Many will require in vitro fertilization&#xD;
      (IVF). IVF involves an initial period of downregulation to suppress the ovaries and prevent&#xD;
      premature ovulation. Hormone injections are then used to stimulate a woman's ovaries to&#xD;
      produce eggs which are removed by a minor operation. The harvested eggs are mixed with sperm&#xD;
      to create embryos in the laboratory. These embryos are replaced in the womb a few days after&#xD;
      they are created (fresh embryo transfer). Any remaining embryos are frozen such that they can&#xD;
      be thawed and transferred at a later date (frozen thawed embryo transfer, FTET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously shown that the presence of moderate or severe adenomyosis&#xD;
      significantly reduces the chance of clinical pregnancy after embryo transfer. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to examine whether it is possible to improve the chance of clinical pregnancy&#xD;
      in these women by modifying the IVF protocol they undergo for FTET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a prolonged downregulation regimen for women with adenomyosis would&#xD;
      reduce the inflammatory reaction in the endometrium of these women and thus improve the&#xD;
      chance of implantation after embryo transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients will be offered FTET. Those proceeding will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      protocols (A - standard protocol vs. B - prolonged downregulation protocol). Women will also&#xD;
      be offered a questionnaire before and after IVF treatment to assess their adenomyosis&#xD;
      symptoms .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is clinical pregnancy defined as an intrauterine pregnancy&#xD;
      with a visible heart beat older than 6 weeks gestation. Secondary outcomes include livebirth,&#xD;
      pregnancy loss (biochemical pregnancy, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth,&#xD;
      termination of pregnancy), gestational age at delivery, birth weight, neonatal mortality,&#xD;
      major congenital anomaly, serious medication reaction, number of frozen embryos available for&#xD;
      transfer, number of days to achieve optimal endometrial thickness.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine whether modified downregulation before embryo transfer&#xD;
      improves the chance of clinical pregnancy after embryo transfer in women with moderate/severe&#xD;
      adenomyosis of the uterus. A secondary objective is to evaluate the impact of IVF on&#xD;
      adenomyosis-related symptom presence, severity and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised, controlled, multi-site trial in women with moderate/severe adenomyosis of the&#xD;
      uterus undergoing frozen-thawed embryo transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, randomised controlled study of patients undergoing assisted&#xD;
      conception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to assisted conception all patients are referred for a diagnostic scan. The scan is&#xD;
      done in a systematic fashion starting from the uterus in longitudinal plane and measurement&#xD;
      of the endometrial thickness. The probe is then rotated to the transverse plane and the&#xD;
      uterus scanned from the cervix to the fundus with any uterine pathologies noted and measured&#xD;
      in 3 orthogonal planes. A 3D ultrasound volume is then be obtained and saved starting with&#xD;
      the uterus in longitudinal view making sure to include all uterine tissue in the 3D volume&#xD;
      sweep. Any congenital or acquired uterine anomalies are diagnosed according to published&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria. Adenomyosis is diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria outlined&#xD;
      by Exacoustos et al and Naftalin et al and graded for severity according to the number of&#xD;
      adenomyosis features present (assign a score of 1 for each of: i) asymmetrical myometrial&#xD;
      thickening, ii) parallel shadowing, iii) myometrial cysts, iv) disrupted endometrial&#xD;
      myometrial junction, v) endometrial striae, vi) endometrial islands, vii) adenomyoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operator then sweeps to the adnexae, starting from the left, identifies and measures the&#xD;
      ovaries in 3 orthogonal planes and documents the antral follicle count. Each ovary is&#xD;
      examined for the presence of cysts as well as for mobility and tenderness by gentle pressure&#xD;
      with the ultrasound probe. Once the ovaries have been assessed the operator examines the&#xD;
      pouch of Douglas for the presence of free fluid as well as any evidence of endometriosis such&#xD;
      as obliteration and/or endometriotic nodules as previously described by Holland et al.&#xD;
      Videosonography for a period of 5 mins will be performed. Once the ultrasound scan is&#xD;
      concluded all information is added to the clinical database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients found to have moderate or severe adenomyosis (4 or more features of adenomyosis as&#xD;
      defined by Mavrelos et al) on this scan will be approached by a member of the research team.&#xD;
      The researcher will describe the project and provide a copy of the patient information&#xD;
      leaflet. Patients will then be invited to return to the unit at a designated time for a scan&#xD;
      by a member of the research team. On return to the unit the researcher will repeat the scan&#xD;
      to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the scan and once eligibility is confirmed patients will be asked to confirm if they&#xD;
      want to participate in the trial. If they agree they will be asked to sign a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating patients will then be followed through the process of assisted conception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients will be randomized to one of two protocols (A vs. B) for frozen thawed&#xD;
      embryo transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol A (standard) - start Norethisterone on day 14 of downregulation cycle and continue&#xD;
      for 11 days. Start Buserelin 0.5ml on day 21 of downregulation cycle and reduce to 0.2ml on&#xD;
      day 1 of bleed. Baseline scan on day 1 - 5 of bleed and start Progynova 2mg TDS PO. Serial&#xD;
      scanning from day 10 until endometrial thickness more than 8mm. Once endometrial thickness&#xD;
      more than 8mm start cyclogest 400mg BD PV/PR and lubion 25mg BD and proceed to embryo&#xD;
      transfer on appropriate day for embryo age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol B (modified) - Baseline scan on day 1-5 of bleed and administer Triptorelin acetate&#xD;
      3.75 mg. 28 days later administer 1.875 mg Triptorelin acetate and 21 days later start&#xD;
      Progynova 2 mg TDS PO. Serial scanning from day 10 of Progynova until endometrial thickness&#xD;
      more than 8mm. Once endometrial thickness more than 8mm start Cyclogest 400mg BD PV/PR and&#xD;
      Lubion 25mg BD and proceed to embryo transfer on appropriate day for embryo age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be offered the opportunity to complete an adenomyosis symptom assessment&#xD;
      questionnaire at the start of their treatment, and again two months after completion of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial duration per participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      8-12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated total duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned trial sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of participants planned:&#xD;
&#xD;
      162.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently reported that the clinical pregnancy rate in women with moderate&#xD;
      to severe adenomyosis is 22.9% vs. 42.7% in women with mild disease. They speculate that the&#xD;
      modified protocol will improve the chance of clinical pregnancy to be equivalent to those&#xD;
      with mild disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      162 patients are required to have an 80% chance of detecting an increase in the clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy rate from 22.9% in the control group to 42.7% in the experimental group, as&#xD;
      significant at the 5% level (α = 0.05, β = 0.20). The trial is powered at 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methodology and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will first perform univariate analysis to explore significant differences&#xD;
      in the demographic characteristics (age, duration of subfertility), and clinical factors&#xD;
      known to impact the outcome of assisted conception (number of oocytes retrieved, number and&#xD;
      quality of embryos transferred) between women randomized to standard and modified FTET&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage analysis the investigators will perform univariate analysis to compare&#xD;
      the primary outcome (clinical pregnancy rate after FTET) between woman randomized to the&#xD;
      standard and modified clinical protocol. The investigators will perform univariate analysis&#xD;
      to compare secondary outcomes (livebirth, pregnancy loss (biochemical pregnancy, miscarriage,&#xD;
      ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, termination of pregnancy), gestational age at delivery, birth&#xD;
      weight, neonatal mortality, major congenital anomaly, serious medication reaction, number of&#xD;
      frozen embryos available for transfer, number of days to achieve optimal endometrial&#xD;
      thickness). They will perform a sub-analysis for women with co-existing endometriosis. All&#xD;
      models will be estimated in the Stat 12 statistical software.&#xD;
