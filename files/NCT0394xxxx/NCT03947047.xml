  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placenta accreta is a relatively rare event, in which the placenta is abnormally implanted&#xD;
      into the uterine myometrium. The most significant complication is intense bleeding, mainly&#xD;
      during labor. The incidence of placenta accreta increased during the last years due to the&#xD;
      increase in cesarean delivery rate, which is the main risk factor. Pre-cesarean diagnosis of&#xD;
      placenta accreta may improve surgical outcome. Early diagnosis allows appropriate preparation&#xD;
      of multidisciplinary team (including, among others; OB-GYN, urologists, anesthesiologists,&#xD;
      neonatologists) and massive blood products. Pre-cesarean diagnosis is based on imaging,&#xD;
      mainly ultra-sound. This modality has significant false positive rate which may result in&#xD;
      extreme sources investment and even indicated pre-term labor, in vain. Volatolome is a&#xD;
      complex of volatile markers emitted in several processes in the human body and collected from&#xD;
      breath, skin, urine, blood, feces and more. This profile may be used to identify volatile&#xD;
      markers for specific medical conditions. NA-NOSE is an electronic device knowing to identify&#xD;
      differences in the Volatolome between &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;sick&quot; subjects. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to identify specific volatile profile for placenta accreta which will help to&#xD;
      distinguish between women with placenta accreta and those without.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women with clinical risk factors for placenta accreta will perform targeted&#xD;
      sonographic evaluation for detection of placenta accreta features, according to a standard&#xD;
      protocol. Of those with clinical and sonographic risk factors who will agree to participate&#xD;
      in the study, will be asked to breathe through a collection device (NA-NOSE) for &quot;lung wash&quot;.&#xD;
      The participant will be instructed to inhale through the device and exhale to the ambient air&#xD;
      for about 3 minutes. After the lung wash step, the collector will inform the participant that&#xD;
      she is about to start filling the collective bags. At the end of a regular breath, after&#xD;
      exhaling, the collector will ask the participant to take a deep breath so the full volume of&#xD;
      the lungs is filled, and then exhale until both the dead space bag and collection bag are&#xD;
      full. After filling the first bag, a second bag will be placed and the participant will be&#xD;
      asked to repeat the act. In addition, a venous blood sample of 8-10 ml will be taken from&#xD;
      each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will be transferred to the Department of Chemical Engineering and Russell Berrie&#xD;
      Nanotechnology Institute, Technion-Israel, Institute of Technology. The samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed to determine the nature and composition of the volatile biomarkers in the related&#xD;
      breath and blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, the investigators will identify among women who have clinical and sonographic&#xD;
      risk factors for placenta accreta, those biomarkers distinguishing women with placenta&#xD;
      accreta (group 1) from those who will not have placenta accreta at birth (group 2).&#xD;
