  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In type 1 diabetes (T1D), immune defense cells in the body attack and destroy&#xD;
      insulin-producing beta cells leaving affected people with a lifelong need for daily insulin&#xD;
      injections. Even with insulin injections, blood glucose (sugar) control is imperfect and&#xD;
      leads to many health complications and a shortened life span. Our pilot study (NCT02117765)&#xD;
      has informed us that Ustekinumab is safe in the treatment of participants with recent-onset&#xD;
      T1D. Ustekinumab is currently licensed for use in psoriasis where it has proven to be both&#xD;
      highly effective and safe. The investigators hope that if the drug can block immune cells&#xD;
      soon after the development of diabetes, any remaining insulin-producing cells may be&#xD;
      protected, and regenerate, thus producing more insulin so that individuals may be insulin&#xD;
      free, or require less insulin. This trial will assess the efficacy of Ustekinumab in&#xD;
      decreasing C-peptide decline (proxy for endogenous insulin production) in participants with&#xD;
      recent onset T1D.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-centre phase II/II study to&#xD;
      assess efficacy and safety of Ustekinumab (STELARA®) in patients with T1D. The investigators&#xD;
      will perform a phase II/III clinical trial with a total of 66 adult (18-25 years old)&#xD;
      subjects with recent-onset T1D. There will be two study cohorts, with a drug:placebo ratio of&#xD;
      2:1. Patients receiving the study drug will receive a loading dose of 6mg/kg Ustekinumab IV&#xD;
      given at week 0. Thereafter, 90mg Ustekinumab subcutaneously given at weeks 8, 16, 24, 32,&#xD;
      40, 48 (total of 7 doses). Patients randomized to receive placebo will receive respective&#xD;
      amounts of a saline-placebo. An additional non-dosing visit at the midpoint (week 28) is&#xD;
      required to measure 2-hour C-peptide during a MMTT. Patients will be followed for 78 weeks&#xD;
      following the first dose. There will be a total of 10 study visits over 78 weeks, three of&#xD;
      which are non-dosing and follow-up visits. Recruitment and screening for the study will be&#xD;
      completed within the first 24 months. The follow up period is 1 and 1.5 years from the first&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>There will be a total of 60 patients enrolled in the study. The study participants will be enrolled at 2 centers (Vancouver and Toronto), and will be referred by adult or pediatric endocrinologists. This sample size estimation is based on results from week 52 C-peptide AUC values observed in the pilot UST1D study and the expected 1-year C-peptide decline in adult-onset T1D patients. Using a 2:1 Ustekinumab vs. placebo randomized assignment, a sample size of 60 yields 85% power to detect improvement in C-peptide function (alpha = 0.05) in the Ustekinumab group for an unstratified analysis at 12 months. Sixty-six participants (44 active: 22 placebo) will be recruited to allow for an approximate 10% loss to follow-up.</intervention_model_description>
