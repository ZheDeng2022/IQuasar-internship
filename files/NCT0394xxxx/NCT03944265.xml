      This trial studies the use of genetics and shared decision making in improving care for&#xD;
      patients with stage IVA-C non-small cell lung cancer. Developing educational tools may help&#xD;
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer to increase patient treatment knowledge, reduce&#xD;
      decisional conflict, and promote treatment shared decision making with their health care&#xD;
      providers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Use the information on genomic tumor diagnostics, provider treatment recommendations, and&#xD;
      patient and provider feedback on the treatment decision making process, which will be used to&#xD;
      develop materials and methods to adapt an existing decision counseling program (DCP) for use&#xD;
      with patients diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) as a standard&#xD;
      component of clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Pilot test the adapted DCP in a subset of patients to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      delivering the DCP session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess DCP effects on patient treatment knowledge and decisional conflict. III. Assess&#xD;
      treatment choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I: Use physician input to develop draft treatment education materials and use patient&#xD;
      input to adapt an online decision counseling application for use in helping patients clarify&#xD;
      treatment preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients complete a treatment decision counseling session/interview about genetic&#xD;
      testing and supportive/palliative care with a qualified member of the research team in-person&#xD;
      or via telephone. Health care providers receive a 1-page summary of session results for use&#xD;
      in treatment shared decision making at the next office visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 30 and 60 days.&#xD;

    <description>Results will be reported descriptively. A Decision Counseling Program (DCP) is a tool that allows patients and physicians to engage shared decision making. The DCP will be created based on genetic tumor diagnostics, provider treatment recommendations, and feedback from patients and providers gathered from interviews.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of the adapted DCP in a subset of patients: proportion of consenting patients who complete the DCP</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Results will be reported descriptively. The feasibility endpoint will be the proportion of consenting patients who complete the DCP, about which we will estimate an exact 95% confidence interval by the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Results will be reported descriptively on pre and post surveys that will be completed by patients Survey is the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) Total and subscores have applicable items are a) summed; b) divide by 10; and c) multiplied by 25 Total Score Items 1-10 Score range: 0 [No decisional conflict] to 100 [extremely high decisional conflict].&#xD;
Uncertainty Sub score Items 9, 10 Score range: 0 [feels extremely certain about best choice] to 100 [feels extremely uncertain about best choice] Informed Sub score Items 1, 2, 3 Score range: 0 [feels extremely informed] to 100 [feels extremely uninformed].&#xD;
Values Clarity Sub score Items 4, 5 Score range: 0 [feels extremely clear about person; a values for benefits and risks/side effects] to 100 [feels extremely unclear about personal value] Support Sub score Items 6, 7, 8 Score range: 0 [feels extremely supported in decision making] to 100 [feels extremely unsupported in decision making]</description>
