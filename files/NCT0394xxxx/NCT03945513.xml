    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to demonstrate the contraceptive efficacy of LPRI424,&#xD;
      Additional goals of the trial are to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of LPRI424.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-controlled trial in postmenarcheal&#xD;
      and premenopausal female subjects, including adolescents, between the ages of 15 and 45 who&#xD;
      present to the clinic seeking contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening, informed consent will be obtained and the screening procedures will be&#xD;
      performed. After confirmation of the subject's eligibility, the subject will be provided with&#xD;
      the investigational product and trained in the use of an electronic diary. Afterwards, the&#xD;
      subjects will attend visit the clinical site on Day 20±2 of the 1st, 3rd, 6th and 9th cycles&#xD;
      and on Day 29+2 of the 13th cycle. The last clinical site visit will occur 10-14 days after&#xD;
      the 13th cycle visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include women who have never used hormonal contraceptives before consent&#xD;
      (naïve users), women who have used hormonal contraceptives in the past but have had a&#xD;
      contraceptive-free period before consent and a full menstrual cycle during the drug-free&#xD;
      period (previous users) as well as women directly switching from another hormonal method&#xD;
      (switchers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events and safety information will be collected throughout the study.&#xD;
