  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well the combination of ibrutinib and venetoclax works in&#xD;
      treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia whose cancer has stopped responding to&#xD;
      ibrutinib alone. Both ibrutinib and venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving ibrutinib and venetoclax together&#xD;
      after development of ibrutinib resistance may work better than discontinuing ibrutinib and&#xD;
      switching to other chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Overall response rate to combination ibrutinib and venetoclax after 12 cycles&#xD;
      (intervention cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Rate of mutation negative status after 12 cycles of combination venetoclax and ibrutinib&#xD;
      (intervention cohort ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Incidence of BTK C481S mutations during ibrutinib treatment (observation cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Progression-free survival after development of a BTK C481S mutation (observation cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Progression-free and overall survival after adding venetoclax to ibrutinib (intervention&#xD;
      cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Type and incidence of adverse events during combination ibrutinib and venetoclax&#xD;
      treatment in this patient population (intervention cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine patient and disease characteristics associated with clinical disease progression&#xD;
      in a univariable and multivariable analysis (observation cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the changes in the allelic frequency of ibrutinib resistance mutations after&#xD;
      their development (observation cohort) and after venetoclax is added (intervention cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine novel resistance mechanisms to ibrutinib and ibrutinib/venetoclax combination&#xD;
      therapy by whole exome and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing at baseline and clinical&#xD;
      relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Perform BH3 profiling and correlate with response to combination venetoclax and ibrutinib&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBSERVATION COHORT: Patients who are taking ibrutinib enter Observation cohort and undergo&#xD;
      screening every 3 months for development for genetic mutations. If mutations develop,&#xD;
      patients undergo increased screening for development of clinical disease progression.&#xD;
      Patients who develop clinical disease progression with or without mutations enter the&#xD;
      Intervention cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION COHORT: Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) daily and ibrutinib PO once&#xD;
      daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete&#xD;
      remission (CR) after 12 or 24 cycles continue receiving ibrutinib PO QD on days 1-28 in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

    <description>Defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved any response better than stable disease after 12 cycles of combination ibrutinib and venetoclax treatment.
