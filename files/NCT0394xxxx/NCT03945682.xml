      The overall aim of the study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) studying the effectiveness of physiotherapy intervention (virtual&#xD;
      training) in children with ataxia following surgical resection of posterior fossa tumour&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain tumours are the most common group of solid tumours in children accounting for nearly a&#xD;
      quarter of all childhood cancers. There are approximately 500 new cases of central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) tumours in children/adolescents reported in the UK per year. Although prognosis&#xD;
      has improved over the last 30 years, brain tumours remain the leading cause of&#xD;
      tumour-associated death in children. Surgical resection is a mainstay of management of&#xD;
      children with brain tumours, as for several tumour types there is strong evidence that&#xD;
      survival and progression free survival are influenced by the degree of resection. Therefore&#xD;
      extensive tumour removal is an operative goal, but the morbidity of surgery along with any&#xD;
      subsequent oncological treatment should also be considered. The NICE guidelines for improving&#xD;
      outcomes in children and young people with cancer identify that 'Survivors of CNS malignancy&#xD;
      are among the neediest of all cancer survivors, because of the effects of the tumour and&#xD;
      multimodality therapy, all of which affect neurological, psychological, endocrine and&#xD;
      academic function and become more evident with increasing age'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with posterior fossa tumours (PFT), which account for approximately 50% of all&#xD;
      childhood brain tumours, have a distinctive set of issues e.g. potential for gross change&#xD;
      pre/post operatively, rapid onset of ataxia, hydrocephalus and increased intra-cranial&#xD;
      pressure adding deficits distinct from ataxia, in addition to potential problems from any&#xD;
      subsequent oncological management such as radiotherapy. Of these issues, ataxia is the&#xD;
      predominant motor problem in children with posterior fossa tumours. Ataxia can describe a&#xD;
      related number of impairments including upper limb control, balance, gait difficulties, eye&#xD;
      movement issues and speech problems. It is a presenting sign in 58-90% of children with&#xD;
      posterior fossa tumours. Ataxia and balance problems also persist long term following&#xD;
      surgery, Piscione et al found 70% of children with posterior fossa tumours will have long&#xD;
      term post-operative balance problems. Lannering et al specified that truncal ataxia was the&#xD;
      most disabling motor impairment in children with brain tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to neuro-rehabilitation is recognized as crucial in paediatric neuro-oncology with&#xD;
      physiotherapy integral to this; yet there is no consensus as to the type, intensity or timing&#xD;
      of interventions. A literature review of physical therapy/physiotherapy for children with&#xD;
      ataxia (of any origin) was carried out in preparation for this project to confirm the&#xD;
      literature gap, and consider interventions that have been of value in other pathologies&#xD;
      causing ataxia. Ten papers in total were identified which included three review papers that&#xD;
      covered adult and paediatric literature though the data were not separated in the studies to&#xD;
      enable consideration of paediatrics as a distinct group. Overall the reviews concurred there&#xD;
      was a suggestion of the benefit of physiotherapy (including treadmill training,&#xD;
      rehabilitation, virtual training) though treatment modalities were often not consistently&#xD;
      defined and evidence was typically of low quality (level III/IV). The recommendations from&#xD;
      these reviews are that the next step would be to undertake RCTs (randomised controlled&#xD;
      trials) in more homogenous patient groups. Looking at the paediatric literature, there were&#xD;
      three case studies identified (and one case series with a population of three adolescents)&#xD;
      again in differing diagnoses though none were examining children with brain tumours that is&#xD;
      the most common acute cause for ataxia in the paediatric population. The largest paediatric&#xD;
      study (n=10) identified through the literature review was a cohort study by Ilg et al&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of virtual training. Virtual training refers to the use of computer&#xD;
      technologies that provide an interactive environment that requires limb movement to react to&#xD;
      on screen game play. Ilgs study found positive results and proposed that virtual training&#xD;
      should then complement/supplement therapy treatment tailored according to the individual and&#xD;
      continued in the home environment. Virtual training has also been explored in other&#xD;
      paediatric populations e.g. cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall the literature review highlighted that there is a gap in the literature regarding&#xD;
      physiotherapy intervention for children with ataxia, in particular there is no literature on&#xD;
      effectiveness of physiotherapy for children with brain tumours. However, there is an emerging&#xD;
      evidence base in adults with ataxia and to a lesser extent paediatric populations as&#xD;
      described above, from similar (though non acute) lesions in the cerebellum reporting the&#xD;
      benefits of balance therapies including virtual training. This suggests the potential for&#xD;
      recovery from ataxia in similar conditions i.e. children with damage to the cerebellum&#xD;
      following surgical resection of posterior fossa tumour.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child or young person (4-&lt;18 years) demonstrating ataxia. (For this study, ataxia is&#xD;
             currently defined as SARA greater than 2. This definition is taken from data from the&#xD;
             CARS study to date, from the cut off threshold value distinguishing no ataxia from&#xD;
             mild ataxia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  12 months to 3 years following surgical resection of posterior fossa tumour. (This&#xD;
             time frame has been selected as this covers the time when the children will typically&#xD;
             have completed any adjunct oncology treatment and therefore more emphasis is dedicated&#xD;
             to rehabilitation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically unstable/currently undergoing adjunctive treatment e.g. radiotherapy or&#xD;
             chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 4 years of age (due to inability to complete standardized assessments)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18 or over&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to stand independently for less than one minute or SARA gait item score over 4,&#xD;
             either of which would inhibit capacity to complete the training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of co-morbities with the potential to affect the safety of training, such as&#xD;
             congenital or acquired disorders causing high risk of falls or lack of comprehension&#xD;
             of training tasks, or current musculoskeletal impairments (such as a non-union&#xD;
             fracture or fracture currently healing limiting weight-bearing)&#xD;
