  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper Gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a medical emergency and the most common cause of&#xD;
      hospitalization associated with digestive disease. Proper initial resuscitation is the first&#xD;
      step in the management of UGIB patients. Today, modern pulmonary ultrasound is used in&#xD;
      different clinical settings, such as intensive care, emergency medicine and/or traumatology.&#xD;
      In the last years, the use of this has been standardized both in internal medicine and in&#xD;
      pulmonary medicine. The primary objective is to describe the findings of pulmonary ultrasound&#xD;
      and its relationship with severity in patients with UGIB. The investigators will include all&#xD;
      patients with UGIB. A pulmonary and vena cava ultrasound will be performed on admission to&#xD;
      the emergency room, 10 minutes prior to endoscopy and 24 hours after having performed the&#xD;
      endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of thoracic point-of-care ultrasound (TPOCUS) has been standardized in both internal&#xD;
      and pulmonary medicine. There is a concern about the role of TPOCUS useful as a severity&#xD;
      prognostic tool in patients with UGIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team proposes that TPOCUS is a severity prognostic tool in UGIB patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome: To describe the findings of TPOCUS in patients with variceal and non-variceal&#xD;
      UGIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Correlate the presence of B-type lines on TPOCUS with mean arterial pressure in UGIB&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlate the inferior vena cava diameter with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease&#xD;
           scale in UGIB patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlate the inferior vena cava diameter with the 48 hours post-admission mortality of&#xD;
           UGIB patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authors design a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study to identify the findings of&#xD;
      TPOCUS in patients with variceal and non-variceal UGIB. Patients will be included in the&#xD;
      study since May 15th through October 30th 2019, admitted to the University Hospital, &quot;Dr.&#xD;
      José E. González&quot;, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León.&#xD;

      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with a diagnosis of UGIB documented by endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Over 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with UGIB previously treated in other hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients under 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with suspected UGIB who did not undergo endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients with interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients with pleural effusion at the time of admission to the emergency room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Refusal to participate in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The investigators will study all patients who come to the emergency room of the&#xD;
      hospital due to suspicion of UGIB (melena, hematemesis, vomiting in coffee grounds and&#xD;
      hematochezia with hemodynamic instability). These patients will undergo a pulmonary and vena&#xD;
      cava ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with suspected UGIB who are candidates for upper endoscopy during their hospital&#xD;
      stay will undergo a second pulmonary and vena cava ultrasound ten minutes prior to upper&#xD;
      endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include in the research study patients with UGIB documented by upper&#xD;
      endoscopy. The investigators will perform a third pulmonary and vena cava ultrasound 24 hours&#xD;
      after the endoscopic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will exclude patients with suspected UGIB but who are not candidates for&#xD;
      endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique used is a bilateral intercostal thoracic point-of-care ultrasound (TPOCUS) with&#xD;
      the patient in supine decubitus with the head at 30 degrees. Each hemithorax will be divided&#xD;
      into 4 areas: anterior and lateral, superior and inferior. The anterior area will be&#xD;
      delineated between the clavicle and the diaphragm and between the parasternal line to the&#xD;
      anterior axillary line. The lateral area will be delineated between the axilla and the&#xD;
      diaphragm and between the anterior to the posterior axillary line. The superior area will be&#xD;
      delineated from the 1st to the 3rd intercostal space and the lower area from the 4th to the&#xD;
      6th intercostal space. A total of 8 areas of the chest will be visualized during normal&#xD;
      breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TPOCUS findings to report are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-type lines: Those lines are hydro-aerial artifacts presenting as comet tail images, begin&#xD;
      in the pleural line, are hyper-echoic, well defined, disseminated towards the end of the&#xD;
      screen, delete A-type lines, and move with the pleural slip when this it is present. The&#xD;
      lines separated from each other around 7 mm correspond to interstitial edema, while those&#xD;
      that distance 3 mm indicate the presence of alveolar edema. The presence of more than 3&#xD;
      B-type lines indicates the presence of an alveolar-interstitial syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inferior cava vein evaluation will be performed by measuring the diameter and percentage&#xD;
      of collapse of this vein. It will be performed in the subxiphoid window with the&#xD;
      identification of the four cardiac chambers, then a 90º turn of the transducer will made in&#xD;
      the cephalad direction, which will show the right atrium, the union of the inferior vena cava&#xD;
      and the liver above it. The diameter measurement will be beyond the point of confluence of&#xD;
      the hepatic veins, usually found approximately 2 cm from the union of the inferior vena cava&#xD;
      and the right atrium. Based on the diameter and collapse percentage measurement of the&#xD;
      inferior vena cava on spontaneous breathing, a volume status will be defined as lack of&#xD;
      volume if the diameter is &lt;2 cm and the collapse percentage is &gt;50%; however, a diameter &gt;2&#xD;
      cm and a collapse percentage &lt;50% will be classified as hypervolemic state.&#xD;
