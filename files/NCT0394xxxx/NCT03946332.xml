  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical exercises program is known to improve quality of life, chronical fatigue and appears&#xD;
      to be a behavioural recommendation against cancer as primary and tertiary prevention.&#xD;
      Nutritional status is also important in cancer patients: a loss of 5% of weight increases the&#xD;
      complication risks and decreases survival and the quality of life. Interactions between&#xD;
      physical activity and haematological malignancies are less described compared to solid&#xD;
      cancers. Methodology and protocols are also heterogeneous. Supervised exercises program&#xD;
      improves the physical condition and the quality of life; however there are few randomised&#xD;
      studies versus a controlled group. Post autograft evaluation for myeloma patients showed a&#xD;
      physical deficit with increased fat mass, but in this particular population physical&#xD;
      exercises need to be more explored. This project is a randomised study versus controlled&#xD;
      group that evaluates supervised physical exercises program in a homogenous population:&#xD;
      patients under-65-years-old with multiple myeloma and who will undergo autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

      Physical exercises program is known to improve quality of life, chronical fatigue and appears&#xD;
      to be a behavioural recommendation against cancer as primary and tertiary prevention.&#xD;
      Nutritional status is also important in cancer patients: a loss of 5% of weight increases the&#xD;
      complication risks and decreases survival and the quality of life. Interactions between&#xD;
      physical activity and haematological malignancies are less described compared to solid&#xD;
      cancers. This multicentre project is a randomised study versus controlled group that&#xD;
      evaluates supervised physical exercises program in a homogenous population: patients&#xD;
      under-65-years-old with multiple myeloma and who will undergo autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. The hypothesis of this study is that a supervised physical exercises program&#xD;
      during and after autograft might have a positive impact on the physical capacities and the&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experimental arm, patients will benefit regularly from a physical exercises program&#xD;
      during their hospitalization. When going back home, they will be given a practical help kit&#xD;
      with specific equipment (dumbbell, elastic), an actimeter with heart rate monitoring (in&#xD;
      order to have an objective collection of the physical practice in addition to a&#xD;
      self-evaluation) and a physical exercises program on paper and video supports, that patients&#xD;
      would have learnt during their hospitalization. Furthermore, SMS will be regularly sent to&#xD;
      remind them to practice. In the controlled arm, patients will be hospitalized in the same&#xD;
      conditions than the experimental group and can practice if they want. At the end of the&#xD;
      hospitalization, they will receive a paper document with global informations about physical&#xD;
      exercises including a few simple exercises. Evaluations will be carried out in both arms at&#xD;
      day 0, day 30 and day 90 from autograft. The post graft follow up will be done at the same&#xD;
      time as the medical consultation and before the maintenance treatment.&#xD;
