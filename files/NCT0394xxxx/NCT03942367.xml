      Multi-center, international, prospective, randomized, double-blind, two-arms,&#xD;
      sham-controlled, first-in-human clinical investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Patients will be allocated to one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A (Active Device Group): Patients will receive a fully functioning vPatch device,&#xD;
           pre-configured to deliver stimulation intensity according to the subjective motor&#xD;
           threshold intensity reported by the Patients. Pre-configured stimulation intensity&#xD;
           cannot be changed by the Patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B (Sham Device Group): Patients will receive a vPatch device pre-configured to&#xD;
           deliver the sensory electrical stimulation according to the subjective sensory threshold&#xD;
           that is ineffective for muscle activation. Pre-configured stimulation intensity cannot&#xD;
           be changed by the Patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start with a Screening Visit (Visit 1), when potential Patients complaining of&#xD;
      PE will be informed about the investigation and its objectives. If they agree to participate,&#xD;
      after signing a valid Informed Consent Form they will undergo a full medical history and&#xD;
      physical examination and will be selected according to eligibility criteria except IELT&#xD;
      (which will be examined at the next visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety profile of the vPatch device and&#xD;
      its effectiveness in delaying ejaculation when used in Patients suffering of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the Patient's perception of the ease of use of the vPatch device and&#xD;
           treatment, through the use of a dedicated questionnaire (Usability Questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the Patient's perception of the changes in his Premature Ejaculation Profile&#xD;
           (PEP) under different aspects with the use of device, through the use of a dedicated&#xD;
           questionnaire (Control and Distress Domains of the Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP)&#xD;
           Questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the Patient's perceived intensity of orgasm by using the vPatch device,&#xD;
           through the use of a validated tool (Orgasmometer).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the first visit the Patients will undergo a run-in Home Phase, during which they will&#xD;
      be asked to have 4 sexual intercourse sessions with their female partners, in the privacy of&#xD;
      their home, during which their partner will measure their intravaginal ejaculatory latency&#xD;
      time (IELT) using a stopwatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the run-in Home Phase the Patients will be requested to attend to the hospital (Visit&#xD;
      2) and the ones with a IELT value confirming their eligibility will be randomized in the&#xD;
      trial (otherwise they will be excluded as Screening Failures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 will include three steps. Step 1: conditioning stimulation, delivered to the&#xD;
      Patient's forearm muscles, aiming at familiarizing and adapting the Patient to transcutaneous&#xD;
      electrical stimulation. Stimulation during Step 1 will be delivered using a CE approved&#xD;
      TensMed S82 device. Following the conditioning stimulation, the Patient will undergo Step 2:&#xD;
      incrementally increasing perineal stimulation, in order to identify the electrical intensity&#xD;
      of his sensory and motor activation. The Patient will recognize motor activation as a muscle&#xD;
      contraction, similarly to the voluntary induced muscle contraction when delaying urination.&#xD;
      Step 2 will be repeated twice. Finally, the Patient will undergo Step 3: 10 to 15 minutes&#xD;
      (according to Investigator's discretion) of continuous functional intensity stimulation,&#xD;
      delivered to the Patient's perineum, aiming at demonstrating safety of prolonged stimulation.&#xD;
      Stimulation during Steps 2 and 3 will be delivered using the investigational BLE (Bluetooth&#xD;
      Low Energy)-enabled vPatch device. Furthermore, the Investigator will carefully instruct the&#xD;
      Patient how to safely place the device, how to safely use of the device, and how to remove&#xD;
      the device. During this visit the baseline assessments (see flow chart) will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the Visit 2, the Home Phase will initiate, where the Patients will be asked to have&#xD;
      4 sexual intercourse sessions with their female partners, in the privacy of their home,&#xD;
      during which their partner will measure their Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time (IELT)&#xD;
      using a stopwatch. The 4 sessions will include four IELT measurements, while the&#xD;
      investigational BLE-disabled vPatch device is applied, pre-configured either delivering a&#xD;
      functional stimulation to 40 Patients (Active Device Group) or sensory stimulation to 20&#xD;
      Patients (Sham Device Group). All Patients will be informed that the stimulation is not&#xD;
      necessarily detectable. The Investigator will call the Patients every day during the first&#xD;
      three days of the Home Phase to monitor the progression and to remind to fill in the 72 h&#xD;
      Safety Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Patients will be requested to return to the site (Visit 3) after 4 intercourse sessions&#xD;
      with their female partners in order to undergo the assessments foreseen by protocol (see flow&#xD;
      chart) and to return the filled questionnaires and the used device. This will be considered&#xD;
      the End of Trial Visit.&#xD;
