  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease (CHD) is predominantly detected before birth. Using echocardiography&#xD;
      and MRI, this study will determine whether acute exposure to maternal hyperoxygenation (MH)&#xD;
      leads to measurable increases in fetal cerebral oxygenation from baseline in fetuses with&#xD;
      CHD. The study aims to determine whether MH could be used as a chronic in-utero treatment&#xD;
      strategy to promote brain growth/maturation to birth and to improve postnatal&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes, and identify the types of CHD most likely to benefit from&#xD;
      chronic MH.&#xD;

      This study determines the impact of administering oxygen to mother during the later part of&#xD;
      pregnancy on cerebral oxygen delivery in fetuses who were identified with severe forms of&#xD;
      Congenital Heart disease (CHD) including the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Single ventricular (SV) lesions, including hypoplastic left heart syndrome&#xD;
           (HLHS); pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS); tricuspid atresia&#xD;
           (TA); unbalanced AV septal defect (AVSD); double inlet ventricle (DILV); and severe form&#xD;
           of Ebstein's anomaly (EA with pulmonary atresia) of the tricuspid valve; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF),including TOF-like double outlet right ventricle&#xD;
           (DORV), pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA/VSD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: Bi-ventricular lesions with transposition of the great arteries (TGA),&#xD;
           including DORV with TGA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with severe CHD experience challenges in multiple developmental domains, impacting&#xD;
      executive function, memory, language, and other aspects of cognitive and motor function. It&#xD;
      is now well established that brain growth and development are adversely affected by CHD and&#xD;
      it is increasingly clear that central nervous system changes that occur in the third&#xD;
      trimester play a particularly important role in the pathogenesis of adverse&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental maternal oxygen will used in the last trimester for a short period of time&#xD;
      (acute MH) in pregnant mothers carrying babies with CHD to briefly increase fetal oxygen&#xD;
      levels to those reached in the newborn with spontaneous breathing. This study will examine&#xD;
      whether and to what degree acute MH will improve the cerebrovascular oxygenation. The rate&#xD;
      and duration of MH (10 to 15L/min by mask for up to 30-45 minutes/test) is considered to be&#xD;
      safe to the mother and her fetus. Both fetal echocardiography and fetal MRI will be used to&#xD;
      determine the effects of acute MH on the fetal-placental circulation and will determine in&#xD;
      fetuses with CHD whether acute exposure to MH leads to measurable increases in fetal cerebral&#xD;
      oxygenation from baseline. Thus it could potentially become useful as a chronic in-utero&#xD;
      treatment strategy to promote brain growth/maturation to birth and to improve postnatal&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes.&#xD;
