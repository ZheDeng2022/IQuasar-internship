      This evaluation will be conducted in ten countries involved in the Catalyzing Pediatric TB&#xD;
      Innovation (CaP-TB) project: Cameroon, Cote D'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya,&#xD;
      Lesotho, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe and India. The CaP-TB project is a project&#xD;
      designed to use innovative methods and capacity building to strengthen the health systems of&#xD;
      developing countries in terms of pediatric TB case detection, early accurate diagnosis and&#xD;
      effective treatment. This project is funded by Unitaid and is implemented by Elizabeth Glaser&#xD;
      Pediatric AIDS Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGPAF proposes to evaluate the implementation of CaP-TB in up to 450 sites in ten&#xD;
      participating countries. This evaluation will assess the effects of CaP-TB innovative&#xD;
      interventions on selected service delivery outcomes as compared to routine TB program in a&#xD;
      sub-set of project sites in the ten countries.&#xD;

      This pre-post quasi-experimental evaluation study will be conducted in ten countries involved&#xD;
      in the Catalyzing Pediatric TB Innovation (CaP-TB) project: Cameroon, Cote D'Ivoire,&#xD;
      Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe and India.&#xD;
      The CaP-TB project is a project designed to use innovative methods and capacity building to&#xD;
      strengthen the health systems of developing countries in terms of pediatric TB case&#xD;
      detection, early accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. This project is funded by&#xD;
      Unitaid headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland and is implemented by Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric&#xD;
      AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) with headquarters in Washington, D.C. and Geneva and 10 country&#xD;
      offices. This study will assess the effects of CaP-TB innovative interventions on selected&#xD;
      service delivery outcomes as compared to routine TB program in a sub-set of project sites in&#xD;
      ten countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CaP TB project is a 4-year (October 1, 2017-September 30, 2021) Unitaid-funded project to&#xD;
      improve pediatric TB outcomes by introducing integrated and decentralized models of pediatric&#xD;
      TB care and strengthening access to WHO-recommended drugs and diagnostics. Integration refers&#xD;
      to supporting TB activities, such as screening and TB sample collection for children, into&#xD;
      non-TB health care services, such as general pediatric outpatient clinics. Decentralization&#xD;
      refers to moving pediatric TB services from higher levels of health clinics to lower levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the CaP TB project on the below TB service indicators and clinical outcomes for&#xD;
      children 0-14 in facilities implementing the CaP TB project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and proportion of children screened for TB among clinic attendees&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and proportion of presumptive TB cases referred for lab-based TB diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and proportion of pediatric presumptive TB cases who are tested with Xpert&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and proportion (out of all children screened) of pediatric cases diagnosed with&#xD;
           active TB disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time between when a child is identified as a presumptive TB case and when the child is&#xD;
           diagnosed with TB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and proportion of pediatric TB cases started on DS-TB treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time between when a child is identified as a presumptive TB case and when the child is&#xD;
           initiated on TB treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and proportion of pediatric DS-TB cases or cases treated with first-line TB&#xD;
           treatment who achieve treatment success&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and proportion of all TB index cases for whom successful contact tracing has been&#xD;
           done&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and proportion of pediatric household contacts who are negative to TB screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention retrospective data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the standard of care condition (baseline), the investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capture data that will answer the TB service indicators and clinical outcomes listed in&#xD;
           the primary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capture key data points that will be needed to estimate project targets In each site,&#xD;
           trained data collectors will retrospectively extract data from appropriate registers,&#xD;
           logs, and in some cases patient files, for a period of 12 months starting 6 months&#xD;
           before the start date of data extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the implementation of the CaP TB project, prospective data will be collected by&#xD;
      project-specific data collection tools and/or from existing registers. Whenever possible, the&#xD;
      CaP TB data collection will use existing site level data collection tools to gather the data&#xD;
      for the project.&#xD;
