  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating PDR001 in two arms&#xD;
      for concurrent chemoradiation and consolidation in the treatment-naïve patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (arm A and&#xD;
      arm B):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A (consolidation only arm) will be treated with standard platinum-based concurrent&#xD;
           chemoradiotherapy, followed by consolidation with PDR001 regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B (concurrent arm) will be treated with PDR001 concurrent with standard&#xD;
           platinum-based chemoradiation, followed by consolidation with PDR001 regimen.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    Due to the delay in the study shceduled, due to the start of competitive study and the approval&#xD;
    of Durvalumab from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, it was judged that it was difficult to&#xD;
    enroll subjects.&#xD;
