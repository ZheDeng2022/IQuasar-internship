  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that in humans, eating a&#xD;
      relatively big amount of chocolate at the wrong time (bedtime) may disrupt our circadian&#xD;
      system (change the circadian phase), while taking this same amount of chocolate in the&#xD;
      morning (wake up condition) may synchronize it. Other related factors may be also affected&#xD;
      such as total body weight and body fat, dietary habits (total energy intake and macronutrient&#xD;
      distribution), the timing of food intake and of sleep, daily rhythms of TAP, microflora&#xD;
      composition and postprandial glycemia.&#xD;

      Recent studies suggest that not only &quot;what&quot; the people eat, but also &quot;when&quot; the people eat&#xD;
      may have a significant role in obesity treatment and in the regulation of the circadian&#xD;
      system. Thus, the hypothesis of this study is eating a relatively big amount of chocolate at&#xD;
      the wrong time, bedtime may affect:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Metabolism: resting energy expenditure, corrected resting energy respiratory quotient&#xD;
           (RQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Glucose metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Total weight loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Food intake, total energy intake, and type of food&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Microflora (feces)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Mood&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Disrupt our circadian system 7a) Changes in Temperature, Actimetry, and Position 7b)&#xD;
           Electrocardiogram (ECG) 7c) Melatonin (two points) cortisol rhythm (three points) While&#xD;
           having this same amount of chocolate in the morning (wake up condition) may synchronize&#xD;
           it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other related factors may be also affected such as total body weight and body fat, dietary&#xD;
      habits (total energy intake and macronutrient distribution), the timing of food intake and of&#xD;
      sleep, daily rhythms of TAP, microflora composition and postprandial glycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      19 women (postmenopausal) following the habitual dietary habits of participants (ad libitum)&#xD;
      will have 30% of the habitual total daily calories in chocolate of participants (Nestle,&#xD;
      &quot;chocolate with milk&quot;) during two consecutive weeks each under three conditions: eating&#xD;
      chocolate within 1 hour of habitual wake-time, eating chocolate within 1 hours of habitual&#xD;
      bedtime, or eating no chocolate. No other chocolate (i.e., none at all in control and in the&#xD;
      washout weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be a randomized, cross-over design, with a 1-week washout between each&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 14 days in each condition, the participants will record sleep and activity&#xD;
      schedules by dairy, food intake and food timing by phone application, daily rhythms of wrist&#xD;
      temperature, activity and position (TAP).&#xD;
