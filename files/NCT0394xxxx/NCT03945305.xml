    <textblock>
      In this study, 1000 cases of essential hypertension in changping district, Beijing, who are&#xD;
      currently taking oral antihypertensive drugs and still have poor blood pressure control (&gt;&#xD;
      130/80mmHg) are included. The duration of the study is 3+ (30±2) days, during which time the&#xD;
      changing of antihypertensive drugs are avoided and the types and doses of drugs taken daily&#xD;
      are recorded. Baseline blood pressure and heart rate are measured 2 times a day for 3 days.&#xD;
      And then the blood pressure and heart rate are measured before and after remote ischemic&#xD;
      conditioning for 200mmHg, twice a day, 30±2 days in a row to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of remote ischemic conditioning on essential hypertension.&#xD;

    <description>Baseline blood pressure and heart rate are measured 2 times a day for 3 days. And then the blood pressure and heart rate are measured before and after remote ischemic conditioning. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is induced by 4 cycles of 5 min of upper limb ischemia followed by 5 min reperfusion. Limb ischemia was induced by inflations of a blood pressure cuff to 200 mm Hg. RIC will be conducted twice daily for 30±2 days.</description>
