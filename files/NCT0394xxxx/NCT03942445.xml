  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle regenerates after injury, due to the satellite cells (SCs), the muscle stem&#xD;
      cells that activate, proliferate, differentiate and fuse to form new myofibers. While SCs are&#xD;
      indispensable for regeneration, there is increasing evidence for the need for an adequate&#xD;
      cellular environment. Among the closest cellular partners of SCs are vascular cells. During&#xD;
      muscle regeneration, endothelial cells (ECs) stimulate SC differentiation while SCs exhibit&#xD;
      pro-angiogenic properties indicating a coupling between angiogenesis and myogenesis.The&#xD;
      specific signaling cues controlling these relationships are still poorly characterized,&#xD;
      specially in specific pathologic context such as limb ischemia. The investigators research&#xD;
      aims to evaluate the role of chronic and acute lower limb ischemia on the SC status and&#xD;
      interaction with ECs in human patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-injury muscle regeneration is a multifaceted process requiring the coordination of&#xD;
      myogenesis and angiogenesis. Whether this coordination is altered in pathological context has&#xD;
      been poorly investigated, whether the original defect stems from the myogenic cell&#xD;
      (degenerative myopathy) or the vessel (chronic limb ischemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic limb ischemia in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) causes muscle&#xD;
      weakness and decreases exercise tolerance. PAD patients with chronic limb ischemia suffer&#xD;
      mainly from intermittent claudication on walking or rest pain in more advanced stage, i.e. in&#xD;
      critical limb ischemia . PAD is associated with muscle cell apoptosis and atrophy, fiber type&#xD;
      switching (from type I to type II), increased muscle fat content and denervation . The&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms are from hemodynamic origin and linked to atherosclerotic obstructions&#xD;
      of the major arteries supplying the lower extremities. However, additional mechanisms&#xD;
      contribute to the limb manifestations, where a reduction in blood flow alone cannot explain&#xD;
      exercise limitation in symptomatic PAD patients. These mechanisms include a cascade of&#xD;
      pathological responses during exercise-induced ischemia and reperfusion at rest, endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscle metabolic abnormalities).&#xD;
      Surprisingly, the implication of SCs in the pathophysiology of chronic limb ischemia has been&#xD;
      overlooked. One could assume that the regenerative capacity of SCs in advanced PAD is&#xD;
      overwhelmed by prolonged ischemia. In this case, a decrease in SC regenerative capacities&#xD;
      could participate in the aggravation of muscle atrophy and limb perfusion, considering their&#xD;
      known pro-angiogenic properties. Consistently, a preclinical study demonstrated that combined&#xD;
      delivery of pro-angiogenic and myogenic factors improves ischemic muscle recovery , while&#xD;
      endovascular surgery and administration of angiogenic factors (recombinant proteins or gene&#xD;
      therapy) or angiogenic cells (cell therapy) showed limited effects. This indicates that&#xD;
      promoting angiogenesis along with myogenesis may be a more suitable therapeutic strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired angiogenesis and/or impaired myogenesis are thus novel players in chronic limb&#xD;
      ischemia and could represent potential therapeutic targets to delay or alleviate muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For PAD patients, muscle biopsies will take place during femoro-popliteal bypass surgery.&#xD;
      Control muscle biopsies will be performed in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery of the&#xD;
      lower limb or femora-popliteal bypass for non-ischemic reasons (popliteal aneurysm, popliteal&#xD;
      entrapment syndrome) In parallel, human SCs in non-PAD patients with &lt;6h acute limb ischemia&#xD;
      (from embolic origin) will be obtained. For the PAD study, patients with autoimmune disease,&#xD;
      active cancer, end stage renal disease or tissue necrosis or edema close to the site of&#xD;
      biopsy will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three major assessments will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Topographic study: Number, distribution, and relative proximity of SC, and capillaries,&#xD;
           fiber type, based on immunohistochemistry applied to standard thin transverse sections,&#xD;
           and to thicker segments of cleared muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Functional study: in vitro and in vivo comparison of myogenic potential of SC between&#xD;
           ischemic and control patients, based on SC primary cell culture, and SC-ECs co-culture&#xD;
           system. Ultimately, SC transplantation in injured muscle of immunodepressed mice will&#xD;
           aim to evaluate myogenic capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Transcriptomic analysis: of SCs and ECs sorted from ischemic muscle from PAD patients,&#xD;
           control muscle and patients with acute ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators goal is to analyze and compare the molecular adaptation of ECs and SCs&#xD;
      towards chronic ischemia (in a context of muscle atrophy and weakness) as compared with acute&#xD;
      ischemia (in a context of normal muscle function) Particular attention in the analysis will&#xD;
      be given to the pathways already involved in myogenesis/angiogenesis coupling during muscle&#xD;
      regeneration.&#xD;
