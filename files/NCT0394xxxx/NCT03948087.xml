      Comparison of wound healing, edema level, knee range of motion, rate of revision post falls,&#xD;
      device application time, time to prosthetic fit, and cost between postoperative soft dressing&#xD;
      and a vacuum removable rigid dressing after unilateral transtibial amputation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gold standard after transtibial amputation is casting of the residual limb to limit room&#xD;
      for post-surgical edema, enable faster wound healing and shorter hospital stays, as well as,&#xD;
      reduce time to prosthetic fitting. Casting also reduces the risk of impact damage to the&#xD;
      limb. Casting, however, is costly and impractical due to the requirement of a prosthetist&#xD;
      available on call for after emergency amputation surgeries and a need for multiple repeat&#xD;
      prosthetist visits to cut off and reapply casting after wound healing checks. Thus current&#xD;
      practice involves use of a compression elastic tube bandage (like a tensor bandage) applied&#xD;
      within 15 minutes after surgery. However this bandage applies pressure to the residual limb,&#xD;
      which can increase risk of reduced blood supply to the healing limb especially in vascular&#xD;
      compromised patients. Further, this soft bandage does not offer any protection to the&#xD;
      residual limb, a fall or severe contusion could lead to a requirement for costly revision&#xD;
      surgery. There is evidence that rigid removable dressings can improve wound healing times,&#xD;
      protect the limb, prevent contractures and enable earlier prosthetic fitting. This study aims&#xD;
      to examine the the differences in wound healing time, changes in limb edema, knee range of&#xD;
      motion, limb protection post falls, device application time, time to prosthetic fitting and&#xD;
      cost between currently used postoperative soft dressing (SD) and vacuum removable rigid&#xD;
      dressing (VRRD) after transtibial amputation.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Transtibial amputation related to peripheral vascular disease with or without diabetes&#xD;
             or trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Justification: The form and function of the ORD device relates solely to transtibial&#xD;
             amputees. The device is not useable for any other limb amputation type (e.g.&#xD;
             transfemoral, transmetatarsal). The choice of using vascular compromised participants&#xD;
             is intentional. Ischemia and necrosis rapidly ensue as a result of vessel occlusion&#xD;
             which can easily happen with any external compressive force (e.g. tensor bandaging).&#xD;
             The ORD does not apply compressive force to the residual limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Transtibial amputation that includes myodesis and/or myoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Justification: Myoplasty and myodesis are preferred surgical techniques while&#xD;
             performing an amputation. They involve the surgical attachment of muscle to muscle&#xD;
             (myoplasty) or muscle to bone (myodesis) across the end of the residual limb prior to&#xD;
             skin flap closure. This allows increased stability and provides a better interface&#xD;
             with a future prosthetic device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Greater than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
             Justification: Below the age of 18 informed consent must be obtained by a parent or&#xD;
             guardian&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must be able to speak and understand English in order to provide informed&#xD;
             consent. No reliance on translator services will be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has no major illness where life expectancy is less than 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Justification: This is the study timeline and co-morbidities that limit participation&#xD;
        within this timeframe will introduce confounding factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Severe dementia or insufficient cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Justification: Inability to provide informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Knee contracture greater than 30 degrees&#xD;
&#xD;
             Justification: The ORD will not fit a limb with too much flexion at the knee. Wound&#xD;
             healing is also affected due to pressure across the end of the residual limb without&#xD;
             the use of offloading techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severe peripheral vascular disease involving the contralateral lower limb&#xD;
&#xD;
             Justification: Having severe peripheral vascular disease to the contralateral limb may&#xD;
             affect the secondary outcome measures due to the need for further medical or surgical&#xD;
             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Inability to speak, read, or understand English.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Justification: For a patient to participate in the study informed consent must be&#xD;
             obtained. There is a high probability that there would be too much variability among&#xD;
             translators (family member or institutional) to ensure consistent informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Neurological condition or medical disorder that could affect rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Justification: Rehabilitation post transtibial amputation is critical to overall functional&#xD;
        outcomes as well as study outcomes. If a patient has difficulty with participation in&#xD;
        rehabilitation then this will be a confounding factor.&#xD;
