      1. Study name: Efficacy and safety of a single-pill fixed combination of sufficient&#xD;
           losartan/hydrochlorothiazide in Chinese hypertensive patients (FOCUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medicine: Losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg single-pill fixed combination;&#xD;
           amlodipine besylate tablet (5 mg/tablet); hydrochlorothiazide tablets (25 mg/tablet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rationale: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor&#xD;
           blocker (ARB) combined with thiazide diuretic (DIU), which is the preferred combination&#xD;
           for most hypertension guidelines. However, the efficacy and safety of losartan 100&#xD;
           mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg single-pill fixed combination evaluated by ambulatory blood&#xD;
           pressure are still lack of clinical evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25&#xD;
           mg fixed combination for ambulatory blood pressure after 8 weeks therapy in patients&#xD;
           over 18 years with grade 1 or 2 hypertension either newly diagnosed or with blood&#xD;
           pressure not controlled with monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study design: This study is a multi-center, randomized and controlled clinical trial&#xD;
           with two equally sized treatment groups: losartan/hydrochlorothiazide single-pill fixed&#xD;
           combination and amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study population: Men and Women aged over 18 years (n=300) meeting the&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Randomization and treatment: Patients should receive a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
           monitoring measurement before randomization. After stratification by centers, eligible&#xD;
           patients will be randomly divided into two groups, taking losartan 100&#xD;
           mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg fixed combination once a day or amlodipine besylate tablets&#xD;
           (5 mg/tablet) + hydrochlorothiazide tablets (25 mg/tablet) once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Follow up: 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Sample size: a total of 300 patients should be enrolled in the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Timeline: After obtaining the approval of Ethics Committee of Ruijin Hospital in&#xD;
           September 2018, recruitment will start. Patients enrollment will be performed between&#xD;
           October 2018 to October 2020. All patients should be followed up before December 2020.&#xD;

        2. Medicine: Losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg single-pill fixed combination;&#xD;
           amlodipine besylate tablet (5 mg/tablet); hydrochlorothiazide tablets (25 mg/tablet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rationale: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor&#xD;
           blocker (ARB) combined with thiazide diuretic (DIU), which is the preferred combination&#xD;
           for most hypertension guidelines. However, the efficacy and safety of losartan 100&#xD;
           mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg single-pill fixed combination evaluated by ambulatory blood&#xD;
           pressure are still lack of clinical evidence, especially randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
           trials with ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring as the main evaluation method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objective The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of losartan 100&#xD;
           mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg fixed combination for ambulatory blood pressure after 8&#xD;
           weeks therapy in patients over 18 years with grade 1 or 2 hypertension either newly&#xD;
           diagnosed or with blood pressure not controlled with monotherapy. The secondary&#xD;
           objective are to compare the 24-hour, daytime, night-time, home and office systolic and&#xD;
           diastolic blood pressure between the losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg group and&#xD;
           the amlodipine besylate 5 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg group after 8 weeks of&#xD;
           antihypertensive treatment; to compare the changes in blood glucose, blood lipids, blood&#xD;
           electrolytes, serum creatinine, blood uric acid and other biochemical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study design: This study is a multi-center, randomized and controlled clinical trial&#xD;
           with two equally sized treatment groups: losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg&#xD;
           single-pill combination group and amlodipine besylate 5 mg+hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study population: Men or Women aged over 18 years (n=300) will be screened, who should&#xD;
           never take antihypertensive drugs or stop antihypertensive drugs for more than 2 weeks&#xD;
           with systolic blood pressure of 140-179 mmHg and / or diastolic blood pressure of 90-109&#xD;
           mmHg or who is on monotherapy for at least 2 weeks with systolic blood pressure of&#xD;
           140-179 mmHg and / or diastolic blood pressure of 90-109 mmHg will be screened. Before&#xD;
           randomization, two visits should be performed and 6 clinic blood pressures should be&#xD;
           recorded. The average of the 6 clinic blood pressures should be 140-179 mmHg in systolic&#xD;
           and/or 90-109 mmHg in diastolic. Regardless of whether the office blood pressure meets&#xD;
           the enrollment conditions, a one-week home blood pressure measurement should be&#xD;
           performed before randomization. Patient should sign the written consent form before&#xD;
           screening and be able to go to the clinic by him/herself. Exclusion criteria included:&#xD;
           suspected or confirmed secondary hypertension; history of coronary heart disease,&#xD;
           myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke or dementia; taking other drugs that might&#xD;
           affect blood pressure; liver dysfunction, serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL (133 μmol/L),&#xD;
           urine protein positive; serum potassium &gt;5.5 mmol/L or &lt;3.5 mmol/L; history of gout or&#xD;
           serum uric acid ≥420 μmol/L for man and ≥360 μmol/L for women; elderly care patients; or&#xD;
           patients who are participating in other clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Randomization and treatment: Patients should receive a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
           monitoring measurement before randomization. After stratification by centers, eligible&#xD;
           patients will be randomly divided into two groups, taking losartan 100&#xD;
           mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg fixed combination once a day or amlodipine besylate tablets&#xD;
           (5 mg/tablet) + hydrochlorothiazide tablets (25 mg/tablet) once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Follow up: Sitting office blood pressures should measured by an OMRON device. Medical&#xD;
           history should be recorded. Clinical examinations including ambulatory blood pressure,&#xD;
           home blood pressure, electrocardiogram, blood and urine routine tests and biochemical&#xD;
           tests should be performed. During the 4-week follow-up visit, office blood pressures,&#xD;
           serum electrolyte should be measure, adverse events and medication assignment should be&#xD;
           recorded. A one-week home blood pressure measurements should be performed immediately&#xD;
           before the follow-up visit. During the 8-week follow-up visit, clinical examinations&#xD;
           similar with baseline including ambulatory blood pressure, home blood pressure,&#xD;
           electrocardiogram, blood and urine routine tests and biochemical tests should be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Sample size and statistical analysis: At least 150 eligible patients should be enrolled&#xD;
           in each group, and a total of 300 patients should be enrolled in total. Data will be&#xD;
           analyzed by using the SAS software. T-tests will be used to compare the parameters&#xD;
           between groups and the difference between the two groups with the calculation of 95%&#xD;
           confidence interval. In addition, a covariance analysis will also be used in the&#xD;
           analysis of baseline parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
