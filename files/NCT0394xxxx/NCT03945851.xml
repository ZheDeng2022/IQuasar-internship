  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans on patients undergoing&#xD;
      stroke rehabilitation therapy in conjunction with vagal nerve stimulators (VNS) is to&#xD;
      determine if the patients clinical improvement correlates to changes that can be identified&#xD;
      on MRI of the brain such as degree of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, changes in&#xD;
      resting state connectivity, and corticospinal tract fiber density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized at implant surgery to either the device treatment (rehabilitation&#xD;
      and VNS) or control (rehabilitation and Control VNS) groups. All participants of this study&#xD;
      are also participants of the STU 062017-071 study and chose to participate in this functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sub-study. Rehabilitation is standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both experimental groups and control groups will receive pre-rehabilitation and&#xD;
      post-rehabilitation fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans to quantify their white&#xD;
      matter track density. We will analyze this data using the University of Texas Southwestern&#xD;
      (UTSW) Advanced Neuroscience Imaging Research (ANSIR) pipeline which can automatically&#xD;
      quantify white matter track density on both sides of the brain given the appropriate scans.&#xD;
      In this study the VNS device specifically will not be studied. Rather we will be looking at&#xD;
      the changes that occur in the brain as a result of using the VNS device during physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the post-rehabilitation scans are completed the patients in the control group will be&#xD;
      given the opportunity to crossover into the experimental group and receive physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation with the VNS implant turned on. They will have a third MRI session after their&#xD;
      round of rehabilitation with the implant turned on in order to quantify their white matter&#xD;
      tract density.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of 2-3 fMRI sessions, depending on group assignment, and span 2 days&#xD;
      for each session. It will be done at a single site only, at UTSW. The fMRI tasks will&#xD;
      consists of subjects grasping and releasing a handgrip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VNS implant will be used in this study to determine if having the implant active during&#xD;
      physical rehabilitation produces white matter tract changes in the brain visible on fMRI. All&#xD;
      subjects in the STU 062017-071 study will receive a VNS implant. And all subjects in this&#xD;
      study are also subjects of the STU 062017-071 study. Therefore participants of this study&#xD;
      will enroll with the implant already in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: After passing routine MRI screening, patients who are enrolled in the VNS-REHAB&#xD;
      study and consent to participate in the fMRI study will be scanned on a Phillips 3 Tesla&#xD;
      Research Magnet (Ingenia, Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands). Patients will be&#xD;
      scanned before therapy and the week after therapy. A subset of patients will be scanned 3&#xD;
      times, before therapy, after therapy without activation of the vagal nerve stimulator, and&#xD;
      after therapy with activation of the vagal nerve stimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scan Time:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scan time is limited to 15 minutes per session to match manufacture FDA guidelines. Patients&#xD;
      will receive two, 15 minute MRI scans over 2 days.&#xD;
