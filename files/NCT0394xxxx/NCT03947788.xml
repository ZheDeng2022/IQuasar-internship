  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot assessment of whether practices that implement the One Key Question®&#xD;
      (OKQ) pregnancy intention screening tool will demonstrate differences in patient-reported&#xD;
      receipt of preconception and/or contraceptive counseling, compared to practices that provide&#xD;
      usual care. In Phase I, the study team surveyed patients at six practices within NorthShore&#xD;
      University HealthSystem to establish baseline rates of counseling. Phase II assesses the&#xD;
      effects of the OKQ tool on patient care, and half of participating sites are randomly chosen&#xD;
      as intervention sites and exposed to the OKQ tool. After the intervention practices implement&#xD;
      OKQ, patients will be surveyed at both intervention and control (usual care) practices to&#xD;
      measure changes in preconception and contraceptive care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effectively delivered preconception counseling leads to healthier pregnancy behaviors.&#xD;
      However, many clinicians miss opportunities to provide this counseling due to a lack of&#xD;
      processes in place to provide this counseling and access to evidence based care once the need&#xD;
      is identified. The purpose of this study is to build upon baseline data collected on&#xD;
      pregnancy intention and receipt of contraceptive and preconception counseling. Half of the&#xD;
      study practices will be randomly selected to receive comprehensive One Key Question® Training&#xD;
      through the nonprofit Power To Decide. These practices have already displayed interest in&#xD;
      taking part in this intervention.The training will act as our intervention, and will be given&#xD;
      to help improve the quality of preconception and contraceptive counseling in Primary Care and&#xD;
      Obstetrics/Gynecology. All of the participating practices will then be surveyed again to&#xD;
      determine changes in contraception and preconception counseling. After patient data&#xD;
      collection is complete, a research assistant will return to each practice to collect surveys&#xD;
      from clinicians and staff (this includes: physicians, nurses, medical assistants, patient&#xD;
      support associates, or anyone that participated in the OKQ training) at the intervention&#xD;
      practices to assess the experience of implementing OKQ and their perceptions of its utility&#xD;
      for patients. Following the Phase II collection of surveys, the remaining control practices&#xD;
      will be given the option to receive Power To Decide training.&#xD;
