    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate if lipid composition mapping using magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      could improve early and accurate cancer detection in genetic mutation carriers at high risk&#xD;
      of breast cancer. It is hypothesised that there is a significant difference in the extent of&#xD;
      spatial variation in lipid composition in breast from MRI between genetic mutation carriers&#xD;
      and patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a major and expanding societal challenge despite the significant improvement&#xD;
      in survival rate. The current screening method has been shown to lead to overtreatment,&#xD;
      prompting the development of accurate early detection approaches targeting underlying&#xD;
      clinical features. Patients with BRCA1/2 and TP53 genes are at risk of breast cancer and&#xD;
      receive annual surveillance. However, the current diagnostic approach relies on detecting the&#xD;
      changes to the growth of tumour only once cancer is well under development. Detecting earlier&#xD;
      changes to breast fatty tissue may detect patients earlier and more accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast fatty tissue is composed of different fatty acids and a difference in the fatty acid&#xD;
      composition has been shown in BRCA1/2 gene carriers. Measurement of lipid composition can be&#xD;
      achieved using a specialist magnetic resonance spectroscopy method, but is limited to&#xD;
      sampling a small area and is unable to provide the full picture of lipid composition&#xD;
      distribution during early cancer growth. Recently, magnetic resonance chemical shift imaging,&#xD;
      through combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging approaches, has been developed&#xD;
      to provide lipid composition maps of the entire breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to perform lipid mapping in the breasts of 20 genetic mutation&#xD;
      carriers at high risk of breast cancer and 20 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer to&#xD;
      examine the sensitivity of the method. The overarching aim is to improve early and accurate&#xD;
      cancer detection in genetic mutation carriers at high risk of breast cancer through the&#xD;
      assessment of whole breast lipid composition.&#xD;

    <description>MRI scan uses radio waves in a magnetic field to obtain images of the breast. It is non-invasive and participants will not be exposed to harmful radiation. An image contrast agent will be used to enhance image clarity. Participants will be scanned lying face-down on a specially-designed bed and ear protectors will be provided to screen out background noise.</description>
