  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Port wine stain (PWS) is a congenital, progressive vascular malformation of human skin&#xD;
           involving the superficial vascular plexus that occurs in estimated 3-5 children per&#xD;
           1,000 live births. In childhood, PWS are flat red macules, but lesions tend to darken&#xD;
           progressively to purple and, by middle age, often become raised as a result of the&#xD;
           development of vascular nodules. Because most malformations occur on the face, PWS is a&#xD;
           clinically significant problem in the majority of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The late-stage cobblestoning appearance of PWS subjects is comprised by not only&#xD;
           pronounced vascular ectasia with proliferation of thin and/or thick-walled vessels and&#xD;
           their stroma, but also numerous epithelial, neural and mesenchymal hamartomatous&#xD;
           abnormalities. Despite these histologic observations, the specific mechanisms involved&#xD;
           in PWS nodular formation remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In one nodular PWS subject, we found that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K)/protein&#xD;
           kinase B (AKT) and phosphoinositide phospholipase C g subunit (PLC-g) were activated in&#xD;
           both hypertrophic areas and nodules within the lesion. These observations led us to&#xD;
           hypothesize that the PI3K pathway may play an important role in nodular formation.&#xD;
