  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various recent scientific data testify to the cognitive deficiencies of cancer patients,&#xD;
      called Cancer-Related Cognitive Impairments (CRCI) (Noal, Daireaux &amp; Joly, 2010). At the same&#xD;
      time, regular physical activity (aerobic, muscle building, and yoga) has been shown to&#xD;
      decrease CRCIs, although commonly used cognitive measures are self-reported (Zimmer et al.,&#xD;
      2016). The investigators will develop an interventional study using objective measures of&#xD;
      cognition to confirm the cause-and-effect relationship, and specify the orientation of the&#xD;
      cognitive effects of the adapted physical activities. The main and original objective will be&#xD;
      to determine if the cognitive functions most affected by CRCI (episodic memory, inhibition,&#xD;
      treatment speed) can be optimized in patients undergoing treatment.&#xD;

      1. Inclusion procedure and saving selection failures Participation in this study will be&#xD;
           offered to patients during their care in day hospital (= inclusion visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any patient giving express consent to participation and meeting the criteria for&#xD;
           inclusion and non-inclusion will then be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each patient will then be identified by his or her initials as a patient number in the&#xD;
           study, directly on the basis of collecting the data from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study progress for patients Data collection takes place over two different periods. Each&#xD;
           period lasts 12 weeks. The Adapted Physical Activity (APA) program is 8 weeks old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first period will run from mid-January to early April (first cohort) to collect data from&#xD;
      the first patients in the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second period will be from mid-February to the end of April. During this one, it will be&#xD;
      necessary to collect the data of the last patients of the experimental group (second cohort)&#xD;
      The first two weeks of each period (weeks 1 and 2, weeks 4 and 5) are dedicated to recruiting&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pre-test session, carried out week 3 for the first cohort and weeks 6 for the&#xD;
      second, the patients will carry out different tests and questionnaires: General Information&#xD;
      Questionnaires, Education, MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), GPAQ (Global Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire), Stroop test, test of MEM3 (Echelle Clinique de Mémoire), letter&#xD;
      comparison test, HADS (Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale), and the MFI (Multidimensional&#xD;
      Fatigue Inventory). Patients should also wear an actimeter for one week from the day of&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients then take part in a program of Adapted Physical Activity lasting 8 weeks, with 2&#xD;
      sessions per week. The sessions of this program are similar to the APA sessions already&#xD;
      offered by sports therapy practitioners. This is an aerobic exercise session, with Nordic&#xD;
      walking, and a combined session of muscle building and breathing-based exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post-test session, which was conducted week 12 for the first cohort and week 15 for&#xD;
      the second, some questionnaires and tests are again administered: GPAQ, Stroop test, MEM3&#xD;
      test, letter comparison test, HADS and the MFI. Patients should also wear an actimeter the&#xD;
      week before the day of the post-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The forecast schedule may be slightly modified depending on unforeseen circumstances and&#xD;
      constraints that may occur.&#xD;
