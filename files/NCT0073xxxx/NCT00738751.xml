    <description>DCR: The percentage of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents. CR: is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR: is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. SD: is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

    <description>Panobinostat was taken twice weekly, for 2 out of 3 weeks of each cycle. Each cycle was defined as a 21-day period. Four dose levels of panobinostat in combination with erlotinib were planned: 1) dose level 1 (DL1) = panobinostat 20 mg by mouth (PO) twice weekly for 2 out of 3 weeks + erlotinib 100 mg PO daily; 2) dose level 2 (DL2) = panobinostat 30 mg and erlotinib 100 mg; 3) dose level 3 (DL3) = panobinostat 30 mg and erlotinib 150 mg; and 4) dose level 4 (DL4) = panobinostat 40 mg and erlotinib 150 mg. Doses were not escalated over the course of treatment of an individual participant.</description>
