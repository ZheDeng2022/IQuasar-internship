  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study aims to explore the effectiveness of human erythropoietin versus placebo&#xD;
      in promoting the recovery of erectile function in patients undergoing bilateral nerve-sparing&#xD;
      radical retropubic prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical studies have shown erythropoietin potently promoted recovery of erectile&#xD;
      function in rats and humans have similar receptors on penile tissues and the periprostatic&#xD;
      neurovascular bundles. A clinical non-randomized study conducted in men undergoing radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy demonstrated a benefit to recovery of erectile function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the hypothesis is that erythropoietin offers nerve protection in men undergoing&#xD;
      nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy and results in a reduced degree of erectile dysfunction&#xD;
      and also an improved rate of erection recovery following surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of erythropoietin versus placebo in the recovery&#xD;
      of erectile function in patients undergoing bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy for&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent laboratory findings in rat models and on human urogenital tissues suggest that&#xD;
      erythropoietin may play a role in protection of the cavernous nerves during surgery. Some&#xD;
      degree of nerve trauma occurs during bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, but for&#xD;
      most it is temporary. Erythropoietin will be studied as an investigational drug for&#xD;
      enhancement of erectile function postoperatively in a prospective, randomized study.&#xD;
      Erythropoietin has been used in many men undergoing open radical prostatectomy in the past&#xD;
      according to FDA indications for preparation for noncardiac, nonvascular surgery with a high&#xD;
      risk of blood loss. Evidence also suggests it is safe with no demonstration of increased risk&#xD;
      of venous thromboembolism (blood clots) or cardiac events for men with prostate cancer&#xD;
      undergoing radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of the study is 12 months and involves receiving a dose of study drug or placebo&#xD;
      on the day before surgery, the day of surgery, and the day following surgery. The dose is&#xD;
      given by subcutaneous injection. The study will also require the completion of questionnaires&#xD;
      which will be completed online every three months until study completion (at 3, 6, 9, and 12&#xD;
      months) to assess outcomes.&#xD;
