  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of cancer often involves the use of more than one drug at the same time. In&#xD;
      this study, patients are treated with the already marketed drug paclitaxel (administered&#xD;
      every 3 weeks by infusion)and with the investigational drug CHR-2797 (given orally, once&#xD;
      daily). The purpose of this study is to evaluate if it is safe to administer these two drugs&#xD;
      together, and how well the combination is tolerated by patients. The first patients will&#xD;
      receive a 90mg dose of CHR-2797; doses will be increased in subsequent patients, as long as&#xD;
      they are adequately tolerated.&#xD;
