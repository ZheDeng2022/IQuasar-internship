      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together&#xD;
      with alvocidib in treating patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of leukemia or&#xD;
      lymphoma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Alvocidib may stop the growth of cancer cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving lenalidomide together with&#xD;
      alvocidib may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of flavopiridol (alvocidib) in combination&#xD;
      with lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the specific toxicities and the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of flavopiridol in&#xD;
      combination with lenalidomide in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      CLL/SLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess preliminary efficacy of flavopiridol combined with lenalidomide in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL to justify future, rigorous phase II studies of the combination&#xD;
      in CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of flavopiridol and lenalidomide alone and in&#xD;
      combination in patients with CLL/SLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate select pre-treatment prognostic markers, including interphase cytogenetics&#xD;
      with minimal residual disease, progression-free survival, response, and toxicity following&#xD;
      combination therapy with flavopiridol and lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine patient cytokine expression profiles immediately pre-treatment, after&#xD;
      flavopiridol dosing, and after combination flavopiridol and lenalidomide therapy to assess&#xD;
      the impact of lenalidomide on flavopiridol induced cytokine release (interleukin [IL]-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess if pre-treatment ex vivo and in vivo (day 1 and day 3 of lenalidomide) immune&#xD;
      (B-cell, natural killer [NK] cell, and T-cell) activation correlates with response and&#xD;
      toxicity of lenalidomide therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess the in vivo effect of lenalidomide on flavopiridol on the modulation of&#xD;
      selected intracellular pharmacodynamic targets including signal transducer and activator of&#xD;
      transcription 3 (acute-phase response factor) (STAT3), myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1&#xD;
      (BCL2-related) (Mcl-1), and other downstream IL-6 targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive alvocidib intravenously (IV) over 4.5 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 in course 1&#xD;
      followed by a week of rest. Beginning in course 2 and all subsequent courses, patients&#xD;
      receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and alvocidib IV over 4.5 hours&#xD;
      on days 3, 10, and 17. Treatment repeats every 35 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
