    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study prospectively the early clinical and immunological&#xD;
      events in children susceptible to rhinovirus induced early wheezing (i.e., recently found&#xD;
      highest risk factor for recurrent wheezing/asthma) and the efficacy of systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroid to modify these events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50% of children suffer from acute wheezing before school-age. The prevalence of&#xD;
      childhood asthma is 5-7%. Although pediatric asthma is mainly allergic, the exacerbations are&#xD;
      associated with respiratory viral infections in 95% of cases. The means to predict asthma&#xD;
      from environmental factors have been limited mainly to sensitization to aeroallergens (3-fold&#xD;
      risk), which start to develop usually at 2-3 years of age. VINKU 1-study (orig. VINKU-study)&#xD;
      discovered simultaneously with two other groups, that early wheezing associated with&#xD;
      rhinovirus, the &quot;common cold&quot; virus, is the strongest predictor of recurrent wheezing/asthma&#xD;
      (up to 10-fold risky). Noteworthily, viral infections work as risk markers already during&#xD;
      infancy, a lot earlier than the sensitization to aeroallergens. The investigators also found&#xD;
      retrospectively that early wheezers affected by rhinovirus responded to 3 day course of oral&#xD;
      prednisolone (inexpensive and widely available treatment): recurrent wheezing decreased by&#xD;
      50% during following 12 months and the difference appeared to continue. VINKU 5V-study is&#xD;
      currently investigating the clinical history, prevalence of asthma and airway hyperreactivity&#xD;
      of these same children at school-age. The mechanism of rhinovirus associated risk or why they&#xD;
      respond to prednisolone are largely unknown. However, the susceptibility to rhinovirus&#xD;
      infections is associated with atopy and therefore it is possible these children may have&#xD;
      impaired anti-inflammatory (Treg) responses and more likely to wheeze with any&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory response (Th1 or Th2). Moreover, they may not effectively clear viruses,&#xD;
      because they can not limit rhinovirus to nose and it spreads to lower airways and causes&#xD;
      wheezing. VINKU 2-study will prospectively investigate the immunological events in young&#xD;
      first-time wheezers affected by rhinovirus, and prospectively study the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      systemic corticosteroid in them. Most likely these children will benefit from the drug in&#xD;
      terms of less recurrent wheezing, the investigators will also explore immunological effects&#xD;
      of the drug and their link to clinical efficacy. The results are expected to give basis for&#xD;
      the prevention of asthma and for the development of new treatment strategies and they can be&#xD;
      directly applied to clinical medicine.&#xD;

      Main Hypothesis and Anticipated Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virology&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rhinovirus is a common causative agent of bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Persistence of rhinovirus (or any virus) infection worsens long-term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The dose of virus inoculation at the time of acute wheezing (assessed&#xD;
           semi-quantitatively for rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus) is related to&#xD;
           outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Immunology&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Children susceptible to rhinovirus induced early wheezing have altered immunology (T&#xD;
           cell regulation and interferon responses) when compared to children with RSV induced&#xD;
           wheezing and children with rhinovirus induced upper respiratory infection without&#xD;
           wheezing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. These immunological events are related to recurrent wheezing and asthma inception.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therapeutic intervention with systemic corticosteroid&#xD;
&#xD;
           Systemic corticosteroid in children susceptible for rhinovirus-induced early wheezing&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. decreases persistence of rhinovirus infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. decreases the severity and relapses of the first wheezing episode, and prevents&#xD;
           recurrent wheezing, and asthma,&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. prevents Th2-polarization, favours Th1- and Treg-responses during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel, one-center trial. The&#xD;
      study was commenced in 6/2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age 3-23 months, be delivered at &gt;37 weeks, first wheezing episode, written informed consent&#xD;
      from guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria for the Intervention and the Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhinovirus PCR positive wheezing episode and still signs of lower respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      (cough, noisy breathing or wheezing) at the time the initiation of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria for the Follow-up without Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any rhinovirus negative wheezing episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic illness other than atopy, previous systemic or inhaled corticosteroid treatment,&#xD;
      participation to another study (excluding long-term follow-up studies in childhood),&#xD;
      varicella contact if previously intact, need for intensive care unit treatment, or poor&#xD;
      understanding of Finnish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for hospitalization will be decided independently of the study by an on-duty&#xD;
      physician in the emergency room. Whether hospitalized or not, the eligible children&#xD;
      (rhinovirus positive wheezers, n=70) will be randomly assigned (2 separate randomization&#xD;
      lists: one for hospitalized and one for out-patients) in a double-blind fashion to receive&#xD;
      either oral prednisolone (first dose 2 mg/kg (max 60 mg), then 2 mg/kg/d (max 60 mg/d) in 3&#xD;
      divided doses for 3 days, Prednisolon®, 5 mg tablets, Oy Leiras Finland Ab, Helsinki,&#xD;
      Finland) or placebo after informed consent had been obtained. The randomization code list&#xD;
      will be stored in the hospital pharmacy and will be revealed only after all children had&#xD;
      completed first 2 months of the study. Separate codes for each patients will be stored in&#xD;
      patients charts and revealed in case of emergency. The tablets and packages will be&#xD;
      indistinguishable in appearance from those of the active drug (Oy Leiras Finland Ab,&#xD;
      Helsinki, Finland) and be provided in numbered containers. The study drugs will be&#xD;
      administered by nurses independent of the study or by parents. The tablets will be minced and&#xD;
      administered with jelly or yogurt. All patients will receive nebulized albuterol 0.15 mg/kg&#xD;
      at 2 h intervals for the first 12 h, then at 4 h intervals while in the hospital. After&#xD;
      discharge, beta2-agonists were used on demand. The patients will receive antibiotics or&#xD;
      nebulized epinephrine (in emergency room or hospital) on demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk-benefit ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, the efficacy of prednisolone has only been evaluated post-hoc in rhinovirus&#xD;
      induced early wheezing in &lt;3 year-old-children. The prevalence of relapses within 2 months&#xD;
      after discharge was 22% in prednisolone group and 56% in placebo group. This observation&#xD;
      needs to be confirmed in a prospective randomized trial, which is the purpose of the current&#xD;
      study. Prednisolone has not been found beneficial in RSV-induced early wheezing in many&#xD;
      studies and therefore, is not recommended to these children. Neither, prednisolone is used in&#xD;
      upper respiratory tract infections without wheezing. Short courses (up to 5 days) of&#xD;
      prednisolone have been used for decades in the treatment wheezing illnesses and they are well&#xD;
      tolerated. There are no data that this dosage in this patient group could cause similar&#xD;
      long-term neurological consequences as systemic corticosteroid treatment in mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated premature infants suffering from severe respiratory distress syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Required sample size for the intervention will be &gt;70 rhinovirus positive wheezing patients,&#xD;
      which will include &gt;35 infants for prednisolone group and &gt;35 infants for placebo group. In&#xD;
      addition, &gt;200 healthy control children (no wheezing during the first 2 years of life) will&#xD;
      be recruited and followed until school age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary endpoint is the occurrence of new wheezing episode within 2 months after&#xD;
      discharge. According to our previous data on rhinovirus induced first or second episode of&#xD;
      wheezing in children aged less than 3 years, the prevalence of relapses within 2 months after&#xD;
      discharge in prednisolone group is 22% and in placebo group 56%. To maintain an alpha error&#xD;
      of 0.05 and a beta error of 0.20, the required size of the sample is 29 children for each&#xD;
      treatment group for the 2-month follow-up. When assessing the risk for the development of&#xD;
      asthma at age 6 years, we expect 60% in the rhinovirus group and 18% in the RSV group to&#xD;
      develop asthma by that age. We expect approximately 10-20% of the children to discontinue the&#xD;
      study within 6 years. Thus, 35 children are needed in each group for the follow-up until&#xD;
      school-age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect approximately 15-25 subjects in each virus specific group to be sufficient to&#xD;
      reveal immunologically or clinically meaningful differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subject will be recruited in the outpatient clinic of the Department of Pediatrics, or&#xD;
      in the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Ward in the Turku University Hospital. Study&#xD;
      physician/nurse or on-duty physician/nurse tells the guardian about the study and givens&#xD;
      written information about the study. After the guardian has had adequate time the get&#xD;
      familiar with the study and has had change to ask, his/her signature will be seeked to the&#xD;
      informed consent form and the study will commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Laboratory Methods for VINKU 2-study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol is presented in Table 1. Several laboratory analyses will enable us to&#xD;
      address questions regarding the relationship between viral infections, T cell regulation,&#xD;
      genetics, atopy, and pulmonary function. Laboratory work will be done according to modern&#xD;
      standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of the Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: The occurrence of and time to a new physician-confirmed wheezing episode&#xD;
      within 2 months after discharge; number of physician-confirmed wheezing episodes during the&#xD;
      first 12 months after discharge; diagnoses of asthma during the full study period. Asthma is&#xD;
      defined according to NAEPP Guidelines (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Up to 2 weeks after the acute respiratory tract infection, severity of&#xD;
      symptoms (cough, wheeze, noisy breathing, breathlessness, rhinitis) will be assessed on a&#xD;
      4-graded scale (0-3, mild 1, moderate 2 and severe 3) by the parents as well as exact number&#xD;
      of bronchodilator puffs used (symptom diary 1). Up to 2 months after the acute respiratory&#xD;
      tract infection, parents will record days with rhinitis, cough, noisy breathing, wheezing,&#xD;
      night-time symptoms, medication (bronchodilator, corticosteroid or antibiotics) and visits to&#xD;
      physician or hospitalizations for wheezing (symptom diary 2). Up to 12 months, the number of&#xD;
      out-patient care visits and hospitalizations for wheezing and courses of systemic or inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids will be recorded (diary 3). Multiple immunologic markers and pulmonary&#xD;
      function after 24-36 months and at age 6 years will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Termination of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for the termination of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Parent or guardian neglects the study orders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Parent or guardian does not want to continue the study with any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Turku University Hospital&#xD;
      in 11/2006 and will follow the rules of the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      and the directives for clinical research by European Union (HE 20/2004). Patients or guardian&#xD;
      won't get any financial benefits from the study. Children will be covered by the insurance&#xD;
      (potilasvakuutus). This is an academic project and researchers have no conflicts of&#xD;
      interests. Patient data will be confidential and won't be shared outside research group&#xD;
      without coding. All deviations from the original protocol will be reported to the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the Turku University Hospital and to the national authorities (Lääkelaitos).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events during hospitalization will be recorded on a four-point scale (0-3) and&#xD;
      their possible relation to study drug will be assessed on a three-point scale (no, possible,&#xD;
      likely, Appendix 4). Parents will be asked to record all adverse events on a two-week home&#xD;
      symptom diary (Appendix 5). Investigator shall report all clinically meaningful adverse&#xD;
      events in a timely correct manner to the national authorities (Lääkelaitos) according to&#xD;
      national law, and to Leiras / Drug Safety Officer Johanna Kause. In case of premature&#xD;
      termination of the trial, due to safety concerns, the investigator shall write a safety&#xD;
      summary report and immediately forward this to Leiras and the national authorities. In case&#xD;
      of an emergency, sealed envelope containing the randomization code will be available in the&#xD;
      patient chart in the Turku University Hospital and can be easily opened.&#xD;
