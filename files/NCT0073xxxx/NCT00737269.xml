  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to better understand (1) complicated skin and soft-tissue&#xD;
      infections requiring hospitalization, and (2) clinical and economic outcomes in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients receiving intravenous antibiotic therapy.&#xD;

      A prospective, multi-center, observational study involving 1200 patients hospitalized for the&#xD;
      treatment of cSSTIs. The study will be conducted at approximately 50 hospitals in the US.&#xD;
      Patients who consent to participate in the registry will be enrolled in the registry within&#xD;
      24 hours of initial IV antibiotic therapy for treatment of one or more cSSTI types. Sites&#xD;
      will treat patients according to their usual clinical practice. The objective of this&#xD;
      registry is to characterize cSSTIs with respect to patient characteristics and describe&#xD;
      patient outcomes.&#xD;
