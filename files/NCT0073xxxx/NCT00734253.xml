      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of two different doses of&#xD;
      Pyridorin (150 mg and 300 mg)compared to placebo in retarding the progression of diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy. This will be assessed by measuring the change in serum creatinine and other&#xD;
      biomarkers of kidney disease during the course of the 1-year study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic kidney disease afflicts about 20% of all diabetics and is the major cause of&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). There are an estimated 1.2 million diabetic overt nephropathy&#xD;
      patients in the US, and approximately 5.1 million diabetic patients exhibiting signs of&#xD;
      developing kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia-induced microvascular disease is the fundamental cause of diabetic kidney&#xD;
      disease. More specifically, hyperglycemia perturbs metabolic pathways, particularly in&#xD;
      tissues that do not regulate intracellular glucose levels. This favors a broad range of&#xD;
      pathogenic oxidative chemistries including the formation of advanced glycation end-products&#xD;
      (AGEs), toxic carbonyls, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are considered to be the&#xD;
      principal causative factors in the development of diabetic microvascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pyridorin™ has been shown to inhibit AGE formation and to scavenge ROS and toxic carbonyl&#xD;
      compounds in extensive in vitro studies. The therapeutic potential of Pyridorin™ has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in vivo by extensive preclinical studies that have been carried out in a number&#xD;
      of independent laboratories by prominent investigators. In addition, Pyridorin™ has&#xD;
      demonstrated a significant treatment effect in slowing the progression of diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy in two Phase 2 clinical trials. Thus, a solid scientific rationale and clinical&#xD;
      evidence exists for the application of Pyridorin™ therapy to slow the progression of diabetic&#xD;
      kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NephroGenex is initiating a new Phase 2b clinical trial (PYR-210) that is evaluating the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Pyridorin™ in slowing the progression of overt nephropathy in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes. This trial incorporates the latest discussion with the FDA regarding&#xD;
      the use of an approvable surrogate marker that would be subsequently confirmed with hard&#xD;
      clinical endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, eligible type 2 diabetic patients with overt&#xD;
      nephropathy will be treated for one year with bid doses of either Pyridorin™ 150 mg,&#xD;
      Pyridorin™ 300 mg, or placebo. The primary endpoint in the study is the change in serum&#xD;
      creatinine (SCr) from baseline after 1 year of therapy. Secondary 1-year endpoints include&#xD;
      the slope of SCr, the change in protein/creatinine ratio (PCR) derived from 24-hour urine&#xD;
      collections, and the change from baseline and slope of serum cystatin C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population studied will be type 2 diabetics with overt nephropathy defined as&#xD;
      having a SCr between 1.3 and 3.3 mg/dl in females and between 1.5 and 3.5 mg/dl in males,&#xD;
      accompanied by proteinuria in the macroalbuminuric range (PCR at least 1200 mg/g). In order&#xD;
      to reduce confounding variables, careful control of blood pressure (BP) will be required. If&#xD;
      not yet controlled, each patient's BP will brought to a level that the investigator believes&#xD;
      is appropriate for the patient prior to randomization, and this will remain the target BP for&#xD;
      that patient for the remainder of the study. Also, patients will be permitted to be on only&#xD;
      one ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and no other drugs that inhibit the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis throughout the study. A run-in period will be required in&#xD;
      some patients to achieve the BP and ACEi/ARB requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted with the leadership of the Collaborative Study Group.&#xD;
