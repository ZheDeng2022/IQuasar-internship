      This study will determine whether electrical stimulation of an area of the brain called the&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is important in determining the feeling of fullness&#xD;
      after eating, affects how much food a person eats and weight loss over 4 weeks. It will also&#xD;
      compare weight changes in people who attend weight loss counseling sessions and those who do&#xD;
      not over this period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese, non-diabetic people between 18 and 60 years of age who are in good health and who live&#xD;
      in the Phoenix, AZ, metropolitan area are eligible for this study. Candidates must have a&#xD;
      body mass index of 35 kg/m(2) or more and weigh less than 350 pounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are admitted to the NIH inpatient unit in Phoenix for the first 9 days of the&#xD;
      study for tests, which include meal tests to determine eating behaviors and caloric intake,&#xD;
      blood and urine tests, glucose tolerance test, weight measurement, psychological assessments&#xD;
      and DEXA scan to measure body fat. For 3 of the days, they will be asked to eat all of their&#xD;
      food from automated vending machines. Some subjects receive transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (TDCS). For this procedure, electrodes that conduct electricity are placed on the&#xD;
      head and arm and the current is turned on for 40 minutes. Some tingling may be felt under the&#xD;
      electrodes. Other subjects receive sham TDCS, with the current turned on only very briefly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the evaluations, subjects are discharged home from the NIH unit and instructed to eat&#xD;
      25 percent fewer calories than they consumed while on a weight maintenance diet the first 3&#xD;
      days of their inpatient stay. They maintain the lower calorie diet at home for 4 weeks.&#xD;
      During this period they come to the NIH unit 3 days a week to receive either real or sham&#xD;
      TDCS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In our studies of brain function examining areas related to hunger and fullness, a part of&#xD;
      the brain called the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was found to be less active&#xD;
      in obese versus lean individuals following a meal. Furthermore, in women who have lost and&#xD;
      maintained weight loss, the activity in this area following a meal is similar to that of lean&#xD;
      women, suggesting that the activity in this area may improve with weight loss. Two recent&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated a lack of increase in food craving following non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation to the left DLPFC when compared to a sham control group that did not receive&#xD;
      brain stimulation. The aim of our protocol is to investigate the effectiveness of one type of&#xD;
      noninvasive brain stimulation technique, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on&#xD;
      food intake in significantly overweight (BMI &gt;= 30 kg/m2) individuals. In study 1, we&#xD;
      enrolled individuals who previously participated in this study and examined how anodal&#xD;
      (active) stimulation or sham (no stimulation) to the left DLPFC compared to their previous&#xD;
      stimulation condition in terms of both weight loss and food intake. The aim of Study 2 was to&#xD;
      compare active versus sham anodal left DLPFC stimulation in a new group of volunteers. Study&#xD;
      3 will be a 9-week double-blind parallel outpatient study where volunteers will come to the&#xD;
      Clinical Research Unit 3x per week and be randomized to receive either active tDCS or &quot;no&#xD;
      stimulation&quot; (sham) to the left DLPFC for stimulation sessions while being asked to follow&#xD;
      diet that is a 25% reduction from their calculated weight maintenance calories. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measurement will be total food (kcal) intake during a snack food taste test and&#xD;
      weight change. Volunteers will also undergo 4 sessions of brain imaging (called functional&#xD;
      MRI) to help us understand how the stimulation is working. Participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      come back to the Unit after 6 months and 1 year for weight measurements. We will also examine&#xD;
      appetitive hormones, neurocognitive and behavioral factors, which might also mediate&#xD;
      potential changes in food intake and weight following tDCS to the left DLPFC. Positive&#xD;
      findings from this study could demonstrate the utility of a novel and safe treatment for&#xD;
      severe obesity. Future studies could include longer clinical trials of tDCS with extended&#xD;
      follow-up durations.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-60 years. Women who are post-menopausal will be excluded from the study due to&#xD;
             changes in their metabolism that could affect weight loss. We will set the cutoff at&#xD;
             age 60 so that the age difference between the men and women is not too great for&#xD;
             analysis purposes. Minors under the age of 18 will be excluded because the time&#xD;
             requirements of the study are such that they would interfere with school schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Right-handedness (because the treatment will be given to the left dorsolateral&#xD;
             prefrontal cortex and the evidence accumulated in this region was only in right-handed&#xD;
             individuals)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight stable (plus or minus 5 percent) for last 3 months as determined by volunteer&#xD;
             report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight &gt; 300 lbs (136 kg), as this is the weight limit of the fMRI machine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of medication affecting metabolism and appetite in the last three months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current pregnancy, pregnancy within the past 6 months or currently lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or clinical manifestations of acute or chronic disorders or conditions that&#xD;
             may affect appetite or energy expenditure (such as, but not limited to type 1 or type&#xD;
             2 diabetes, Cushing s disease, thyroid disorders, coccidiomycoses)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal disease, including inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g. Chron s disease&#xD;
             and ulcerative colitis), malabsorption syndromes (e.g. celiac disease), gastric ulcer&#xD;
             (active) which may alter metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current, unstable medical conditions such as hepatitis, renal insufficiency, cancer&#xD;
             requiring treatment in the last 5 years, or central nervous system disorders etc. as&#xD;
             assessed by history and physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of alcohol abuse as defined by greater than or equal to 8 point score on the&#xD;
             Alcohol consumption screening AUDIT questionnaire in adults&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of nicotine use or of drug use such as amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, or&#xD;
             marijuana&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal women or symptoms of perimenopause (e.g. hot flashes, onset of&#xD;
             irregular periods following age 40, elevation of FSH &gt;20 IU following age 40 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any conditions contraindicated for MRI (e.g., pacemaker, metal in the cranial cavity,&#xD;
             significant claustrophobia, holes in the skull made by trauma or surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition not specifically mentioned above that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, may interfere with the study or prove unsafe for participation.&#xD;
