      This protocol provides an early evaluation of an entirely new class of small molecule agents&#xD;
      directed at disruption or elimination of tumor tolerance, a phenomenon now demonstrated to be&#xD;
      involved in the growth of many solid tumors. D-1MT, or any other substance targeting this&#xD;
      enzymatic pathway indoleamine-(2,3)-dioxygenase (IDO), has not been used previously in&#xD;
      humans. Although pre-clinical toxicology in rats and dogs shows an extremely encouraging&#xD;
      toxicity profile, the study needs to carefully evaluate the toxicities and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      to provide the basis for assigning a safe and biologically effective dosing regimen for later&#xD;
      trials determining its contribution to tumor responses in phase II and III clinical trials.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A histological or cytological diagnosis of recurrent or refractory solid tumor&#xD;
             malignancy. The patient's pathology must be reviewed and confirmed prior to enrollment&#xD;
             (outside reviews acceptable). If no standard therapy exists for disease or subject&#xD;
             refused standard therapy, subject would be considered eligible for enrollment.&#xD;

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 gm/dL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1200/mm3, platelets&#xD;
             ≥100,000/mm3, absolute lymphocyte count ≥800/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic: serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN mg/dL, ALT (SGPT) and AST (SGOT) ≤2.5 x&#xD;
             upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal: serum creatinine (sCr) ≤1.5 x ULN, or creatinine clearance (Ccr) ≥50 mL/min&#xD;
             (approximation by Cockcroft and Gault accepted)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable or non-measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal EKG including benign variants or abnormalities associated with any condition&#xD;
             currently responding to appropriate care (e.g., controlled hypertension with minimal&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy may include any number of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or radiation&#xD;
             therapy regimens. Major surgery or systemic chemotherapy must have been completed at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and residual toxicities from that therapy must be&#xD;
             Grade 1 or lower at the time of enrollment with the exception of hemoglobin and&#xD;
             absolute granulocyte count. Localized radiation therapy must have been completed at&#xD;
             least 2 weeks prior to enrollment and residual toxicities must be Grade 1 or lower at&#xD;
             the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have the ability to understand the study, its inherent risks, side&#xD;
             effects and potential benefits and be able to give written informed consent to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects of child producing potential must agree to use contraception&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women due to the unknown effects of study drug on the developing&#xD;
             fetus or newborn infant.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving immunosuppressive therapy including systemic corticosteroid therapy&#xD;
             and/other immunosuppressive therapy (methotrexate, cyclosporine, FK-506, rapamycin)&#xD;
             for any reason. Subjects receiving inhaled or topical corticosteroids are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease to include: uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension (blood pressure must be ≤ 150/90 mmHg at the time of enrollment on a&#xD;

             acquired/inherited immunodeficiencies are ineligible due to the possibility of&#xD;
             affecting the response to D-1MT and the higher risk of active opportunistic&#xD;
             infections.&#xD;
