      The investigators aim to demonstrate the ability to accurately measure and restore leg&#xD;
      length, offset, and center of rotation during a total hip replacement through a new technique&#xD;
      that uses the femoral component as a measurement tool. The operative technique requires&#xD;
      inserting the femoral component prior to performing the femoral neck osteotomy. After the&#xD;
      femoral component is implanted, a reference guide is attached to the femoral component and&#xD;
      guides a screw into the ilium at a fixed distance from the femoral component. The&#xD;
      pre-arthroplasty measurements of leg length and offset are recorded. The femoral neck&#xD;
      osteotomy is performed, and the native femoral head is removed and measured. The acetabular&#xD;
      socket is prepared and the acetabular component is inserted. A repeat measurement with trial&#xD;
      modular neck components is taken and allows the surgeon an additional opportunity to&#xD;
      accurately recreate leg length and offset with the final component. The reference screw is&#xD;
      removed from the ilium and the incision is closed.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leg length inequality following total hip replacement is the leading cause of patient&#xD;
      dissatisfaction and subsequent litigation after total hip replacement. A change in the total&#xD;
      offset of the hip (lateral translation of the femur relative to the pelvis) may also cause&#xD;
      significant discomfort and hip instability. Before surgery, patients are informed that their&#xD;
      leg may be lengthened and a shoe lift may be required in the opposite shoe to equalize the&#xD;
      leg lengths. Although much less frequent, the leg can accidentally be shortened following&#xD;
      total hip replacement. In one recent study, 62% of patients had a mean leg lengthening of 9&#xD;
      mm and one third of these patients complained about this lengthening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limb length inequality can occur for two reasons. First, significant inaccuracies exist in&#xD;
      current leg length measurement techniques. Second, the surgeon may deliberately lengthen a&#xD;
      patient in order to gain hip stability. Increasing leg length and/or hip offset decreases the&#xD;
      occurrence of bony impingement and increases myofascial tension, both of which improve hip&#xD;
      stability and prevent hip dislocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current methods of determining leg length and offset during surgery include pre-operative&#xD;
      templating, intra-operative measurements, intra-operative x-rays, and computer navigated&#xD;
      surgery. From the pre-operative x-rays, surgeons typically determine which size implant will&#xD;
      best fit the patient's anatomy and best recreate the same leg length. During surgery,&#xD;
      surgeons may attempt to palpate both the operative and the contra-lateral knee and/or ankle&#xD;
      to estimate leg lengths. Surgeons may measure the length of the femoral head and neck that&#xD;
      were removed and the length of the femoral head and neck that were replaced. Surgeons may&#xD;
      insert a long pin into the pelvis (typically the ilium bone) and measure the length from this&#xD;
      pin to some reference point on the femur. This pin in the pelvis method is probably&#xD;
      considered the most accurate, but the leg must be repositioned in exactly the same position&#xD;
      for the measurement to be accurate; 5Â° of hip abduction results in an 8 mm error in leg&#xD;
      length.3 An intra-operative x-ray that shows both hips can also help estimate leg length and&#xD;
      hip offset. Surgical navigation can determine leg length but is not widely availability and&#xD;
      requires a significant financial commitment by an institution. Surgeons typically determine&#xD;
      the appropriate amount of hip offset from their pre-operative templating. Current leg length&#xD;
      guides have shown even greater errors in their attempts to measure hip offset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to demonstrate the ability to accurately measure and restore leg length, offset, and&#xD;
      center of rotation during a total hip replacement through a new technique that uses the&#xD;
      femoral component as a measurement tool. We plan to evaluate the clinical outcome of this&#xD;
      procedure and compare it to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary goal of this research study is to accurately measure and restore the leg length&#xD;
      during a hip replacement. Our second goal is to accurately measure and restore the hip&#xD;
      offset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated in clinic at 2 weeks, 3 months, one year, two year, five years and&#xD;
      every 5 years afterwards. The leg length, offset and center of rotation will be measured on&#xD;
      the pre and post-operative x-ray. Questionnaires based on validated clinical outcomes scores&#xD;
      will be completed at the pre-operative visit, at 3 months, one year, two years, five years&#xD;
      and every 5 years afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abbreviated Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consent for enrollment in this study will have a standard pre-operative and&#xD;
      post-operative AP pelvic x-ray, and leg length, offset measurements, and center of rotation&#xD;
      measurements will be made from these two radiographs. In addition, intra-operative&#xD;
      fluoroscopic radiographs will also be obtained. Validated questionnaire (Harris Hip Scores)&#xD;
      will be administered pre-operatively, at 3 months, at one year, and at two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operative technique for measuring leg length requires inserting the femoral component&#xD;
      prior to performing the femoral neck osteotomy. After the femoral component is implanted, a&#xD;
      reference guide is attached to the femoral component and guides a screw into the ilium at a&#xD;
      fixed distance from the femoral component. The first measurements of leg length and offset&#xD;
      are recorded. The reference guide is removed from the femoral component and the femoral neck&#xD;
      osteotomy is performed. The native femoral head is removed and measured. The acetabulum is&#xD;
      prepared and the acetabular component is inserted. A repeat measurement with trial components&#xD;
      in place allows the surgeon an additional opportunity to accurately recreate leg length and&#xD;
      offset with the final component. After the final components are inserted, the reference screw&#xD;
      is removed from the ilium and the incision is closed. All total hips in this study will be&#xD;
      performed through a superior approach so that the anterior and posterior capsules are&#xD;
      preserved and hip stability is maximized. This capsular tissue preservation approach will&#xD;
      prevent or at least limit the need to deliberately lengthen the leg in order to gain hip&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;
