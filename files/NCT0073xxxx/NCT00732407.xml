    <textblock>
      Aliskiren is a novel renin inhibitor approved for the treatment of hypertension. The effect&#xD;
      of aliskiren on arterial stiffness, inflammation and oxidative stress has not been fully&#xD;
      investigated yet.The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of aliskiren on arterial&#xD;
      stiffness, platelet function and inflammation compared to losatan in patients with diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that aliskiren will have a beneficial effect on arterial stiffness and&#xD;
      platelet function in patients with diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have an increased risk for atherothrombotic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets play an important role in cardiovascular disease both in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and in the development of acute thrombotic events. Their importance in&#xD;
      coronary heart disease is indirectly confirmed by the benefit of antiplatelet agents in these&#xD;
      disorders. Platelet adhesion, aggregation and activation are abnormal in patients with DM.&#xD;
      Several factors were found to be associated with the abnormalities in platelet signaling in&#xD;
      patients with DM, including increased levels of reactive oxygen species, altered calcium&#xD;
      mobilization and increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness, assessed noninvasively by measuring the aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV),&#xD;
      is considered a powerful and independent risk factor for early mortality. Increased arterial&#xD;
      stiffness may lead to early pulse wave reflection causing an increase in systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure. This in turn, increases the myocardial&#xD;
      oxygen demand, reduces ejection fraction and increases the left ventricular working load. PWV&#xD;
      probably represents an integrated index of vascular structure and function, being influenced&#xD;
      by many factors including age, blood pressure, lipid profile and glucose levels. For any&#xD;
      level of systolic blood pressure, aortic PWV is found to be increased in diabetic patients&#xD;
      compared to nondiabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aliskiren is the first direct renin inhibitor that was introduced for the treatment of&#xD;
      hypertension. Aliskiren binds to the active site of renin, inhibiting the activation of the&#xD;
      renin- angiotensin- aldosteron (RAAS) system at the rate limiting step. Aliskiren inhibits&#xD;
      the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (AI). This direct inhibition may be more&#xD;
      efficient than the indirect blockade of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except for its BP lowering effect aliskiren was found to increase renal blood flow to a&#xD;
      higher degree than that was found for angiotensin converting enzime (ACE) inhibitors or&#xD;
      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Moreover- it blocks the active site of the&#xD;
      prorenin/renin ((pro)renin) receptors reducing the local angiotensin II (AII) generation.&#xD;
      Renin inhibitors, like the ACE inhibitors or ARBs, increase the concentration of renin which&#xD;
      activates the (pro)renin receptors. Renin receptors were found in the kidney, blood vessels&#xD;
      and the heart. Binding of renin to these receptors increases its catalytic effect and&#xD;
      probably activates a potentially pathogenic, mitogen activated protein kinase pathway. It has&#xD;
      a tissue damaging effect by increasing frofibrotic pathways and the expression of molecules&#xD;
      such as TGF- beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study aliskiren was found to bind both to renin and prorenin receptors and&#xD;
      increase their stability, this rise is probably not causing AII generation although it allows&#xD;
      the detection of prorenin as renin. Aliskiren increases the amount of circulating&#xD;
      immunoreactive renin but decreases the PRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uresin Y et al compared the efficacy and safety of aliskiren with that of ramipril in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes and hypertension. Aliskiren was found to be more effective at lowering&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure (SBP) than ramipril, and showed no inferiority in reducing diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (DBP). When used in combination with ramipril, aliskiren showed a significant&#xD;
      additional reduction in both SBP and DBP. In the same study, plasma renin concentration (PRC)&#xD;
      was significantly increased with each monotherapy and when combined, PRC increased to a&#xD;
      greater level than the sum of the effects of each alone. The reactive rise in PRC was&#xD;
      associated with a concomitant rise in plasma renin activity (PRA) in the ramipril group, an&#xD;
      effect that was suppressed when combined with aliskiren.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other recent studies found similar results when comparing efficacy and safety of aliskiren&#xD;
      and ramipril or adding it to treatment with valsartan. Safety of aliskiren was also evaluated&#xD;
      in elderly patients (above 65) and was found to effectively reduce blood pressure and to be&#xD;
      well tolerated in this subgroup of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibition of the RAAS in diabetic patients is known to result in several beneficial effects,&#xD;
      independent of their BP lowering effect; Reduction of albumin excretion, prevention of the&#xD;
      progression of renal disease and possibly a cardio-protective effect. Valsartan was also&#xD;
      found to reduce PWV, and hence arterial stiffness, in diabetic patients independently of its&#xD;
      BP lowering effect. Several of these effects had already been evaluated using aliskiren, for&#xD;
      example: Nussberger J at al evaluated the effect of aliskiren on atherosclerosis and plaque&#xD;
      stabilization in mice, comparing it with atenolol, amlodipine and irbesartan. They found that&#xD;
      although they all had a similar blood pressure lowering effect, aliskiren and irbesartan had&#xD;
      a beneficial effect on plaque phenotype (including smooth muscle cell content, fibrous cap,&#xD;
      lipid core, medial degeneration and macrophage content) whereas amlodipine and atenolol did&#xD;
      not. Lu H et al. evaluated the effect of aliskiren on atherosclerosis in LDL receptor&#xD;
      deficient mice. They found a significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque size in the&#xD;
      aortic root and arch in the aliskiren treated mice. Aliskiren was found to reduce BP, prevent&#xD;
      albuminuria and suppress the renal gene expression of (pro)renin receptors in a model of&#xD;
      hypertensive diabetic renal damage in rats. It also exhibited a potential to inhibit&#xD;
      prorenin. When using the combination of aliskiren and losartan in patients with DM, aliskiren&#xD;
      revealed a reno-protective effect that was independent of its BP lowering effect. The effect&#xD;
      of aliskiren on arterial stiffness is yet to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have evaluated the effect of RAAS system inhibitors on platelet function and&#xD;
      hemostasis, for example perindopril was found to have anti-platelet and profibrinolytic&#xD;
      effects and telmisartan was found to have anticoagulant effect. Perindopril was also found to&#xD;
      reduce platelet aggregation and adrenaline induced platelet aggregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of aliskiren on platelet activity is not clear. In an in vitro study biomarkers of&#xD;
      platelet activity were not altered by aliskiren (except for a moderate increase of&#xD;
      antithrombin-III activity). At higher doses (exceeding its therapeutic range) it had a&#xD;
      diverging effect - both platelet activating and antiplatelet effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of aliskiren, which inhibits the rate&#xD;
      limiting step of the RAAS system, on arterial stiffness, inflammation and platelet function&#xD;
      in patients with DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective, cross over, randomized trial. All patients fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, after a short screening period, will be treated with&#xD;
      aliskiren or losartan. After a washout period of 2 weeks a cross over will be made between&#xD;
      the two groups. Aliskiren will be given in a preliminary dosage of 150 mg per day, after a&#xD;
      follow up of two weeks dosage will be increased to 300 mg per day. Losartan will be given in&#xD;
      a preliminary dosage of 50 mg per day and after a two weeks follow up dosage will be&#xD;
      increased to 100 mg per day. Two weeks after initiation of each treatment potassium and&#xD;
      creatinin levels will be assessed. The follow up will be conducted in the Research and&#xD;
      Development unit in Assaf Harofeh Medical Center at 0, 3 and 6 months and after the wash out&#xD;
      period. On each visit patients BP will be assessed by 24 ambulatory BP monitoring. Blood will&#xD;
      be drawn (10 cc) for Hemoglobin levels, electrolytes, renal and liver functions, total&#xD;
      cholesterol, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL- cholesterol), triglycerides (TG),&#xD;
      oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and hs- CRP. LDL-cholesterol will be calculated.&#xD;
      PRA will be measured by radioimmunoassay of generated AI, PRC and plasma aldosterone will be&#xD;
      measured by immunochemiluminescence. In addition NO and isoprostane will be measured as an&#xD;
      index to oxidative stress. Platelet function and arterial stiffness will be assessed. The&#xD;
      patients' medication regimen will not be changed throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet Function Tests Cone-and-Platelet Analyzer 200 µL of citrated blood will be placed in&#xD;
      a polystyrene well and subjected to a shear rate of 1300 sec-1 using a rotating conical disk&#xD;
      for 2 minutes. The well will be washed and stained by May-Gruenwald stain. Platelet adhesion&#xD;
      will be evaluated as the percentage of total area covered with platelets designated as&#xD;
      surface coverage (%) and aggregation as the mean size of the surface-bound aggregates&#xD;
      designated as average size (µ'm2) by use of an image analysis system (Galai).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin Response Assay 3.6µl Arachidonic Acid and 0.2 ml blood will be added to a micro tube&#xD;
      (2ml), (final Arachidonic Acid concentration 0.275 mM). The tube will be rotated on the tube&#xD;
      mixer at 10 rpm for 1 minute. 130 µl will be placed in a well and tested with the cone and&#xD;
      platelet analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clopidogrel Response Assay 5 µl ADP and 0.2 ml blood will be added into a micro tube (2 ml)&#xD;
      (final ADP concentration 1.25 µM). The tube will be rotated on the tube mixer at 10 rpm for 1&#xD;
      minute. 130 µl will be placed in a well and tested with the cone and platelet analyzer.&#xD;
      (Varon D et al 1997) Arterial stiffness Assessment of arterial stiffness will be performed by&#xD;
      a noninvasive technique using the commercially available SphygmoCor System (AtCor Medical&#xD;
      LTD, Australia). All measurements will be performed while the patient is in a recumbent&#xD;
      position at a room temperature of 25۫ C, between 06:30 and 08:30 A.M. after an overnight&#xD;
      fasti (8-10 hours) and after a short period of rest. Peripheral pressure waveforms will be&#xD;
      recorded from the radial artery at the wrist, using applanation tonometry with a high&#xD;
      fidelity micromanometer. When sequential waveforms will be recorded, a validated 16-18&#xD;
      generalized transfer function will be applied to generate the corresponding central pressure&#xD;
      waveform. The integral system software will be used to calculate an average radial artery&#xD;
      waveform and to derive a corresponding central aortic pressure waveform using a previously&#xD;
      validated generalized transfer function. From these data the indexes of arterial stiffness&#xD;
      will be obtained. The augmentation of central arterial pressure is the difference between the&#xD;
      first and second systolic peaks of the central pressure waveforms, and the central&#xD;
      augmentation index (AIx) is the augmentation expressed as a percentage of the pulse pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technology is easy to use, non-invasive, simple, rapid (15 minutes per test) and&#xD;
      repeatable.&#xD;
