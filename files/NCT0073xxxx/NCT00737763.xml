  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single-center therapeutic study, we will study the ability of efalizumab to protect&#xD;
      remaining beta cells in teenagers and young adults who have been newly diagnosed with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. Efalizumab is a monoclonal antibody which prevents the activation of&#xD;
      antigen specific T lymphocytes to sites of inflammation. Efalizumab was approved by the FDA&#xD;
      in 2003 for the treatment of psoriasis. It has been proven to be safe, well tolerated and&#xD;
      effective in targeting T cell mediated disorders like those seen in autoimmunity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since there is data that shows that early intervention can prevent further destruction of&#xD;
      insulin producing beta cells, the patients who will be enrolled in this study will have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes within 6 weeks of enrolling and starting therapy. Patients who&#xD;
      meet the screening criteria will be randomized at a 2 to 1 ratio to either get weekly&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections of efalizumab for 26 weeks versus a placebo injection. The&#xD;
      researchers and patients will be blinded to the treatment group assignment. All patients will&#xD;
      be followed for two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for this study will be the difference from baseline in the body's&#xD;
      ability to respond to a Mixed Meal Tolerance Test at 12 months after enrollment. The Mixed&#xD;
      Meal Tolerance test will help test the production of insulin by the pancreas. By comparing&#xD;
      the results of these tests between the treated group and the placebo group, we hope to be&#xD;
      able to show preservation of beta cell function in the group treated with efalizumab.&#xD;
