    <textblock>
      The questions proposed by this study are those of safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Concerning safety: &quot;Are sublingual food drops (SLIT) safe enough to be used for&#xD;
           stimulation of natural immune suppression in patients with food allergies?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Concerning efficacy: &quot;Do the drops suppress food allergy enough for patients to eat&#xD;
           previously allergic foods with little or no allergic reaction?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to provide systematic collection of data proving the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of food drops in the correction of food allergy. A patient's range of symptoms,&#xD;
      which can include but are not limited to fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain,&#xD;
      and insomnia can be diagnostic indicators of food allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An approach to answering the above questions can be done by a randomized, controlled, blinded&#xD;
      study. The design of our study could be reasonable and powerful because this layout limits&#xD;
      bias and accounts for placebo effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients enrolled in our study will present with food allergy symptoms and diagnostic&#xD;
      tests will provide the specific information regarding their food allergies. Once the&#xD;
      diagnosis has been made and consent for treatment has been obtained, participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the group that receives the food allergy intervention with SLIT (&#xD;
      food allergens mixed with 50% glycerin in a vial) or the group that receives the control SLIT&#xD;
      (glycerin only). The patients are truly blinded to their treatment because all the SLIT food&#xD;
      allergy vials are identical and contain no distinguishing features that could reveal their&#xD;
      contents. There is also no difference in taste between a vial containing glycerin and food&#xD;
      allergens and a vial containing only glycerin. Therefore, a food allergy SLIT&#xD;
      randomized-controlled study can be reasonably achieved.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized-controlled blinded trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sublingual&#xD;
      immunotherapy for food allergy sufferers. The study will report any adverse events caused by&#xD;
      the administration of food allergy drops. Food allergy can manifest itself in many forms&#xD;
      including general fatigue, abdominal pain, GERD, nausea, and other symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End Points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison between groups 1 and 2 about patient-reported adverse, as well as beneficial,&#xD;
      events while on food allergy immunotherapy at 3, 6, 9, 12 months after maintenance dose is&#xD;
      achieved (SLIT questionnaire). These comparisons relate to both safety and efficacy issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial subjects will be identified by their presenting complaints due to ingestion of certain&#xD;
      symptomatic foods. Clinical assessment of potential food allergy participants for SLIT will&#xD;
      occur according to usual testing standards. All participants will have diagnostic tests&#xD;
      (usually RAST analysis and or food challenge techniques) to confirm specific food allergies.&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be asked to participate in the study through&#xD;
      informed consent. Once consent has been obtained, the subject will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either the control or the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (control group) will receive sublingual immunotherapy (escalation followed by&#xD;
      maintenance) with vials containing glycerin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (intervention group) will receive sublingual immunotherapy (escalation followed by&#xD;
      maintenance) with vials containing glycerin and the previously diagnosed food allergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the offending foods are diagnosed, the subject will be instructed to avoid these foods&#xD;
      until they have been on the 9-week escalation doses and the maintenance immunotherapy dose&#xD;
      for six months. After this eight-month combined period of escalation and maintenance, the&#xD;
      participants will be allowed to reintroduce the known offending foods. In addition,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to respond to questionnaires at pre-defined intervals in regards&#xD;
      to any adverse symptoms they may have experienced while on maintenance SLIT. These&#xD;
      questionnaires will allow us to determine if food drops contribute to adverse events, as well&#xD;
      as how effective the drops are at suppressing immune response to previously allergic foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial clinic visit, potential subjects will be asked to elaborate on specific food&#xD;
      allergy symptoms in order to obtain a better understanding of the food allergies involved.&#xD;
      Also, diagnostic tests will be performed based on signs and symptoms and these can include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical History&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Oral Food Challenge Participants in the intervention group will receive SLIT with&#xD;
           glycerin and individualized food allergens. Subjects in the control group will receive&#xD;
           SLIT with glycerin only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected length for an individual's participation is sixteen to eighteen months. This&#xD;
      period includes the time between the initial clinic visit and diagnostic work-up, the&#xD;
      achievement of SLIT maintenance dose, and the 3,6,9,12 month post-maintenance dose safety&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules apply to the intervention and placebo groups in the case of an adverse event.&#xD;
