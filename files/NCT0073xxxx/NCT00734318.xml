      The study compares the efficacy and safety of FlutiForm® vs Flixotide® plus Foradil® in the&#xD;
      treatment of severe persisent asthma in adult subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study involving a 2 week run-in phase followed by an 8 week double blind treatment&#xD;
      phase. During the run-in phase, subjects receive Flixotide®. In the treatment phase subjects&#xD;
      will be randomised to one of the four treatment groups and will receive either high dose&#xD;
      FlutiForm® and Foradil® plus Flixotide® placebo or low dose FlutiForm® plus Foradil® and&#xD;
      Flixotide® placebo or Foradil® plus Flixotide® and FlutiForm® placebo or Flixotide® and&#xD;
      FlutiForm® plus Foradil® placebo. Efficacy will be assessed by lung function tests, asthma&#xD;
      symptoms, sleep disturbance due to asthma and rescue medication use. Safety will be assessed&#xD;
      by adverse events, lab tests, ECGs and vital signs.&#xD;

             1993) during the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and Randomisation Visit (Visit 3) following&#xD;
             appropriate withholding of asthma medications (if applicable).&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Demonstrated satisfactory technique in the use of the study medication.&#xD;

             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Near fatal or life-threatening (including intubation) asthma within the past year.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Current use of medications other than those allowed in the protocol that will have an&#xD;
