    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of 188Re-PTI-6D2 in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with confirmed Stage III (unresectable) or Stage IV melanoma who meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will undergo thorough physical examination and baseline tumor imaging to&#xD;
      document baseline tumor measurements. Patients will be allowed to check in to the study&#xD;
      center either the evening prior to dosing (Study Day 0) or the day of dosing (Study Day 1)&#xD;
      based upon the principal investigators (PIs) discretion. All patients will be dosed and&#xD;
      monitored as inpatients during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of 188Re-PTI-6D2. Patients will undergo&#xD;
      serial gamma scans at specified time points. Blood samples will be obtained prior to dosing&#xD;
      and at specified intervals for PK measurements of the mAb as well as for measurement of serum&#xD;
      radioactivity. Urine will be collected to measure excreted radioactivity. Patients will be&#xD;
      closely monitored for safety throughout the duration of the study. Patients will remain at&#xD;
      the study center for 48-72 hours after infusion of the radiolabeled dose to allow adequate&#xD;
      time for post-treatment safety observation and rhenium decay. No investigational or&#xD;
      commercial agents or therapies other than the study agent may be administered with the intent&#xD;
      to treat the patient's malignancy during the inpatient treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After three evaluable patients have been followed for a minimum of 2-6 weeks after&#xD;
      188Re-PTI-6D2 infusion, the Principal Investigator and the PTI Medical Monitor will review&#xD;
      safety data for patients at the current dose level. If there is no evidence of a&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity, the dose of 188Re-PTI-6D2 will be escalated for the next cohort of&#xD;
      patients. Dose escalation of 188Re-PTI-6D2 will occur according to the following titration&#xD;
      scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 1 = 20-30 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 10 - 50 mg of antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 2 = 40-60 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 10 - 50 mg of antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 3 = 75-100 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 50 - 100 mg of antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 4 = 125-150 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 50 - 100 mg of antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 5 = 175-200 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 50 - 100 mg of antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-limiting toxicity will be defined as the following: Grade 4 hematological toxicity; ≥&#xD;
      Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity; or any adverse event that results in permanent&#xD;
      discontinuation of the infusion. If at any time Grade 5 toxicity is observed, accrual will be&#xD;
      suspended until further review. If 0 out of 3 patients experience DLT, the next cohort of 3&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled at the next dose level. If 1 out of 3 patients experience a&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity, an additional three evaluable patients will be enrolled at the&#xD;
      current dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation occurs until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. The MTD is defined as&#xD;
      the dose preceding the dose at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated by vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and&#xD;
      temperature), physical examinations, electrocardiograms (EKGs), clinical laboratory tests and&#xD;
      adverse event monitoring. Laboratory studies will include hematology, chemistry and&#xD;
      urinalysis at baseline, at the end of the inpatient treatment period, and at 2 weeks and 6&#xD;
      weeks after the infusion of the 188Re-PTI-6D2 dose. If hematological recovery has not&#xD;
      occurred by week 6, patients will follow-up monthly until hematological recovery. In&#xD;
      addition, thyroid function tests will be performed at baseline and at 6 weeks after infusion;&#xD;
      then monthly until recovery (if has not occurred). Human anti-murine antibodies (HAMA) will&#xD;
      be measured at baseline, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks after infusion .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biodistribution of 188Re-PTI-6D2 will be evaluated by whole body imaging with a gamma camera&#xD;
      immediately after infusion (0 - 2 hrs.), at 2.5 - 5 hours, at 6 - 8 hours, and 24 hours&#xD;
      post-infusion. Whole body imaging at 48 and 72 hours post-infusion may be conducted at the&#xD;
      discretion of the PI. Urine will be collected to measure cumulative radioactivity excretion&#xD;
      up to 48-72 hours post-infusion (depending on the hospital discharge date). Pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of the mAb and radioactivity will be determined from blood samples taken through 48-72 hours&#xD;
      post-infusion (depending on the hospital discharge date). Dosimetry calculations will be&#xD;
      performed to determine estimated absorbed radiation doses to critical organs and to tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be discharged from the study unit 48-72 hours after infusion with 188Re-PTI-6D2&#xD;
      or later as determined by the Investigator's clinical judgment. Patients will be required to&#xD;
      return for post-treatment follow-up visits approximately 2 and 6 weeks (± two days) after&#xD;
      infusion for safety monitoring. Ongoing follow-up visits will continue until disease&#xD;
      progression every 4 weeks. Tumor measurements will be performed at baseline, and all&#xD;
      follow-up visits to assess for tumor response. Patients with unacceptable adverse events will&#xD;
      have events followed until resolution.&#xD;
