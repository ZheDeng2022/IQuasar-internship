  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are many different treatments that doctors recommend for patients with IC/PBS. Only a&#xD;
      few research studies have been done to evaluate treatments given to patients. Treatment&#xD;
      choices can be of two types: drug therapy and non-drug therapy. The two treatments used in&#xD;
      this study will be of the non-drug therapy type. One of the treatments being used in this&#xD;
      study is called Myofascial Tissue Manipulation. This is a kind of physical therapy that is&#xD;
      designed to work on specific muscles and tissue layers in a particular part of the body. In&#xD;
      this study, this treatment will focus on the areas around the pelvis and the pelvic floor.&#xD;
      The treatment will involve the physical therapist's use of hands and fingers to target&#xD;
      specific muscles and tissues located within your pelvis, rectum, and/or vagina (the pelvic&#xD;
      floor) as well as muscles and layers of tissue in your abdomen and legs. The other treatment&#xD;
      being used in this study is Global Therapeutic Massage. This treatment involves the physical&#xD;
      therapist's use of classic Western body massage techniques on the muscles of your arms, legs,&#xD;
      hands, neck, shoulders, back, stomach, buttocks, and feet to create an overall feeling of&#xD;
      well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if Pelvic Physical Therapy is safe and&#xD;
      effective on treating symptoms in women with interstitial cystitis as compared to a full body&#xD;
      therapeutic massage. This study will also measure the lasting effects of the treatment up to&#xD;
      3 months after your last study treatment.&#xD;

      The Urologic Pelvic Pain Syndromes (UPPS) are characterized by pelvic pain with concurrent&#xD;
      urinary symptoms. Broadly, the UPPS comprise Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome&#xD;
      (IC/PBS) in men and women, and Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) in&#xD;
      men, although the focus of this protocol is exclusively women with IC/PBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interstitial Cystitis (IC) is a debilitating bladder disorder characterized by urinary&#xD;
      urgency, frequency, and pain. The presentation of symptoms can be quite variable among&#xD;
      patients, suggesting that IC is a multi-factorial syndrome with several proposed etiologies,&#xD;
      some of which may be interrelated.1 Painful Bladder Syndrome (PBS), as defined by the&#xD;
      International Continence Society, is &quot;the complaint of suprapubic pain related to bladder&#xD;
      filling, accompanied by other symptoms, such as increased daytime and night-time frequency,&#xD;
      in the absence of proven urinary infection or other obvious pathology. 2&quot; PBS is a clinical&#xD;
      description of disease based on the patient's symptoms and does not depend on urodynamic or&#xD;
      cystoscopic findings. These symptoms may be related to interstitial cystitis, although&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria are still lacking for this entity, and the relationship between PBS and&#xD;
      interstitial cystitis is not clear. For clarity and compliance with current nomenclature,&#xD;
      this protocol will use the term IC/PBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with many chronic pain disorders, IC/PBS is poorly understood, poorly characterized, and&#xD;
      treatment is mostly empirical and unsatisfactory. Several proposed etiologic theories include&#xD;
      (1) increased bladder epithelial permeability, (2) activation of bladder mast cells, (3)&#xD;
      allergic or autoimmune processes, (4) toxic substance(s) in the urine, (5) occult infection,&#xD;
      (6) neuropathic changes, and (7) neurogenic inflammation. However, none of these mechanisms&#xD;
      have been conclusively shown to be responsible for IC/PBS. Estimates of prevalence of the&#xD;
      syndromes vary widely. In 1990 interstitial cystitis (IC) was thought to affect as many as&#xD;
      500,000 U.S. citizens, with 25% of patients under age 25.3 More recently however, using&#xD;
      expanded definitions of PBS now exceed 10 million.4 Quality of life with IC/PBS can be worse&#xD;
      than end stage renal disease.5 The recent pilot study of manual physical therapies for&#xD;
      Urologic Pelvic Pain demonstrated feasibility of recruitment, and promising benefit of&#xD;
      myofascial tissue manipulation (MTM) (ref manuscript#1). In that pilot study, 47 participants&#xD;
      were recruited to six centers with prior expertise in MTM. Of the 47 participants, 24 were&#xD;
      females with IC/PBS, and 23 were males -- 2 with IC/PBS and 21 with CP/CPPS. Motivated by the&#xD;
      promising findings in that pilot study, this protocol aims to investigate whether those&#xD;
      initial results are generalizable in an expanded phase 3 clinical trial, in which we include&#xD;
      other therapists from other centers. However, due to the gender-specific findings of the&#xD;
      pilot study, and the limited resources available, this protocol is focused on replicating the&#xD;
      initial pilot study exclusively in women with IC/PBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the pain of IC/PBS is poorly understood, almost all clinicians agree that there is&#xD;
      almost always some chronic tension and tenderness of the pelvic floor musculature present in&#xD;
      UPPS patients,8-10 and it is possible that these myofascial abnormalities contribute&#xD;
      significantly to the pain of IC/PBS. For example, Hetrick et al11 compared the surface EMG&#xD;
      signals from men with CPPS to those from men without chronic pain, and found that there was&#xD;
      greater EMG instability in men with CPPS, along with increased baseline tonicity, and&#xD;
      instability with lowered voluntary endurance contraction amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether these musculoskeletal abnormalities of the abdominal wall and pelvic floor&#xD;
      musculature found in IC/PBS sufferers represent primary or secondary phenomena remains&#xD;
      unknown. It is possible that pelvic visceral pain leads to chronic contraction of regional&#xD;
      skeletal musculature, leading to overuse injury and pain. It is also possible that primary&#xD;
      pelvic myofascial problems lead to painful and weakened pelvic floor musculature, which also&#xD;
      functions poorly to inhibit the urgency associated with bladder filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our prior study of manual physical therapy suggested benefit of MTM over GTM. Translation of&#xD;
      those office practices into the research setting was apparently successful in centers that&#xD;
      participated in the first trial. We propose to expand the number of treating therapists to&#xD;
      include 11 study centers, in order to determine whether the results of the first trial can be&#xD;
      generalized, at least in the research setting. However, due to the gender-specific findings,&#xD;
      this expanded replication study will focus exclusively on women with IC/PBS.&#xD;
