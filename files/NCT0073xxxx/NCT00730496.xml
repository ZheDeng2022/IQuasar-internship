      Forty-five infertile women undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment were managed by&#xD;
      uterine cavity injection of day 2 embryo culture supernatant before day 3 embryo transfer. No&#xD;
      statistically significant differences were found in implantation and pregnancy rates when&#xD;
      compared with control group.&#xD;

      Study design and sample size This was a randomized clinical trial involving ninety patients&#xD;
      who were undergoing conventional IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment at&#xD;
      our Reproductive Medical Center. The subjects were recruited and studied for a period of 6&#xD;
      months between January and June 2008. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      Shen-Zhen Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital. Subjects all signed an informed consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the guideline made by the Ethics Committee of Shen-Zhen Maternity and Child&#xD;
      Healthcare Hospital, we had better accomplish the study within six months. We calculated&#xD;
      that, in our center, a sample size of 100 or more subjects would need to be recruited over&#xD;
      about a 6 months period. We ended up with 90 patients in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Ninety infertile women, aged 23-39 years, with an infertile duration of 3-8 years,&#xD;
      were enrolled from our infertility treatment clinic between January and June 2008. The&#xD;
      selection criteria for participants were only those women who were first going to undergo IVF&#xD;
      or ICSI treatment. Women who were treated with natural cycle IVF or had no appropriate embryo&#xD;
      for ET were excluded. The infertility factors were identified as the following: tubal (n=54),&#xD;
      unexplained (n=3), male n=22), endometriosis (n=9), others (n=2). The selection and&#xD;
      enrollment for each subject was decided by three same physicians. All subjects were informed&#xD;
      that this procedure was a new technique, and that its effectiveness has not been confirmed,&#xD;
      although an optimal outcome in patients with blastocyst transfer was obtained by using this&#xD;
      technique for the same purpose (6). During the selection procedure, four eligible subjects&#xD;
      opted not to participate when counseled about the uncertain of effectiveness, and other two&#xD;
      subjects declined to randomize. Finally, 90 eligible patients were enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization First, ninety random numbers generated by means of computer were randomly&#xD;
      divided into study group and control group. Then, all subjects in an enrolled date order were&#xD;
      arranged according to the sequence of random numbers. So, ninety subjects were randomly&#xD;
      divided into the study group and control group. The random allocation sequence was concealed&#xD;
      in a closed and dark-colored envelope until the day of oocyte pick-up. Randomization occurred&#xD;
      after patients agreed to participate in the study (Figure 1). All women of two groups&#xD;
      underwent a conventional IVF or ICSI procedure, but in study group, the patients were added&#xD;
      with a uterine cavity injection of day 2 embryo culture supernatant. The IVF or ICSI&#xD;
      procedure was performed by same physicians and laboratory technicians. The treating sequence&#xD;
      of subjects was as same as the enrolling sequence. The study was not blinded, because the&#xD;
      patients as well as the clinicians were aware of the study content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVF or ISCI procedure and injection technique of embryo culture supernatant Controlled&#xD;
      ovarian hyperstimulation was performed using a variety of protocols, as previously published&#xD;
      elsewhere (8). A down-regulation of the pituitary was realized during triptorelin&#xD;
      (Triptorelin Acetate Injection, Ferring, Germany) administration S.C., 0.1 mg/d×7, started&#xD;
      from day 21 of the previous cycles. Ovarian stimulation started from day 3 of stimulated&#xD;
      cycle by using recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH, Gonal-F, Serono, Switzerland),&#xD;
      225-300IU daily S.C.. The follicle development was monitored by transvaginal ultrasound scan&#xD;
      (TVS). 250ug of HCG (Ovitrelle; Serono, Madrid) was administered by I.M. when one to two&#xD;
      leading follicle(s) reached a mean diameter of 18 mm. In general, transvaginal oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval was performed after 36 h of HCG injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The media used for embryo culture was IVF-60. Briefly, after oocyte retrieval (day 0),&#xD;
      cumulus-enclosed oocytes were incubated in IVF-60. Semen was prepared with a 45-90&#xD;
      discontinuous gradient. The resulting pellet was washed in IVF-60. For normal IVF, 100,000 to&#xD;
      150,000 sperm/100ul were used for each oocyte. The maturation stage of oocyte was assessed&#xD;
      for IVF 15-18 hour after insemination (day 1). Cumulus and corona cells were removed using&#xD;
      drawn pipettes. When ICSI was performed, oocytes were denuded with HYASE. Each mature oocyte&#xD;
      was placed in a 6-ul droplet of GAMETE-20. The partner's sperm was placed in a 6-ul droplet&#xD;
      of ICSI-100. All droplets were overlaid with OVOIL. ICSI was performed using a inverted&#xD;
      microscope with RI micromanipulators (INTEGRA Micromanipulation System, Research Instruments,&#xD;
      UK). The CO2 incubators (Forma, USA) with 6% CO2 gas were used for embryo incubation. An&#xD;
      embryo scoring system based on cleavage rate and morphologic features was used for the&#xD;
      evaluation of embryo quality, as previously described elsewhere (9). Briefly, grade 1 is the&#xD;
      best score and grade 5 is the worst. For example, a grade 1 embryo has blastomeres of equal&#xD;
      size with no cytoplasmic fragmentation. A grade 2 embryo has symmetric blastomeres, but a&#xD;
      small degree of cytoplasmic fragmentation involving ≤10% of the embryo's surface. Grades 3&#xD;
      through 5 demonstrate progressive embryo cytoplasmic fragmentation and variable cell&#xD;
      symmetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day 2, the embryos were translated from the old dish to a new dish with fresh media&#xD;
      and cultured continuously. In study group, the embryo culture supernatant at the old dish&#xD;
      were aspirated by using embryo transfer catheter (COOK-5000, Australia) and injected into the&#xD;
      patient's uterine cavity. ET was performed on the third day of embryo culture. Two to three&#xD;
      embryos were selected to transfer for each woman. The number of embryos selected for transfer&#xD;
      was based on morphologic criteria and some additional factors, such as duration and cause of&#xD;
      infertility and age of the patient. Pregnancy was determined by carry out a urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test after 14 days of ET. The embryo implantation, the number of gestational sacs, and embryo&#xD;
      heart pulsation were determined by TVS in the seventh week of pregnancy. Except the day 2&#xD;
      embryo culture supernatant injection, all of the above-mentioned clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      procedures were identical between the study group and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Baseline characteristics of the patients were expressed as mean&#xD;
      ±standard deviation or frequencies and proportion (%). The pregnancy and implantation rates&#xD;
      were calculated based on the cases of pregnancy and number of gestational sacs. A Chi-Square&#xD;
      Test was used to compare the implantation and conception proportions between two groups. The&#xD;
      Statistics Package for Social Science (SPSS 13.0; SPSS Inc.) was used for statistical&#xD;
      analyses. Statistical significance was set at P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
