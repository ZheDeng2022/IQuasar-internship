      Background Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients develop leg weakness and a&#xD;
      reduced walking capacity, due to reduced leg muscle oxygen-utilising capacity (OUC). Animal&#xD;
      experiments indicate that low muscle levels of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors&#xD;
      (PPAR) cause the reduced muscle OUC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      In COPD patients, investigate whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reduced muscle PPAR levels cause reduced leg muscle OUC, by investigating a correlation&#xD;
           between these in muscle samples (Study 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. training increases muscle PPAR levels in proportion to increases in OUC, as should occur&#xD;
           if PPARs control OUC (Study 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. muscle PPAR levels and walking capacity correlate (Study 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. the new technique of repetitive stimulation of the nerve to the leg with a magnet (rMS)&#xD;
      improves muscle OUC (Study 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1 Leg weakness and walking ability are assessed in 75 patients, then a leg muscle&#xD;
      sample is taken to measure PPARs and OUC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 60 Study 1 patients have either cardiovascular training, rMS, or no training, for 8&#xD;
      weeks, then are re-studied as in Study 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance If reduced PPAR levels correspond with leg weakness, medicines can be developed to&#xD;
      target these receptors and treat weakness. If rMS is effective, it can be offered to&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There has been considerable interest in finding methods of improving quadriceps function in&#xD;
      COPD, since quadriceps dysfunction is associated with reduced exercise capacity5 and survival&#xD;
      in patients16, independently of lung function. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) courses&#xD;
      comprising exercise and education can increase oxidative enzymes, strength and endurance of&#xD;
      the quadriceps in patients with COPD17 and improve walking capacity even over a period of 8&#xD;
      weeks12, 18. However, PR is not a complete solution: not all regions of the UK offer PR, PR&#xD;
      only has on average a 50% uptake rate by patients and the drop-out rate is 30%. Also a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients (about 30%) do not increase their exercise capacity as a&#xD;
      result of PR19, perhaps because breathlessness limits the training they complete or their&#xD;
      peripheral muscle strength is normal19. Therefore, there is interest in alternative&#xD;
      treatments or add-ons to exercise, particularly in terms of localised muscle treatments that&#xD;
      are not limited by impaired respiratory function. Repetitive electrical stimulation of the&#xD;
      femoral nerve (rES) appears to be an effective alternative method of passively training the&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle. 30 minutes rES at 10Hz five times a week to both legs increased muscle&#xD;
      strength and exercise performance in patients with COPD21 and those with heart failure22.&#xD;
      Similar results have been achieved with fifteen minutes of repetitive magnetic stimulation of&#xD;
      the femoral nerve (rMS) three times a week23. However, treatment studies with rES to&#xD;
      investigate effects on exercise performance have often used separate treatment and control&#xD;
      groups which introduces inter-subject differences into studies already limited by sample&#xD;
      size243 and have only used voluntary measures of quadriceps function96. The only biopsy study&#xD;
      of rES used a cross-over design but biopsies were only taken before and after the rES&#xD;
      training period and not before and after the control period.244 The rMS study involved a&#xD;
      total of eighteen subjects (ten assigned to rMS, eight to control) and biopsies were not&#xD;
      taken to evaluate histological changes in the muscle. With this study, I sought primarily to&#xD;
      evaluate the changes in quadriceps fibre characteristics as a result of an intensive rMS&#xD;
      protocol, and secondarily, compare changes in quadriceps function as the result of rMS with&#xD;
      the clinical gold standard for improving muscle function, PR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval The Research Ethics Committee of the Ealing &amp; West London Mental Health&#xD;
      Trust approved the study (06/Q0410/54). The trial was registered with National Clinical&#xD;
      Trials Database (NCT 00737698). 2.13.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation The sample size required for the training study was based on power&#xD;
      calculations from a previous study on PR from our group221 and pilot data from our group on&#xD;
      the effect of rMS on muscle strength (Swallow et al, unpublished) using Stata 10 statistical&#xD;
      software. The power calculations were based on functional improvements (increase of 54m on&#xD;
      6MW as a result of PR and 10% increase in quadriceps TwQ as a result of rMS, as the minimum&#xD;
      clinically significant increments) rather than increases in muscle fibre CSA or type I fibre&#xD;
      proportions as the data for the latter was not available. We chose an increase of 10% twitch&#xD;
      force as the minimally significant increment as previous data from Mador et al showed a 9.7%&#xD;
      increase in twitch force as the result of 8 weeks PR17. A conventional power of 80% with a&#xD;
      two-tailed p value of ≤0.05 was chosen indicating that a minimum of ten patients were&#xD;
      required for the PR arm and twenty six for the rMS arm. We aimed to recruit fifteen to the PR&#xD;
      group and thirty to the rMS group to allow for patient drop-out at the rates we have&#xD;
      previously encountered. At completion, there were seventeen in the PR group and thirty seven&#xD;
      in the rMS group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject selection Eighty six COPD patients consented for the cross-sectional study also&#xD;
      consented for the training study therefore the inclusion and exclusion criteria were as for&#xD;
      the cross-sectional study. Patients were precluded from starting any new exercise regimen or&#xD;
      new regular medication from consent to completion of the study, and patients were encouraged&#xD;
      to contact me on day 1 of an acute exacerbation so appropriate treatment could be instituted.&#xD;
      The study design and flow of participants through the study are shown in Fig. 4.1 and 4.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation FFMI was calculated using bioelectrical impedance (Methods chapter Section&#xD;
      2.4.2.1) and patients stratified into low FFMI (&lt;15 kg/m2 for females, &lt;16 kg/m2 for males)&#xD;
      and normal FFMI. The low and normal FFMI groups were randomised separately (so low FFMI&#xD;
      patients were evenly distributed between treatment groups) using a sealed envelope system and&#xD;
      a block of 4 procedure weighted 2:1:1 for rMS: PR: no active treatment as the power&#xD;
      calculation suggested that at least twice as many patients were required in the PR arm as the&#xD;
      rMS arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-training assessments Lung function, FFMI, quadriceps strength, quadriceps endurance,&#xD;
      physical activity and 6MW and maximal cycle ergometry performance and HRQOL measurements were&#xD;
      performed as described in the Methods chapter Sections 2.4-2.7. Percutaneous biopsy of the&#xD;
      quadriceps and muscle fibre type analysis were performed. Patients underwent the pre-training&#xD;
      physiological assessment and biopsies within four weeks of randomisation. The assessment was&#xD;
      as described for the cross-sectional study (in the rMS group both legs were tested on the&#xD;
      same day, in the other two groups the leg ipsilateral to the dominant hand was tested) and&#xD;
      then patients proceeded to their allocated treatment within two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerve (rMS) This was delivered using the&#xD;
      Magstim Rapid magnetic nerve stimulator system (Magstim, Whitland Dyfed, UK) and supervised&#xD;
      by myself at RBH Muscle Lab. The patient sat upright or reclined slightly backwards with the&#xD;
      mat coil wrapped round the body of the quadriceps muscle to be trained, with the foot of the&#xD;
      leg being stimulated positioned in a strap so that the contractions were isometric (Fig.&#xD;
      2.8). The stimulation frequency was 40Hz with a duty cycle of 0.4 (1s on, 4s off). Patients&#xD;
      had three hours continuous rMS (apart from toilet breaks) twice a week over an 8-week period&#xD;
      with at least twenty four hours rest between sessions. At the first session the stimulus&#xD;
      intensity was increased from 22% power to 40% power, and subsequent sessions were at 40%&#xD;
      power as this was the upper limit of what patients could tolerate and the machine could&#xD;
      deliver for the whole session. 40% power generally generated between 10-20% of the patient's&#xD;
      MVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) This was run by a research respiratory physiotherapist at the&#xD;
      Royal Brompton Hospital twice a week with a maximum of three patients per session so training&#xD;
      was closely supervised. Training consisted of a warm-up, then one hour aerobic work with&#xD;
      subjects exercising on a stationery bicycle at a workload that produced 80% of their peak VO2&#xD;
      on a maximal incremental cycle ergometry protocol, on a treadmill, climbing stairs, and a&#xD;
      combination of leg resistance exercises involving leg weights, squats and sit-to-stand&#xD;
      manoeuvres, followed by a cool-down. Attempts were made at each session to increase the&#xD;
      intensity and/or number of repetitions of each exercise. The exercise sheet used by the&#xD;
      supervising physiotherapist to chart achievements is shown in Fig. 2.9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No active treatment (Controls) Controls were asked to continue with their usual activities&#xD;
      and were contacted by telephone two to three times during the 8-week period to minimise&#xD;
      drop-out and to monitor for acute exacerbations of COPD. After study completion, these&#xD;
      patients were enrolled on the PR course at RBH if they wished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-training assessments For the PR and rMS groups, the physiological tests were done four&#xD;
      to five days after the last training session, and three to four days later the biopsies were&#xD;
      taken. Controls were assessed in the same week as the others. The timing was aimed at&#xD;
      minimising group differences from varying delays between the last training session and&#xD;
      testing. Post-training assessments involved all the same tests as the pre-training&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The primary outcomes measures were a) change in quadriceps fibre&#xD;
      proportions and fibre CSA in trained leg versus untrained leg in rMS group and b) change in&#xD;
      quadriceps function in rMS group versus PR group. All statistical analysis was performed&#xD;
      using SPSS (SPSS 15, Chicago, USA). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess group&#xD;
      differences (patients vs controls, trained vs untrained leg, change in trained leg vs change&#xD;
      in untrained leg), Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated to assess&#xD;
      correlations and the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test used to examine differences between pre and&#xD;
      post-training results in both the trained and the untrained leg (data not normally&#xD;
      distributed). An interaction factor was calculated to assess the effect of exacerbation&#xD;
      during the study. A two-tailed p value of ≤0.05 was used to define statistical significance.&#xD;
