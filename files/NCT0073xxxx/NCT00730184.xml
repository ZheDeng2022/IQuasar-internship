  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether adding the basic salt potassium bicarbonate&#xD;
      to the diet will have a positive effect on how dietary protein affects your bone and muscle.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The balance between the amount of protein in the diet (anabolic component) and the net acid&#xD;
      load of the diet (catabolic component) in part determines whether the diet as a whole has a&#xD;
      net anabolic or catabolic effect on bone and muscle. This study will investigate whether the&#xD;
      addition of an alkaline salt of potassium, potassium bicarbonate, will allow dietary protein&#xD;
      to have a more favorable net impact on intermediary indices of bone and muscle conservation&#xD;
      than is observed with protein in the usual acidic environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and postmenopausal women, age 50 and older, will be enrolled in this 42-day study in&#xD;
      order to have 20 completers. Subjects may continue in the study for up to an additional two&#xD;
      weeks should this be necessary for reasons related to intercurrent illness (unrelated to the&#xD;
      research) or scheduling circumstances. Over the first 15 days, subjects will be placed on&#xD;
      gradually increasing doses, up to a maximum of 90 mmol/d of potassium bicarbonate or placebo.&#xD;
      They will remain on this dose for the rest of the study. Subjects will then have two 10-day&#xD;
      metabolic diet cycles each, in random order, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - low protein diet (0.5 g/kg/d) then high protein diet (1.5 g/kg/d) Group 2 - high&#xD;
      protein diet (1.5 g/kg/d) then low protein diet (0.5 g/kg/d)&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 5-day period between the two metabolic diets in which subjects consume their&#xD;
      usual diets but continue to take the study pills.&#xD;
