    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the relative hemodynamic effect of a novel&#xD;
      intravenous formulation of amiodarone (PM101), administered as an immediate IV bolus push,&#xD;
      with placebo and with the currentlyl available formulation of Amiodarone IV, administered as&#xD;
      a 10-minute IV infusion, on systolic arterial pressure.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women &gt;18 years of age at Screening, with a diagnosis of stable congestive&#xD;
             heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NYHA Functional Classification of Heart Failure Class II, III, or IV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented left ventricular ejection fraction â‰¤35% within 6 months before Screening,&#xD;
             provided that the assessment was not within 4 weeks of a myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Outpatient or inpatient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On stable doses of medications to treat congestive heart failure (eg, beta-blockers,&#xD;
             angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor antagonist, diuretic) for&#xD;
             at least 7 days before dosing with trial drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at Screening that shows no clinically&#xD;
             significant abnormalities of rate, rhythm, or conduction (such as high-grade&#xD;
             atrioventricular block, bifascicular or trifascicular block), that would jeopardize&#xD;
             the safety or the ability to accurately measure the arterial pressure of the subject,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to communicate effectively with the trial personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to undergo study related procedures as required by the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequately informed of the nature and risks of the trial and give written informed&#xD;
             consent prior to undergoing any trial-related procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test both at Screening&#xD;
             and at check-in to the trial site before receiving trial drug on Day 1 and must be&#xD;
             using an effective medically acceptable form of birth control for the duration of the&#xD;
             trial (up through the Day 8 follow-up evaluation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergy to amiodarone, Captisol, Amiodarone IV, or any of&#xD;
             its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergy to iodine or radio-opaque dyes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of asthma or other pulmonary disease, thyroid disease (hypo or&#xD;
             hyperthyroidism), hepatitis, or other liver disease that would place the subject at&#xD;
             increased risk from treatment with amiodarone, in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarction within the 30 days before Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Functioning pacemaker at Screening or on Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Amiodarone administration within 7 days before dosing with trial drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiogenic shock, marked sinus bradycardia, or second- or third-degree&#xD;
             atrioventricular block&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any disease or condition that might compromise trial evaluations or place the subject&#xD;
             at increased risk from treatment with amiodarone, in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significantly abnormal laboratory test at Screening or Day 1 that would&#xD;
             place the subject at increased risk from treatment with amiodarone, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding A-ny subject who has received an&#xD;
             investigational drug within 30 days before dosing with trial drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to obtain 3 baseline SAP readings with no more than 5 mm Hg difference among&#xD;
             these readings&#xD;
