    <textblock>
      The concept of starting the patient on early enteral nutrition has been a topic of much&#xD;
      interest and research in the past decade. It is gaining widespread acceptance worldwide as&#xD;
      more and more studies are being conducted proving early enteral nutrition to be more&#xD;
      physiological, to prevent morphologic and functional trauma related alterations of the gut&#xD;
      and to modulate immune and inflammatory responses, and as being less expensive than total&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition. Early enteral nutrition is a major component of the recently introduced&#xD;
      post operative rehabilitative regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early feeding has been shown to reduce the risk of any specific infection, mean length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, anastomotic dehiscence, wound infection, pneumonia, intra abdominal abscesses.&#xD;
      It leads to lower weight loss and early positive nitrogen balance. Hence, overall early&#xD;
      enteral nutrition leads to reduced post operative morbidity and better patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to study and compare the effects of early enteral feeding&#xD;
      with those of conventional management in patients undergoing intestinal anastomosis; the end&#xD;
      points being return of bowel activity, incidence of septic complications, length of hospital&#xD;
      stay, weight loss and post operative morbidity.&#xD;

      Pre operatively, common parameters observed in both study and control groups were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Name&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indication of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre operative features of sepsis (whether present or not) which included temperature,&#xD;
           pulse rate&amp; total leukocyte count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operatively, the patients in the study group were kept nil per orally for the first&#xD;
      forty eight hours. The nasogastric tube was removed on the first post operative day&#xD;
      invariably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After forty eight hours of surgery, subjects were started on sips of clear liquids orally;&#xD;
      the amount was gradually increased as tolerated by the patient. The diet was stepped up to&#xD;
      soft diet and to regular diet. A record was made of abdominal discomfort, pain or distension&#xD;
      if experienced by the subject during feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record was made of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Site of anastomosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of anastomosis ( sutured / stapled )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of removal of nasogastric tube&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of passage of flatus / stools post operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of appearance of bowel sounds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Features of sepsis which included temperature, pulse rate &amp; total leukocyte count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of wound infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight on the fifth day of surgery, at the time of discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group were kept on maintenance intravenous fluids containing dextrose&#xD;
      and saline. Nasogastric tube was removed and feeds were started orally as decided by the&#xD;
      operating surgeon depending on the clinical condition of the patient and presence of bowel&#xD;
      activity. Post operative records were made of the same parameters as in the study group.&#xD;
