      The questioned proposed by this study is one of treatment: &quot;To what extent does simultaneous&#xD;
      BMT (Bilateral Myringotomy with Tympanostomy Tubes), adenoidectomy, and diagnosis/avoidance&#xD;
      of food allergy affect the frequency of recurrent otitis media (ROM) versus the standard&#xD;
      academy approach (tube insertions only) to chronic otitis media with effusion; furthermore,&#xD;
      are adenoids a factor in OME or is food allergy diagnosis and treatment able to significantly&#xD;
      prevent ROM after the tubes fall out?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial seeks to provide evidence that the treatment for Chronic OME in children should&#xD;
      involve surgical procedures (BMT +/- adenoidectomy), as well, as a food allergy work-up and&#xD;
      subsequent avoidance of the offending foods in order to significantly decrease ROM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer this question, a prospective, randomized controlled trial needs to be conducted.&#xD;
      Since a majority of OME patients are from the pediatric population, parental consent must be&#xD;
      obtained. Subjects in our study will initially present to the clinic with otitis media&#xD;
      symptoms and diagnostic tests such as a tympanogram, otoscopy, and history of recurrent&#xD;
      otitis media will be obtained. Once the surgical decision for bilateral myringotomy and&#xD;
      tympanostomy tubes has been made, parents will be informed about the trial. The standard&#xD;
      protocol for children presenting with initial Chronic OME is to perform a BMT. Therefore,&#xD;
      data from the control group (Group 1) will be obtained from faculty ENT who follow the&#xD;
      academy's recommendations. Data from Group 2 and 3 will be collected from other ENT faculty&#xD;
      members, including the faculty co-investigator who will perform the BMT and obtain a food&#xD;
      allergy blood draw at the time of surgery. The study's faculty co-investigator will describe&#xD;
      food avoidance techniques to post-op patients from Groups 2 and 3. Patients with previous&#xD;
      adenotonsillar surgery or placement of tympanostomy tubes will not be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      The incidence of ROM episodes in all trial groups will be recorded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Design: Randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a new approach in the&#xD;
      treatment of children presenting with chronic otitis media with effusion. The new approach&#xD;
      calls for a surgical correction of OME by a BMT (Bilateral Myringotomy with Tympanostomy&#xD;
      Tubes) +/- Adenoidectomy, with additional food allergy diagnosis and subsequent management of&#xD;
      offending foods in order to reduce the frequency of recurrent otitis media (ROM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      End Points: Comparison between groups (1,2,3) on the recurrence of otitis media following&#xD;
      surgery. All trial participants will have follow-up clinic appointments every three months&#xD;
      until tubes fall out and after this point, patients will present to clinic every three months&#xD;
      for one year for evaluation of recurrent middle ear fluid. Questionnaires will be&#xD;
      administered to Groups 2 &amp; 3 at the F/U appointments to evaluate food allergy management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Trial participants will be identified by their otitis media signs and symptoms.&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be asked to participate in the study and&#xD;
      consent will be obtained. Surgery will be performed based on group assignment. All trial&#xD;
      subjects will receive standard post-op care and will also be seen for clinical evaluation q 3&#xD;
      months post-surgery, and then q 3 months after the tubes are out for one year. The number of&#xD;
      otitis media episodes during the follow up year in children assigned to groups 1,2, and 3&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: At the initial clinic visit, potential trial subjects will be asked about their&#xD;
      otitis media history, including how many episodes of OM in the past six months, evidence of&#xD;
      hearing loss, lack of response to antibiotic therapy, prolonged periods of OME, and previous&#xD;
      tympanograms. Pediatric patients will have their tympanic membranes (TM) evaluated by&#xD;
      otoscopy for evidence of OME. Tympanometry will also be performed to confirm the presence of&#xD;
      fluid in the middle ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group (Group 1) will receive the standard academy regimen for&#xD;
      initial presentation of Chronic OME, which is insertion of BMT. Group 2 trial subjects will&#xD;
      receive food allergy testing and management in conjunction with BMT. Group 3 involves BMT&#xD;
      insertion, adenoidectomy, and food allergy testing and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food management involves parental education on how to avoid the specific offending foods by&#xD;
      their allergic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total length of subject participation is variable depending on when the tubes come out.&#xD;
      Once the tubes have fallen out, the patient will be evaluated every three months for one full&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
