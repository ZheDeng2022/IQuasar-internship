  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacteria responsible for skin, bone, and muscle&#xD;
      infections. Recent studies from the United States have suggested that a type of this&#xD;
      bacterium called methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has become dramatically more common,&#xD;
      especially the community strain. However, Canadian data is still largely lacking. This study&#xD;
      aims to determine the prevalence of community acquired (CA) MRSA among patients presenting&#xD;
      with skin and soft tissue infections to the Urgent Care Center and Emergency Departments in&#xD;
      London, Ontario. This will be determined by taking swabs at enrollment from patient's noses,&#xD;
      throats, and sites of infection. Patients will be asked to complete a health questionnaire&#xD;
      with the goal of identifying risk factors associated with CA-MRSA. Through follow-up swabs of&#xD;
      participants' noses and throats at one and three months, the effects of treatment on&#xD;
      patient's carrying MRSA will be determined. Results may be used to form guidelines for&#xD;
      empirical S aureus treatment in the region, reducing possible morbidity and mortality from&#xD;
      delayed or suboptimal treatment of CA-MRSA infections. Improved understanding of risk factors&#xD;
      associated with MRSA infection in a Canadian setting, may also change the practice of&#xD;
      physicians considering empiric antibiotic therapy for skin and soft tissue infections.&#xD;

      Objective &amp; Hypothesis: The objective of this prospective study is to determine the&#xD;
      prevalence of MRSA and community acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) in adult patients (&gt;17yrs old)&#xD;
      presenting with skin or soft tissue infections to the emergency departments (EDs) of an&#xD;
      academic health care setting in London, Ontario. Secondary objectives will include the&#xD;
      identification of demographic and clinical variables associated with MRSA, characterization&#xD;
      of MRSA antimicrobial susceptibilities and genotypes, and determining the effects of&#xD;
      treatment on MRSA colonization. We believe that the prevalence of MRSA and CA-MRSA in London,&#xD;
      Ontario will be lower than rates recently published by academic hospitals from the United&#xD;
      States. The hypothesis of the study is that patients presenting to the Emergency Departments&#xD;
      in London, Ontario with skin and soft tissue infections will have a 10% prevalence of&#xD;
      CA-MRSA, but certainly the prevalence may be much higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: Results from this research may be used as part of the guidelines for empirical S&#xD;
      aureus treatment in the region, thus reducing possible morbidity and mortality from delayed&#xD;
      or suboptimal treatment of CA-MRSA infections. This information, along with an improved&#xD;
      understanding of risk factors associated with MRSA infection in a Canadian setting, has the&#xD;
      potential to change the practice of physicians who are considering empiric antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      for skin and soft tissue infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on the epidemiology of patients with skin or soft tissue infections&#xD;
      presenting to the adult emergency departments (EDs) at the London Health Sciences Centre&#xD;
      (LHSC) and the Urgent Care Center at St. Joseph's Health Centre (SJHC). By using a comparison&#xD;
      group of non CA-MRSA infections, the proportion of CA-MRSA with relation to the total MRSA&#xD;
      and methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in the region will be investigated.&#xD;
      The study will also investigate the risk factors in the CA-MRSA population including:&#xD;
      demographics, housing history, contact with the health care system, past CA-MRSA infection,&#xD;
      asymptomatic CA-MRSA colonization, colonization/infection of close contacts, involvement in&#xD;
      contact sports/team sports, hygienic body shaving, chronic skin disorders, recurrent/recent&#xD;
      antibiotic use, IV drug use, contact with incarcerated individuals, and chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through follow-up visits at one and three months involving nares and throat swabs of patients&#xD;
      initially testing positive for MRSA the effects of treatment on MRSA colonization will be&#xD;
      determined. Furthermore, a follow-up questionnaire will be administered to all patients at&#xD;
      one month to determine complication rates for patients colonized with MRSA versus those not&#xD;
      colonized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current recommendations for antibiotic treatment of unknown S. aureus infection are based&#xD;
      on clinical judgment, and therefore an understanding of regional incidence and susceptibility&#xD;
      of CA-MRSA are essential for empiric treatment. Through the microbiological analysis of the&#xD;
      cases, laboratory parameters and antibiotic susceptibility of CA-MRSA presenting to LHSC will&#xD;
      be established. As well, the clinical characteristics of these patients will be documented to&#xD;
      aid clinicians in recognizing patients presenting with CA-MRSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design: This study will be a prospective prevalence study involving adult&#xD;
      patients (&gt;17years old) with skin and soft-tissue infections presenting to the Emergency&#xD;
      Departments of LHSC (University Hospital and Victoria Hospital) as well as to the Urgent Care&#xD;
      of SJHC. These departments have a combined approximate total of 150,000 visits per year. The&#xD;
      study has an expected enrollment of 152 patients from July 2008- July 2009. The study will&#xD;
      continue until three months after the last patient has been enrolled so that follow-up nasal&#xD;
      and throat swabs may be obtained, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = Z2 P (1-P) / d2 n = 1.962 * .10 (1- .10) / 0.052 n = 3.8416 * .10 * .90 / .0025 n = 138&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the investigators do not anticipate a problem with non-response or missing values, to&#xD;
      take this into consideration, we will over-sample the above sample size by 10%. Therefore, we&#xD;
      will recruit at least 152 patients to the study. Therefore, assuming 80% power, an estimated&#xD;
      prevalence of 10%, and a precision level of 5%, 152 patients are needed to be 95% confident&#xD;
      that the true proportion of MRSA in adult patients (&gt;17yrs old) presenting with skin or soft&#xD;
      tissue infections will be between 5% and 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written, informed consent will be obtained from all patients that meet the study inclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
