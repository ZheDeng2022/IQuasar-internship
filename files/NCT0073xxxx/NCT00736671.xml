      This research study will evaluate functions of memory, thinking, eye movements and walking&#xD;
      and how these relate to the measurement of certain chemicals (acetylcholine and dopamine) in&#xD;
      the brain using an imaging procedure called positron emission tomography (PET). You may know&#xD;
      that the brain chemical dopamine, a &quot;neurotransmitter&quot; substance (a chemical messenger that&#xD;
      nerve cells need to communicate with each other), is important for the brain to control&#xD;
      movements and that the brain chemical acetylcholine may have functions related to mental&#xD;
      concentration and attention. At the present time, the investigators have no clear information&#xD;
      how these two chemicals in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease are related to the&#xD;
      risk of falling.&#xD;

      Although most research in PD has a focus on presynaptic dopaminergic denervation, new lessons&#xD;
      may be learned by exploring to what extent alterations in non-motor and non-dopaminergic&#xD;
      systems may play a role in the balance impairment in this disorder. This project is designed&#xD;
      to evaluate striatal pre-synaptic dopaminergic, cortical, thalamic, and brainstem&#xD;
      cholinergic, cognitive, and oculomotor mechanisms underlying the risk of falling and&#xD;
      imbalance in PD. The proposed study will exploit advances in our center in the development of&#xD;
      dynamic biomathematical modeling of electronic platform data, application of specialized&#xD;
      cognitive and oculomotor assessments, and positron emission tomography (PET). This novel&#xD;
      multi-system approach holds promise for understanding mechanisms of falling in PD beyond&#xD;
      pre-synaptic dopaminergic nigrostriatal denervation.&#xD;

        Patients with Parkinson's disease and normal control persons between the ages of 50-85&#xD;
        years are eligible to participate in this study. Participants should be willing and able to&#xD;
        comply with study requirements. Normal control persons should not have a history of brain&#xD;
        or mental disorders. Both males and females are eligible.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects considered for inclusion will be female or male subjects either currently&#xD;
             enrolled or eligible for care at the VA aged 50-85 years, or community volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The racial, gender and ethnic characteristics of the proposed subjects population&#xD;
             reflect the demographics of the patient population of the VA. However, extra efforts&#xD;
             will be made to recruit women and minorities (see table 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No exclusion criteria shall be based on race, ethnicity, gender, or asymptomatic HIV&#xD;
             status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to stand or walk independently (i.e., patients in Hoehn and Yahr stage IV&#xD;
             and V).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vertiginous disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Orthostatic hypotension or unstable cardiovascular disease at risk of syncope (drop in&#xD;
             systolic blood pressure of &gt; 20 mm Hg upon standing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stroke with focal cortical lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cerebellar, myelopathic or significant radiculopathy syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diminished light perception in both eyes (&lt; 20/40 corrected OU).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intracranial surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have participated in other research protocols such that their cumulative&#xD;
             radiation absorbed dose to whole body, gonads, bone marrow or lens of the eye would&#xD;
             exceed 5 Rem, or dose to other body organs is more than 15 Rem in preceding 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (beta-HCG test within 48 hours of PET study) or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contra-indications to MRI.&#xD;
