             a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the&#xD;
             population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical&#xD;
             Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and&#xD;
             will not interfere with the study procedures. In any case, liver function tests must&#xD;
             be strictly within the normal range at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in&#xD;
             the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or&#xD;

             pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception for at least&#xD;
             4 days following the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the&#xD;
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication through at least 4 days after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt; 50 kg and BMI within the range 18.5 - 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;

             active disease or physical or mental impairment). A subject with a clinical&#xD;
             abnormality may be included only if the Principal Investigator or physician designee&#xD;
             considers that the abnormality will not introduce additional risk factors and will not&#xD;
             interfere with the study procedures. Consultation with the GSK medical monitor is&#xD;
             required before such subjects may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;

             are not eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history or presence of recreational drug abuse or dependence or current abuse as&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK&#xD;
