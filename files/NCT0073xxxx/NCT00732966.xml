      Most Angiotensin receptor blocker's (ARBs) are metabolized by cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9),&#xD;
      one of the major isoforms of the cytochrome P450 in human liver microsome. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate whether CYP2C9 polymorphism has a significant clinical influence on&#xD;
      the blood pressure lowering effect of losartan and valsartan. Weather there is a genetic&#xD;
      importance in choosing the right ARB for the right patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Losartan, the first angiotentsin II receptor blocker (ARB), is known to reduce blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP). The LIFE study, Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality in the Losartan Intervention for&#xD;
      Endpoint Reduction, showed that losartan prevented more cardiovascular morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality than the ÃŸ receptor blocker atenolol. This effect was independent of its BP&#xD;
      lowering effect. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is known to be a cardinal manifestation&#xD;
      of BP and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular complications. In the patient&#xD;
      subgroup of isolated systolic hypertension, losartan was found to reduce cardiovascular and&#xD;
      all cause mortality and to reverse LVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARBs are used for the treatment of hypertension, alone or in combination with other&#xD;
      antihypertensive drugs, such as calcium channel blockers, diuretics or angiotensin I&#xD;
      converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. ACE inhibitors and ARBs may also have an important role&#xD;
      in the prevention of type II diabetes and should be considered first line agents in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients with impaired fasting glucose or metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most ARBs are metabolized by cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9), one of the major isoforms of the&#xD;
      cytochrome P450 in human liver microsome. It converts losartan to its pharmacologically&#xD;
      active metabolite EXP-3174 (E-3174). Other ARBs such as telmisartan and olmesartan are innate&#xD;
      to CYP2C9, whereas candesartan and valsartan are metabolized by it to pharmacologically&#xD;
      inactive metabolites. Maximal concentration of the drug is reached two hours post&#xD;
      administration. Fourteen percent of the orally administered medication is converted to&#xD;
      E-3174, which is 10 to 40 fold more potent than losartan. The pharmacokinetics of losartan&#xD;
      and E-3174 are linear, dose dependent and do not change after repetitive administration. The&#xD;
      CYP2C9 gene has three main polymorphic variations caused by single nucleotide polymorphism;&#xD;
      the most common allele is CYP2C9*1 (Arg144 Ile359), and the two less common CYP2C9*2 (Cys&#xD;
      144Ile359) and CYP2CP*3 (Arg144Leu359) that code for an enzyme with decreased activity. The&#xD;
      oxidation of losartan is decreased 2,3 and 40 fold in individuals genotyped as CYP2C9*1*3,&#xD;
      CYP2C9*2*3 and CYP2C9*3*3 compared to individuals genotyped as CYP2C9*1*1.CYP2C9*3 was found&#xD;
      to influence losartan's metabolism more than does CYP2C9*2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution of CYP2C9 allelic variants within different ethnic groups varies. In&#xD;
      Caucasians the allele frequencies of CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 have been reported to be&#xD;
      0.79-0.86, 0.08-0.135 and 0.03-0.085 respectively, whereas very low frequency of the alleles&#xD;
      CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 have been reported in Asian populations (0 and 0.02-0.05 respectively).&#xD;
      Ashkenazi Jews were found to have similar prevalence of allele polymorphism as North American&#xD;
      Caucasian population (the CYP2C9*1, *2, *3 allele frequencies were 0.772, 0.140 and 0.086,&#xD;
      respectively). Nakai K et al. evaluated the population prevalence of the different alleles in&#xD;
      four different ethnic groups in the Israeli population: Ashkenazi, Moroccan, Libyan and&#xD;
      Yemenite Jews. They found that in the Ashkenazi population, the prevalence of CYP2C9*1,&#xD;
      CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 variants was 0.83, 0.17 and 0.15 respectively, in the Yemenite&#xD;
      population 0.89, 0.1 and 0.15 respectively, in the Moroccan population 0.81, 0.19 and 0.23&#xD;
      respectively and in the Libyan population 0.69, 0.27 and 0.31 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many drugs have been found to be substrates for CYP2C9, including fluoxetine, losartan,&#xD;
      phenytoin, tolbutamide, torsemide, warfarin, and numerous NSAIDs. CYP2C9 activity is&#xD;
      inducible by rifampicin and possibly also by carbamazepine, ethanol and phenobarbitone.&#xD;
      Several drugs have been reported to inhibit CYP2C9 activity in vivo or in vitro, for example:&#xD;
      fluconazole, amiodarone, trimethoprim, fluvastatin, cimetidine and chloramphenicol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An in vitro study demonstrated that the clearance of losartan was reduced significantly in&#xD;
      human liver microsomes obtained from CYP2C9*3*3 and CYP2C9*2*2 homozygous individuals, and&#xD;
      from CYP2C9*3*1 heterozygous individuals but not from CYP2C9*2*1 individuals. In this study,&#xD;
      no clear conclusion could be made regarding the CYP2C9*2*3 genotype. In another study, no&#xD;
      influence of the CYP2C9 polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of losartan or E-3174 was found&#xD;
      after a single oral dose of 50 mg losartan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irbesartan undergoes metabolism through the CYP2C9 to an inactive metabolite. Hallberg P et&#xD;
      al. randomly assigned 115 hypertensive patients to be treated with atenolol or irbesartan.&#xD;
      They found that the CYP2C9 genotype predicted the BP response to irbesartan and had no&#xD;
      influence on the effect of atenolol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether CYP2C9 polymorphism has a significant&#xD;
      clinical influence on the BP lowering effect of losartan and valsartan. Weather there is a&#xD;
      genetic importance in choosing the right ARB for the right patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A screening period will be conducted in which hypertensive patients aged 18 years and over,&#xD;
      will undergo a genetic evaluation for CYP2C9 polymorphism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will sign a written informed consent before their inclusion in the study. No other&#xD;
      change in patients' medication regimen will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective non randomized trial. All patients fulfilling the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria will be treated with losartan 50 mg once daily for one month. After a&#xD;
      wash out period of one week losartan treatment will be replaced with valsartan 160 mg once&#xD;
      daily. Patients will be evaluated at baseline and following losartan and valsartan treatment.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a 24 hour ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline, one months following&#xD;
      losartan treatment and one month following valsartan treatment. Creatinine and Potassium&#xD;
      levels will be measeured at baseline and one week following each drug administration, blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected to measure the losartan/ E-3174 ration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polymerase chain reaction amplification will be preformed with the use of specific primers.&#xD;
      Genotyping of the polymorphic CYP2C9 genes will be made using real time PCR (RT PCR)&#xD;
      technology with Roche light cycler. The procedure is made in a closed system which decreases&#xD;
      the chance for contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Losartan and E-3174 Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The losartan and e-3174 assays will be performed using a reversed phase high performance&#xD;
      liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Hewlett Packard HP-1090 Series II will be used.&#xD;
