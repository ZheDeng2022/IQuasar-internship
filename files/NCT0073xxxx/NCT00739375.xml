  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is an elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) that can be&#xD;
      the result of heart, lung or systemic disease. PHT also complicates chronic hemodialysis (HD)&#xD;
      therapy immediately after the creation of an arteriovenous (AV) access, even before starting&#xD;
      HD therapy. It tends to regress after temporary AV access closure and after successful kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. Affected patients have significantly higher cardiac output. This syndrome is&#xD;
      associated with a statistically significant survival disadvantage. The laboratory hallmark of&#xD;
      this syndrome is reduced basal and stimulatory nitric oxide (NO) levels. It appears that&#xD;
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) acquire endothelial dysfunction that reduces the&#xD;
      ability of their pulmonary vessels to accommodate the AV access-mediated elevated cardiac&#xD;
      output, exacerbating the PHT. Doppler echocardiographic screening of ESRD patients scheduled&#xD;
      for HD therapy for the occurrence of PH is indicated. Early diagnosis enables timely&#xD;
      intervention, currently limited to changing dialysis modality such as peritoneal dialysis or&#xD;
      referring for kidney transplantation.An echocardiographic diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      (PHT) is made when the systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) exceeds normal values (30&#xD;
      mmHg). In mild PHT, PAP values range up to 45 mmHg, in moderate PHT, PAP is between 45 and 65&#xD;
      mmHg, and in severe PHT, PAP values are greater than 65 mmHg. Systolic PAP equals cardiac&#xD;
      output times pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), (i.e., PAP = cardiac output Ã— PVR).&#xD;
      Increased cardiac output by itself does not cause PH because of the enormous capacity of the&#xD;
      pulmonary circulation to accommodate the increase in blood flow. Therefore development of PHT&#xD;
      requires pathologic, marked elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance. The presence of PH&#xD;
      may reflect serious pulmonary vascular disease, which can be progressive and fatal.&#xD;
      Consequently, an accurate diagnosis of the cause of PHT is essential in order to establish an&#xD;
      effective treatment program. Pulmonary hypertension can occur from diverse etiologies. In&#xD;
      1996 we first noted unexplained PH in some long-term hemodialysis (HD) patients during an&#xD;
      epidemiologic study of this disorder (Nakhoul F and Yigla M Rambam Medical Cemter-Haifa). It&#xD;
      was assumed that their PHT was related to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or to long-term HD&#xD;
      therapy via an arteriovenous (AV) access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several potential explanations for the development of PHT in patients with ESRD.&#xD;
      Hormonal and metabolic derangement associated with ESRD might lead to vasoconstriction of&#xD;
      pulmonary vessels and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Values of PAP may be further&#xD;
      increased by high cardiac output resulting from the AV access itself, worsened by commonly&#xD;
      occurring anemia and fluid overload. Despite almost five decades of HD therapy via a&#xD;
      surgically created, often large, hemodynamically significant AV access the long-term impact&#xD;
      of this intervention on the pulmonary circulation has received little attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RD versus AV HD via AV access&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Mechanisms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Elevated Parathyroid hormone&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Metastatic Calcification due to the increase of the calcium-phosphor multiple&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. High cardiac output&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Nitric oxide-endothelin metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A-v Access flow&#xD;
&#xD;
      These observations indicate a role for AV access-mediated elevations in cardiac output in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of PH. The correlation between access flow and PAP values has not yet been&#xD;
      studied. Since patients undergoing HD therapy via AV access had PH that reversed after&#xD;
      successful kidney transplantation and after short AV access compression, we concluded that&#xD;
      both ESRD and AV access-mediated elevated cardiac output are required for the development PH.&#xD;
      From a physiologic point of view, due to the enormous capacity of the pulmonary&#xD;
      microcirculation, increased cardiac output by itself cannot cause PH. It is the inability of&#xD;
      the pulmonary circulation of some ESRD patients to accommodate the AV access-mediated&#xD;
      elevated cardiac output that leads to the development of PH.&#xD;
