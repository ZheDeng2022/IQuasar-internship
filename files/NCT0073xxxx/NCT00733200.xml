      The investigators conducted a prospective study to determine the safety and efficacy of minor&#xD;
      and major hepatectomy selected by predetermined criteria in 138 patients with hilar&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma. In selected patients, minor liver resection was a good treatment.&#xD;

      Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of minor and major hepatectomy selected by&#xD;
      predetermined criteria in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary Background Data: For HC treated with hepatectomy, the extent of liver resection&#xD;
      remains controversial despite extensive studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: From January 2000 to December 2007, we prospectively studied patients who received&#xD;
      surgical treatment for HC. Of the 187 patients who were surgically treated, 138 (73.8%)&#xD;
      underwent resection with a curative intent. Minor hepatectomy was carried out in 93 patients&#xD;
      who had Bismuth-Corlette types I, II and III HC without hepatic artery/portal vein invasion;&#xD;
      and major hepatectomy in 45 patients who had type III HC with hepatic artery/portal vein&#xD;
      invasion, or type IV HC.&#xD;
