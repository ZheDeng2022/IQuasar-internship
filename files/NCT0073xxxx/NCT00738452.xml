    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, paclitaxel, cisplatin, and etoposide, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can find tumor cells and carry tumor-killing&#xD;
      substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving radiation therapy and combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy together before radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of radiolabeled&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody therapy when given after radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy&#xD;
      in treating patients with stages I-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and associated&#xD;
      toxicities of intravenous yttrium-90 (90Y) chimeric T84.66 (cT84.66) anti-carcinoembryonic&#xD;
      antigen (CEA) antibody targeted radiotherapy delivered after carboplatin/paclitaxel or&#xD;
      cisplatin/etoposide and external beam radiotherapy in patients with CEA positive stage III&#xD;
      unresectable or medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To collect data on the biodistribution, clearance and metabolism of&#xD;
      90Y (yttrium-90) and 111In (indium-111) chimeric T84.66 administered intravenously. II. To&#xD;
      collect data on radiation doses to whole body, normal organs, and tumor through serial&#xD;
      nuclear imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      cT84.66.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy 5 days a week for 45&#xD;
      days. Beginning within 24 hours of the start of radiation therapy, patients receive&#xD;
      paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      15, 22, 29, and 36 OR cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 and etoposide IV&#xD;
      over 60 minutes on days 1-5 and 29-33.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY: Beginning 6-10 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy,&#xD;
      patients with stable disease, partial response, or complete response receive a therapeutic&#xD;
      dose of yttrium Y 90 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody cT84.66 IV. Treatment continues in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 6 months&#xD;
