  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT) of dasatinib when combined with protracted, daily temozolomide (TMZ).&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are: To further evaluate the safety and tolerability of dasatinib plus&#xD;
      protracted, daily TMZ; 2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib when administered&#xD;
      with protracted, daily TMZ among recurrent malignant glioma patients who are on and not on&#xD;
      CYP-3A enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs); 3. To evaluate for anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      with this regimen in this patient population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, one-arm phase I dose-escalation study of dasatinib plus&#xD;
      protracted , daily TMZ administered orally on a continuous daily dosing schedule among adult&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or relapsing malignant glioma. The study format includes a classical&#xD;
      &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation design to determine the MTD and DLT of dasatinib plus protracted, daily&#xD;
      TMZ among recurrent malignant glioma patients. Patients will be stratified based on whether&#xD;
      they are receiving EIAED and each stratum will independently dose escalate. Additionally, the&#xD;
      study will characterize the safety, tolerability, biologic activity, and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile of dasatinib when used in combination with protracted, daily TMZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will start treatment on day 1 of cycle 1 with dasatinib. For patients undergoing&#xD;
      dasatinib pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, dasatinib will be administered alone until initial&#xD;
      PK assessments are collected. Protracted TMZ will be initiated after initial dasatinib PK&#xD;
      assessments are collected and will continue to be administered with dasatinib on a continuous&#xD;
      daily dosing schedule. The initial dasatinib PK assessments will be collected over 24 hours&#xD;
      between days 3-7 of cycle 1. Patients not undergoing dasatinib PK collections will begin both&#xD;
      dasatinib and protracted, daily TMZ together on day 1, cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protracted, daily TMZ dose will be 50 mg/mÂ² daily for all patients. The dose level of&#xD;
      dasatinib will be increased in successive cohorts. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will accrue at&#xD;
      each dose level until MTD is defined. Each cohort will consist of a minimum of 3 newly&#xD;
      enrolled patients. Intra-patient dose escalation is not permitted. It is estimated that this&#xD;
      study will enroll a minimum of 30 patients (up to 4 dose levels/stratum; 3 patients/dose&#xD;
      level for levels 1-3 and 6 patients at level 4) and a maximum of 48 patients (6 patients/dose&#xD;
      level; 4 dose levels/stratum). Cohorts may be expanded at any dose level for further&#xD;
      elaboration of safety and pharmacokinetic parameters as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety and efficacy analysis will be conducted on all patient data at the time&#xD;
      all patients who are still receiving study drug will have completed at least 4 cycles of&#xD;
      treatment. The additional data for any patients continuing to receive study drug past this&#xD;
      time, as allowed by the protocol, will be further summarized in a report once these patients&#xD;
      either completed or discontinued the study. Prior to the primary analysis, an additional&#xD;
      safety report may be prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia (loss of appetite), fluid&#xD;
      retention, fatigue, headache, rash, hypocalcemia (low calcium level), and decreases in blood&#xD;
      counts. Other possible side effects may include nausea, joint pain, muscle aches, generalized&#xD;
      pain, abdominal pain, and fever. Rare side effects may include QTc prolongation (heart beat&#xD;
      changes), pulmonary edema (fluid around the lungs), difficulty breathing, cough, hemorrhage,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, cardiac effusion (fluid in the sac surrounding the&#xD;
      heart), and cardiac failure. Temodar has been well tolerated by both adults and children with&#xD;
      the most common toxicity being mild myelosuppression. Other, less likely, potential&#xD;
      toxicities include nausea and vomiting, constipation, headache, alopecia, rash, burning&#xD;
      sensation of skin, esophagitis, pain, diarrhea, lethargy, hepatotoxicity, anorexia, fatigue&#xD;
      and hyperglycemia. As in the case with many anti-cancer drugs, Temodar may be carcinogenic.&#xD;
      Rats given Temodar have developed breast cancer.&#xD;

             or if other primary malignancy is a basal cell skin cancer or a cervical carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ. Existence of any other malignant disease is not allowed;&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Patient unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol including ability to&#xD;
             swallow whole pills or presence of any malabsorption syndrome;&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia if it cannot be corrected;&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Concomitant Medications, consider the following prohibitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Drugs that are generally accepted to have a risk of causing Torsades de Pointes&#xD;
                  including: (Patients must discontinue drug 7 days prior to starting dasatinib)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. erythromycin, clarithromycin&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, pimozide&#xD;
&#xD;
                    5. cisapride, bepridil, droperidol, methadone, arsenic, chloroquine,&#xD;
                       domperidone, halofantrine, levomethadyl, pentamidine, sparfloxacin,&#xD;
                       lidoflazine.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Drugs that reduce dasatinib exposure such as H2 blockers or proton-pump&#xD;
                  inhibitors (eg famotidine and omeprazole), which can cause long-term suppression&#xD;
                  of gastric acid secretion. The concomitant use of H2 blockers or proton pump&#xD;
                  inhibitors with dasatinib is in general not recommended and antacids should be&#xD;
                  considered in place of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors in patients&#xD;
                  receiving dasatinib therapy. However, given that nearly all recurrent malignant&#xD;
                  brain tumor patients are on dexamethasone for increased intracranial pressure,&#xD;
                  such patients must also receive effective medical therapy to prevent&#xD;
                  complications related to increased gastric acid secretion due to chronic&#xD;
                  dexamethasone therapy. Therefore all patients enrolled on the current protocol&#xD;
                  will receive standard H2 blocker (preferred) or proton pump inhibitor (PPI)&#xD;
                  therapy to be administered on a daily basis each evening. Dasatinib will be&#xD;
                  administered each morning in order to maximize the time interval from&#xD;
                  administered H2 blocker (preferred) or proton pump inhibitor (PPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Drugs that cause hypocalcemia (i.e. IV bisphosphonates will be withheld for the&#xD;
                  first 8 weeks of dasatinib therapy due to risk of hypocalcemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Any prohibited CYP3A4 inhibitors; 22. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily&#xD;
                  detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either a psychiatric or&#xD;
                  physical (e.g., infectious) illness.&#xD;
