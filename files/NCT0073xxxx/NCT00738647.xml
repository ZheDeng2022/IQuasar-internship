      Evaluation of a new resin-based composite material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amalgam and composite are the most commonly used restorative materials in dentistry. Due to&#xD;
      the toxicity of mercury and the subsequent environmental problems, the search for&#xD;
      alternatives continues and search into new composite restorative materials intensifies. The&#xD;
      presently available composites have improved, but shrinkage of the composite during the&#xD;
      curing procedure is still a clinical problem. A new composite restorative material has among&#xD;
      other advantages demonstrated lower shrinkage in laboratory studies, due to a new formulation&#xD;
      of the material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to study the clinical performance of this new composite compared to a&#xD;
      commonly used composite restoration material. 72 patients (158 teeth) are allocated to the&#xD;
      project which is carried out at the School of dentistry, University of Aarhus, Denmark.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project aims to study the clinical performance of a new composite restoration material&#xD;
      (Filtek Silorane®) compared to a conventional composite restoration material (Ceram X®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amalgam and composite are the most commonly used restorative materials, with the number of&#xD;
      composite restorations increasing over the past 20 years. Composite restorative materials&#xD;
      have improved considerably over the years. They have almost reached the same resistance to&#xD;
      wear as amalgam, and are as a consequence now also used for molar restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main reasons for replacing composite restorations are fractures and caries associated&#xD;
      with the restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce the risk of caries a new composite material Filtek Silorane® with reduced&#xD;
      polymerization shrinkage has been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive laboratory studies have been performed on the new material, but the clinical&#xD;
      attributes have yet to be disclosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out as a randomized, double blinded, longitudinal study, with&#xD;
      assessment of the restorations after one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project includes 72 patients, 158 teeth. Most of the patients have been recruited from&#xD;
      the Treatment Planning Clinic at the dental school in Aarhus. After giving their consent to&#xD;
      take part in the study, the teeth are randomized into two treatment groups. Multi surface&#xD;
      restorations of both upper and lower molars and premolars are performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment procedure is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are offered local anesthetic before treatment start. The cavity is excavated and&#xD;
      filled according to the guidelines for composite restorations. An impression of the cavity is&#xD;
      taken before and after it has been filled. After treatment bw-radiographs are taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control procedure is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restoration is evaluated according to marginal adaptation, cavo surface marginal&#xD;
      discoloration, approximal contact, fractures, caries associated with restorations and&#xD;
      postoperative hypersensitivity. The controls will take place after three weeks and one year.&#xD;
