    <textblock>
      PX-12 (1-methylpropyl 2-imidazolyl disulfide) is a novel small molecule inhibitor of&#xD;
      thioredoxin-1, a small protein over-expressed in many human cancers that is associated with&#xD;
      aggressive tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. This study is being&#xD;
      conducted to determine the maximally tolerated dose of PX-12 delivered as a 72-hour infusion&#xD;
      over days 1, 2, and 3 of a 21-day cycle in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic cancer or lymphoma whose tumors are refractory to standard therapy or for&#xD;
             whom no standard therapy is available that increases survival by at least three&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Men and women at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A predicted life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG performance status of 0-2 .&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have discontinued previous anticancer therapy and/or other&#xD;
             investigational agents at least three weeks prior to treatment with PX-12 (six weeks&#xD;
             for mitomycin C and nitrosureas) and recovered (grade 1 or less) from the toxic&#xD;
             effects of that treatment. In the case of oral agents with a short half life, on a&#xD;
             case by case basis, a minimum of a two week interval may be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have discontinued any radiation therapy at least four weeks prior to&#xD;
             treatment with PX-12 and have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities.&#xD;
             Palliative radiation of 10 fractions or less is permitted and a four week interval is&#xD;
             not necessary (also allowed during therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient has adequate hematologic function as defined by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             platelets &gt;100,000/μL; hemoglobin &gt;9 g/dL (may be transfused to this level); ANC &gt;&#xD;
             1,500 cells/μL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient has adequate hepatic function as defined by the following: bilirubin &lt;2.0&#xD;
             mg/dL;aspartate aminotransaminase (AST/SGOT) &amp; alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT)&#xD;
             &lt;2.5 times (or up to five ULN for patients with liver metastases) institutional upper&#xD;
             limit of normal (ULN). International Normalized Ratio (INR) and activated partial&#xD;
             thromboplastin time (aPTT) within 1.5 times ULN unless subject is on coumadin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient has adequate renal function as defined by serum creatinine level&#xD;
&#xD;
             ≤ 1.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient has signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient is compliant with the study and in geographic proximity to allow adequate&#xD;
             follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Childbearing potential will be defined as women who have had menses&#xD;
             within the past 12 months, who have not had tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating in&#xD;
             this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with symptomatic pulmonary disease, e.g., active chronic&#xD;
             obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease, asthma, evidence of interstitial&#xD;
             pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with history of dyspnea, dyspnea on exertion, or paroxysmal nocturnal&#xD;
             dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients that meet the Medicare criteria for receiving home oxygen or are on oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a history of prior lung radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with any active infection requiring i.v. antibiotics at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any serious concomitant systemic disorders that in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             would place the patient at excessive or unacceptable risk of toxicity.&#xD;

             ability of the patient to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known or suspected brain metastases that have not received adequate therapy. In the&#xD;
             case of previously treated brain metastases, a minimum of four weeks interval between&#xD;
             completion of radiation therapy and registration on study with radiologic evidence of&#xD;
             stable or responding brain metastases is required. In the setting of previous CNS&#xD;
             metastasectomy, adequate (minimum four week) recovery from surgery and/or radiation&#xD;
             therapy should be documented.&#xD;

          9. Major surgery within four weeks of treatment with PX-12.&#xD;
&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients who are breastfeeding or pregnant (confirmed by serum β-HCG within 10 days&#xD;
