      This study is a pharmacokinetic study designed to evaluate the effect of food on the oral&#xD;
      bioavailability and effect of diurnal variation on the pharmacokinetics of ABT-869.&#xD;
      Triplicate ECG performed to determine the effect of ABT-869 on QT prolongation . Subjects may&#xD;
      continue receiving linifanib after completion of the study.&#xD;
