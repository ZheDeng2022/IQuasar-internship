  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed&#xD;
      into the bloodstream, distributed in the body and eliminated from the body) after a single&#xD;
      dose and after repeated administration of TMC278 administered once daily for 11 days in&#xD;
      subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (impaired liver function), compared with&#xD;
      healthy control subjects. Furthermore the short-term safety and tolerability (how well the&#xD;
      body tolerates the drug) of TMC278 will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are routinely being treated with&#xD;
      combinations of 3 or 4 drugs (highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]), to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of viral resistance development. Development of new potent antiretroviral (ARV) drugs is&#xD;
      urgently needed to prolong suppression of viral replication in subjects infected with HIV.&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, open-label, parallel, controlled, sequential study to investigate the&#xD;
      single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics, and short-term safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      TMC278 in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal&#xD;
      hepatic function. The trial aims to provide guidance on administration and dose&#xD;
      recommendations of TMC278 in subjects with mildly or moderately impaired hepatic function.&#xD;
      The study population will consist of a total of 32 male and female subjects between 18 and 65&#xD;
      years. Panel A will consist of 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment and 8 healthy subjects&#xD;
      matched for sex, age (± 5 yrs), and BMI (± 15%). Panel B will consist of 8 subjects with&#xD;
      moderate hepatic impairment and 8 healthy subjects matched for sex, age (± 5 yrs), and BMI (±&#xD;
      15%). Treatment in Panel A and Panel B will be conducted sequentially. Subjects in Panel A&#xD;
      will receive a TMC278 25 mg tablet once daily for a total of 11 days. Recruitment for&#xD;
      subjects for Panel B will start after evaluation of the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data from subjects in Panel A. The anticipated dose of TMC278 to be&#xD;
      administered to subjects in Panel B is the same dose as for Panel A (25 mg once daily for 11&#xD;
      days), but this dose might be adjusted depending on the results of Panel A.&#xD;
