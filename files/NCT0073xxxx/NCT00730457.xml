      µg, 5 µg and 8 µg of STF2.HA1 (SI) (VAX125) to be given on Day 0&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Intramuscular (i.m.) vaccination of a single dose of placebo or one of two dose&#xD;
      levels of STF2.HA1 (SI) (VAX125) (optimum dose levels to be determined from the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity data from Part I of this study) to be given on Day 0&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I Primary: To assess the safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of the VAX125 vaccine&#xD;
      delivered i.m. in a single dose regimen of dose levels of 0.1 µg, 0.3 µg, 1 µg, 2 µg, 3 µg, 5&#xD;
      µg, and 8 µg in healthy adults 18 - 49 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To assess the immunogenicity of the VAX125 vaccine delivered i.m. in a single dose&#xD;
      regimen at dose levels of 0.1 µg, 0.3 µg, 1 µg, 2 µg, 3 µg, 5 µg, and 8 µg, for inducing a&#xD;
      post-vaccination serum HAI antibody response in healthy adults against the influenza A virus&#xD;
      H1 HA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II Primary: To assess the safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of a single dose of&#xD;
      the VAX125 vaccine delivered i.m. in one of two dose levels as compared to placebo, (optimum&#xD;
      dose levels to be determined from the safety and immunogenicity data from Part I of this&#xD;
      study), in healthy adults 18- 49 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To assess the immunogenicity of a single dose the VAX125 vaccine delivered i.m. in&#xD;
      one of two dose levels as compared to placebo (optimum dose levels to be determined from the&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity data from Part I of this study) for inducing a post-vaccination&#xD;
      serum HAI antibody response in healthy adults against the influenza A virus H1 HA antigen.&#xD;

             with a minor illness, such as diarrhea, or mild upper respiratory tract infection with&#xD;
