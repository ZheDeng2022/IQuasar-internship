  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nexagon™ is a novel compound that promotes wound healing by temporarily disrupting cellular&#xD;
      communication at the wound site, thereby promoting accelerated healing, reducing inflammation&#xD;
      and pain. This randomized double-blind study will assess the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      clinical effect of Nexagon™ when applied to skin wounds created by punch biopsy in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. 43 healthy, fair-skinned males and females between ages 18-40 will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Subjects will be reviewed again at 3 months and 9 months for follow-up safety assessments and&#xD;
      wound appearance evaluation.&#xD;
