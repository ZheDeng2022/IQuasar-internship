  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The traditional way of doing a donor transplant is to give high doses of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation before giving the stem cells. However, high doses of chemotherapy and radiation can&#xD;
      have serious side-effects. The doctors think that the transplant will be safer and more&#xD;
      likely to be successful with reduced doses of chemotherapy and radiation. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to find out how good a combination of chemotherapy and radiation at reduced doses&#xD;
      followed by a cord blood transplant are at treating cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stem cells chosen for the transplant are from umbilical cord blood. Umbilical cord blood&#xD;
      is collected from healthy newborn babies and frozen. One cord blood collection is called a&#xD;
      &quot;cord blood unit.&quot; On transplant day, the cord blood will be given through the catheter just&#xD;
      like a blood transfusion. Transplants done this way have been successful. However, this type&#xD;
      of transplant is fairly new. Therefore, it is important to study it so the doctors can better&#xD;
      understand how it works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most blood or bone marrow transplants using donor stem cells are done as part of a study.&#xD;
      When patients are on a study we test new ways of treating them which we think may be better&#xD;
      than the old ways. We collect information about the result of this treatment so we can&#xD;
      understand how well the treatment works. This is so we can learn better ways to treat our&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>There are three chemotherapy drugs involved. They are called fludarabine (5 doses), cyclophosphamide (1 dose), and thiotepa (2 doses). Also two days of radiation therapy. This is called Total Body Irradiation or TBI. The TBI if given for two days before, the transplant. On transplant day, the cord blood cells will be given through a catheter. The immune suppressing drugs given are called cyclosporine-A (CSA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). These will be started 3 days before the transplant and will be given through the catheter. Later they can be given as tablets.</description>
