      This is a single-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Vyvanse™ and provide&#xD;
      pilot data in two areas: (1) on the use of Near-Infrared Spectroscopy to detect medication&#xD;
      effects in children with ADHD; and (2) on the influence of Vyvanse ™ on reading fluency and&#xD;
      comprehension over a period of approximately 6 weeks. Subjects will be between the ages of 6&#xD;
      and 12 at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of periods detailed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Washout. Subjects will be screened up to four weeks prior to baseline. The&#xD;
      washout period will be 3 days for most ADHD stimulant medication (the half life is around 3-5&#xD;
      hours and the washout is at least 5 half-lives in duration). Other medication will be&#xD;
      discussed during the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Screening Visit will occur at the UCI Child Development Center and will allow for the&#xD;
      determination of appropriateness of each subject's inclusion into the study. The Principal&#xD;
      Investigator or his/her designee must obtain written signed and dated consent for the subject&#xD;
      to participate in the study from the subject's parent(s)/legally authorized representative&#xD;
      and assent must be given by the subject, prior to any study related procedures being&#xD;
      performed. This visit is expected to last 3-4 hours and may take place across more than one&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be conducted during the Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed Consent/Assent obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric evaluation that utilizes the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and&#xD;
           Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) and according to DSM-IV-TR™&#xD;
           criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion/Exclusion criteria confirmed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and Medication History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Examination including height (using a calibrated stadiometer), weight (using a&#xD;
           calibrated scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sitting Vital Signs after 5 minutes of rest (oral or tympanic temperature, pulse, blood&#xD;
           pressure, and respiratory rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-Lead ECG after 5 minutes of rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test 2 (KBIT2): used to assess both verbal and non-verbal&#xD;
           cognitive ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant Medications reviewed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events reviewed&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the subject will be asked to give a small blood sample, for safety screening&#xD;
      purposes, for laboratory procedures (approximately 2 teaspoons).The following lab procedures&#xD;
      will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematology with complete blood count (CBC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum Chemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinalysis and microscopic examination (if protein and/or blood are detected during&#xD;
           urinalysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum Pregnancy Test for all FOCP - A negative serum pregnancy test must be documented&#xD;
           for inclusion into this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine drug test Baseline Procedures. After all Screening and washout procedures have&#xD;
           been completed, subjects will return to the site for the Baseline Visit, which will last&#xD;
           approximately 5-6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be provided with a one-week supply of VyvanseTM 30mg/day. Subjects will begin&#xD;
      treatment the morning of the baseline visit and continue on the same dose for the next week.&#xD;
      The first dose of medication will be administered on site and subsequent dosing will be given&#xD;
      to the subject's parent(s)/legally authorized representative who will be required to&#xD;
      administer study drug to the subject upon awakening. During the visit subjects will perform&#xD;
      the Attention Task while the NIRS is recording and they will also be given the Gray's Oral&#xD;
      Reading Test before the medication is administered. After the medication is administered the&#xD;
      subject will stay on site until the second NIRS measurement can be taken a second time. They&#xD;
      will be provided food and activities during the waiting period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be conducted during the Baseline Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of continued eligibility (i.e., with respect to inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria and medication history)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sitting Vital Signs (oral or tympanic temperature, pulse, blood pressure and respiratory&#xD;
           rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV-Parent: Investigator&#xD;
           Administered and Scored (ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv): The primary efficacy measure, used to&#xD;
           assess the 18 symptoms of ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale (CGI-S): This measure is used to assess the&#xD;
           severity of the subject's symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant Medications will be reviewed with the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication administered on-site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Near Infrared Spectroscopy and Attention Task performed twice, once at before medication&#xD;
           and again 3-4 hours after first exposure to medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administer the Gray Oral Reading Test-4 (GORT-4), which used to test oral reading rate,&#xD;
           accuracy, fluency, and comprehension, before exposure to medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distribute Open-Label Study Drug - A one-week supply of VyvanseTM 30mg capsules will be&#xD;
           dispensed, including the dose administered on site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Optimization. During the dose optimization period, subjects will visit the office once&#xD;
      per week so that the study doctor can determine if the subject is tolerating the study&#xD;
      medication and if she/he is seeing any benefit. These visits will last approximately 45&#xD;
      minutes. The Investigator will review AEs, ADHD-RS-IV, and CGI-I scores, and use clinical&#xD;
      judgment to ensure that subjects are titrated to an acceptable dose of VyvanseTM for&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be conducted at each dose optimization visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sitting Vital Signs (oral or tympanic temperature, pulse, blood pressure and respiratory&#xD;
           rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject Weight (using a calibrated scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator Dose Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ADHD-RS-IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Global Impressions Improvement Scale (CGI-I).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Drug Accountability and Compliance Assessment Performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distribute Open-Label Study Drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events Dose Optimized NIRS and GORT Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit will be similar to the baseline visit. Subjects will arrive early in the morning&#xD;
      and medication will be administered on-site. They will remain on site for the next 4 hours so&#xD;
      that the dose will be at peak effect before administering the GORT or NIRS. The following&#xD;
      procedures will happen during this visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sitting Vital Signs after 5 minutes of rest (oral and tympanic temperature, pulse, blood&#xD;
           pressure and respiratory rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject weight (using a calibrated scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An electrocardiogram will be performed.&#xD;

        <title>Gray Oral Reading Rest, Fourth Edition (GORT-4)</title>
        <description>The GORT-4 evaluates oral reading rate, accuracy and comprehension. Both Forms A and B were used.Half of the subjects randomly were tested on From A at baseline and the other half were tested with Form B.&#xD;
The GORT-4 is a standardized measure/test. Scores provided are standard scores, which range from 1 to 20, with a Mean of 10 and Standard Deviation of 3. A higher score means better reading performance. There was no total score used or calculated in this study.</description>
