      RATIONALE: A step-by-step procedure may help health care practitioners diagnose and treat&#xD;
      cancer patients with bowel injury symptoms caused by radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the care of cancer patients with bowel&#xD;
      injury caused by radiation therapy to the pelvis.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To undertake a systematic review of the published effectiveness of investigations and&#xD;
           treatments for patients with radiation-induced bowel injury after pelvic radiotherapy&#xD;
           for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a diagnostic and treatment algorithm (based on evidence [where available] or&#xD;
           on expert opinion [where there is no evidence]) for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine each test in the algorithm for its usefulness in establishing precise&#xD;
           diagnoses for these patients within the context of a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine whether use of the treatment algorithm in delivering treatment specifically&#xD;
           targeted for each diagnosis improves symptoms and quality of life of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate whether the same level of care can be delivered to these patients by a&#xD;
           nurse practitioner or by a specialist consultant gastroenterologist following the same&#xD;
           algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify other symptoms and healthcare needs experienced by these patients after&#xD;
           pelvic radiotherapy and whether there are any other unmet needs in addition to their&#xD;
           bowel injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the cost-effectiveness of the investigations and treatments developed for&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a two-part, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: Researchers develop a diagnostic and treatment algorithm to guide health care&#xD;
           practitioners in the management of patients with radiation-induced bowel injury. The&#xD;
           algorithm, which is based on a systematic literature review or expert opinion, uses a&#xD;
           series of simple tests to establish specific diagnoses and to target treatment for&#xD;
           managing patient symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2: Patients are stratified according to tumor site (urological vs gynecological vs&#xD;
           gastrointestinal) and degree of bowel dysfunction as measured by IBDQ-B score &gt; 10&#xD;
           points above normal [&lt; 60 vs 60-70]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 intervention&#xD;
           arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm I (usual care): Patients receive an advice booklet on self-management of bowel&#xD;
                symptoms. Patients whose symptoms continue 6 months after study enrollment may&#xD;
                cross over to arm II.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm II: Patients undergo diagnostic and treatment algorithm-led management of bowel&#xD;
                symptoms by a gastroenterologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm III: Patients undergo diagnostic and treatment algorithm-led management of&#xD;
                bowel symptoms by a nurse practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete questionnaires about bowel symptoms and other pelvic symptoms, quality of&#xD;
      life, and anxiety and depression at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year. Patients also complete&#xD;
      questionnaires about cost effectiveness of the diagnostic and treatment algorithm or usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
