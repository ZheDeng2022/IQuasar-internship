  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an uncommon dermatosis that consists of nodules and pustules&#xD;
      that ulcerate. PG can occur anywhere on the body. Lesions often progress in size and may be&#xD;
      multiple. There is no universally accepted treatment for PG. In mild disease, therapy&#xD;
      consists of local wound care and topical or intralesional corticosteroids. For more severe&#xD;
      disease, systemic agents are necessary. Systemic corticosteroids are often effective, but&#xD;
      large doses are required leading to serious long-term side effects. Other immunosuppressives&#xD;
      have been reported to be successful in individual case reports and small case series.&#xD;
      However, they too are associated with significant toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infliximab is an antibody directed against TNF-α. It had been used in success for treatment&#xD;
      of PG. Adalimumab (Humira) is a fully human antibody directed against TNF-α. Given that&#xD;
      adalimumab has the same target as infliximab, one would expect that adalimumab may also be&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of PG. Treatment with adalimumab may be advantageous over&#xD;
      infliximab because it can be given at home, whereas infliximab is delivered intravenously in&#xD;
      the office. Additionally, because adalimumab is fully human, patients would be less likely to&#xD;
      form antibodies against the medication. Purpose of this study is to determine the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of Humira in the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum.&#xD;
