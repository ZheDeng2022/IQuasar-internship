      phase 2 study. Target disease: Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational and relevance to IBD patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copaxone is known for its high safety profile and for acting as an effective immunomodulatory&#xD;
      agent for the treatment of MS. . In experimental models of IBD, a beneficial effect of&#xD;
      Copaxone was demonstrated where significant amelioration of macroscopic colonic damage,&#xD;
      preservation of the microscopic colonic structure, reduced weight loss, and improved&#xD;
      long-term survival in treated compared with untreated mice was demonstrated. In addition,&#xD;
      Copaxone suppressed the proliferation of local mesenteric lymphocytes to syngeneic colon&#xD;
      extract, significantly reduced the overall secretion of TNF-α and induced the secretion of&#xD;
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. The ability of Copaxone to effectively modulate the&#xD;
      clinical manifestations and the detrimental immune response involved in experimental colitis,&#xD;
      together with its high safety profile support its potential effect as a new treatment for CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: patients with moderately active Crohn's disease as indicated by a CDAI 220 - 450,&#xD;
      whose diagnosis was done more than 3 months before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives: to test the efficacy and safety of Copaxone in CD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This will be a single center, randomized, double blind placebo controlled phase&#xD;
      2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed for study eligibility 1 to 2 weeks prior to baseline Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled into the study after signing an informed consent form and allocated&#xD;
      in a 1.5:1 ratio to receive either Copaxone or placebo. A total of 50 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subcutaneous injections (Copaxone or Placebo) will be administered daily through week 12.&#xD;
      Patient assessment of safety and efficacy will be made at weeks 0,4,8,12 and 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 12 non-responders would be offered an open label arm with daily Copaxone 20mg for the&#xD;
      next 12 weeks&#xD;

      Data evaluation: Evidence of therapeutic benefit and safety will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      following assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crohn's disease activity will be assessed by components of the CDAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mucosal healing will be assessed by VCE (data will be quantitated using the Lewis&#xD;
           score). Patients requiring colonoscopy according to Physicians decision would also be&#xD;
           offered to participate in an endoscopic mucosal healing evaluation substudy. Patients&#xD;
           participating will undergo colonoscopy and biopsies at the beginning (screening±1 week)&#xD;
           and the end (week 12±1 week) of the treatment period. Endoscopic damage will be assessed&#xD;
           using the CDEIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean (median) doses of corticosteroids and the average total aggregate dose of&#xD;
           corticosteroids received per patient during the trial will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life will be assessed by components of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease&#xD;
           Questionnaire(IBDQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AE incidence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical laboratory values&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability and Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events, dropout rate will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of subjects who prematurely discontinue the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of subjects who prematurely discontinue the study due to Aes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to premature discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to premature discontinuation due to Aes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunologic assessment (including lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion assays)&#xD;
      will be performed at the baseline visit as well as weeks 4 and 12 and 16. Serum samples for&#xD;
      cytokine studies 24 hours after first injection would also be collected.&#xD;
