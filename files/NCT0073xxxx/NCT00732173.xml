      RATIONALE: Participating in a diet and exercise program may improve the quality of life of&#xD;
      overweight and obese patients who are in remission from endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying an exercise and healthy diet program to&#xD;
      see how well it works compared with standard care in patients in remission from stage I or&#xD;
      stage II endometrial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * To reduce morbidity and early mortality in endometrial cancer (EC) survivors through&#xD;
      obesity management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To expand and refine a previous pilot study of a behavioral, lifestyle-change education&#xD;
           intervention for use in overweight and obese patients in remission from endometrial&#xD;
           carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the potential effects and variation of each regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore potential mediators (self-efficacy, depression) and moderators (body mass&#xD;
           index) of healthful dietary and exercise behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate neuronal response to high-versus-low calorie visual food stimuli under&#xD;
           fasted (hunger) and fed (satiated) states in brain regions of interest (hypothalamus,&#xD;
           lateral orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum, insula) using blood oxygenation level&#xD;
           dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after a&#xD;
           lifestyle (diet and exercise counseling) intervention or usual care in obese EC&#xD;
           patients. We will also compare the neuronal responses in obese EC patients to those from&#xD;
           normal weight subjects without cancer being seen at the same gynecologic clinic; and,&#xD;
           explore modification of the neuronal signals by candidate genes and serum biomarkers in&#xD;
           the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis, serotonergic and inflammatory pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to body mass index (25.0-39.9 vs ≥ 40) and&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive a lifestyle intervention, &quot;Survivors of Uterine Cancer Empowered&#xD;
           by Exercise and Healthy Diet (SUCCEED)&quot;, on a group and individual basis consisting of&#xD;
           nutrition, exercise, and behavioral modification counseling from a physician,&#xD;
           psychologist, registered dietitian, and physical therapist. Sixteen group sessions will&#xD;
           be conducted (10 weekly, 6 bi-weekly) for 6 months. Weight and body mass index,&#xD;
           satisfaction with study treatment, and exercise/activity logs are assessed weekly and&#xD;
           biweekly. Patients receive additional feedback and support during the weeks not met in a&#xD;
           group, including newsletters and telephone and e-mail contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (control): Patients receive usual care informational brochures, but no lifestyle&#xD;
           counseling, related to weight loss, physical activity, and nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo physician counseling sessions at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients&#xD;
      are assessed by weight, anthropometric measures, and body mass index; biomarkers; body&#xD;
      composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry/densitometry (DEXA); co-morbidities by the&#xD;
      Charlson co-morbidity score; depression by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); eating&#xD;
      patterns by the Three-Factor Eating Inventory (EI); exercise/physical activity by Leisure&#xD;
      Score Index (LSI) and pedometer step count; nutrient intake by 24-hour recall; quality of&#xD;
      life by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and Short-form Medical&#xD;
      Outcomes (SF-36); and self-efficacy by the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ) and the Weight&#xD;
      Efficacy Life-Style (WEL).&#xD;

    <measure>Weight change</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis will be carried out by fitting a mixed model. Weight change will be expressed in terms of absolute and relative weight change. In addition, percent weight change will be calculated. To test the null hypotheses that the groups do not differ in terms of change in weight at 6 or 12 months, parameter estimates from the model will be used to construct subsequent t-test that the difference in means at 3, 6, or 12 months is zero.</description>

    <measure>Quantitative and qualitative nutrient intake</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>24 hour dietary recalls will be conducted using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 5 Step Multiple Pass Method. Information about dietary supplement use will also be obtained. Food intake will be entered into Nutritionist Pro. Fruit/vegetable intake will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) All-Day Fruit and Vegetable Screener, which has 10 questions which assess intake of fruits and vegetables during the previous month. A mixed modeling approach will be used.</description>

Average frequency of milk, moderate, and strenuous exercise during a typical week are assessed. Duration in minutes of activity along with specific questions regarding walking are included. Complete 7-day pedometer step test at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. A mixed modeling approach will be used.</description>

    <time_frame>at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Serum biomarkers analyzed for changes along with weight to help track effectiveness of the intervention. Risk factors of metabolic syndrome: low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), serum triglycerides, and fasting glucose. Plasma carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin) and lycopene concentrations for changes in fruit and vegetable intake. Sub-Study, serum for appetite-related hormones and inflammatory cytokines: leptin, insulin, adiponectin, resistin, IGF-1, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, glucagon, GLP-1 active, and thyroid hormones.</description>

    <description>Self-Efficacy Questionnaire: Physical Activities, an 8 item measure of respondents' perception of the degree to which they feel able to make changes in their physical activity level. Weight Efficacy Life-Style (WEL) questionnaire, 20 questions in 5 situational factors, where subjects rate their ability to successfully resist the desire to eat using a 10-point scale. Methodology of Baron and Kenny used to test for mediating effect of self-efficacy.
