  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis of this study is that subtle interactions between structural&#xD;
      (substrate) and functional (trigger) abnormalities of the heart, some of which are&#xD;
      genetically-determined, can be used to identify patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death&#xD;
      (SCD). Such information may be used to better define patients most likely to benefit from&#xD;
      replacement of an internal defibrillator (ICD). The prospective, observational study to&#xD;
      enroll, categorize and follow patients who receive an ICD pulse generator replacement for&#xD;
      primary prevention of SCD (PROSe-ICD) was established to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to gain a better understanding of the biological mechanisms that predispose to SCD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to develop readily determined clinical, electrocardiographic, genetic and blood protein&#xD;
           markers identify patients with an increased risk of dying suddenly&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PROSe-ICD is a multicenter prospective cohort study of patients who undergo ICD implantation&#xD;
      for primary prevention of SCD, designed to compare patients who sustain SCD (as measured by&#xD;
      an appropriate ICD firing for rapid VT or VF) to those who do not. The cohort for this&#xD;
      observational study consists of patients with cardiomyopathy who have an ICD implanted for&#xD;
      primary SCD prevention according to recent trials (MADIT II, SCD-HeFT, DEFINITE) and practice&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed longitudinally for clinical, ECG, genomic and proteomic markers and for&#xD;
      index events. The primary outcome variable is an appropriate adjudicated ICD firing for rapid&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study standardizes initial therapeutic ICD settings, reflecting the current standard of&#xD;
      care rather than an intervention, because by definition the study cohort consists of patients&#xD;
      without a history of malignant arrhythmia, in whom the ICD functions simply as a&#xD;
      defibrillator rather than as a more complex device employing anti-tachycardia pacing or&#xD;
      tiered therapy. In order to facilitate the identification of rhythms prompting ICD therapy,&#xD;
      programming includes far field ventricular electrogram storage. For patients who have firings&#xD;
      (appropriate or not), all subsequent clinical care (including drug and device prescriptions)&#xD;
      will be managed independently by the clinical attending electrophysiologist/cardiologist&#xD;
      according to the local standard of care, unaffected by the study protocol. For safety&#xD;
      reasons, any clinically-significant data (such as symptomatic complaints or documented&#xD;
      episodes of ventricular arrhythmia) obtained during the study will be promptly communicated&#xD;
      to the clinical attending physician both by telephone and in writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, patients undergo an initial history and examination conducted by an&#xD;
      attending electrophysiologist. Thereafter, patients are generally seen by an ICD nurse every&#xD;
      3 months and are evaluated for the purposes of the study every six months. The physician&#xD;
      and/or nurse will record the variables shown in Table D1 on paper forms or directly into&#xD;
      REDCap, web-based entry form. At each routine clinic visit (Q 3 month intervals) the ICD will&#xD;
      be interrogated and any episodes of ventricular tachycardia lasting &gt;10 beats with a cycle&#xD;
      length &lt; 400 ms, ventricular fibrillation, or any anti-tachycardia pacing or ICD therapies&#xD;
      will be recorded. If a ventricular arrhythmia is detected blood will be drawn and a digital&#xD;
      ECG will be performed as described for the 6 month follow up visits. Further evaluation and&#xD;
      treatment of the arrhythmia will be managed independently by the clinical attending&#xD;
      physician, who will be notified of the arrhythmia by telephone, with written confirmation and&#xD;
      documentation. At alternate visits (every 6 months) the patient will be evaluated by an&#xD;
      attending electrophysiologist, a 60cc blood sample will be obtained, a 5-minute digital ECG,&#xD;
      and any additional laboratory and diagnostic testing will be performed as clinically&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on clinical events (admission for MI/ACS, admission for CHF, diagnostic angiography,&#xD;
      revascularization, ICD device revision) will be collected by medical record review. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for a minimum of ten years or until death, cardiac transplantation or&#xD;
      ventricular assist device implantation. A patient who experiences an appropriate ICD firing&#xD;
      will have been considered to meet the primary endpoint of the study but will continue to be&#xD;
      followed, particularly for the development of adverse events. Investigators will continue to&#xD;
      follow and leverage this population as well as enroll additional patients who have ICDs in&#xD;
      place and are undergoing elective PG replacement for end-of-life indicators. The aims of this&#xD;
      proposal are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if a panel of serum proteins and metabolites measured at baseline and at&#xD;
           replacement identifies patients who will experience ASD after PG replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) performed around the time of PG&#xD;
           replacement identifies patients who will experience ASD after PG replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if baseline and serial ECG markers that are measures of conduction,&#xD;
           repolarization, autonomic tone (HRV, QTV, novel metrics such as entropy), VT&#xD;
           inducibility with programmed electrical stimulation at the time of PG exchange, and the&#xD;
           history of ICD shocks identifies patients who will experience ASD after ICD replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine if baseline levels and changes over time (up to 5-years) in clinical ECG,&#xD;
           epigenetic, serum protein and metabolite markers predict ASD, overall survival and&#xD;
           trajectory of the HF phenotype in patients with a primary prevention ICD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To review for changes over time on the CMR-LGE studies for previously obtained CMRs and&#xD;
           for new baseline CMRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To test whether intra-myocardial fat on MDCT is as effective or adds additional utility&#xD;
           to risk stratification for VA above that of CMR-LGE characteristics in ischemic&#xD;
           cardiomyopathy patients who are candidates for ICD therapy or have in situ ICDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical events committee comprised of three experienced electrophysiologists, who are not&#xD;
      investigators on this study or in the Hopkins Reynolds Center, adjudicate whether ICD firings&#xD;
      are appropriate and whether episodes of VT/VF are related to ischemia, based on reports of&#xD;
      device interrogation and other clinical documentation.The events committee will also&#xD;
      adjudicate deaths in the study as cardiac or non-cardiac and sudden or non-sudden by review&#xD;
      of the medical records, records of interviews of family and friends and ICD interrogation.&#xD;
      Death within one hour of symptom onset and/or VT/VF on ICD interrogation that was not&#xD;
      corrected by the device is considered SCD. All other deaths will be adjudicated as non-sudden&#xD;
      including any terminal or hospice chronic care patient whose ICD is programmed off.&#xD;
