  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if one CT contrast agent (medication injected into&#xD;
      a vein; used in CT examinations to help produce clearer images) is safer to use than another.&#xD;
      This study will compare the safety of two widely-used, U.S. FDA approved contrast agents,&#xD;
      Isovue and Omnipaque. The investigators hypothesize that there is no significant difference&#xD;
      in the rates of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) between these agents when the overall&#xD;
      population consists of low-risk patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients without known kidney disease, it is exceptionally rare for the administration of&#xD;
      CT contrast agents to injure the kidneys, and those rare injuries that do occur are almost&#xD;
      always temporary (a week or two) and heal. Indeed, significant injuries are so rare that the&#xD;
      kidney function in patients is not routinely checked after they receive CT contrast agents.&#xD;
      There are many brands of contrast media in common use across the United States, and it has&#xD;
      been thought in the past that all are similarly low in risk. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      examine whether two different contrast materials might differ in their risk to the kidneys.&#xD;
      We will perform a direct comparison of Omnipaque-300 (iohexol, 300 mg I/ml) and Isovue-300&#xD;
      (Iopamidol, 300 mg I/ml) low osmolality contrast agents to determine their relative CIN rates&#xD;
      (as measured by serum creatinine concentration) in low-risk patients.&#xD;

    <description>Prior to having the clinically scheduled CT examination the subject will have blood work drawn. This blood work will give the investigators a baseline value of the basic kidney function of the subject. They will then have blood work done again at 2 days and again at 3 days following the CT examination. Some patients, based on their blood work obtained at 2 and 3 days after the CT examination, will be asked to have blood work performed at 7 days after their CT examination.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients 18 years of age and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients referred for a contrast-enhanced CT examination. Such contrast- enhanced CT&#xD;
             examinations include, but are not limited to, certain examinations of the head, neck,&#xD;
             chest, abdomen, pelvis, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients less than age of 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in whom there are contraindications to the administration of intravenous&#xD;
             contrast material (as detailed in out Department of Radiology intravenous contrast&#xD;
             material use guidelines), including renal contraindications (such as a University of&#xD;
             Michigan laboratory record of most recent serum creatinine concentration of &gt;1.5 mg/dl&#xD;
             or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) &lt;60 ml/min); if no serum creatinine&#xD;
             is available, patients will be receive contrast material based on departmental&#xD;
             guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are undergoing therapy with agents purported to reduce the risk of CIN&#xD;
             (such as acetylcysteine, theophylline, or intravenous hydration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to provide the follow-up serum creatinine concentration&#xD;
             measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing CT examinations that utilize a higher concentration of iodine (for&#xD;
             example, 370 mg I/ml contrast material)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have experienced allergic-like reactions to contrast; including patients&#xD;
             who receive corticosteroid/antihistamine premedication to reduce the risk of an acute&#xD;
             allergic-like reaction&#xD;

          -  Patients who do not receive the study criterion for dose of contrast material; and&#xD;
             patients in whom a contrast extravasation of more than 5 ml occurs (so that it is not&#xD;
             possible to determine how much contrast material the patient received as a direct&#xD;
             intravenous injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients participating in other investigational drug, contrast material, or device&#xD;
             trials&#xD;
