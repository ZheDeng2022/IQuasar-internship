  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (both good and bad) two medications&#xD;
      (VELCADE and Vorinostat) have on patients who have certain types of lung cancer. The study is&#xD;
      &quot;dose escalating&quot; meaning that patients will receive different doses of medication depending&#xD;
      on when they enter the study. Participation in the study will last approximately 3 months and&#xD;
      will include an initial screening visit, a visit once each week for 3 weeks to receive the&#xD;
      study medications, and then 2 additional visits around the time of your surgery to remove&#xD;
      your lung cancer tumor.&#xD;

             or darbepoetin to achieve this hemoglobin level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a serum creatinine of &lt; 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has AST &lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
