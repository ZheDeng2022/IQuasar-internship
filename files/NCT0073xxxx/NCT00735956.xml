      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial to identify methods of involving underage youth&#xD;
      in interventions to reduce alcohol use through the primary health care system. The trial will&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of using an onsite behavioral health specialist for screening,&#xD;
      intervention and referral with basic written information and staff recommendations typically&#xD;
      provided in primary care offices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be approximately 3-5 sites who will participate in this study. These sites may&#xD;
      include two private practices in Roxboro and Creedmoor, North Carolina, the Duke Hospital and&#xD;
      two practices in the Five County region of NC who are implementing Integrated, Collaborative,&#xD;
      Accessible, Respectful, and Evidence-based (ICARE). In each clinic one day of the week (or 2&#xD;
      half days) will be chosen randomly from the days the clinic identifies as appropriate. During&#xD;
      this time a behavioral health specialist (BHS) will be on site to recruit potential&#xD;
      participants. All patients will be asked to speak to the specialist. On two other randomly&#xD;
      selected days printed material will be given to all parents of underage patients and the&#xD;
      underage patients. This material will describe the study and give the specialist's contact&#xD;
      information. If the patients are 18 to 21 years old the material will be given directly to&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BHS will ask all interested participants to sign the informed consent/minor consent and&#xD;
      one parent/legal guardian will be asked to counter sign the informed consent if subject is&#xD;
      not 18 years of age yet. All participants signing informed consent will be given the CRAFFT&#xD;
      and the PARTNER basic information questions in an interview with the specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the number of participants recruited per day by the on&#xD;
      site BHS versus appointment recruitment method. In addition, the total number of clinic&#xD;
      visits for patients' ages 14 to 21 years old on each day of the week will be totaled by age,&#xD;
      gender and ethnicity to determine the penetration rates for the recruitment procedures. And&#xD;
      lastly, medical records at the treatment referral sites will be checked to identify the&#xD;
      number of participants referred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit subjects at each site for approximately last six months.&#xD;
