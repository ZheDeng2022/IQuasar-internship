    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because your doctor has determined that you&#xD;
      have an ischemic foot ulcer. This research study will compare two approved standard of care&#xD;
      treatment modalities for the management of ischemic foot ulcers. The ischemic foot ulcer&#xD;
      (wound) on your foot is a result of a blocked artery in your leg. The wound can sometimes be&#xD;
      healed with wound care alone, which includes dressing changes with creams and removing&#xD;
      (debriding) the dead tissue. Alternatively, the significant narrowing or blockage in one of&#xD;
      the arteries in your leg can be treated with several endovascular treatment techniques&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  angioplasty, also called percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stent placement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  atherectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that early endovascular or surgical intervention in subjects&#xD;
      with moderate arterial insufficiency and a non-healing foot ulcer results in a higher overall&#xD;
      incidence of wound healing in a significantly shorter period of time.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single center, prospective, randomized trial evaluating the benefit of&#xD;
      endovascular intervention on the healing of ischemic foot ulcers when compared to best wound&#xD;
      care alone. The study population will be comprised of subjects with a foot ulcer and&#xD;
      non-palpable or diminished pedal pulses. The expected duration of subjects in this trial is 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Wound Care (group 1)--Best standard wound care with aggressive debridement&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endovascular Intervention + Wound Care (group 2)--Best standard wound care in&#xD;
           combination with endovascular revascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo standard of care evaluation for ischemic foot ulcers. These same&#xD;
      evaluations would be performed whether or not the subject was participating in this research&#xD;
      study. In the event that a clinically significant event or unanticipated disease or condition&#xD;
      is identified, the subject and their doctor will be notified, the investigator, will review&#xD;
      the results of the tests and procedures that are standard of care, and the results will&#xD;
      become part of the research record. Prior to undergoing randomization, the subject will sign&#xD;
      and fully understand an IRB consent form that is HIPAA compliant.&#xD;
