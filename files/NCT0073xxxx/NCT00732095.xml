      Research has found that natural recovery (self-change) is a very common pathway to change for&#xD;
      individuals with alcohol problems, accounting for nearly 75% of recoveries in several&#xD;
      national surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although few members of the public are aware that self-change is possible, it also is the&#xD;
      case that many individuals with alcohol problems do not enter treatment because of the stigma&#xD;
      or fear of being labeled. The proposed study is based on findings from a recent randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial designed to promote self-change in the community for problem drinkers who&#xD;
      had never been in treatment. Media advertisements were used to recruit 825 participants.&#xD;
      Eligible respondents were sent assessment materials to complete. After the assessment&#xD;
      materials were returned, participants were randomly assigned to receive two alcohol pamphlets&#xD;
      that were freely available in the community or personalized feedback based on their&#xD;
      assessment responses (e.g., how their drinking compared to national norms, health risks&#xD;
      associated with their drinking). A 1-year follow up found that while there were no&#xD;
      differences in drinking behavior between the groups, both groups had very substantial&#xD;
      reductions in their drinking 1-year pre- to 1-year post-intervention. In an attempt to&#xD;
      determine what accounted for the change, participants' reports of their drinking were&#xD;
      evaluated with regard to critical study elements (e. g., when assessment materials were&#xD;
      received). Surprisingly, results revealed that many changed after seeing the advertisement,&#xD;
      and before receiving the assessment materials to complete. This suggests that either seeing&#xD;
      the ad (&quot;Thinking about changing your drinking?&quot;) or a message in the ad (&quot;Did you know that&#xD;
      75% of people change their drinking on their own?&quot;) may have catalyzed the change. To&#xD;
      evaluate when change occurs and the mechanisms that may give rise to change, a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial involving 3 groups will be conducted. The groups will differ in whether they&#xD;
      receive a message informing them that self-change is a common phenomenon (two groups will&#xD;
      receive the message, one will not) and the occasion when the message is delivered (consenting&#xD;
      to the study and before the assessment vs. with the intervention material). Comparisons made&#xD;
      possible by the experimental design will allow an evaluation of the message as a precipitant&#xD;
      of change. The use of Timeline Followback retrospective reports of daily drinking and&#xD;
      recording of critical dates will allow statistical analysis of patterns of inflection (i.e.,&#xD;
      change in drinking) related to seeing the ad, receiving the message, receiving and completing&#xD;
      the assessment materials, and receiving the intervention materials. Possible explanations for&#xD;
      how the message could function as a mechanism of behavior change are offered (e.g.,&#xD;
      catastrophe theory, cognitive social learning theory). The ultimate objective of this&#xD;
      research is to develop cost-effective, large scale interventions that can be viewed as an&#xD;
      early stage in a public health, stepped care model by encouraging self-change for individuals&#xD;
      with alcohol problems.&#xD;

      based on findings from a recent randomized controlled trial designed to promote self-change&#xD;
      in the community for problem drinkers who had never been in treatment. Media advertisements&#xD;
      were used to recruit 825 participants. Eligible respondents were sent assessment materials to&#xD;

      to receive two alcohol pamphlets that were freely available in the community or personalized&#xD;
      feedback based on their assessment responses (e.g., how their drinking compared to national&#xD;

      there were no differences in drinking behavior between the groups, both groups had very&#xD;
      substantial reductions in their drinking 1-year pre- to 1-year post-intervention. In an&#xD;
      attempt to determine what accounted for the change, participants' reports of their drinking&#xD;
      were evaluated with regard to critical study time points (e. g., when assessment materials&#xD;
      were received). Surprisingly, results revealed that many changed after seeing the&#xD;

      Possible explanations for how the message could function as a mechanism of behavior change&#xD;
      are offered (e.g., catastrophe theory, cognitive social learning theory). The ultimate&#xD;
      objective of this research is to develop cost-effective, large scale interventions that can&#xD;
      be viewed as an early stage in a public health, stepped care model by encouraging self-change&#xD;
      for individuals with alcohol problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Goals and Justification The proposed research project is an outgrowth and extension of&#xD;
      research Drs. Linda and Mark Sobell have been conducting for many years. That research began&#xD;
      with investigations of individuals who recovered from alcohol problems without treatment&#xD;
      (natural recoveries). A major finding of the natural recovery research, conducted in Canada&#xD;
      but now supported by similar data from the US, was that rather than an uncommon occurrence,&#xD;
      self-change is the major pathway to change. Another finding of our natural recovery research&#xD;
      was that the most commonly reported precipitant of change was a cognitive appraisal (i.e.,&#xD;
      cost-benefit analysis) 1that occurred over time rather than some particular isolated event&#xD;
      (event-precipitated recovery). The individuals most likely to achieve a natural recovery are&#xD;
      those who do not have severe problems and who also tend not to access treatment resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our natural recovery research findings led to the design of a study, Promoting Self-Change,&#xD;
      intended to encourage problem drinkers within a community setting who have never sought&#xD;
      treatment or formal help to change their drinking their own (Sobell et al., 1996). The&#xD;
      experimental intervention in the PSC study was modeled on the evidence-based materials&#xD;
      developed for use in the Guided Self-Change model of treatment, a brief cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      motivational intervention Although both the experimental and control groups showed&#xD;
      significant reduction in their drinking from 1-year pre- to 1-year post-intervention, the&#xD;
      results showed that people who received the experimental motivational materials showed no&#xD;
      greater change than those who received the two alcohol pamphlets that were freely available&#xD;
      in the community (Sobell et al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fortunately, because we had collected drinking data using the Timeline Followback (Sobell &amp;&#xD;
      Sobell, 1992, 2003, 2007 in press) and kept records of important events (e.g., date person&#xD;
      called to be screened, date assessment materials mailed), it allowed us to explore when&#xD;
      change occurred. Contrary to the our hypothesis, the major reduction in drinking does not&#xD;
      appear to have occurred after the intervention materials were received, but rather after&#xD;
      participants saw the study advertisements. Thus, as will be discussed in detail in the design&#xD;
      section, seeing the ads and the message in the ads was identified as possible important&#xD;
      precipitants of change. The proposed project is a randomized controlled study to investigate&#xD;
      these issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our previous Promoting Self-Change study, we will conduct a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial consisting of three groups and designed to tease apart alternative possible&#xD;
      explanations of mechanisms of behavior change within a community based mail intervention. In&#xD;
      particular, the study will investigate the timing of points of inflection (i.e., change) in&#xD;
      participants' reported drinking as they participate in the study. The three experimental&#xD;
      groups will differ in whether they receive a message informing them that self-change is a&#xD;
      common phenomenon (two groups will receive the message, one will not) and the occasion when&#xD;
      the message is delivered (when consenting to the study and before the assessment vs. with the&#xD;
      intervention material). This design allows the following 5 objectives to be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate if a message that communicates that self-change (i.e., alcohol problem) is&#xD;
           common will prompt participants to engage in a process of self-change resulting in&#xD;
           changes in their drinking behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether there is a difference in effectiveness depending on when the message&#xD;
           that self-change is common is presented (before the assessment versus at the&#xD;
           intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether only seeing an advertisement prompts participants to think about&#xD;
           changing their drinking and then change on their own in the absences of a message that&#xD;
           self-change is common&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether receiving the message as part of the intervention materials adds&#xD;
           value over the effect of receiving only the intervention materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To conduct correlative investigations of whether participants report changes in their&#xD;
           drinking contiguous with first seeing the advertisement, receiving the assessment&#xD;
           materials (without the message), and receiving the intervention feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible explanations for how the message could function as a mechanism of behavior change&#xD;
      are offered from catastrophe theory and cognitive social learning theory. The ultimate&#xD;
      objective of this line of research is the development of cost-effective, large scale&#xD;
      interventions that can serve as an early stage in a public health, stepped care model by&#xD;
      encouraging self-change in the community for individuals with alcohol problems.&#xD;
