  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the timing of the onset of puberty may be&#xD;
      affected by FSH-regulatory peptides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will determine how these peptides relate to FSH production in prepubertal and pubertal&#xD;
      children by comparing the regulation of FSH control in children with precocious (early)&#xD;
      puberty and delayed puberty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, we will stimulate the pubertal axis using an agonist of GnRH to&#xD;
      determine the pubertal response of activin-A, inhibin-A and -B and follistatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine baseline FSH secretion and FSH-regulatory peptide tone, we will block GnRH with&#xD;
      a specific antagonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies should lead to a better understanding of the role of FSH in controlling the&#xD;
      onset of puberty and the pathogenesis of pubertal disorders.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Girls begin puberty earlier and have as much as a 5-fold increase in incidence of precocious&#xD;
      puberty as do boys, while boys are more likely to have delayed adolescence compared to girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons for sex differences in the timing of puberty and sex-based variation in&#xD;
      expression of pubertal disorders are not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Puberty is heralded by an increase in the episodic release of luteinizing hormone (LH) under&#xD;
      the control of increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release. It has been thought&#xD;
      that sex differences in central nervous system restraint of GnRH and subsequently of LH&#xD;
      secretion account for the differences in timing of onset of puberty in boys and girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion is readily detected prior to the onset of&#xD;
      puberty and exhibits sexual dimorphism in basal and GnRH-stimulated concentrations. Thus,&#xD;
      assessment of factors regulating FSH secretion during childhood may enhance our understanding&#xD;
      of sex differences in pubertal development and the pathogenesis of precocious puberty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although FSH is secreted under the control of GnRH, FSH is also secreted constitutively under&#xD;
      the control of a group of peptides collectively known as the FSH-regulatory proteins. These&#xD;
      peptides include activins, peptides that increase FSH secretion and inhibins and&#xD;
      follistatins, peptides that suppress FSH secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gonadal inhibins inhibit FSH via endocrine negative feedback, but their production during&#xD;
      puberty is only beginning to be understood. Activin and follistatin have been thought to have&#xD;
      a principle paracrine role in FSH regulation but recent data have demonstrated these peptides&#xD;
      have an endocrine role as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that differences in elaboration of activins, inhibins, and follistatin that&#xD;
      alter FSH constitutive secretion underlie precocious and delayed puberty in boys and girls&#xD;
      and account, in part, for sex differences in pubertal timing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically we expect that the inhibitory regulators, inhibins and/or follistatins, will be&#xD;
      lower while the stimulatory regulator, activin, will be higher in early compared to delayed&#xD;
      puberty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FSH and the Onset of Puberty is a case control study comparing boys with precocious puberty&#xD;
      to boys with delayed adolescence and girls with precocious puberty to girls with delayed&#xD;
      adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Basal and GnRH agonist-stimulated activin concentrations will be greater and&#xD;
      inhibin concentrations lower in children with early puberty than in children with delayed&#xD;
      adolescence, and the GnRH antagonist, ganirelix, will decrease activin concentrations in&#xD;
      children with early puberty but not in delayed adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine the degree to which FSH-regulatory peptides, compared to&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), control FSH secretion in children by suppressing GnRH&#xD;
      with ganirelix in children with early and delayed adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine the role of FSH-regulatory peptides in control of timing of onset&#xD;
      of puberty by comparing their concentrations with and without GnRH stimulation of FSH in&#xD;
      children with precocious puberty and delayed adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Determine the role of GnRH in control of the FSH-regulatory peptides by&#xD;
      comparing activin, inhibin and follistatin concentrations in children with delayed&#xD;
      adolescence due to constitutional growth delay to those with delayed adolescence from&#xD;
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism&#xD;
