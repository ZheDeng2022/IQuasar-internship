  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an experimental treatment regimen for hepatitis&#xD;
      C (HCV). Standard treatment consists of combination therapy with ribavirin, taken by mouth&#xD;
      twice a day, and Peginterferon, injected under the skin once a week. Hepatitis C genotypes 2&#xD;
      and 3 have a high success rate with this regimen, while genotype 1 is more difficult to&#xD;
      treat. This study will determine if patients with genotype 1 respond better to treatment that&#xD;
      uses a higher dose of ribavirin than the standard approved dose of 1,000 to 1,200 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 who have not been&#xD;
      successfully treated with a standard course of Peginterferon and ribavirin may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Participants eligible will receive Peginterferon plus twice the standard dose&#xD;
      of ribavirin (2,000 to 2,400 mg daily) for 48 weeks. In addition to treatment, all patients&#xD;
      receive undergo the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination, symptom questionnaires, blood tests, urine&#xD;
           collection, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, liver ultrasound, Fibroscan (ultrasound to&#xD;
           measure stiffness of the liver) and pregnancy test for women who are able to have&#xD;
           children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with other medical conditions or special risk factors may have further&#xD;
           evaluations before starting treatment. These may include, for example, eye evaluation&#xD;
           for patients with diabetes, exercise stress test for people over age 40 or who have risk&#xD;
           factors for heart disease and psychiatric evaluation for people who have depression or&#xD;
           anxiety disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodic blood tests to monitor blood counts and viral levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outpatient clinic visits every 4 weeks for the duration of the study for laboratory&#xD;
           tests and review of symptoms and treatment side effects. Physical examinations and urine&#xD;
           tests are done every 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following Completion of Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 1/2 years after starting treatment, subjects are re-evaluated as they were at the&#xD;
      start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Up to 60 patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection who were previously treated&#xD;
      with standard doses of peginterferon and ribavirin (1000 to 1200 mg daily) but who did not&#xD;
      have a virological response (non-responders: n=35) or who relapsed after therapy (relapsers:&#xD;
      n = 25) will be re-treated using peginterferon and higher doses of ribavirin (2000 to 2400 mg&#xD;
      daily). After medical evaluation, documentation of eligibility and written informed consent,&#xD;
      patients will be started on therapy with standard doses of peginterferon alfa-2a (180 micro g&#xD;
      per week) and twice the standard dose of ribavirin (2000 mg daily for patients less than 75&#xD;
      kg; 2400 mg daily for patients greater than or equal to 75 kg). Viral kinetics will be&#xD;
      evaluated on the basis of changes in HCV RNA levels during the first 24 weeks of therapy with&#xD;
      blood sampling done on days 0, 1, and 2 and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Patients&#xD;
      who fail to decrease levels of HCV RNA by more than 2 log(10) IU/ml by week 12 will be&#xD;
      considered non-responders and therapy will stop. Similarly, patients who do not become HCV&#xD;
      RNA negative (less than 10 IU) by week 24 will also be considered non-responders and therapy&#xD;
      will be discontinued. Patients who do become HCV RNA negative during the first 24 weeks of&#xD;
      therapy will continue for 48 weeks and be followed for at least 24 weeks thereafter. The&#xD;
      primary end-point of this study will be a sustained virological response (SVR), which is&#xD;
      defined by the absence of detectable HCV RNA in serum on treatment and for at least 24 weeks&#xD;
      after stopping therapy. The SVR rate for re-treatment using conventional doses of&#xD;
      peginterferon and ribavirin is expected to be less than 5 percent. The estimated rate of SVR&#xD;
      using peginterferon with high doses of ribavirin is 50 percent for patients with a previous&#xD;
      relapse and 25 percent for those with a previous non-response. A sample size of 35 patients&#xD;
      would be needed to achieve statistical significance based upon these estimates of response&#xD;
      rates for non-responders and 25 patients for relapsers. If none of the first ten&#xD;
      non-responder patients treated in this protocol achieve an SVR, no more non-responder&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled and this part of the study will be terminated early. Patients also&#xD;
      will be monitored closely for side effects of therapy, the major one for ribavirin being&#xD;
      anemia. Patients who develop anemia will be treated with darbepoietin to maintain a&#xD;
      hemoglobin level above 10 gm percent. This pilot study is expected to demonstrate whether use&#xD;
      of high doses of ribavirin is an option for patients who fail to have an adequate response to&#xD;
      conventional doses of peginterferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C.&#xD;
