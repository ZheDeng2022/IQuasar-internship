      RATIONALE: Vandetanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as oxaliplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether&#xD;
      vandetanib is more effective than a placebo when given together with oxaliplatin and&#xD;
      docetaxel in treating advanced cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of&#xD;
      vandetanib when given together with oxaliplatin and docetaxel and to see how well it works in&#xD;
      treating patients with advanced cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of vandetanib when administered with oxaliplatin&#xD;
           and docetaxel in patients with advanced cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal&#xD;
           junction. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the progression-free survival of these patients. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the response rate in patients treated with oxaliplatin and docetaxel with&#xD;
           or without vandetanib. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether tumor characteristics (e.g., EGFR/ErbB2 expression, activation and&#xD;
           mutational status of the EGFR and ErbB2 pathway [total and phosphorylated EGFR and&#xD;
           ErbB2, mutational and FISH analysis] and tumoral expression of HIF1-alpha) may have an&#xD;
           association with response and outcome. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of vandetanib followed by a&#xD;
      randomized phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are stratified according to histology (adenosarcoma vs squamous cell carcinoma) and&#xD;
      prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy/chemoradiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients in phase I receive treatment as in phase II arm&#xD;
      I.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8, oxaliplatin&#xD;
           IV over 2 hours on day 1, and oral vandetanib (at the maximum tolerated dose determined&#xD;
           in phase I) once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses&#xD;
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding&#xD;
           or stable disease may continue to receive vandetanib beyond 8 courses in the absence of&#xD;
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II arm II: Patients receive docetaxel and oxaliplatin as in arm I. Patients also&#xD;
           receive an oral placebo once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up&#xD;
           to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
           with responding or stable disease may continue to receive vandetanib beyond 8 courses in&#xD;
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in phase II submit baseline tumor tissue samples for correlative laboratory&#xD;
      studies, including analysis of EGFR and ErbB2 by mutational, FISH, and IHC analysis and&#xD;
      HIF1-alpha expression by IHC analysis.&#xD;
