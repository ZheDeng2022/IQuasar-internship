      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of the use of oral aprepitant in&#xD;
      combination with intravenous ondansetron and dexamethasone with the efficacy provided by the&#xD;
      use of oral aprepitant and dexamethasone for preventing vomiting during the first 24-48 hours&#xD;
      after breast surgery.&#xD;

      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is one of the most common complications associated&#xD;
      with surgery. The overall incidence of PONV is reported to be about 25-30% with specific&#xD;
      surgeries having an incidence up to 70-80%.1-5 Although PONV is typically not life&#xD;
      threatening, patients dread the sensation of nausea and the serious effects of retching and&#xD;
      vomiting. PONV in the surgical patient can cause wound dehiscence, electrolyte imbalance,&#xD;
      increased intraocular pressure, increased intracranial pressure, aspiration, esophageal&#xD;
      rupture, and loss of vision due to retinal detachment. 6-11 In several studies, investigators&#xD;
      found that patients rank vomiting as the most undesirable common side effect after surgery.&#xD;
      PONV is costly in economic terms and is a reason day surgery patients must be admitted in the&#xD;
      hospital for an overnight stay.12, 13 It is estimated that a patient who experiences an&#xD;
      episode of vomiting costs an additional $300 based on emesis basins, supplies, gowns,&#xD;
      bedding, additional medications, and nursing/physician time.14-20&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, PONV is highest in women (with a 2-3 times increased risk) and particularly after&#xD;
      procedures such as gynecological surgery, laparoscopy, thyroidectomy and breast surgery.5,&#xD;
      21-35 A study by Sinclair and group found that patients undergoing breast augmentation&#xD;
      experienced an 8-10 fold higher incidence of PONV than patients undergoing other types of&#xD;
      plastic surgery.26 Similar incidences were found in other studies of 48% to 68% of PONV in&#xD;
      patients undergoing mastectomies, breast reconstruction, and implantation.36-40&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospitalization of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery has significantly decreased&#xD;
      by 40% between 1993 and 2003. Many surgeries are now being performed on an outpatient basis&#xD;
      according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), with 96% of lumpectomies,&#xD;
      86% of partial mastectomies and 22% of complete mastectomies scheduled as ambulatory&#xD;
      surgeries.41 Carroll and group found that 35% of outpatients suffered from nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting after they left the surgical center.42 Therefore, the resulting problem is not only&#xD;
      the high incidence of nausea and vomiting in this specific group of patients but the post&#xD;
      discharge nausea and vomiting (PDNV) that will occur when these patients are at home and&#xD;
      without direct medical oversight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although still unclear, it is postulated that the etiology of postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting is the central mechanism involving stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone&#xD;
      (CTZ) located bilaterally at the floor of the fourth ventricle in the area postrema. The CTZ&#xD;
      is sensitive to toxins and other substances in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The CTZ&#xD;
      also receives sensory signals from the gastro-intestinal tract. The are three major central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) areas involved with PONV which all have specific emetogenic receptors.&#xD;
      Blockade of these receptors is postulated to be the mechanism of action of the commonly used&#xD;
      antiemetics. The agents' antagonist activity may be at one or more receptors with different&#xD;
      binding affinities and acting at different emetic neuroreceptors. The multifactorial etiology&#xD;
      of PONV involving multiple receptors is believed to be the reason one single agent is not&#xD;
      100% effective. The administration of an agent working on one receptor type will typically&#xD;
      reduce the PONV incidence by 30%. Use of a combination of antiemetic agents acting on&#xD;
      different receptor sites will further reduce the incidence. This combination has shown&#xD;
      greater efficacy than a single agent alone. Although this regimen has improved outcomes it&#xD;
      has not eliminated the problem of PONV and patients needing rescue therapy post surgery&#xD;
      occurs frequently. It would appear reasonable to assume that the use of more than 2&#xD;
      antiemetics would further reduce the incidence of PONV.43 However; published evidence of&#xD;
      greater than 2 agents is scarce. Therefore, the main objective of our proposal is to study a&#xD;
      combination antiemetic regimen (3 agents vs. 2 agents) in females scheduled for breast&#xD;
      surgery, a patient population considered at high risk for postoperative vomiting. The&#xD;
      selected agents will cover different receptors based on the hypothesized PONV multifactorial&#xD;
      etiology with stimulation of several factors. It is unknown which of these receptors may be&#xD;
      stimulated and by which stimuli (anesthetic, surgery, or patient factors).&#xD;
