      To investigate whether genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins involved in the&#xD;
      metabolism or effects of drugs or environmental agents influence the disposition or effects&#xD;
      of these xenobiotic substrates. To investigate the nature of heritability and the genetic&#xD;
      basis of pharmacogenetic traits by studying family members of individuals with specific&#xD;
      genotypes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacogenetics is that discipline devoted to elucidating the genetic determinants of drug&#xD;
      response. Particularly in the area of drug metabolism, many genes exhibit genetic&#xD;
      polymorphism; that is, a stable percentage of the population (which generally differs by&#xD;
      ethnic group) is deficient in the functional expression of the enzyme involved, and the&#xD;
      deficiency is typically inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. With currently known&#xD;
      polymorphisms in drug metabolism, the percentage of homozygous deficient individuals ranges&#xD;
      from 0.3% to as many as 90% of the population, depending on the enzyme and the ethnic group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our prior studies have revealed multigenic pharmacogenetic models that are significantly&#xD;
      predictive of various drug response phenotypes (e.g., drug resistance, drug clearance, drug&#xD;
      toxicity, disease response) in children with ALL. The large number of candidate loci and the&#xD;
      relatively small number of patients illustrate the fact that larger sample sizes are required&#xD;
      to definitively establish these polygenic models. The fact that there were significant&#xD;
      race/genotype interactions, such that predictions differed in whites vs blacks, highlights&#xD;
      the need for adequate numbers of patients within racial and ethnic groups to allow&#xD;
      differential analysis of genotypic predictors after adjusting for confounding demographic&#xD;
      factors in pharmacogenetic studies via stratified design and analyses.&#xD;
