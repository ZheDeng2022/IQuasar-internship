      The chiropractic profession utilizes different outcome measures to evaluate and validate the&#xD;
      chiropractic adjustments or the necessity for care. Some of these outcome measures have never&#xD;
      been compared to each other under the same treatment and trials. In addition, blood analysis&#xD;
      was added to measure the change in the inflammatory processes for the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The outcome measures that we measured are: activities of daily living&#xD;
      questionnaire (Oswestry disability index) , Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP),&#xD;
      lateral bending x-ray analysis, heart rate variability (HRV), paraspinal temperature,&#xD;
      paraspinal surface EMG (sEMG) static and dynamic (flexion, lateral bending and rotation) and&#xD;
      the range of motion (ROM) in flexion and extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activities of daily living questionnaire The modified Oswestry disability index 25 was&#xD;
      utilized. It comprises ten questions that evaluate the capacity of the patient to function&#xD;
      doing his daily activities and how the patient rates himself on a scale from A to F. The&#xD;
      value of A= 0 and each subsequent letter as an ascending numerical value, B=1 to F=5. The&#xD;
      maximum total for all ten questions is 50. The total for all the answers is tabulated and&#xD;
      multiplied by two to give a percentage of dysfunction due to lumbar pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Samples The blood samples were collected for Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and for C-Reactive&#xD;
      Protein (CRP), by a trained nurse with a valid license for the province of Quebec. The IL-6&#xD;
      blood sample was collected in a lavender tube (4.0 ml, BD Vacutainer, K2 EDTA, lot 7344830,&#xD;
      BD, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA) and the sample was left at room temperature for 15&#xD;
      minutes then it was centrifuge for 15 minutes at 1000g, it was immediately decanted and the&#xD;
      plasma was transferred via disposable transfer pipette ( Category number 13-711-7 Fisher&#xD;
      Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA) into Eppendorf tubes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecth,&#xD;
      Germany), the tube was closed and the tube was put on dry ice until it was delivered at the&#xD;
      laboratory of the Hôpital St-Luc in Montréal. The CRP blood sample was collected in a yellow&#xD;
      tube (5.0 ml, BD Vacutainer, SST, lot 8032322, BD, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA) and the&#xD;
      sample was left at room temperature for 15 minutes then it was centrifuge for 15 minutes at&#xD;
      1000g, it was immediately decanted and the serum was transferred via disposable transfer&#xD;
      pipette ( Category number 13-711-7Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA) into&#xD;
      Eppendorf tubes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecth, Germany), the tube was closed and the tube was put on&#xD;
      dry ice until it was delivered at the laboratory of the Hôpital St-Luc in Montréal. All the&#xD;
      needles were disposed after a single use in a biohazard container (BD, Sharps collector,&#xD;
      reference number 305648, lot 7103001, BD Medical, Oakville, Ontario) provided by the Centre&#xD;
      Local de Services de Santé (C.L.S.C.), an organism from the Quebec Ministry of Health. The&#xD;
      analyses were performed at the laboratory of Hôpital St-Luc in Montreal under the supervision&#xD;
      of Dr. Line Labrecque PhD in biochemistry. The results were provided by electronic means with&#xD;
      the patient's code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-ray analysis The participants were x-rayed for the lumbar spine. AP lateral bending films&#xD;
      in the left and right lateral bending position 27, 28, 29 were taken in the end position of&#xD;
      the movement as the patient would stop once the end position was reached; the central ray was&#xD;
      going through an area seven to eight centimeters above the top of the iliac crest. The&#xD;
      lateral film was done with the central ray going through L-5. The radiographs were analyzed&#xD;
      by two independent chiropractors, one chiropractor did the pre treatment analysis and the&#xD;
      other chiropractor did the post analysis. The treating chiropractor was allowed to view the&#xD;
      radiographs, for the purpose of treatment, after the initial analyses were terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRV measurement and analysis. A commercially available heart rate monitor (Suunto watch,&#xD;
      model T6, FitzWright Company Ltd., Langley, BC, Canada) was used. The data recordings&#xD;
      obtained from the heart rate monitor were analyzed for a five minute interval starting at the&#xD;
      80 Hz mark, in order to eliminate &quot;bruit&quot; from the initial positioning of the subject on the&#xD;
      table, finishing at the 380 Hz mark,. The analysis was performed with a personal computer&#xD;
      using custom software 15 (Kubios, Biosignal Analysis and Medical Imaging Group, Department of&#xD;
      Physics, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland) for several HRV parameters, as described&#xD;
      below. As well, as mentioned above, there were no attempts to blind the assessment since the&#xD;
      data were recorded directly into the heart rate monitor. Thus, the examiner could not know&#xD;
      the value during measurement. The risk of influencing HRV was kept to a minimum by insuring&#xD;
      that the interaction, between the subject and the examiner, limited itself to the&#xD;
      installation and removal of the recording apparatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRV Variables. The following variables were evaluated, mean R-R interval (Mean RR), the&#xD;
      standard deviation between r-r intervals (SDNN), the number of pairs of adjacent NN intervals&#xD;
      differing by more than 50 ms (NN 50 Count) and the proportion of NN intervals differing by&#xD;
      more than 50 ms = NN50 divided by total number of NN intervals (pNN 50%), the very low&#xD;
      frequency between (VLF); the normalized spectral components between 0 and 0.04 Hz , the low&#xD;
      frequency (LF); similarly, the normalized spectral components between 0.04 and 0.15 Hz, the&#xD;
      high frequency (HF); the normalized spectral power components were summed between 0.15 and&#xD;
      0.4 Hz and the ratio LF/HF 16. The HF band is related to the parasympathetic nervous system&#xD;
      efferent activity 17 and is synchronized to respiratory rhythms 16. The LF band is related to&#xD;
      both the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system efferent activity 18&#xD;
      and the cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity 16. The VLF band is not well&#xD;
      defined but appears to be related to thermoregulation 16 renin-angiotensin-aldosterone&#xD;
      systems 19-20, parasympathetic mechanisms 21, both the parasympathetic 21 and sympathetic&#xD;
      branches of ANS affect VLF 22 and the humoral system 23, 24. The LF/HF ratio is used to&#xD;
      indicate balance between the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system&#xD;
      efferent tone 18. Thus, a change in this score might indicate either a parasympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system or a sympathetic nervous system tonal change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myovision Instrumentation package The sEMG static and dynamic were connected to the Myovision&#xD;
      8000™ performance multi function sEMG (serial number 833830, Precision Biometrics Inc. 981-A&#xD;
      Industrial Road San Carlos, California, USA. 94070). The thermal, ROM probes and the&#xD;
      Myovision 8000™ were connected in the vision port 2 (serial number H002973, Precision&#xD;
      Biometrics Inc. 981-A Industrial Road San Carlos, California, USA. 94070). The Vision port™&#xD;
      was connected to the computer via a USB connector.&#xD;
