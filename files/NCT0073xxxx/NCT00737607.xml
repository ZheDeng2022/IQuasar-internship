    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective outcome study to evaluate the effectiveness and treatment outcomes&#xD;
      of microendoscopic decompressive laminotomy (MEDL) with objective evaluation tools. The&#xD;
      patients who fulfill the selection criteria will be enrolled to collect the pre-operative&#xD;
      clinical data including demographic data, image studies, and functional evaluation for&#xD;
      neurological symptoms and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive MEDL and post-operative follow-up will be arranged at 1 week, 1&#xD;
      month, 6 months, and 12 months after the operation. All the collected data will be analyzed&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and treatment results of MEDL.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The patients undergoing microendoscopic decompressive laminotomy (MEDL) for lumbar spinal&#xD;
      stenosis (LSS) between will be enrolled in this prospective study. The patients included must&#xD;
      fulfill the following selection criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  neurogenic claudication or radicular leg pain with associated neurologic signs referring&#xD;
           to the LSS syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis shown on cross-sectional imaging such as MRI or&#xD;
           CT scan;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  failure of conservative treatment for at least three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who presents with either mechanical low back pain or segmental instability.&#xD;
      Mechanical lower back pain is defined as pain that was induced by posture change, or that&#xD;
      prevents the patient from sitting or standing for more than 30 minutes. Patients are&#xD;
      considered to have segmental instability if they had isthmic spondylolisthesis, degenerative&#xD;
      spondylolisthesis with more than 4 mm of translation or intervertebral angle reversal on&#xD;
      dynamic radiographs.18 Surgical techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the surgical procedures will be performed by a single surgeon (J. P.). The patients is&#xD;
      positioned prone on the Relton-Hall frame after general anesthesia. Decompression is done&#xD;
      under the endoscope with the tubular retraction system METRx (Medtronics, Minneapolis, MN).&#xD;
      For patients with unilateral neurological symptoms, we will perform unilateral laminotomy and&#xD;
      foraminotomy. For patients with bilateral neurological symptoms, we will performe unilateral&#xD;
      laminotomy for bilateral decompression (ULBD) to decompress the central canal and bilateral&#xD;
      lateral recesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When performing multiple-level decompression, the skin incision will be centered at the&#xD;
      midpoint between selected intervertebral disc levels. The incision can be mobilized one level&#xD;
      above or below after releasing the underlying connective tissues. Then we can set up the&#xD;
      tubular retractor system through separate muscular portals for each level. For patients with&#xD;
      small stature, we can perform a three-level surgery through a single surgical wound, just as&#xD;
      the same size as we perform the single-level surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will have routine AP, lateral, dynamic lateral radiographs pre-operatively,&#xD;
      six months after the surgery, and at final follow-up. Post-operative instability is defined&#xD;
      as progression of listhesis or scoliosis on dynamic radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will MR images of the lumbar spine before the surgery. The severity of stenosis&#xD;
      is classified according to the cross sectional area of the dura sac at the axial plane on&#xD;
      T1-weighted MR images-severe stenosis for less than 76 mm2, moderate stenosis for between 76&#xD;
      and 100 mm2, and mild stenosis for more than 100 mm2. When MRI is contraindicated,&#xD;
      CT-myelography will be used instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes assessment will done with Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) for the overall disability&#xD;
      and the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score for the clinical symptoms and signs. The&#xD;
      patients will receive evaluation before the surgery, at six months, and at the final&#xD;
      follow-up examination. The range of ODI is 100 ~ 0 with a lower index corresponding to a&#xD;
      better result. Significant improvement is defined as more than 15 points of improvement after&#xD;
      the treatment. The range of JOA score is -3 ~ 29 with a higher score corresponding to a&#xD;
      better result. The improvement rate based on JOA score is calculated as follows:&#xD;
      (pre-operative score - post-operative score)/(29 - pre-operative score) Ã— 100%. The clinical&#xD;
      results are classified into four grades by the improvement rate: excellent (more than 75%),&#xD;
      good (between 51% and 75%), fair (between 26% and 50%), and poor (less than 26%). The success&#xD;
      of treatment is defined as more than 25% improvement rate in JOA score.20 At the final&#xD;
      follow-up, we will inquire each patient if he or she is satisfied with the treatment results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data about the pre-operative comorbidities, intra-operative, peri-operative, and&#xD;
      post-operative complications will be retrieved from medical chart review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distribution of gender, age, clinical characteristics (coexistence of spondylolisthesis or&#xD;
      scoliosis, severity of stenosis, and levels of decompression), and self-assessed satisfaction&#xD;
      by the binary outcome of treatment (success or not, based on the JOA score; significant&#xD;
      improvement of not, base on the ODI) will be tabulated. Fisher exact test will be preformed&#xD;
      to compare the difference between the two groups. Odds ratios will be calculated by using the&#xD;
      univariate logistic regression. Variables with two-sided p-value less than 0.05 were&#xD;
      considered as significant factors associated with successful treatment. All statistical&#xD;
      analyses are performed with statistical software, SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary,&#xD;
      NC).&#xD;
