    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that quantitative measurements of the beta cell mass within the endocrine&#xD;
      pancreas can be obtained by PET via targeting of vesicular monoamine type 2 transporters with&#xD;
      the radioligand [11C]DTBZ. and that there will be significant differences in [11C]DTBZ uptake&#xD;
      in the anatomical space of the pancreas between normal individuals and those with BCM&#xD;
      predicted to be greater or less than normal based on the measurement of insulin secretion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes results when the insulin secretory capacity of the beta cell population is lost or&#xD;
      severely compromised. Plasma insulin levels have been used as a surrogate marker of beta cell&#xD;
      mass (BCM) but insulin levels often do not correlate well with BCM and a &quot;gold standard of&#xD;
      measurement&quot; to obtain this type of information would be of great value. The aim of the&#xD;
      proposed study is to evaluate an islet imaging technique using PET scanning that will be able&#xD;
      to be used for directly measuring BCM and thus provide valuable information for monitoring&#xD;
      disease progress and response to therapy in people with diabetes and in people at high risk&#xD;
      for diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) occurs when the beta cells are selectively destroyed by&#xD;
      a T cell mediated autoimmune process. People at high risk for developing T1DM, such as first&#xD;
      degree relatives of patients with T1DM, can be sometimes be identified before the disease&#xD;
      develops by measuring autoantibodies to beta cells, however this test is neither very&#xD;
      sensitive or specific. In contrast, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) occurs in a setting of insulin&#xD;
      resistance leading to hyperinsulinemia. In people at high risk for T2DM, beta cell mass&#xD;
      increases to meet the demand for more insulin. The individual becomes diabetic when the BCM&#xD;
      and insulin production can no longer compensate for the increased need for insulin, and blood&#xD;
      glucose begins to rise. Loss of BCM may then occur as T2DM advances. People at high risk for&#xD;
      T2DM include first degree relatives of patients with T2DM and those with obesity, insulin&#xD;
      resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Little is known about the natural history of BCM,&#xD;
      turnover and cell lifetime, or the course of inflammation in diabetes. This is principally&#xD;
      because the pancreas is a highly heterogeneous organ that is difficult to biopsy without&#xD;
      significant complications, and BCM is only 1-2% of the organ. Accurate assessment of BCM in&#xD;
      human diabetes is limited to autopsy studies, which usually suffer from inadequate clinical&#xD;
      information; thus, the development of noninvasive means of BCM measurement could be&#xD;
      important, not only in intervention therapy of T1DM and T2DM, islet regeneration/stem cell&#xD;
      therapy and islet transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, islet cell mass visualization has not been clinically feasible. We have&#xD;
      previously identified a specific marker on pancreatic beta cells called vesicular monoamine&#xD;
      transporter type 2 (VMAT2). In preclinical studies, we have shown that imaging beta cell mass&#xD;
      with PET scanning using this radioligand is feasible in rats and in dosimetry studies&#xD;
      conducted in baboons. This radioligand, [11C]DTBZ, has been used previously in human subjects&#xD;
      in clinical trials evaluating P.E.T scanning of the brain in patients with bipolar illness&#xD;
      and schizophrenia compared to healthy control subjects. In the current protocol, we propose&#xD;
      to use a radioligand, [11C]DTBZ, that binds to VMAT2 in positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      scanning to assess whether PET can measure beta cell mass in human subjects.&#xD;
