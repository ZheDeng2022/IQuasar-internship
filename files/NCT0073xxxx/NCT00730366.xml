      Malaria in pregnancy contributes substantially to maternal anaemia and low birth weight:&#xD;
      effective malaria control in pregnancy could avoid about 10,000 maternal and up to 200,000&#xD;
      infant deaths every year. Intermittent preventive treatment with the drug&#xD;
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP), administered at least twice during routine antenatal&#xD;
      clinics, is recommended by the World Health Organization for areas of moderate to high&#xD;
      malaria transmission, including Sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies carried out in Kenya and Malawi before 2004 had showed that two doses of IPTp-SP&#xD;
      significantly reduce maternal anaemia, placental malaria parasitaemia and low birth weight.&#xD;
      However, in countries where this strategy had been introduced as part of national policy, the&#xD;
      coverage of the target population has varied widely, with estimates of 33-93% for uptake of&#xD;
      one dose and 24-68% for two doses, and no country had reached the goal of 80% of pregnant&#xD;
      women receiving at least 2 doses of IPTp. New approaches designed to improve IPTp coverage&#xD;
      were therefore urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was therefore set up in 2002, in order to evaluate the additional effect of a&#xD;
      targeted promotional campaign on antenatal clinics utilization and on coverage and uptake of&#xD;
      Intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in a rural health district&#xD;
      in Burkina Faso; and to investigate the effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment&#xD;
      with the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine compared with weekly chloroquine, in order to provide&#xD;
      additional evidence to the Burkinabé Ministry of Health for an impending policy change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, about 50 million women living in malaria endemic regions become pregnant, more&#xD;
      than half in sub-Saharan Africa. In areas of relatively stable transmission, where acquired&#xD;
      immunity to Plasmodium falciparum limits infection and prevents severe disease in adults,&#xD;
      women in their first and second pregnancy are the most vulnerable subjects, due to a higher&#xD;
      risk of severe anaemia and a low birth weight (LBW) outcome, a leading cause of child&#xD;
      mortality and poor growth and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria in pregnancy and its adverse consequences can be prevented with suppressive&#xD;
      antimalarial treatment or chemoprophylaxis. Weekly chloroquine (CQ) had been the basis for&#xD;
      prevention for many years, but its application became limited over time, partly because of&#xD;
      difficulties in coverage and compliance throughout pregnancy and partly because of increased&#xD;
      parasite resistance to CQ in endemic areas. A new strategy for prevention based on&#xD;
      insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and use of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy&#xD;
      (IPTp) was thus formulated, with IPTp being based on the administration of treatment doses of&#xD;
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (1500/75 mg; SP) to all pregnant women at pre-defined intervals and&#xD;
      regardless of malaria infection. WHO elaborated new recommendations, based on the&#xD;
      administration of SP two or three times at scheduled antenatal visits at least one month&#xD;
      apart from the second trimester onwards. Evidence of the efficacy of IPTp with SP for&#xD;
      preventing malaria infection and improving birth weight was reported from East Africa and&#xD;
      West Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the IPTp strategy assumes that most pregnant women attend antenatal clinics (ANC) at&#xD;
      least twice during their pregnancy and at a time when SP can be administered under direct&#xD;
      observation. Unfortunately, it appeared soon that late attendance to ANC and weak health&#xD;
      services limit the effectiveness of this strategy; coverage with two or more SP doses varied&#xD;
      widely (24-68%) and was well behind the goal of 80% proposed by the Roll Back Malaria&#xD;
      Partnership. New approaches to increase IPTp coverage were urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, conceived in 2002 and carried out between 2004 and 2006, had therefore two&#xD;
      different components: on one side, it investigated whether promoting regular and early&#xD;
      antenatal attendance of pregnant women through community based health education would&#xD;
      increase coverage and uptake of IPTp; on the other side, it investigated the effectiveness of&#xD;
      IPTp-SP compared with weekly CQ, in order to provide additional evidence to the Burkinabé&#xD;
      Ministry of Health for an impending policy change.&#xD;
