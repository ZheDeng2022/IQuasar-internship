      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Humira in the treatment&#xD;
      of cutaneous sarcoidosis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease. Cutaneous involvement occurs in approximately 25% of&#xD;
      patients with lesion morphologies varying widely. There is no universally accepted treatment&#xD;
      for sarcoidosis. Systemic agents such as oral corticosteroids are frequently necessary for&#xD;
      treatment, but long-term therapy is limited by a multitude of serious adverse effects.&#xD;
      Steroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, anti-malarials, pentoxifylline,&#xD;
      allopurinol, and thalidomide have been shown beneficial for select patients, but are limited&#xD;
      due to significant toxicities of their own or inconsistencies in efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infliximab is a chimeric, monoclonal antibody directed against TNF-α and is currently&#xD;
      approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      ankylosing spondylitis, and Crohn's disease. Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein&#xD;
      consisting of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human TNF receptor linked to the&#xD;
      Fc portion of human IgG1. Etanercept has been approved for the treatment of psoriasis,&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment with&#xD;
      infliximab and etanercept was generally well tolerated and safe in these reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there have been no reports describing the treatment of sarcoidosis with adalimumab.&#xD;
      Adalimumab (Humira; Abbott Laboratories, Abbot Park, IL) is a fully human, monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody directed against TNF-α and is approved by the US FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
      Given that adalimumab targets the same cytokine as infliximab and etanercept, one would&#xD;
      expect that adalimumab may also be effective in the treatment of sarcoidosis. Treatment with&#xD;
      adalimumab is advantageous over infliximab through differences in drug delivery. Infliximab&#xD;
      is delivered intravenously in the office. This requires routine office visits and vital sign&#xD;
      monitoring by a health care professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adalimumab, on the other hand, is administered subcutaneously once weekly or every other week&#xD;
      by the patient at home. Patients can be instructed on proper injection technique during one&#xD;
      nurse visit. Additionally, because adalimumab is fully human, patients may be less likely to&#xD;
      form antibodies against the medication. Because of the lack of alternative safe, effective&#xD;
      treatment for sarcoidosis, a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of adalimumab in the&#xD;
      treatment of sarcoidosis is warranted.&#xD;
