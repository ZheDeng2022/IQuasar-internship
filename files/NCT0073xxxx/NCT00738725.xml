    <textblock>
      The BioImage Study is a study of the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      as measured by imaging modalities, unsupervised circulating biomarker measurements, and risk&#xD;
      factors that predict progression to overt clinical cardiovascular disease, in a diverse,&#xD;
      population-based sample of 7,300 men (aged 55-80) and women (aged 60-80). The&#xD;
      socio-demographics of the study population aims to mirror the US population as a whole with&#xD;
      approximately 69% of the cohort will be white, 12% African-American, 13% Hispanic, 4% Asian,&#xD;
      predominantly of Chinese descent and 2% other (U.S. Census Bureau: 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort will be recruited from the Humana Health Plan membership represented in three&#xD;
      major US markets; Chicago, Illinois, Louisville, Kentucky and Southern Florida. Of the 7,300&#xD;
      participants, 6,000 will be characterized with respect to their Framingham risk score and&#xD;
      various imaging features including coronary calcification, carotid intima-media thickness&#xD;
      (IMT), presence of atherosclerotic plaques, and lower extremity vascular insufficiency as&#xD;
      determined by the ankle brachial index (ABI). Blood samples will be assayed for putative&#xD;
      biomarkers using a variety of methodologies including unsupervised proteomic and metabolomic&#xD;
      profiling of plasma, RNA expression profiling and candidate gene analysis or genome wide&#xD;
      scanning. These approaches will also be combined with targeted assays for particular&#xD;
      analytes. Biological samples will be banked at the time of collection for these analyses and&#xD;
      for additional follow on case-control and validation studies. Participants will be followed&#xD;
      for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and other forms of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), and stroke;&#xD;
      mortality; and for cardiovascular disease interventions. The remaining 1,300 subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated and followed in a similar manner except no imaging studies will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted using an innovative infrastructure and method of participant&#xD;
      recruitment and enrollment. Mobile clinics containing the imaging equipment will travel to&#xD;
      the three markets included in the study. The mobile clinic configuration allows for a high&#xD;
      level of consistency in the data measurements which will be collected from diverse geographic&#xD;
      areas and populations. Participants will be recruited based on claims monitoring to&#xD;
      pre-determine eligibility. The baseline examinations of the 7,300 participants will occur&#xD;
      over a 12-month period. Based on particular findings (Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) score,&#xD;
      Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (IMT), atherosclerotic plaque, Ankle Brachial Index (ABI), and&#xD;
      presence of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA), approximately 3,000 participants of the 6,000&#xD;
      imaging cohort will be referred for higher resolution imaging modalities to better&#xD;
      characterize their arterial disease. This additional imaging will also be conducted at the&#xD;
      mobile clinics and occur during the same 12-month period. Participants will be contacted&#xD;
      every 6-months throughout the 3-year study to assess cardiovascular events, clinical&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, and to obtain additional blood samples.&#xD;

        Recruitment will be limited to the Humana membership base using health insurance claims&#xD;
        information to identify potential study candidates. Candidate selection algorithms have&#xD;
        been developed to identify members who have no prior history of cardiovascular disease, but&#xD;
        most likely would be at intermediate to high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular&#xD;
        events. The target is to recruit a population that has similar demographics to the US&#xD;
        population in terms of race and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The participant selection criteria for the Humana database extraction to represent a medium&#xD;
        to high risk population*: current Humana member with at least 3 months continuous&#xD;
        enrollment; resides in one of the three study markets; pharmacy or medical claim for&#xD;
        diabetes, hypertension, obesity or abnormal lipid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        *Note: A separate selection will be for patients without any pharmacy claims to represent&#xD;
        20% of the study population.&#xD;
