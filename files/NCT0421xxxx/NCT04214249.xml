  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cytarabine and idarubicin or daunorubicin with or&#xD;
      without pembrolizumab work in treating patients with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, idarubicin, and daunorubicin, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy with pembrolizumab may work better than induction chemotherapy alone in treating&#xD;
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the percentage of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete&#xD;
      remission (CR) (MRD-CR) as measured by flow cytometry at the end of first cycle of&#xD;
      consolidation therapy with chemotherapy + MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) and compare between the two&#xD;
      study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the rate of complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete count&#xD;
      recovery (CRi) as defined per European LeukemiaNet 2017 response criteria at time of count&#xD;
      recovery after induction therapy with chemotherapy + MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) (Dohner et al.,&#xD;
      2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Rates of complete remission with partial recovery count (CRh) and hematologic improvement&#xD;
      (HI) to red blood cells and platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the rates of MRD negativity at day 14, MRD-negative CR at end of induction&#xD;
      therapy and MRD negative CR after last consolidation cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess event free survival (EFS), measured from randomization to failure to achieve&#xD;
      CR/CRi, relapse or death from any cause, and relapse free survival (RFS), calculated as the&#xD;
      time from first documentation of CR/CRi to either disease relapse or death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess the duration of response (DOR, defined as the time from first CR/CRi to the date of&#xD;
      the first documented relapse or death, whichever occurs first) and overall survival (OS),&#xD;
      defined as time from randomization to death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Assess safety endpoints including proportion of patients who develop severe toxicity as&#xD;
      defined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. MRD assessment by duplex sequencing (DS) and comparing DS and multiparameter flow&#xD;
      cytometry for MRD detection as an exploratory biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assessment of immune-checkpoint expression and dynamic change of immune cell subsets in&#xD;
      response to the combination of checkpoint-inhibition and backbone combination in acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. High-throughput sequencing of the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vb CDR3 regions on ï¬‚ow&#xD;
      cytometrically sorted t-cell subsets to assess the effect of immunotherapy on the diversity&#xD;
      of the t-cell repertoire and assess for correlation to clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Investigation of protein signatures and ribonucleic acid (RNA) signatures associated with&#xD;
      response and efficacy using O-link cytokine panel and RNA-sequencing (seq), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determination of mutational load by whole exome sequencing to assess for correlation with&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, immune infiltrating profile, and T cell repertoire diversity and&#xD;
      clonality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Correlate gut microbiome at baseline and changes in the microbiome with clinical&#xD;
      response, both in standard chemotherapy and immunotherapy/chemotherapy therapy settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. MRD assessment using duplex sequencing strategy for circulating cell-free tumor&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and correlation with long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION PHASE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive cytarabine via continuous intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1-7 and&#xD;
      idarubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes or daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-30&#xD;
      minutes on days 1-3 of a 28-35 day cycle. Patients who have evidence of residual leukemia&#xD;
      receive cytarabine via continuous IV infusion over days 1-5 and idarubicin hydrochloride IV&#xD;
      over 15-30 minutes or daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-2 for an&#xD;
      additional cycle in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning&#xD;
      day 8, patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 25-40 minutes. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a CR or a&#xD;
      CRi may undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) per physician discretion or&#xD;
      continue to consolidation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive cytarabine via continuous IV infusion on days 1-7 and idarubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes or daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1-3 of a 28-35 day cycle. Patients who have evidence of residual leukemia receive&#xD;
      cytarabine via continuous IV infusion over days 1-5 and idarubicin hydrochloride IV over&#xD;
      15-30 minutes or daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-2 for an&#xD;
      additional cycle in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who&#xD;
      achieve a CR or a CRi may undergo HSCT per physician discretion or continue to consolidation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Within 4 weeks of remission status documentation, patients receive high-dose&#xD;
      cytarabine (HiDAC) IV over 1-3 hours every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 for a total of 6&#xD;
      doses and pembrolizumab IV over 25-40 minutes. Cycles with HiDAC repeat every 28-42 days and&#xD;
      cycles with pembrolizumab repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who remain in CR or CRi receive up to 3 additional cycles of&#xD;
      HiDAC and pembrolizumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and&#xD;
      continue to maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Within 4 weeks of remission status documentation, patients receive HiDAC IV over 1-3&#xD;
      hours every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 for a total of 6 doses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who remain in CR or CRi receive up to 3&#xD;
      additional cycles of HiDAC in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 25-40 minutes. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for&#xD;
      up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6&#xD;
      months for up to 5 years. Patients who undergo HSCT are also followed up at 100 days&#xD;
      post-transplant.&#xD;

TCR diversity and clonality will be calculated using a software by Adaptive Technologies. T-cell repertoire diversity and clonality will be correlated with clinic-pathological parameters such as response to treatment, survival, and immune infiltrating profile, as well as genomic profiles (total mutation burden, non-synonymous mutation burden, predicted neoantigen burden, clonal mutation burden and clonal predicted neoantigen burden). TCR profile generated from treatment-refractory tumors at the time of disease progression will be compared to data from pre-treatment tumor samples to explore the TCR repertoire evolution of these tumors under therapeutic pressure.</description>

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with known active CNS disease and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Assessment of&#xD;
             the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is not required to enroll in the study unless there is&#xD;
             clinical suspicion for CNS involvement. However, if CSF assessment is performed for&#xD;

             therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy&#xD;
             for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required the use of&#xD;

             humanized antibody with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab), breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab). These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who have received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu&#xD;
                  vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist)&#xD;
                  are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active hemolytic anemia requiring immunosuppressive therapy or other pharmacologic&#xD;
             treatment. Patients who have a positive Coombs test but no evidence of hemolysis are&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as&#xD;
             assessed by treating physician, will be excluded from study&#xD;
&#xD;

             extramedullary disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia will be excluded&#xD;
