      Background: Severe systolic heart failure would be complicated with low cardiac output and&#xD;
      high left ventricular filling pressure and the clinical presentations would be low blood&#xD;
      pressure, poor peripheral perfusion, and pulmonary edema. Severe systolic heart failure with&#xD;
      hemodynamically significant mitral regurgitation brings even more challenged since the&#xD;
      obvious elevation of left atrial pressure induces more pulmonary congestion and backward flow&#xD;
      of regurgitation in cases with already low cardiac output and poor peripheral perfusion&#xD;
      complicates more severe of low cardiac output. Surgical interventions in those cases aren't&#xD;
      strongly recommended due to very high operation risk. In the era of lack of nitroprusside in&#xD;
      Taiwan (more than 7 years), hydralazine, a direct vasodilator, is a potential substitute for&#xD;
      treatment of those cases. The advantages of hydralazine include 1) different dosage forms are&#xD;
      available (10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg); 2) short half-life makes it reaching steady blood&#xD;
      concentration in short period and allow to up- titrate rapidly and also recover fast while&#xD;
      adverse reaction occurs; 3) it is much cheaper than other evidence-based medications. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators try to use rapid up-titration of hydralazine to maximal tolerable&#xD;
      dose, almost up to 300-400 mg per day, combined with other evidence-based medications in&#xD;
      cases with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% and mitral regurgitation severity&#xD;
      more than moderate degree and assess the prognostic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Four hundred of patients with severe systolic dysfunction and hemodynamically&#xD;
      significant mitral regurgitation, who were admitted for intensive care unit for acute&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure, will be enrolled and the participants will be divided into two&#xD;
      groups according 1 to 1 randomization process. Control group will receive conventional&#xD;
      treatment with tolerable maximal dose of evidence-based medications and study group will use&#xD;
      hydralazine with rapid up-titration, if no clinical adverse responses were noted, following&#xD;
      by or simultaneously using evidence-based medications. The end-points include in- hospital&#xD;
      mortality, 3-year all-cause mortality and heart failure rehospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow-up period, any adverse response of high-dose hydralazine including lupus-like&#xD;
      syndrome and arthritis will be monitored.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator team had focused on heart failure (HF) treatment for many years and tried to&#xD;
      develop non-invasive guide for HF treatment. Initially, the investigators had dedicated to&#xD;
      use echocardiography to simulate Swan-Ganz and performed validation for non-invasive&#xD;
      Swan-Ganz (echo Swan-Ganz). Although this method wasn't successful in assessing the full&#xD;
      spectrum of Swan-Ganz data, the estimates of stroke volume and left ventricular filling&#xD;
      pressure (LVFP) were reliable and well-validated by comparing with invasive measurements.&#xD;
      Based on those two data, the investigators could control severe HF patients better and&#xD;
      conducted a HF special outpatient clinic. Guiding HF treatment by this model was on-going.&#xD;
      Due to lack of nitroprusside in Taiwan for more than 8 years, some cases with terminal HF&#xD;
      combined with severe mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation were more complicated and&#xD;
      troubled for management since it might present as even more reduction of forward flow with&#xD;
      more low cardiac output and high LVFP. High-dose of hydralazine, a direct vasodilator, was&#xD;
      the solution of our team and it was used to a substitute of nitroprusside. According to the&#xD;
      preliminary results of previous studies, rapid up-titration of hydralazine to maximal&#xD;
      tolerable dose, then combined with evidence-based medications, was very effective in patients&#xD;
      with severe systolic HF and hemodynamically significant mitral regurgitation, especially in&#xD;
      acute pulmonary edema with critical and unstable conditions. This method is useful for&#xD;
      reducing regurgitation volume and promoting forward flow after afterload reduction and the&#xD;
      counterbalance between increasing forward flow and pressure-lowing effect of vasodilator&#xD;
      brings stable blood pressure without obvious hypotension or poor peripheral perfusion.&#xD;
      Therefore, it increases the possibility of extubation and reduces the in-hospital mortality&#xD;
      in those cases. Additionally, the risk of lupus-like syndrome, arthritis, and positive result&#xD;
      of ANA are relatively lower than those in The East population. However, the exact short-term&#xD;
      and long-term benefits of high-dose hydralazine in Taiwanese with severe systolic HF and&#xD;
      significant mitral regurgitation are unknown. The investigators conduct this study to confirm&#xD;
      our previous observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction Heart failure, either acute or chronic, is a clinical syndrome caused by a&#xD;
      structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality, resulting in a reduced cardiac output&#xD;
      and/or elevated intracardiac pressures at rest or during stress. This means two major&#xD;
      components associated with HF symptoms are inadequate cardiac output and high filling&#xD;
      pressure. Although many categories of medications have been approved as therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions for HF, including beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors&#xD;
      (ACEI), angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARB), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA),&#xD;
      ivabradine, and entresto, the prognosis of HF remains poor, even worse than that of most&#xD;
      cancers. Up-titration of evidence-based medications to maximal tolerable dosages has been&#xD;
      recommended, but loop diuretics remain the main stream of HF treatment despite lack of&#xD;
      evidence of prognostic benefit. In daily practice, diuretics resolve respiratory distress&#xD;
      with reduction preload and LVFP, but overdiuresis with postural hypotension, renal function&#xD;
      decline and worsening low cardiac output is not uncommon. Decompensated HF with low blood&#xD;
      pressure is always difficult to manage, and most evidence-based medications have&#xD;
      blood-pressure-lowing effect at initiation of treatment. Many physicians do not up-titrate&#xD;
      those medications to maximal dosages for fear of more reduction of blood pressure, which&#xD;
      potentially induces adverse events or complications. Therefore, many eligible patients don't&#xD;
      reach suggested dosage according to guidelines, which may adversely affect prognosis. It&#xD;
      points out a blind spot of HF treatment that relatively low blood pressure would avoid&#xD;
      up-titration of evidence-based medications in daily practice of the majority of&#xD;
      cardiologists. Regarding severe systolic HF with hemodynamically significant mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation (MR), it is an even more complicated situation because regurgitation will bring&#xD;
      much lower stroke volume and higher LVFP, which blood pressure becomes low enough to let&#xD;
      physicians withdrawing any medications with blood-pressure-lowering effect, including&#xD;
      evidence-based medications. The nitroprusside with powerful vasodilating and short-active&#xD;
      (rapid conversion after stopping infusion) effects are the solution of this critical&#xD;
      situation. Unfortunately, this medication was unavailable for more than 8 years in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many short-active medications with vasodilator effect such as captopril and hydralazine have&#xD;
      potential to be a substitute of nitroprusside in this situation and are suitable for rapid&#xD;
      up-titration because short half-life brings to achieve steady blood concentration soon.&#xD;
      Compared to hydralazine, captopril decreases the mortality of advanced HF, mainly sudden&#xD;
      death, in line with enalpril. But only the form of captopril 25 mg per tab is available in&#xD;
      Taiwan and one fourth tab three times per day is the common initial regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ACEIs offer strong prognostic benefit in HF and favorable hemodynamic change, it is&#xD;
      not so convenient to use in study cohort. Regarding hydralazine, three forms including 10,&#xD;
      25, and 50 mg are available. Animal study reveals that it is effective for treatment of&#xD;
      mitral regurgitation with reduction of peripheral vascular resistance and LVFP, and increase&#xD;
      of stroke volume and cardiac output. The effect of hydralazine is comparable to nitroprusside&#xD;
      with a similar reduction in systemic vascular resistance but a slightly greater increase in&#xD;
      cardiac index, with a lesser fall in mean arterial pressure, mean pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      pressure, and pulmonary wedge pressure. Hydralazine combined with nitrate had been documented&#xD;
      useful in chronic heart failure, especially in African or black population, according to many&#xD;
      publications. Based on the hypothesis that initial low-dose hydralazine with rapid&#xD;
      up-titration to maximal tolerable dose, following by or simultaneously using other&#xD;
      evidence-based medications, in acute HF patients with low-cardiac-output and&#xD;
      low-blood-pressure patients due to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and&#xD;
      hemodynamically significant mitral regurgitation, would bring better outcome compared to&#xD;
      conventional treatment, the investigators conduct this study to assess short-term and&#xD;
      long-term prognostic change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study population: This prospective study will recruit 400 patients aged 18 years or&#xD;
      older, and hospitalization to E-Da Hospital for acute decompensated heart failure due to&#xD;
      severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction combined with hemodynamically significant mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation. Severe systolic dysfunction and hemodynamically significant mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation are defined as left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% and mitral&#xD;
      regurgitant volume more than 45 ml (more than moderate degree), respectively. All&#xD;
      participants will be randomly divided into two groups according to 1 to 1 fashion. One group&#xD;
      will receive conventional evidence-based medication with up-titration to maximal tolerable&#xD;
      dose and another group will receive low-dose hydralazine initially with rapid up-titration,&#xD;
      if no adverse effect including hypotension with worsening low cardiac output sign, skin rash&#xD;
      and joint pain occurred. Since the half-life of hydralazine is around 4-6 hours and 3-5&#xD;
      half-life achieves the steady blood concentration, up-titration of hydralazine will be done&#xD;
      per 1-2 days. For example, initial dose of hydralazine would be 25 mg tid and the dose would&#xD;
      be 50 mg bid next day if no adverse effect occurred. Following this rule, one week is enough&#xD;
      to reach high-dose hydralazine with daily dose of 300-400 mg. According to our prior&#xD;
      experience of acute HF control, the most patients could tolerate this dose well with&#xD;
      acceptable peripheral perfusion and blood pressure. This process will follow by or&#xD;
      simultaneously use evidence-based medications including ACEI/ARB, beta-blocker, and MRA.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include any history of the following: 1) cancer or other significant&#xD;
      co-morbid diseases with expected life span less than 3 years, 2) any sign of inadequate&#xD;
      preload such as poor skin turgor, severe thirsty feeling, evidence of gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      bleeding or sepsis, 3) adverse effects of hydralazine, 4) surgical interventions of mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation will be done in follow-up period which change the course of native condition,&#xD;
      5) other valvular conditions other than mitral regurgitation with severity more than or equal&#xD;
      to moderate degree, particularly mitral stenosis, and aortic regurgitation/stenosis, or 6)&#xD;
      lack of written informed consent. Signs of inadequate peripheral perfusion including downhill&#xD;
      consciousness level, decreased urine output, and prerenal azotemia will be assessed&#xD;
      routinely. Histories of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes and smoking are recorded. The&#xD;
      endpoints for the current study are in-hospital mortality, 3-year HF rehospitalization and&#xD;
      3-year all-cause mortality. All participants will give written informed consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study, and the study had been approved by the institutional review board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of hemodynamic change after high-dose hydralazine: Thirty patients in each group&#xD;
      will be arranged for admission to intensive care unit for severe HF control, and they will&#xD;
      receive invasive hemodynamic monitor by Swan-Ganz catheter routinely for 1 week. Hydralazine&#xD;
      will be up-titrated to maximal tolerable dose in hydralazine group at first 7 days and the&#xD;
      target dose will be 300-400 mg per day. Echocardiographic measurements including stroke&#xD;
      volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, left atrial size, mitral regurgitation severity,&#xD;
      mitral regurgitant volume, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, tissue Doppler parameters, and&#xD;
      left ventricular filling pressure estimated by left atrial expansion index, will be done at&#xD;
      day 1 and day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of high-dose hydralazine: After discharge, high-dose hydralazine is maintained&#xD;
      except any adverse effect and up-titration of other evidence-based medications to maximal&#xD;
      tolerable dose will be done. The dose of medications is adjusted by clinical signs,&#xD;
      especially peripheral perfusion, not only simply by blood pressure. If participant had low&#xD;
      blood pressure (for example, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg) but no sign of&#xD;
      postural hypotension, or low cardiac output (cold limbs, decreased urine output, dizzy), the&#xD;
      investigators will keep up-titration of medications. Regarding the initial negative inotropic&#xD;
      effect of beta blockers, it will be titrated slowly. While any reasons induce postural&#xD;
      hypotension, the investigator will reduce the dose of hydralazine first and try to keep the&#xD;
      ordinary dose of other evidence-based medications as possible. If participants would admit&#xD;
      for recurrent heart failure or other non-cardiovascular problems, ordinary regimen of&#xD;
      high-dose hydralazine will be maintained unless low blood pressure combined with low cardiac&#xD;
      output occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitor adverse effect of high-dose hydralazine: Antinuclear antibody, hematogram and CXR&#xD;
      will be checked per 6 months. Signs of lupus-like syndrome, serositis, joint pain, skin rash,&#xD;
      liver biochemical and hematological studies will be monitored regularly. For patients with&#xD;
      coronary artery disease and ischemic HF, the investigators will take care of any signs of&#xD;
      worsening myocardial ischemia if chest pain occurs or HF worsens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-dose captopril will replace hydralazine if any adverse effects of high-dose hydralazine&#xD;
      are suspected. Echocardiographic measurements: Basic echocardiographic measurements including&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, left atrial size, and&#xD;
      tissue Doppler imaging will be done. Echocardiography is performed in all patients. The&#xD;
      severity of mitral regurgitation will be evaluated quantitatively by regurgitant volume.&#xD;
      Heart failure patients are admitted with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% and&#xD;
      mitral regurgitant volume more than 45 ml will be enrolled if they are willing to participate&#xD;
      in. Left atrial volume measurements were calculated using the biplane area-length method&#xD;
      immediately before mitral valve opening. In all participants, the left atrial volumes were&#xD;
      indexed to the body surface area. The mitral regurgitation volume is calculated as follows:&#xD;
      regurgitation volume = (stroke volume of mitral annulus) - (stroke volume of left ventricular&#xD;
      outflow tract), where the stroke volumes of the mitral annulus and left ventricular outflow&#xD;
      tract were obtained by multiplying the cross-sectional area by the respective time-velocity&#xD;
      integral. The mitral regurgitant volumes will be assessed at enrollment, at discharge, and at&#xD;
      least once per year during follow-up period. Based on our prior studies, the change of LVFP&#xD;
      assessed by left atrial expansion index will be examined during the course of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical studies and biomarker measurements: Blood samples will be obtained during index&#xD;
      hospitalization and per 3 months after discharge. The measurements of B-type natriuretic&#xD;
      peptide, anti-nuclear antibodies, renal function, liver function and hematogram will be done&#xD;
      regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: The median follow-up will be 3 years and the end-points will be in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality, 3-year HF rehospitalization and 3-year all-cause mortality. Hospitalization for HF&#xD;
      is defined as a hospital stay of at least 1 night for treatment of a clinical syndrome with&#xD;
      at least two of the following symptoms: paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, elevated&#xD;
      jugular venous pressure, pulmonary rales, a third heart sound, cardiomegaly on chest&#xD;
      radiography, or pulmonary edema on chest radiography. These clinical signs and symptoms might&#xD;
      have represented a clear change from the normal clinical state of the patient and might have&#xD;
      been accompanied by either failing cardiac output, as determines by peripheral hypoperfusion,&#xD;
      or peripheral or pulmonary edema requiring treatment with intravenous diuretics, inotropes,&#xD;
      or vasodilators. Supportive documentation of a decreased cardiac index, an increased&#xD;
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, decreasing oxygen saturation, and end organ&#xD;
      hypoperfusion, if available, are included in the adjudication. Follow-up includes medical&#xD;
      record reviews and patient interviews. Medical assistants will check medical records once per&#xD;
      3 months. The certification of death is based on death records, death certificates, and&#xD;
      hospital medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The SPSS software will be used for all statistical analyses. All&#xD;
      continuous variables are presented as means ± standard deviation. A p value of &lt; 0.05 is&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. Comparisons of clinical characteristics are performed&#xD;
      by chi-square analysis for categorical variables. Acute hemodynamic changes after high-dose&#xD;
      hydralazine will be assessed and comparisons of Swan-Ganz and echocardiographic data before&#xD;
      and after high-dose hydralazine will be performed. Otherwise, comparisons of hemodynamic&#xD;
      changes between conventional treatment group and hydralazine will also be done. Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      curve will be performed to assess the cumulative event-free rate according to different&#xD;
      treatment strategies. Cox proportional regression analysis of hazard ratio after adjusting&#xD;
      significant covariates in univariate analyses will be done. Otherwise, multivariate analysis&#xD;
      will be done to identify the independent prognostic indicators of in-hospital, 3-year HF&#xD;
      rehospitalization, and 3-year all-cause mortality. ROC curve analysis is also performed to&#xD;
      assess the sensitivity and specificity of the cut-off points of covariates for predicting&#xD;
      those events. The frequency of adverse effects of high-dose hydralazine, including positive&#xD;
      antinuclear antibody, lupus-like syndrome, serositis, arthritis, hematogram change, and&#xD;
      worsening myocardial ischemia will be assessed. If the strategy of high-dose hydralazine&#xD;
      combined with conventional evidence-based medications was proved to have prognostically&#xD;
      beneficial effect, the prognostic impact according to maximal tolerable dose of hydralazine&#xD;
      will be analyzed. Additionally, high dose of hydralazine will compress the use of other&#xD;
      evidence-based medications and it is assumed that, compared to conventional treatment group,&#xD;
      up-titration of those medications becomes difficult in high-dose hydralazine group. The&#xD;
      effect of counter-balance between high-dose hydralazine and relatively low doses of ACEI,&#xD;
      ARB, beta blocker and MRA will be assessed by multivariate analysis.&#xD;

The evidence-based medications include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, ivabradine and entresto. Which evidence-based medications will be started first depends on the decision of in-charge doctors without strict regulation. However, all evidence-based medications should be up-titrated to maximal tolerable dose. (Excuse me! Up-titration of evidence-based medications in heart failure isn't multiple intervention. Those medications should be prescribed in each heart failure case if no contraindication was noted.)</description>

             ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% and mitral regurgitant volume more than 45&#xD;
             ml (more than moderate degree), respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  cancer or other significant co-morbid diseases with expected life span less than 3&#xD;
             years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  adverse effects of hydralazine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  surgical interventions of mitral regurgitation will be done in follow-up period which&#xD;
             change the course of native condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  other valvular conditions other than mitral regurgitation with severity more than or&#xD;
             equal to moderate degree, particularly mitral stenosis, and aortic&#xD;
             regurgitation/stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  lack of written informed consent.&#xD;
