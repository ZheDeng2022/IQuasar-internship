  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a 3-5 time greater prevalence of Attention Deficit&#xD;
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) than typically developing (TD) children. Despite this higher&#xD;
      risk of ADHD, rates of stimulant medication treatment are disproportionately low in children&#xD;
      with DS+ADHD, even though stimulants are the most efficacious ADHD treatment and are&#xD;
      recommended by consensus guidelines for use in children with intellectual disability and&#xD;
      ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose a pilot clinical trial to support the first randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial of stimulant medication in children with DS+ADHD. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to inform sample size estimates for the larger clinical trial. All children enrolled in the&#xD;
      study will complete a comprehensive assessment battery evaluating ADHD diagnostic criteria as&#xD;
      well as behavioral, cognitive, academic, and functional impairments. Further, children will&#xD;
      take part in the pilot methylphenidate clinical trial to inform measures retained and desired&#xD;
      sample size for the future clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a small pilot clinical trial of stimulant medication&#xD;
      treatment (i.e., methylphenidate (MPH)) in children with DS+ADHD to inform sample size&#xD;
      estimates and power calculations for a larger clinical trial. In sum, this study will&#xD;
      directly address issue related to under-utilization of stimulant treatment in children with&#xD;
      DS+ADHD, and it has the potential to significantly improve the outcomes of approximately&#xD;
      45,000 children with DS+ADHD nationwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, 30 children with DS+ADHD, between the ages of 6.00-17.99 years, will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in a pilot clinical trial across two sites. Following pre-screening to&#xD;
      determine study eligibility, children with DS+ADHD will be assessed at 14 different times&#xD;
      points. The first pre-medication visit will include baseline intelligence, diagnostic,&#xD;
      behavioral, cognitive, health, and functioning assessments. The second through sixth visits&#xD;
      will begin Phase 1 of the pilot clinical trial, and during this time, participants will begin&#xD;
      the lowest dose of MPH and titrate incrementally upward per pediatric guidelines based on the&#xD;
      participant's height and weight. Weekly diagnostic and health assessments will be conducted&#xD;
      to monitor the safety and efficacy of MPH during this phase. Further, this weekly monitoring&#xD;
      will ultimately guide the selection of the participant's optimal dose. At the seventh visit,&#xD;
      participants will enter Phase 2 of the pilot clinical trial where they will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive an optimal dose of MPH (as determined by the assessments conducted throughout the&#xD;
      titration phase) or the placebo. This visit will involve a repeat of most of the baseline&#xD;
      measures. The eighth visit will initiate Phase 3 of the pilot clinical trial in which&#xD;
      participants will crossover to the study intervention not previously assigned during Phase 2.&#xD;
      For example, a participant who was assigned his or her optimal dose during Phase 2 will&#xD;
      receive the placebo during Phase 3, and vice versa. Further, this visit will involve a repeat&#xD;
      of the assessments conducted during Phase 2 which allows each participants to serve as his or&#xD;
      her own control, contributing data both while on an optimal dose of MPH and while on the&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to commencing Phase 4, MPH non-responders or placebo responders will be removed from&#xD;
      the study and referred for non-study (clinical) treatment. Participants for whom MPH is&#xD;
      judged to be effective and tolerable based on clinician ratings and parent/teacher reports&#xD;
      will be invited to undergo an open label trial with their optimal MPH dose for a six-month&#xD;
      maintenance period. During this phase, participants will undergo monthly diagnostic and&#xD;
      health assessments to monitor the safety and efficacy of his or her optimal dose of MPH. The&#xD;
      final visit (week 31) will include diagnostic, behavioral, cognitive, functioning, and health&#xD;
      assessments to evaluate change across time.&#xD;

    <description>A 49-item parent-report measure used to assess parents and teacher perceptions of youth's school and social functioning. The first 47 items assess symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, combined inattention and hyperactivity, oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and anxiety/depression. These items are scored on a 0-3 scale (0 = Never; 1 = Occasionally; 2 = Often; 3 = Very Often). The next two items measure impairment in performance and are scored on a 1-5 scale (1 = Above Average; 3 = Average; 5 = Problematic). For both sub-scales, lower scores mean better outcomes. Data will be entered into SPSS and used as a diagnostic outcome measure.</description>
