    <textblock>
      DESIRIAL® is a CE-marketed hyaluronic acid gel intented to rehydrate vaginal and vestibular&#xD;
      mucous membranes by mucosal injections. In this study, 121 postmenopausal women of minimum&#xD;
      age 45 with symptoms associated with vulvovaginal atrophy, refusing estrogen therapies for&#xD;
      treatment of symptoms or with contraindications for such therapies, with at least one&#xD;
      moderate to severe vulvovaginal symptom among dryness sensation, dyspareunia, itching /&#xD;
      irritation and pain, who have given her informed consent and met all the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, will be enrolled. Patients will randomly receive 1 injection of DESIRIAL® or&#xD;
      placebo (ratio 2:1) in the vaginal mucosa at Day 0. If still eligible 12 weeks after,&#xD;
      patients receiving placebo at Day 0 will be treated with DESIRIAL®. Patients will come to a&#xD;
      total of 6 to 8 visits depending on the product injected at Day 0 over a period of 11 up to&#xD;
      12 months. Phone interview will be performed between 3 and 5 days after injection. Variation&#xD;
      of vulvovaginal symptomatology, sexual function, vaginal pH and safety will be assessed.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, international, multicenter study performed in 2 steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From 0 to 12 weeks: randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From 12 to 52 weeks: open label, treatment only study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess the efficacy of DESIRIAL® in reducing the vulvovaginal symptomatology&#xD;
      after a single injection. One hundred twenty one postmenopausal women of minimum age 45, with&#xD;
      symptoms associated with vulvovaginal atrophy, refusing estrogen therapies for treatment of&#xD;
      symptoms or with contraindications for such therapies, with at least one moderate to severe&#xD;
      vulvovaginal symptom among dryness sensation, dyspareunia, itching / irritation and pain, who&#xD;
      have given her informed consent and met all the eligibility criteria, will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Patients will randomly (2:1 ratio) receive a 1mL-injection of DESIRIAL® (Desirial Only group,&#xD;
      DO) or placebo (Placebo and Desirial group, PAD) in the vestibular and vaginal mucosa using&#xD;
      the multi-puncture and/or retrolinear technique at D0. If still eligible 12 weeks after,&#xD;
      patients from PAD group receiving placebo at Day 0 will be treated with DESIRIAL®. Group DO&#xD;
      will be followed up at 4, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks timepoints.Group PAD will be followed up at&#xD;
      4, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 weeks timepoints. Phone interview will be performed between 3 and 5&#xD;
      days after injection to check safety. Variation of vulvovaginal symptomatology, sexual&#xD;
      function and vaginal pH will be measured using vulvovaginal symptomatology questionnaire,&#xD;
      Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and vaginal pH indicator strip respectively. Safety will&#xD;
      also be assessed through collection of adverse events.&#xD;

FSFI consists in 19 questions with multiple-choice responses coded from 0.0 to 5.0. Each score has a specific meaning depending on the question. The scale has six sexual domains. The maximum score for each domain is 6.0, obtained by summing item responses and multiplying by a correction factor. The total composite sexual function score is a sum of domain scores and ranges from 2.0 (not sexually active and no desire) to 36.0.</description>
