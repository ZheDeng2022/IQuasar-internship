  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, single-arm, research study evaluating the effect of AMR101, as a&#xD;
      chemopreventive agent to reduce risk of colorectal cancer in individuals with a history of&#xD;
      colorectal adenoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AMR101 is made of marine omega-3 fatty acid, which is a family of natural substances&#xD;
           found in the oil of certain fish, such as salmon and mackerel. Marine omega-3 fatty acid&#xD;
           cannot be produced in sufficient amount by the human body and has to be obtained through&#xD;
           diet or supplemented to maintain normal function in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved AMR101 as a treatment for&#xD;
           any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AMR101 is commercially available in the US as VASCEPA (icosapent ethyl)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
           including evaluations and follow up visits, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lifestyle questionnaire,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nutritional survey&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Flexible sigmoidoscopy (24 biopsies of normal colorectal mucosa, one stool sample)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood samples,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AMR101 administered daily, orally for 8-12 weeks and it is expected 80 participants will&#xD;
           take part.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to&#xD;
        participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Underwent screening or surveillance colonoscopy with removal of at least one adenoma;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  This study will only include adult participants because colorectal carcinogenesis&#xD;
                  in children is more likely to be related to a cancer predisposition syndrome with&#xD;
                  distinct biological mechanisms compared with sporadic colorectal cancer in&#xD;
                  adults. Patients over age 80 will not be enrolled since the benefits and risks of&#xD;
                  AMR101 over the age of 80 have not yet been well-characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of AMR101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible&#xD;
        for admission into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently using or have used any fish oil supplement at any dose more than once per&#xD;
             week within the last month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regularly consuming more than three servings of fish per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to fish or compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to omega-3 fatty acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, liver or kidney disease, bleeding diathesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancer (including esophageal, small intestine,&#xD;
             colon, pancreatic), or any diagnosis of other cancers (with the exception of&#xD;
             nonmelanoma skin) in which there has been any active treatment within the last three&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known diagnosis of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) or Hereditary Non-Polyposis&#xD;
             Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC, Lynch Syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any adenoma that was not completely removed during previous colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known bleeding tendency/condition (e.g. von Willebrand disease) or history of peptic&#xD;
             ulcer or gastrointestinal bleed, endoscopic complications, or contraindication to&#xD;
             colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of anticoagulant therapies, including Heparin, Warfarin, Dalteparin&#xD;
             sodium,Bivalirudin, Argatroban, Lepirudin, Heparin Sodium, Heparin/Dextrose, and an&#xD;
             unwillingness or inability to discontinue anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to abstain from non-protocol use of fish oil supplements or&#xD;
             to provide blood or stool samples or colon biopsies during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to swallow pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding. The effects of AMR101 on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. For this reason,women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Similarly, lactating women are excluded from this&#xD;
             study because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AMR101. Consequently, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, or&#xD;
             acute or chronic hepatitis B infection. Participants with these infections are&#xD;
             ineligible because they are at increased risk of significant complications in the&#xD;
             perioperative period, and because fresh tissue from patients with these infections&#xD;
             cannot be harvested for research purposes, per institutional policy. Appropriate&#xD;
             studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy when indicated.&#xD;
