      The primary objectives of the study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response in terms of geometric mean&#xD;
           titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates of the SP Shz QIV compared with the SP Shz TIV&#xD;
           containing the Victoria lineage strain (TIV1) and the SP Shz TIV containing the Yamagata&#xD;
           lineage strain (TIV2) for each strain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of each dosage of SP Shz QIV, TIV1 or TIV2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (subjects 6-35 months): To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response of&#xD;
           SP Shz QIV compared to TIV2 or TIV1 group after the last dose; demonstrate the&#xD;
           superiority of the immune response of the 0.5 mL dose of SP Shz QIV compared to 0.25 mL&#xD;
           dose of SP Shz QIV group after the last dose; describe the immune response after&#xD;
           administration of the last dose of either SP Shz QIV or SP Shz TIV1 or SP Shz TIV2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Groups 2 through 5 (subjects ≥ 3 years): To demonstrate the superiority of the immune&#xD;
           response of SP Shz QIV compared to TIV2 or TIV1 group after a single dose; describe the&#xD;
           immune response after each and every dose for all subjects ≥ 3 years of either SP Shz&#xD;
           QIV or SP Shz TIV1 or SP Shz TIV2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (subjects 3 to 8 years), previously unvaccinated ,receiving SP Shz QIV: To&#xD;
           describe the immune response after administration of each dose of SP Shz QIV, first dose&#xD;
           and second dose of SP Shz QIV respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 5 (subjects ≥ 65 years only): To assess the compliance, in terms of&#xD;
           immunogenicity, of SP Shz QIV with the requirements of the CHMP NfG CPMP/BWP/214/96 in&#xD;
           subjects aged 65 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of SP Shz QIV 0.5 mL after each dose.&#xD;
