    <textblock>
      COPD and bronchiectasis share common symptoms of cough with sputum production and&#xD;
      susceptibility to recurrent exacerbations driven by new or persistent infection The overlap&#xD;
      between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis is a neglected area&#xD;
      of research, and it is not covered by guidelines for clinical practice COPD is diagnosed on&#xD;
      the basis of poorly reversible airflow obstruction and is therefore a physiological&#xD;
      diagnosis. It is defined when an objective measure of airflow obstruction is associated with&#xD;
      an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious stimuli, with cigarette smoke being&#xD;
      the most common exposure in the developed world. Operationally, this implies that patients&#xD;
      with any sufficient exposure and fixed airflow obstruction are labelled as having COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchiectasis is diagnosed in the presence of airway dilatation and airway wall thickening&#xD;
      on imaging (usually computed tomography (CT)), and is therefore a structural diagnosis.&#xD;
      Clinically significant disease is present when imaging abnormalities are associated with&#xD;
      symptoms of persistent or recurrent bronchial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      in the 2014 Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines, bronchiectasis&#xD;
      was for the first time defined as a comorbidity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD), and this change has been retained in the 2015 update, which emphasizes the influence&#xD;
      of bronchiectasis in the natural history of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of bronchiectasis in patients with COPD is high, especially in advanced&#xD;
      stages. The identification of bronchiectasis in COPD has been defined as a different clinical&#xD;
      COPD phenotype with greater symptomatic severity, more frequent chronic bronchial infection&#xD;
      and exacerbations, and poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent meta-analysis by Du et al, of 5,329 COPD patients found a greatly increased&#xD;
      exacerbation risk due to comorbid COPD with bronchiectasis compared to COPD alone.18&#xD;
      Moreover, the risk of exacerbations rose almost two times higher, colonization of the lungs&#xD;
      four times higher, severe airway obstruction 30 percent higher, and mortality two times&#xD;
      higher. It is not surprising that such elevated risks are also associated with higher&#xD;
      healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments useful in COPD may not be widely effective in bronchiectasis and vice versa.&#xD;
      Inhaled corticosteroids provide perhaps the best example of this: they are widely used in&#xD;
      COPD but not recommended for most patients with bronchiectasis . The reasons for this are&#xD;
      unclear but probably reflect, in part, the diverse aetiology underlying bronchiectasis. In&#xD;
      contrast, inhaled antibiotics, including antipseudomonal agents in appropriate patients, are&#xD;
      of benefit and appear in current bronchiectasis guidelines ,but are not used routinely in&#xD;
      stable COPD Macrolides, in addition to their antimicrobial effects, have decreased neutrophil&#xD;
      chemotaxis and infiltration into the respiratory epithelium, inhibition of transcription&#xD;
      factors leading to decreased proinflammatory cytokine production, down-regulation of adhesion&#xD;
      molecule expression, inhibition of microbial virulence factors including biofilm formation,&#xD;
      reduced generation of oxygen-free radicals, enhanced neutrophil apoptosis, and decreased&#xD;
      mucus hypersecretion with improved mucociliary clearance.&#xD;

    <description>1)-ototoxicity by whispered- voice test before starting treatment and monthly The examiner stands arm's length (0.6 m) behind the seated patient and whispers a combination of numbers and letters (for example, 4-K-2) and then asks the patient to repeat the sequence.&#xD;
If the patient responds correctly, hearing is considered normal; if the patient responds incorrectly, the test is repeated using a different number/letter combination The examiner always stands behind the patient to prevent lip reading The other ear is assessed similarly with a different combination of numbers and letters&#xD;
-2)-assessment of hepatotoxicity by measuring liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase AST, Alanine transaminase ALT (Unit/Liter)) before starting treatment and monthly.&#xD;
3)-assessment of possible prolongation of QT interval (millimeters) by ECG (electrocardiogram) before starting treatment and monthly.</description>
