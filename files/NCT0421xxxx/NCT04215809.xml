      Assess the safety and tolerability, identify dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of APG-2575.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two (2) parts and each part will consist of a ramp-up period,&#xD;
      dose escalation and dose expansion portions. The duration of the ramp-up period will depend&#xD;
      on the dose schedule being tested and will be conducted for both monotherapy and combination&#xD;
      therapy. The ramp-up will consist of treatment with APG-2575 given once a day starting at 20&#xD;
      mg on Day 1, 50 mg on Day 2, 100 mg on Day 3, 200 mg on Day 4, 400 mg on Day 5¸ 600 mg on Day&#xD;
      6, 800 mg on Day 7, 1000 mg on Day 8 and 1200 mg on Day 9. Scheduled maximum cohort doses for&#xD;
      evaluation will start at 200 mg of APG-2575 to a maximum of 1200 mg of APG-2575.&#xD;
      Consequently, patients with a scheduled maximum dose of 200 mg will have a 3-day ramp-up&#xD;
      period, those scheduled at 400 mg, a 4-day ramp-up, and those scheduled at 600 mg, a 5-day&#xD;
      ramp-up, etc, see Figure 1. Part 1 will study APG-2575 at different dose levels as&#xD;
      monotherapy using a 3+3 dose escalation design with dose expansion at RP2D. Part 2 will be&#xD;
      combination of APG-2575 with rituximab or acalabrutinib or voruciclib Part 2 will be a 3+3&#xD;
      dose escalation of combination APG-2575 plus rituximab or acalabrutinib or voruciclib.&#xD;
      Expansion cohorts at RP2D for the respective combinations will be conducted to further&#xD;
      evaluate safety and anticancer activity&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The dose escalation study of APG-2575 as monotherapy will use the standard 3+3 design. APG-2575 will be taken orally, once daily starting with a ramp-up treatment and will receive the full dose starting on Day 1 of 28-Day-Cycle 1. The starting target dose of APG-2575 is 200 mg (using ramp-up) and will be increased in subsequent cohorts to 400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg and 1200 mg accordingly.</intervention_model_description>
