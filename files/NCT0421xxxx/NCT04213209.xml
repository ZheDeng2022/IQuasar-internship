    <textblock>
      The purpose of this survey is to examine the safety of adult patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) (excluding anaplastic large cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (ALCL)) and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL or&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in the actual use of on concomitant Brentuximab Vedotin in routine&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;

      The drug being tested in this survey is called Brentuximab Vedotin intravenous infusion 50&#xD;
      mg. This intravenous infusion is being tested to treat adult patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) (excluding anaplastic large cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (ALCL)) and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL or&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This survey is an observational (non-interventional) study and will look at the safety of&#xD;
      adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL (excluding ALCL) and pediatric&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL or HL in the routine clinical&#xD;
      setting. The number of observed patients will be approximately 86 as total (80; Adult&#xD;
      participants and 6; Pediatric participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center observational survey will be conducted in Japan.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Best response is defined as the cumulative numbers of participants who achieve each level of best response including complete response (CR), complete response uncertain (CRu) (when no positron emission tomography [PET] data are available), partial response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), and Progressive Disease (PD) after treatment. Best response will be assessed by Cheson 2010 Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. PET and Computed Tomography (CT) will be used in cancer diagnosis and treatment.</description>

    <description>Best response is defined as the cumulative numbers of participants who achieve each level of best response including complete response (CR), partial response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), Progressive Disease (PD) and Not Evaluable (NE) after treatment. Best response will be assessed by Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) Response Criteria for ATLL. PET and CT will be used in cancer diagnosis and treatment.</description>

    <description>Severity grades will be evaluated as per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (NCI CTCAE). Grade 1 scales as Mild; Grade 2 scales as Moderate; Grade 3 scales as severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; Grade 4 scales as life-threatening consequences; and Grade 5 scales as death related to AE.</description>
