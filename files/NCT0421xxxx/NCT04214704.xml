    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the benefits of a painless lancing device among&#xD;
      diabetes subjects in improving self-monitoring frequency and HbA1c compared to the&#xD;
      conventional lancing device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-monitoring of glucose forms the cornerstone of diabetes management. There are multiple&#xD;
      limiting factors towards efficient self- monitoring of blood glucose, including cost&#xD;
      barriers, inconvenience, investment of time, pain associated with pricking etc. Pain has&#xD;
      perceived as a major impediment to the self-monitoring of blood glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genteel lancing device offers a painless pricking experience and hence helps to report blood&#xD;
      sugar values at least 4 times a day. The perceived pain sensitivity of the study subjects&#xD;
      would be assessed using the 4- point pain screening questionnaire during the course of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to gather information on the percentage reduction in HbA1c values in&#xD;
      diabetes patients as compared to the baseline values after three months and six months&#xD;
      respectively brought about by percentage SMBG adherence, defined as the percentage of total&#xD;
      recorded SMBG values as compared to the ideal number of readings over the 24-week period.&#xD;
      SMBG adherence = actual number of fingerpricks (6 times daily in type 1 subjects or twice&#xD;
      weekly in type 2 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMBG adherence can be provisionally attained by multiple pricking using painless Genteel&#xD;
      lancing device compared to the conventional lancing device. Additionally, the subject is&#xD;
      asked about the likelihood they would use the device if available for routine SMBG practice&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;

    <description>Percentage SMBG adherence, defined as the percentage of total recorded SMBG values as compared to the ideal number of readings over the 24-week period.SMBG adherence = actual number of fingerpricks/ ideal number of fingerpricks(6 times daily in type 1 subjects or twice weekly in type 2 subjects). Should be assessed both at baseline and end of 24 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subject's Subjective Assessment of pain after using the Genteel device in comparison to conventional SMBG devices would be recorded using a pain scale.&#xD;
The scale for pain sensation is as follows:&#xD;
Elimination&#xD;
Significant reduction&#xD;
Slight reduction&#xD;
No change&#xD;
Mild worsening of pain&#xD;
Significant worsening of pain&#xD;
The above values are computed relative to the worst pain the subject can think of at a score of 6.</description>

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subject is asked about the likelihood they would use the device if available for routine SMBG practices in the future. Scale for predicting future (probability) use of device for SMBG is as follows:&#xD;
Definitely yes&#xD;
Probably yes&#xD;
Not sure&#xD;
Probably no&#xD;
Definitely no&#xD;
The above values are computed relative to the worst probability this device would not be used in future at a score of 5.</description>
