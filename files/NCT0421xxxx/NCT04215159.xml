  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HER2 signaling pathway abnormalities or HER2 overexpression can be seen in various types of&#xD;
      solid tumors apart from breast cancer or hepatic cancer. In this regardHER2 targeting therapy&#xD;
      has been proven to be effective in colorectal cancer, gallbladder cancer, and salivary gland&#xD;
      tumors. Although HER2 targeted-treatment Trastuzumab biosimilar is clinically being used&#xD;
      after gaining official permission recently, clinical data for this use is still lacking,&#xD;
      especially regarding experiences of combination with various cytotoxic chemotherapy agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, techniques to separate and extract a small sized ciculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in&#xD;
      patient's blood originated from a tumor is being developed and improved along with&#xD;
      introduction of Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique enabling a comprehensive genetic&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Trastuzumab biosimiler and to&#xD;
      investigate the association between ctDNA and clinical outcomes such as disease response,&#xD;
      progression-free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;

      Samfenet is a biosimilar of trastuzumab and received marketing approval based on the results&#xD;
      of efficacy equivalence to trastuzumab. This study is a phase 2 study to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of Samfenet in combination with cytotoxic agents in patients with HER2-positive&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 42 patients will be enrolled. Treatment will be continues until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal. Tumor evaluation will be performed&#xD;
      at every 8 weeks during treatment, and then at every 12 weeks thereafter end of study.&#xD;
