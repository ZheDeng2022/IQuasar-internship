  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study of 1,000 subjects with known or suspected cancer&#xD;
      and 2,000 subjects with no known cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be asked questions to confirm their eligibility by a nurse&#xD;
      navigator, study staff member, or physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be carried out for eligible subjects in accordance with applicable&#xD;
      federal regulations and International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)/Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      (GCP) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then complete a survey, and study staff will draw 60 mL of blood and measure&#xD;
      the height and weight of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where available, data from the medical records of the cancer subjects will reviewed and&#xD;
      collected. In addition, non-cancer subjects will be requested to allow access to their&#xD;
      medical records as an optional portion of their informed consent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study of 1,000 subjects with known or suspected cancer&#xD;
      confirmed through pathology reports and/or clinical/radiographic data and 2,000 subjects with&#xD;
      no known cancer. De-identified blood samples and clinical data will be collected from&#xD;
      subjects to validate a classification algorithm for a new version of the CancerSEEK assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be asked questions to confirm their eligibility by a nurse&#xD;
      navigator, study staff member, or physician to document screening including date of upcoming&#xD;
      therapy or surgery for cancer patients if one has been scheduled, before providing informed&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study. Study procedures outside of the pre-screening for&#xD;
      eligibility will not be performed prior to the subject providing consent. Informed consent&#xD;
      will be carried out in accordance with applicable federal regulations and International&#xD;
      Council for Harmonisation (ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. Prior to signing the&#xD;
      informed consent form (ICF), potential participants will confirm that they understand the&#xD;
      study and that they have no questions about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ICF may be offered by paper or electronically with the option to also review a paper copy&#xD;
      provided by the nurse navigator or study coordinator either face-to-face on a tablet or via&#xD;
      email. Potential participants will be given a phone number to call with any study specific&#xD;
      questions. Copies of all signed consent forms will be stored centrally in a secure&#xD;
      environment, and signed consent forms will thereby be available for verification by Thrive or&#xD;
      its designee at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the subject completes the survey, study staff will complete the blood draw and collect&#xD;
      height and weight data. For some participants, their contact information and unique study&#xD;
      identifier (ID) will be sent securely to a third-party vendor who will contact the subject&#xD;
      within 24 hours to schedule the blood draw and height and weight measurements at a location&#xD;
      convenient to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all subjects, study staff and the third-party vendor performing the blood collection will&#xD;
      verify the following before performing the blood draw and height and weight measurements:&#xD;
      participant identity and age against a form of identification, that consent to participate&#xD;
      has been given, that the participants in the cancer arm are still treatment naïve, and that&#xD;
      they do not have a fever that could be caused by an infection. The blood collection vendor&#xD;
      will ensure all required data are captured and included with the blood sample, that the&#xD;
      sample is collected and packaged according to laboratory manual specifications, and that the&#xD;
      sample is shipped to the indicated processing lab with the required expediency. Following all&#xD;
      study visits, study staff and third party vendor staff will complete a visit checklist&#xD;
      confirming all of the study activities that occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the Cancer cohort will be identified via nurse navigation, study staff or&#xD;
      oncology physicians in local offices. The nurse navigator or study staff will verify&#xD;
      eligibility through chart review and pre-screen, approach the subject about the study&#xD;
      opportunity, and present the informed consent form. For participants enrolling&#xD;
      electronically, participants will be presented with a secured tablet device on which the&#xD;
      subject will watch a brief video about the study, read the informed consent and provide&#xD;
      electronic consent. Some participants may also have the option of having the video, informed&#xD;
      consent and survey emailed to them. Upon consent and enrollment, subjects will be assigned a&#xD;
      unique subject study ID, which will be used to track the subject, their data and their&#xD;
      biospecimen throughout study operations. Consented subjects will then be directed to complete&#xD;
      a survey via the tablet device, email or paper. Participants will be allowed to skip&#xD;
      questions in the survey or select the answer option &quot;prefer not to answer.&quot; Subject data will&#xD;
      be tracked in real-time by central study staff to ensure desired tumor type diversification&#xD;
      and communicate enrollment strategy changes to the nurse navigators and study staff.&#xD;
