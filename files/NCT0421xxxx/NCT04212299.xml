  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot research project is to evaluate the effect of prosthetic socket&#xD;
      design on amputated limb hip muscle strength and endurance in Service members, Veterans, and&#xD;
      civilians who use above-the-knee prostheses. Traditional above-the-knee socket designs&#xD;
      provide pelvic support that interferes with hip motion. They may also reduce the effort&#xD;
      required from amputated limb hip muscles to stabilize the hip and amputated limb, risking&#xD;
      further loss of muscle mass and strength beyond that due to amputation. Long-standing use of&#xD;
      above-the-knee sockets with pelvic support may therefore intensify amputated limb muscle loss&#xD;
      and weakness, leading to challenges with walking and balance, increasing the effort required&#xD;
      to walk, and contributing to degenerative changes in the hips and knees. Alternative socket&#xD;
      designs that lessen the loss of muscle mass and strength are therefore required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a new socket without pelvic support for above-the-knee&#xD;
      prosthesis users called the Northwestern University Flexible Sub-Ischial Suction (NU-FlexSIS)&#xD;
      Socket. This new socket design increases user comfort and is often preferred by users over&#xD;
      sockets with pelvic support. This new socket does not lessen the mechanical function of the&#xD;
      socket, or walking and balance performance. Our recent research suggests that walking with&#xD;
      this new socket may also increase amputated limb hip muscle size. However, more research is&#xD;
      needed to demonstrate that this new socket design improves amputated limb hip muscle strength&#xD;
      and endurance, leading to better function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A socket design that increases amputated limb hip muscle strength and endurance would provide&#xD;
      a simple way to restore amputated limb hip muscle weakness in above-the-knee prosthesis&#xD;
      users. Despite a considerable decrease in hip muscle size and strength due to amputation&#xD;
      surgery, amputated limb hip muscles are expected to compensate for the loss of knee and ankle&#xD;
      function by providing stability and propulsion during walking. Walking in the new socket&#xD;
      design without pelvic support is expected to increase amputated limb hip muscle strength and&#xD;
      endurance, providing an appealing alternative to traditional resistance training in order to&#xD;
      retain hip muscle strength. Unlike traditional resistance training, using this new socket&#xD;
      design would not require additional time or equipment, and may be effective just by walking&#xD;
      in the home, community, or workplace. Due to existing infrastructure (e.g., ongoing clinical&#xD;
      adoption of the NU-FlexSIS Socket, existing instructional materials and courses for&#xD;
      fabrication and fitting of the NU-FlexSIS Socket, as well as a continuing partnership with&#xD;
      Chicago's largest provider of prosthetic clinical care), the investigators anticipate being&#xD;
      able to translate our research results to clinical practice by the end of the project period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect the results of the proposed pilot research project to directly and&#xD;
      positively benefit the health and well-being of Service members, Veterans, and civilians who&#xD;
      are above-the-knee prosthesis users. Benefits of increasing amputated limb hip muscle&#xD;
      strength and endurance may include: i) improved control over the prosthesis, ii) better&#xD;
      balance, iii) reduced effort to walk, and iv) protection against joint degeneration. For&#xD;
      Service members these benefits could improve their performance on challenging and/or uneven&#xD;
      ground, and increase the distance and speed they can walk or run. For Veterans, these&#xD;
      benefits could lead to greater independence during activities of daily living, and fewer&#xD;
      falls, reducing the physical and emotional burden on family members and caregivers.&#xD;
