  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who are born early (pre-term infants) are at increased risk of fractures until the&#xD;
      age of 2 years, due to their weak bones caused by several physiological, and environmental&#xD;
      factors.There is however little information about the persistence of this increased risk of&#xD;
      fractures in childhood. There is also lack of detail in the medical literature about the&#xD;
      gestational age at birth of children presenting to hospitals with fractures, the nature of&#xD;
      their fractures and the differences in fracture features, if any, between the preterm and&#xD;
      term (infants born at 37 weeks and above) children. This information would be especially&#xD;
      useful for doctors when deciding if a fracture with no other obvious explanation in a preterm&#xD;
      child is caused by an accidental or inflicted injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This dilemma is complicated by reports that preterm children are more likely to be subjected&#xD;
      to abuse as compared to term children. Furthermore, infants less than a year old are more&#xD;
      likely to be abused, and this coincides with the time when preterm infants are most&#xD;
      vulnerable. Hence it is important to collect information about the physical examination,&#xD;
      chemical substances in their blood and x-ray features of fractures in preterm children. Also&#xD;
      important to study is whether there are differences in how accidental and inflicted fractures&#xD;
      present in term and preterm children, as certain findings in term children might not apply in&#xD;
      the context of prematurity. Determining if preterm birth is a major cause for childhood&#xD;
      fractures is also especially relevant to the medico legal profession. When there is a&#xD;
      suspected inflicted fracture in an ex-preterm child, the outcome could depend on whether&#xD;
      prematurity is an adequate explanation for fractures. We would like to collect, study and&#xD;
      present detailed information on the differences in causes and patterns of accidental and&#xD;
      inflicted fractures in both preterm and term children. This could lend support to medical&#xD;
      opinions offered in medico legal proceedings in which child abuse is alleged in preterm&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;

      This is a retrospective study involving only data collection and no patient contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from both Sheffield Children's Hospital Accident and Emergency&#xD;
      Department and Jessop Hospital. The coding office will be contacted for a list of children&#xD;
      below the age of 2 presenting to SCH with a fracture from January 2005 to December 2015, and&#xD;
      a list of children born in Jessop Hospital over the same time period. By comparing both lists&#xD;
      and selecting the matching cohort, we will have a list of those children (below the age of 2,&#xD;
      preterm or term) born in Jessop Hospital who presented to SCH with a fracture over the last&#xD;
      10 years. The clinical notes of these patients will be accessed electronically and through&#xD;
      their clinical files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jessop:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consultant employed by Jessop hospital or with the appropriate HR arrangement with the&#xD;
      Trust will retrieve numbers of all pre-term babies born between Jan 2005 and Dec 2014 from&#xD;
      the Jessop database and collect the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A named researcher will retrieve NHS numbers of all children( both term and pre-term) less&#xD;
      than 2 years of age presenting with a fracture between Jan 2005 and Dec 2014 from Sheffield&#xD;
      Children's Hospital Coding Office and collect the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI of the study will cross match both records and identify the common cohort and assign&#xD;
      one patient study identification number for each NHS number which should be used across both&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A named researcher will collect data from both Sheffield Children's Hospital Accident and&#xD;
      Emergency Department and Jessop Hospital as outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS. Descriptive for age, sex, gestation,&#xD;
      ethnicity, and diagnosis; Chi-square for categorical data, with the possibility of regression&#xD;
      analysis on advice of a statistician.&#xD;
