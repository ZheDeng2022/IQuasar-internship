  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CCR2 is a significant prognostic biomarker in head and neck cancer. Currently there is no&#xD;
      clinical biomarker to study CCR2, its prognostic significance or to select patients for&#xD;
      CCR2-targeted therapy and to monitor response to such therapy. The investigators have&#xD;
      developed a CCR2 specific PET radiotracer based on the peptide, ECL1i (d(LGTFLKC)) and&#xD;
      radiolabeled with 64Cu (64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i). The investigators have found that 64Cu-DOTA-ELC1i&#xD;
      specific binding has been demonstrated in human head and neck cancer tissue.&#xD;

    <description>-Overall image quality will be graded on a 4 point scale with 1 being the worse and poor quality, not acceptable for diagnostic interpretation and 4 being good image quality, similar to routine clinical studies</description>

    <measure>Diagnostic quality of 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i-PET/CT images as measured by presence of absence of abnormal 64Cu-DOT-ECL1i uptake in pathologically proven site of disease</measure>

    <time_frame>At the time of standard of care surgery (estimated to be within 2 weeks of imaging)</time_frame>
    <description>-Intensity of CCR2 signal in IHC will be assessed by the study pathologist and categorized into 4 categories (0=absent/faint, 1=weak, 2=moderate, 3=strong). Any cells that stained positively with CCR2 will be assessed and the final score will be based on an overall assessment of CCR2 IHC on all of these cells.</description>
