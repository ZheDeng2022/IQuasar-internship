      Treatment, Prospective, Assignment, Open Label, Single-center, Non-randomized Study An&#xD;
      exploratory clinical trial of comparison of Nab-Paclitaxel combined with Gemcitabine and&#xD;
      Gemcitabine combined with Tegafur for adjuvant chemotherapy after radical resection of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of less than&#xD;
      5%. About 25% of patients have the opportunity for radically surgical resection when&#xD;
      diagnosis. However, the recurrence rate is up to 85% within 2 years. Data from clinical&#xD;
      trials indicated that gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy reduced recurrence and enhanced&#xD;
      overall survival for patients who have undergone surgery to remove their tumor.&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel could significantly increase the concentration of gemcitabine in the tumor;&#xD;
      recent studies showed that nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine significantly improved&#xD;
      progression-free survival and overall survival of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. A&#xD;
      study in Japan and Taiwan compared the efficacy of gemcitabine in combination with tegafur in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The median progression-free&#xD;
      survival was significantly better in the gemcitabine combined with the tegafur group than in&#xD;
      the gemcitabine group. The present study is intended to observe the effect of albumin&#xD;
      paclitaxel combined with gemcitabine and tegafur combined with gemcitabine on recurrence-free&#xD;
      survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma undergoing radical resection.&#xD;
