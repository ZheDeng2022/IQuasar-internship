  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive multisystem disorder characterized by abnormalities in&#xD;
      the transport of chloride ions in human airway epithelial cells, leading to frequent lung&#xD;
      infections, decreased pulmonary function, inability to properly digest food and absorb&#xD;
      essential nutrients, and complications with many organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CF spend hours daily, in treatments required to manage their disease, including&#xD;
      hours of physiotherapy and inhalation and treatment with many daily pills. CF treatment load&#xD;
      heavy burden on patients and families and the inevitable consequence of these treatment&#xD;
      demands is widespread non-adherence to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CFTR modulators (trade name Kalydeco, Orkambi, Simdeco) is a highly efficient drug approved&#xD;
      to treat CF in patients with certain mutations. It is the first drug that treats the&#xD;
      underlying cause rather than the symptoms of the disease. It is also one of the most&#xD;
      expensive drugs, costing over $300,000 per patient per year. Despite of its proven efficacy&#xD;
      and approved reimbursement for certain patients, non-adherence is common among CF patients,&#xD;
      resulting from the heavy burden of daily treatment required to manage CF disease.&#xD;

      ReX is a hand-held, mobile device intended to provide solid oral medication on patient's&#xD;
      demand according to a pre-programmed treatment protocol. ReX addresses poor patient&#xD;
      adherence, tracks patient's response to treatment and enhances patient engagement to therapy.&#xD;
      The system comprises a reusable drug dispensing unit (Dispenser), a disposable Cassette&#xD;
      containing the prescribed medication, a cellphone app, and the ReX cloud. The Dispenser&#xD;
      manages pill administration. It includes a touch screen which guides the user and presents&#xD;
      patient-specific clinical surveys and therapy information. The Dispenser contains a&#xD;
      chargeable battery and indicators demonstrating device and battery status; a pill window&#xD;
      enabling pills to be viewed; operational sensors; and communication to an app on cellphones.&#xD;
      The patient receives the Cassette from the pharmacy, pre-filled with his/her specific&#xD;
      medication. The Cassette is inserted into the Dispenser where it is locked in place. All&#xD;
      therapy and patient survey data are transferred to a patient-specific domain on DosentRx'&#xD;
      proprietary web-based cloud, named ReX cloud.&#xD;
