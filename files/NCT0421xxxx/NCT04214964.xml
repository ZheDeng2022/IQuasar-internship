      Gynecological tumors are serious threats to women's health. Ovarian Cancer (OC), uterine and&#xD;
      cervical malignancies (c-uc) are common gynecological malignancies, which are featured by&#xD;
      high morbidity and mortality, limited late-stage efficacy, easy recurrence and drug&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real World Study (RWS) refers to the study based on a large sample size (covering&#xD;
      representative subjects), according to the actual condition, carry out evaluation for a long&#xD;
      time, and pay attention to the outcome of treatment, meaningful to further evaluate external&#xD;
      validity and safety of the intervention measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      this study is devoted to the provide the real world evidence for the clinical treatment of&#xD;

      Randomized clinical trials（RCT）are representative traditional clinical studies with high&#xD;
      internal validity but limited external validity. Originated in the effectiveness of clinical&#xD;
      trials, Real World Study (RWS) refers to the study based on a large sample size (covering&#xD;
      representative subjects), according to the actual condition and will not randomly chosen&#xD;
      treatment measures, carry out evaluation for a long time, and pay attention to the outcome of&#xD;
      treatment, meaningful to further evaluate external validity and safety of the intervention&#xD;
      measures. The real world research covers the etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis,&#xD;
      providing the maximum reference for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical patients. Now the&#xD;
      application of RWS in oncology is getting more and more attention. In the current information&#xD;
      era, Big Data (BD) technology is gradually applied and popularized. To build a disease&#xD;
      database platform, collect, manage and process big data in the diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      process in the real world, and conduct RWS on the basis of the platform, will be of great&#xD;
      enlightenment to clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gynecological tumors are serious threats to women's health. Ovarian Cancer (OC), uterine and&#xD;
      cervical malignancies (c-uc) are common gynecological malignancies, which are featured by&#xD;
      high morbidity and mortality, limited late-stage efficacy, easy recurrence and drug&#xD;
      resistance, etc., causing serious difficulties to gynecological oncologists and scholars.&#xD;
      Asia is one of the regions with high incidence of ovarian cancer, uterine body malignancy and&#xD;
      cervical cancer. In China, the incidence of uterine body malignancies including endometrial&#xD;
      cancer and rare gynecological tumors (such as ovarian sarcoma, endometrial sarcoma,&#xD;
      transparent cell carcinoma, etc.) is increasing. New cases and deaths from ovarian cancer&#xD;
      remain high. At present, no effective early screening and diagnosis method has been found,&#xD;
      and the recurrence rate is high after treatment, and the prognosis of patients is poor.At&#xD;
      present, the standard treatment for ovarian cancer is surgery, supplemented by postoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy. At present, researches at home and abroad mainly focus on the advantages and&#xD;
      disadvantages of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, secondary surgery for&#xD;
      tumor recurrence and lymph node resection. Based on the results of the study, such as LION&#xD;
      and SOLO - 1, NCCN ovarian cancer clinical practice guidelines (2019 version 1)&quot; have&#xD;
      important update in ovarian cancer surgery way, heat abdominal cavity perfusion chemotherapy&#xD;
      and maintenance treatment, most of these progress comes from the RCTs, the evidence whether&#xD;
      patients in reality benefit from this, is still limited. In addition, due to the cancer&#xD;
      chemotherapy adverse reactions and the complications of patients, antibiotics, NSAIDS,&#xD;
      corticosteroids, colony stimulating factors are common taken, in recent years, the auxiliary&#xD;
      medicine's influence on the prognosis of malignant tumor has caused the attention of people,&#xD;
      their impact for the treatment and prognosis of ovarian cancer and other gynecological&#xD;
      malignant tumors is not yet clear. Real-world studies can provide further clinical evidence.&#xD;
      There is still a lack of corresponding big data research on the treatment methods of ovarian&#xD;
      cancer and uterine body malignant tumor (endometrial cancer and rare uterine body tumor) in&#xD;
      China. The establishment of big data platform and platform-based RWS will build the disease&#xD;
      database of gynecological malignant tumor in China and get the corresponding RWE to better&#xD;
      support clinical diagnosis and treatment. This is a multi-center real world study in China,&#xD;
      from January 2002 to December 2022, all medical records of patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      gynecological malignant tumor (ovarian malignant tumor or uterine body malignant tumor) by&#xD;
      pathology or cytology will be collected, and the data in the actual medical records be&#xD;
      analyzed to summarize the characteristics of relevant diseases and diagnosis and treatment,&#xD;
      to further evaluate the evolution of the diagnosis and treatment model of gynecological&#xD;
      malignancies (ovarian malignancies/uterine malignancies) in China in the real world, as well&#xD;
      as the safety and effectiveness of different treatment models in the clinical treatment of&#xD;
      patients, to evaluate the influence of auxiliary drugs (eg, aspirin, antibiotics, granulocyte&#xD;
      colony stimulating factor (g-csf), glucocorticoids, etc.) for survival, to analysis the risk&#xD;
      factors of Chinese gynecology malignant tumor (ovarian malignant tumor or uterine body tumor)&#xD;
      and build China gynecology malignant tumor patients' prognosis prediction model, and&#xD;
      summarize the rare gynecology malignant tumor (such as ovarian tumor, endometrial sarcoma,&#xD;
      clear cell carcinoma, etc.)'s diagnosis and treatment patterns and risk factors, analyze&#xD;
      Chinese gynecology malignant tumor (ovarian malignant tumor or uterine body tumor) in&#xD;
      patients with gene mutation spectrum, etc. this study is devoted to the provide the real&#xD;
      world evidence for the clinical treatment of gynecological malignant tumors in China.&#xD;
