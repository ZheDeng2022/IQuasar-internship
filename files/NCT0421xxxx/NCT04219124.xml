    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised double blind placebo control cross over trial with 4 weeks washout&#xD;
      period. The expected duration of participant participation is 103 days. the study aims to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of dapagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, on glucose flux, lipolysis and&#xD;
      exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      SGLT2 inhibitors are a new class of drug that have a novel mechanism of action by promoting&#xD;
      urinary glucose excretion to lower blood glucose levels. The recent observations that&#xD;
      ketogenesis or episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis seem to be of higher frequency in patients&#xD;
      with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes on SGLT2 inhibitors, is of considerable worldwide interest.&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitors seem to be associated with euglycemic DKA and ketosis, perhaps because of&#xD;
      their noninsulin-dependent glucose clearance, hyperglucagonemia, and volume depletion. There&#xD;
      have been two papers that have looked at this in some detail. One is a metabolic study by&#xD;
      Ferrannini et al and a review paper by Yabe et al. The central question that needs to be&#xD;
      raised is whether the observed effects are solely due to the SGLT2 inhibitors masking&#xD;
      elevations in blood glucose in insulin deficient states, or whether there is some metabolic&#xD;
      effect of the SGLT2 inhibitors that make episodes more likely to occur. There is increasing&#xD;
      evidence to suggest that the SGLT2 inhibitors are affecting metabolism in several ways and&#xD;
      that these may contribute to the risk of ketoacidosis. Ferrannini et al have shown that, on&#xD;
      chronic usage, lipid oxidation rates change and thus the body appears to have a homeostatic&#xD;
      response to losing glucose by switching metabolism more in favour of free fatty acids. It is&#xD;
      also possible that protein and other metabolites are also involved in this process but these&#xD;
      have never been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent trials of newer glucose-lowering agents have been neutral on the primary&#xD;
      Cardiovascular (CV) outcome. However, patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular events who received empagliflozin, as compared with placebo, had a lower rate&#xD;
      of the primary composite cardiovascular outcome and of death from any cause when the study&#xD;
      drug was added to standard care. This may be a class effect and is of high importance to&#xD;
      explore the effects of SGLT2 inhibitor effect on cardiovascular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To study the metabolic adaptions that take place following chronic administration of&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitors in people with Type 2 diabetes and to establish whether these adaptations&#xD;
      contribute to the development of ketoacidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment phase will commence as soon as there is ethical, HRA, research governance and&#xD;
      regulatory approval and only after the Sponsor 'green light' has been issued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: From Diabetes Clinics at Cedar centre, Royal Surrey County Hospital and&#xD;
      additional locations: local GP practices, other healthcare settings including but not limited&#xD;
      to outpatient clinics, retinal screening, podiatry, diabetes patient groups, University of&#xD;
      Surrey staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened by the diabetes research team, which includes research doctors&#xD;
      and nurses working at the Cedar centre research unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent- The participant will have a minimum of 24hours to consider participation in&#xD;
      the study to consider the information, and the opportunity to question the Investigator,&#xD;
      their GP or other independent parties to decide whether to participate in the study. Written&#xD;
      Informed Consent will then be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the individual fulfils the inclusion criteria and meets none of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
      they will be accepted into the study. All females of childbearing age will need to provide a&#xD;
      urine sample for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and pulse will be taken in line with the&#xD;
      Cedar centre SOP. Any abnormal or clinically significant deterioration will be reported as an&#xD;
      adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight and height will be recorded at screening visit and weight only at visits 2- 6. Weight&#xD;
      (without shoes) will be measured using body composition analyser. Height (without shoes)&#xD;
      recorded using a stand-alone stadiometer for height measurement, manufacturer unknown. Body&#xD;
      Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated and rounded up/down to nearest whole figure at each&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination will be carried out. Any abnormal, clinically significant findings at&#xD;
      screening visit must be recorded as concomitant illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If acute kidney injury occurs, the study medication will be promptly discontinued and kidney&#xD;
      impairment treated using standard guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Tests Point of care or plasma HbA1C within 1 month of the screening visit. All&#xD;
      laboratory results will be reviewed, and the reports signed by the Investigator or delegate&#xD;
      in accordance with the delegation log, who will record in the CRF whether they are normal,&#xD;
      abnormal but not clinically significant, or abnormal and clinically significant. In the&#xD;
      latter case the eligibility of the participants will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bloods samples analysed at University of Surrey will be viewed as bloods of research&#xD;
      significance and not reported to the GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: week 1: Baseline VO2 max test A VO2 max test will be used to tailor exercise&#xD;
      intensity to each participant. This exercise intensity information will be used for visit 3&#xD;
      and 5 when the exercise test is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will use an exercise bike and wear a mask and mouthpiece. Participants will&#xD;
      perform a 5min warm up at 25% VO2 max. The submaximal exercise test using a 2-stage bicycle&#xD;
      ergometer protocol will consist of two consecutive 10min stages at a constant load&#xD;
      corresponding to 40 and 70 % VO2 max followed by 5 min warm down. In addition, measurements&#xD;
      relating to heart function will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 and 5: Exercise test Participants will have a standardised meal the evening before&#xD;
      the exercise test and will arrive at the laboratory after an overnight fast. The standardised&#xD;
      meal is 500-kcal meal, which will be provided by the study team for the participant to&#xD;
      prepare and cook at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cannula will be inserted into an antecubital vein and baseline blood samples taken at times&#xD;
      0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 60 min before, during and after exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a set duration of exercise on the exercise bike. The&#xD;
      duration and intensity will have been calculated from the results of visit 2. They will wear&#xD;
      a mouthpiece and mask throughout and be attached to a cardiac monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measurements will be taken before and during/after exercise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentrations, atrial natriuretic peptide,&#xD;
           noradrenaline and adrenaline (n=8 for each measurement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma glucose, insulin and growth hormone concentrations (n=8 for each measurement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ketone body and metabolite concentrations (n=8 for each measurement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG trace&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BP, HR and Rate Pressure Product (RPP=HR*SBP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculated substrate oxidation recorded as VO2 ml/min and VCO2 ml/min and resting energy&#xD;
           requirement (RER)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capillary lactate concentration Visit 4 and 6: The Metabolic Assessment Day (8-10 hours)&#xD;
           Participants will have taken the randomised study treatment daily for 28 days prior to&#xD;
           visit 4 and 6. Blood glucose study diaries will be collected at visit 4 and 6.&#xD;
           Hypoglycaemia events will be reviewed. Data from their home glucose monitoring will not&#xD;
           be collected for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants should refrain from alcohol and strenuous exercise for 24hours prior to any&#xD;
      metabolic assessment day. If female of childbearing age, a urine pregnancy test will be&#xD;
      undertaken prior to the commencement of any metabolic study activity. Blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate will be recorded. Participants will be asked to return their unused IMP at visit 4&#xD;
      and visit 6. They will be prescribed the IMP required for the second arm of the study&#xD;
      depending on the randomisation code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a standardised meal the evening before the metabolic assessment day&#xD;
      and will attend the clinical research unit at 7.00am on the morning of the assessment day&#xD;
      after an overnight fast. Blood glucose concentration will be measured using a glucose oxidase&#xD;
      technique on a glucose analyser (YSI 2300 Clandon Scientific, Yellow Springs Instruments,&#xD;
      Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA). Hydration may be maintained by insertion of an intravenous fluid&#xD;
      drip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood samples will be separated immediately using a centrifuge (Heraeus Labofuge 400&#xD;
      centrifuge, Thermo Fisher Scientific. UK) and the plasma stored at -20°c at the Cedar centre&#xD;
      overnight and then transferred to a minus -80°c freezer at the University of Surrey for&#xD;
      analysis later at the University of Surrey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Assessment Day Blood samples will be as shown in Appendix A. The samples will be&#xD;
      used for measuring different metabolites and hormones at various time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous cannulae will be inserted into the antecubital fossa of each arm: one for blood&#xD;
      taking at time -15 minutes and the other for the infusion of the isotopes [6,6]- 2H2 glucose&#xD;
      and [1,1,2,3,3]- 2H5 glycerol at time 360 minutes. Two fasting samples will be taken at -10&#xD;
      and 0 for the baseline isotope enrichment for glucose, glycerol and palmitate and NEFA and&#xD;
      ketone body concentrations and various hormone concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 0 minutes the study medication will be taken and a stable isotope of U-13C palmitate&#xD;
      (200mg) in 30 ml olive oil will be ingested in less than 2 minutes after which blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken for palmitate enrichment and concentration in TAG and NEFA pools and TAG and&#xD;
      NEFA concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A primed infusion of stable isotope of glucose and glycerol will be given from 360 to 480&#xD;
      minutes and the concentration and enrichment of both glucose and glycerol will be measured&#xD;
      from 450 minutes to 480 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be taken for glucose concentration throughout the study. Blood samples for&#xD;
      acetoacetate concentration and beta-hydroxybutyrate enrichment and concentration will be&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One blood sample will be taken at 480 minutes for targeted metabolomics and cardiac&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for will also be taken for insulin, glucagon and cortisol. Patients will be&#xD;
      asked to empty their bladder and urine will be collected to analyse glucose excretion at 120,&#xD;
      360, 450 and 480 minutes (4 samples).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Transthoracic Echocardiogram and pulse wave velocity will be completed during the metabolic&#xD;
      assessment day. This can be done at any time point during the metabolic assessment day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On completion of the metabolic assessment day, participants will be reminded that they have&#xD;
      the telephone number for the research team that can be used 24hours a day (identification&#xD;
      card) and will be advised not to drive home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a minimum period of a 28-day drug wash out period before starting the second&#xD;
      arm of the study. The participant will be dispensed with trial medication for the second arm&#xD;
      at visit 4. A date will be agreed for visit 5 and 6 to allow the study doctor to advise when&#xD;
      the participant should to start taking the study medication in preparation for visit 5 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone Visits 1 and 2 The research team will contact the participant the day after each&#xD;
      metabolic assessment day to ensure glucose levels have normalised. This may be a Saturday if&#xD;
      a metabolic study is conducted on a Friday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone Visit 3 Once participants have completed both metabolic assessments days the&#xD;
      participant will have completed the research study protocol. Each participant will receive a&#xD;
      follow up check on well-being 2-4 weeks after completion of the last metabolic assessment day&#xD;
      and will continue their diabetes care with their usual diabetes doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant withdraws from the study, all samples will be destroyed but the anonymised&#xD;
      data collected up to the point of withdrawal will be used unless explicitly stated by the&#xD;
      participant. The study doctor may also decide that it is no longer appropriate for a&#xD;
      participant to continue with the study. This will happen if they no longer meet the&#xD;
      requirements for the study or exclusion criteria become apparent. The participant will be&#xD;
      required to withdraw from the study if they become pregnant or lose capacity to follow the&#xD;
      study procedures and provide consent to continue.&#xD;
