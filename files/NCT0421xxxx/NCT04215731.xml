  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multimodality treatment that comprises preoperative fluoropyrimidine with concurrent&#xD;
      radiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery and adjuvant&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is recommended as a standard treatment of patients with&#xD;
      stage II/III rectal cancer. However, the main target of radiotherapy is local control but no&#xD;
      improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) has been shown with this&#xD;
      treatment strategy, which leaves approximately 30% of patients in whom distant metastases&#xD;
      will develop. Moreover, the short- and long-term adverse effects of radiotherapy such as&#xD;
      chronic pain, faecal incontinence and urogenital/anal dysfunction are associated with poor&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neadajuvant chemotherpay (NACT) alone has been proposed instead of preoperative&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with the aim of elimination of potential micrometastasis as early as&#xD;
      possible while avoiding the adverse effects of radiotherapy, without jeopardizing local&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence from the UK CR07 trial suggests that, without RT, a local recurrence rate of 5%&#xD;
      (27/543) can be achieved if a complete mesorectal excision is carried out with a negative&#xD;
      CRM. A small single-center phase II pilot trial treated patients with stage II or III rectal&#xD;
      cancer with induction FOLFOX/bevacizumab chemotherapy followed by CRT only in those with&#xD;
      stable or progressive disease and resection in all patients. All 32 of the participants had&#xD;
      an R0 resection, and the 4-year DFS was 84%. Another phase II trial, which included 60&#xD;
      patients with stage II/III rectal cancer, assessed the R0 resection rate after FOLFOX plus&#xD;
      either bevacizumab or cetuximab. An R0 resection was achieved in 98.3% of the participants,&#xD;
      and the pathologic complete response rate was 16.7%. The phase III FOWARC trial, compared&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy with and without radiation and found that perioperative mFOLFOX6 alone&#xD;
      led to a similar downstaging rate as fluorouracil-radiotherapy, and no significant difference&#xD;
      in outcomes was found between mFOLFOX6 without radiotherapy and 5-FU- radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the results of these trials, The investigators hypothesized that radiotherapy&#xD;
      could be selectively omitted for patients who respond to NACT alone. The results of TRIBE&#xD;
      showed that FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab yield a high objective response rate (ORR) (65%),&#xD;
      early tumor shrinkage (ETS) (62.7%) and depth of response (DoR) (43.4%) in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators were motivated to investigate this triplet-drugs chemotherpay plus&#xD;
      bevacizumab both by the possibility of avoiding the toxicities of radiation without&#xD;
      compromising local control, and the possibility that earlier introduction of intensive&#xD;
      systemic therapy might achieve rapid tumor shrinkage, and improve distant control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted this phase III trial to compare neoadjuvant mFOLFOXIRI plus&#xD;
      bevacizumab with selective radiotherapy with induction FOLFOX followed by concomitant&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy in patients with high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;

      This trial is a two-arm, multicenter, open labelled, prospective, randomized phase III&#xD;
      studies. Eligible patients with high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer patients (cT3 with&#xD;
      any MRF involved, any cT4a/b or lateral node positive) will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio, to receive either neoadjuvant mFOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab with selective radiotherapy&#xD;
      or induction FOLFOX followed by concomitant chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive neoadjuvant mFOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab once every two weeks for 4 cycles and the same mFOLFOXIRI for 2 cycles. After completing all 6 cycles chemotherapy, the patient will have an MRI scan to examine the tumor. If MRI restaging is ycT4a/b, or MRF involved, the patient will receive concomitant chemoradiotherapy (preoperative radiotherapy consisted of 50 Gy in 25 fractions, and concurrent with capecitabine at a fixed dose of 825 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 to 5 for 5 weeks). If MRI restaging is ycT0-3 and MRF negative, then the patient will proceed directly to surgery.</description>
