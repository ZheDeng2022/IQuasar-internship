  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the standard treatment of gallbladder disease. LC is the&#xD;
      common procedure for general surgeons. Although LC is a safe procedure with very low&#xD;
      mortality (&lt;1%), it has some associated major morbidity. Bile duct injury is the most serious&#xD;
      complication of LC. However, there are some postoperative morbidity including shoulder-tip&#xD;
      pain. The incidence of shoulder-tip pain is about 15-45%, which might be influencing the&#xD;
      patient outcome including length of hospital stay. From the previous studies, one of the&#xD;
      important factor associated with this condition is pneumoperitoneum pressure. Thus, the&#xD;
      suggestion of the intra-abdominal pressure should be low pressure as about 8 mmHg. However,&#xD;
      the optimum pressure for the low-pressure during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is&#xD;
      controversial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We designed the prospective randomized controlled trial to comparing the postoperative&#xD;
      shoulder tip pain between two low pressure level (8 and 10 mmHg) during laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy. After the enrolled participant signed the inform consent, the participant&#xD;
      was randomly assigned to 8 or 10 mmHg group. The standard procedure of the laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy was performed by experience surgeons. During the operation, the pressure&#xD;
      limit can be adjusted to facilitate the procedure according to the surgeons. Following the&#xD;
      operation, the investigator will ask about the shoulder tip pain from the participant during&#xD;
      48 hours. The standard of care including pain medication during postoperative period was&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

    <description>The shoulder tip pain was assessed by the investigator during postoperative period unfil 48 hours. The measurement of the outcome, the investigator would ask the participant by the clinical record form and questionnair. The answer of the questionnaire is presence or absence of the shoulder pain or pain around the shoulder and scapular region.</description>

    <description>The change of intra-abminal pressure was measure by two parameters. Firstly, the adjustment of the pressure during the operation was recorded by the questionnaire. The answer of the questionnaire is the presence or absence of the intra-abdominal pressure change. Secondly, the maximum intra-abdominal pressure which is the highest pressure used during the operation, is measure by the level of the pressure appearing in the laparoscopic station by mmHg unit.</description>
