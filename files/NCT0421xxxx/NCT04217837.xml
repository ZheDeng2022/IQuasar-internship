      This is a single-center, naturalistic, observational study following the use of the&#xD;
      NeuroStar® Advanced Therapy System and assessment of clinical outcome. The goal is to&#xD;
      collect, analyze and report information as aggregated summaries on participants receiving&#xD;
      treatment with the NeuroStar® Advanced Therapy System.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline to endpoint on the total score for the Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale will be reported for the 6 week 3, 6, 9, and 12 month time points. The 7-point scale requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. The scale ranges from 1-7, where a higher score means a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire - 9-item Self Report</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline to endpoint on the total score for the PHQ-9 will be reported for the 6 week, 3, 6, 9, and 12 month time points. The questionnaire assesses degree of depression severity. The scale ranges from total scores of 1-27, where a higher score means a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (IDS-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline to endpoint on the total score for the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report will be reported for the 6 week, 3, 6, 9, and 12 month time points. It is a tool designed to screen for depression and measure changes in severity of symptoms. The scale ranges from total score ranges of 0-84, where a higher score means a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EuroQol 5 Dimensions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline to endpoint on the total score for the EuroQol 5 Dimensions will be reported for the 6 week, 3, 6, 9, and 12 month time points. The EuroQol 5 Dimensions questionnaire assesses quality of life and is presented as a health profile.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Resource Utilization Questionnaire (HRU)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in health care service utilization reported on the individual questions contained in the HRU will be reported for the 6 week, 3, 6, 9, and 12 month time points. It is a socioeconomic and quality of life questionnaire. Because changes in individual questions are reported, there is no range of scores. The score ranges from 0-100, where a higher score means a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form 36-item Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline to endpoint on the Individual Factor Scores and General Medical and Mental Health Composite Scores for the SF-36 will be reported for the 6 week, 3, 6, 9, and 12 month time points. The Short Form 36-item Questionnaire evaluates quality of life outcomes.</description>

    <description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses a targeted pulsed magnetic field, similar to what is used in an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machine. While the patient is awake and alert, NeuroStar TMS Therapy stimulates areas of the brain that are underactive in depression.</description>

             safely be removed. Examples include: cochlear implants; implanted&#xD;
             electrodes/stimulators; aneurysm clips or coils; stents; bullet fragments; jewelry;&#xD;
             and hair barrettes&#xD;

             participant from completing the procedures required by the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active or inactive implants (including device leads), including deep brain&#xD;
             stimulators, and vagus nerve stimulators&#xD;
