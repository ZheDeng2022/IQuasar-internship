  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are building an empirical evidence base for real world data through large-scale&#xD;
      replication of randomized controlled trials. The investigators' goal is to understand for&#xD;
      what types of clinical questions real world data analyses can be conducted with confidence&#xD;
      and how to implement such studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE&#xD;
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical&#xD;
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance claims&#xD;
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly&#xD;
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.&#xD;
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a&#xD;
      statistical balancing of measured covariates according to standard practice. Investigators&#xD;
      assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that&#xD;
      failure to replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims&#xD;
      data for replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the&#xD;
      validity of the original RCT finding.&#xD;

        This study will involve a new user, parallel group, cohort study design comparing&#xD;
        empagliflozin to the DPP-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) antidiabetic class. DPP4is serve as a proxy&#xD;
        for placebo, since this class of antidiabetic drugs is not known to have an impact on the&#xD;
        outcome of interest. The comparison against DPP4 inhibitors is the primary comparison. The&#xD;
        patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during the baseline period of 180&#xD;
        days before initiation of empagliflozin or a comparator drug (cohort entry date). Follow-up&#xD;
        for the outcome (3P-MACE), begins the day after drug initiation. As in the trial, patients&#xD;
        are allowed to take other antidiabetic medications during the study.&#xD;
