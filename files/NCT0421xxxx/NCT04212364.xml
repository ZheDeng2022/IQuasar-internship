    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot and implement a peer mentor intervention focused on&#xD;
      overdose prevention and care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of 3 sessions. During the first and second session, each&#xD;
      participant will meet individually with a trained staff member. In the 3rd session, the&#xD;
      participant will invite a social network member to attend the session, and these 2&#xD;
      participants will meet with a trained staff member.&#xD;

      The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct a pilot of an HIV/HCV/overdose prevention and care intervention for people who&#xD;
           use opiates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the feasibility of collecting donated drug preparation containers (i.e.,&#xD;
           cookers) to assess the presence of fentanyl, HCV, and HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess efficacy of the experimental Peer Mentor&#xD;
           condition on (a) overdose prevention and care education to drug network members, (b)&#xD;
           naloxone availability, and (c) drug treatment readiness and entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two types of participants: Index participants and network participants. Both type&#xD;
      of participant will currently used opiates. Participants will take part in a baseline visit&#xD;
      and up to 3 follow-up visits. Index participants will be randomized into the intervention or&#xD;
      control arm of the study.&#xD;

    <description>Change in risk will be measured by a score that includes frequency of naloxone availability when using opiates, testing drugs before injecting, and drug use alone. Higher scores will indicate increased overdose risk. Scores will be measured from 0-9</description>

    <description>During Session 1, participants will be trained in Peer Education and how to use Nasal Narcan. They will be given two Nasal Narcan kit that includes 2 doses. One kit if for their use and one kit is to give someone in their social network after they have trained them in how to use it.&#xD;
A week after Session 1, participants will be scheduled for Session 2.&#xD;
During session 1 and 2 participants, Index participants will be taught information and skills pertaining to overdose prevention and response and how to train network members in overdose prevention and response.&#xD;
At the 2nd session, index participants will be given 1 coupon to give to 1 member from their social network to attend Session 3.&#xD;
Session 3 will be a dyad session where Index participants will use their peer mentors' skills to train their network member in overdose prevention and response.&#xD;
Index participants will also be invited to up to 3 Booster Session (monthly) after they complete Sessions 1-3.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will participate in one 1-hour session. This session will be an individual session where the participant will meet with a trained staff member in a private room at the Lighthouse.&#xD;
This session will be standard overdose prevention and response information. Participants will also be trained in Narcan administration. Participants will be given 1 nasal Narcan kit.&#xD;
At the end of this session, participants will be asked to refer a network member to the study for survey visits</description>
