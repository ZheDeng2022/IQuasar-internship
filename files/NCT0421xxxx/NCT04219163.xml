  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients eligible for this study have a type of blood cancer Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      which has come back or has not gone away after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting disease and infection, and this research study&#xD;
      combines two different ways of fighting cancer with antibodies and T cells with the hope that&#xD;
      they will work together. T cells (also called T lymphocytes) are special infection-fighting&#xD;
      blood cells that can kill other cells including tumor cells. Antibodies are types of proteins&#xD;
      that protect the body from bacterial and other infectious diseases. Both antibodies and T&#xD;
      cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they have shown promise, but have not&#xD;
      been strong enough to cure most patients when used alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T lymphocytes can kill tumor cells but there normally are not enough of them to kill all the&#xD;
      tumor cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in&#xD;
      the laboratory and then given them back to the person. The antibody used in this study&#xD;
      targets CLL-1. This antibody sticks to AML cells because of a substance (protein) on the&#xD;
      outside of these cells called CLL-1. For this study, the antibody to CLL-1 has been changed&#xD;
      so that instead of floating free in the blood, it is now joined to the T cells. When T-cells&#xD;
      contain an antibody that is joined to them, they are called chimeric antigen receptor T-cells&#xD;
      or CAR-T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the laboratory, the investigators have also found that T cells work better if proteins&#xD;
      that stimulate T cells are also added, such as one called CD28. Adding the CD28 makes the&#xD;
      cells grow better and last longer in the body, thus giving the cells a better chance of&#xD;
      killing the leukemia or lymphoma cells. In this study we are going to attach the CLL-1&#xD;
      chimeric receptor that has CD28 added to it to the patient's T cells. We will then test how&#xD;
      long the cells last.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These CLL-1 chimeric antigen receptor T cells with CD28 are investigational products not&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To make the CLL1-CD28 chimeric antigen receptor T cells, the investigators will collect the&#xD;
      patient's blood and stimulate them with growth factors to make the cells grow. To get the&#xD;
      CLL-1 antibody and CD28 to attach to the surface of the T cell, we put the antibody gene into&#xD;
      the T cell. This is done using a virus called a retrovirus that has been made for this study&#xD;
      and will carry the antibody gene into the T cell. This virus also helps investigators find&#xD;
      the T cells in the patient's blood after they are injected. Because the patient will have&#xD;
      received cells with a new gene in them the patient will be followed for a total of 15 years&#xD;
      to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient enrolls on this study, the patient will be assigned a dose of CLL-1 chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor- T cells. Several studies suggest that the T cells that we give to the&#xD;
      patient need room to be able to grow and work well and that this may not happen if there are&#xD;
      too many other T cells already in circulation the patient's body. Because of that, the&#xD;
      patient will receive two chemotherapy medications before receiving the CLL-1 chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor- T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One medication is called cyclophosphamide and the other fludarabine. The patient will receive&#xD;
      3 daily doses of each drug, ending at least one day before receiving the chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor- T cells. These drugs will lower the numbers of the patient's T cells before we give&#xD;
      them the CLL-1 chimeric antigen receptor T cells and will also help lower the number of other&#xD;
      cells that may block the chimeric antigen receptor- T cells from working well. Although we do&#xD;
      not expect any effect on the patient's cancer with the doses that will be received, these&#xD;
      drugs are part of many treatment plans that are used to treat leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given an injection of cells into the vein through an IV at the assigned&#xD;
      dose. The injection will take from 1 to 10 minutes. Before patients receive the injection,&#xD;
      they may be given a dose of Benadryl and Tylenol. The treatment will be given by the Center&#xD;
      for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will monitor patients in the clinic after the injection for up to 3 hours, and&#xD;
      they will have to remain locally for at least 3 weeks after the infusion. If patients have&#xD;
      any side effects, they may have to be admitted to the hospital for evaluation and management.&#xD;
      If after a 4 week evaluation period following the infusion, the patient has achieved a&#xD;
      complete response, his/her cancer doctors may decide if you should go on to have a bone&#xD;
      marrow transplant, at which time the patient will be removed from the treatment portion of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BEFORE BEING TREATED, PATIENTS WILL RECEIVE A SERIES OF STANDARD MEDICAL TESTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam and History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test for female patients who are of child bearing potential -Measurements of&#xD;
           your tumor by bone marrow studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging such as PET scans, CT scans or MRIs will be obtained if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS WILL RECEIVE STANDARD MEDICAL TESTS DURING TREATMENT AND AFTER:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams and History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of your tumor by bone marrow studies 4-6 weeks after the infusion, possibly&#xD;
           12 weeks after the infusion and then per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging such as PET scans, CT scans or MRIs will be obtained if needed 4-6 weeks&#xD;
           following the infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the CLL-1 chimeric receptor-T cells are working and how long they&#xD;
      last in the body, extra blood will be drawn. The total amount on any day is about 10&#xD;
      teaspoons (50 mL) or no more than 3 mL per 2.2 pounds body weight in children. This amount is&#xD;
      considered safe but may be lowered if you are anemic. This blood may be taken from a central&#xD;
      line if you have one. Blood will be taken before the chemotherapy drugs, several hours after&#xD;
      the T cell infusion, at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks after the&#xD;
      infusion, at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, at 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly&#xD;
      for a total of 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients have a bone marrow exam while they are on this study, we may ask to have a sample&#xD;
      of bone marrow to look for CLL-1 chimeric receptor- T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient decides to withdraw at any time during the study, both samples and data&#xD;
      collected during his/her participation will be kept.&#xD;
