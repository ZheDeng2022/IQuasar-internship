  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for patients with an advanced cancer that carries a mutation in a gene&#xD;
      called KRAS. Genes are parts of our DNA which carry instructions for a cell (the smallest&#xD;
      component of an body part). In many cancers, the KRAS gene contains errors (mutations) which&#xD;
      allows the tumors to grow. The purpose of this study is to determine if combination treatment&#xD;
      with atezolizumab, cobimetinib, and hydroxychloroquine is safe, and if it will decrease the&#xD;
      size of the tumor and prolong life in patients whose tumors contain this mutation.&#xD;
      Cobimetinib and atezolizumab are both approved by the FDA for use in other cancers, but not&#xD;
      in some cancer types being studied in this trial. Hydroxychloroquine is FDA approved to treat&#xD;
      malaria and other conditions, but has also not been approved for these cancer types.&#xD;
      Preliminary results have shown that this combination of drugs is effective at killing cancer&#xD;
      cells and shrinking tumors in several KRAS-mutated cancers in animals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      combination therapy with cobimetinib and hydroxychloroquine, with or without atezolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with KRAS-mutated advanced malignancies. Given that the pre-clinical and clinical&#xD;
      benefit from this combination is from within poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma (PDAC)&#xD;
      animal models and human subjects with PDAC and duodenal cancer, we will include at least 12&#xD;
      of the 18 evaluable subjects from PDAC and/or colorectal malignancies. The phase 2 portion of&#xD;
      the study will be amended after preliminary safety and efficacy results from phase 1 and&#xD;
      other ongoing clinical trials have been analyzed and a summary incorporated within the&#xD;
      protocol as an amendment including a rationale of the cohorts to be tested.&#xD;
