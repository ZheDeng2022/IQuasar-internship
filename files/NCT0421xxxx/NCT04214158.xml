      Dance is the language of expression in which artistic bodily movements are displayed&#xD;
      depending on space or space depending on a certain rhythm. Folk dances are one of the most&#xD;
      important elements in the promotion of a country and play a role in the emergence of cultural&#xD;
      values by reflecting the customs and traditions of the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Folk dance is a whole consisting of two elements, movement and music. Turkish folk dances&#xD;
      have a very wide and smooth movement and have a feature that enhances and enhances the whole&#xD;
      organism from toes to hand fingers. In this way, it provides aesthetic appearance by allowing&#xD;
      body parts to move harmoniously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it has regional differences among the Turkish folk dances, it has common exercise&#xD;
      characteristics. There are some differences in the organism, including legs, trunk, arms,&#xD;
      shoulders and head, starting from the feet. Regional diversity in Turkish folk dances is&#xD;
      differentiated in terms of nature and intensity of movement and this has different physical&#xD;
      and physiological effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women's, men's, children's, young and elderly folk dances played by an individual who has a&#xD;
      heartfelt enthusiasm by individuals of all ages have also been competing in sport activities&#xD;
      in the investigator's country and in the world for many years. Choreographies are performed&#xD;
      within 8-10 minutes according to the competition rules of folk dances. This period is&#xD;
      prolonged in choreographies for demonstration purposes. The long-term choreographies of folk&#xD;
      dances require the training to be carried out in a long time and at an intense pace. The&#xD;
      ability to successfully complete long-term competitions and demonstrations by conducting a&#xD;
      series of intensive exercises requires adequate physical fitness of the players. If the&#xD;
      physical suitability is sufficient, it is only possible with regular studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the proprioceptive sense and physical fitness&#xD;
      parameters of professional folk dancers and compare the results with sedentary healthy&#xD;
      individuals with the same age and physical characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of research&#xD;
&#xD;
      H01 : Professional folk dancers and sedentary healthy individuals have no difference between&#xD;
      the results of the results of physical fitness measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H02: Professional folk dancers and sedentary healthy individuals have no difference between&#xD;
      the results of knee joint proprioceptive sensation measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H03: Professional folk dancers and sedentary healthy individuals have no difference between&#xD;
      the results of pulmonary function measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unıverse and the samplıng of research&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include volunteer dancers aged between 18-35 years who are under the roof of&#xD;
      the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Turkish Folk Dance Federation and sedentary&#xD;
      volunteers with the same age and physical characteristics. The study will be carried out in&#xD;
      the cardiopulmonary unit associated with the Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      of Eastern Mediterranean University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the power analysis using G-Power program; a total of 128 participant will be&#xD;
      included in the calculation of Cohen d = 0.8, α = 0.05, β = 0.20, assuming that the&#xD;
      nonparametric Mann Whitney-U test is used for comparison between the two groups. Both groups&#xD;
      will be evaluated for proprioceptive sense and physical fitness parameters. In order to&#xD;
      determine the physical activity levels of sedentary individuals, UFAA-short form (IPAQ-short&#xD;
      form) will be used. The questionnaire contains 7 questions about physical activities. The&#xD;
      subjects will be asked about the number of days of severe physical activities, moderate&#xD;
      physical activities and walking activities within the last week and how much time they spend&#xD;
      on one of these days, how much time they spend sitting in a day. According to the calculation&#xD;
      of MET value, sedentary individuals with less than 600 MET-min / week exercise participation&#xD;
      will be classified in the low activity level group and will be accepted to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluatıons ın the research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study who have signed a voluntary consent form will be informed about the&#xD;
      study first.Then, the evaluation starts with the sociodemographic data of the participants&#xD;
      (age, gender, height, dominant side, occupation, smoking), exercise habits (duration, day /&#xD;
      week, type) and questioning of the dance background (daily and weekly training time,&#xD;
      frequency, whether or not a break in workouts, how many min / hour breaks are given, warm-up&#xD;
      exercise before and after a training session, whether or not cooling training).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical Fitness Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Body composition:Body composition measurement will be made with Tanita brand body&#xD;
           analysis monitor (MC-780 MA). After the individuals are removed on the platform and&#xD;
           grasping the electrodes with their hands, the body analysis monitor with body weight,&#xD;
           BMI, total body muscle mass (kg), total body muscle mass rate, total body fat mass (kg),&#xD;
           total body fat percentage, total body fluid ( kg), total body fluid ratio, right and&#xD;
           left arm, right and left leg and body muscle mass and fat mass (kg) analysis of various&#xD;
           body composition parameters will be calculated automatically.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Flexibility: It will be evaluated using the sit and reach test. The test will be&#xD;
           repeated three times and the average distance will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Muscle Strength: Humac Norm ® isokinetic dynamometer will be used to evaluate muscle&#xD;
           strength. The evaluation of quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength in the lower&#xD;
           extremity will be evaluated as concentric. Before the measurements are carried out, the&#xD;
           bike will be heated for 5 minutes without resistance. At the same time the quadriceps&#xD;
           and hamstring muscles of the participants will be stretched. The test will be performed&#xD;
           at 60 ̊/sec and 180 ̊/sec at two different angular speeds. 60 sec rest time between&#xD;
           measurements will be given. The peak torque values of the results will be recorded in 'N&#xD;
           / m'.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4 Aerobic Capacity: It will be evaluated by using 20 meter shuttle running test. After&#xD;
           the participants have been informed about the test procedure, the person will be asked&#xD;
           to run back and forth with the recorded signal at the same time by pressing the 20m&#xD;
           signal line. If the participants did not complete the 20 m distance in three consecutive&#xD;
           signal tones, the test will be terminated and the number of levels and shuttles will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.5 Anaerobic Power: It will be evaluated using vertical jump test. The test will be&#xD;
           repeated three times. The best result will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.6 Balance: An electronic computerized balance device (PK200WL, Prokin TecnoBody) will&#xD;
           be used for dynamic balance evaluation.Balance evaluation will be carried out in the&#xD;
           Sleight Test program, which is a computerized system software.Each test will be 30&#xD;
           seconds and 1 trying and 3 test. Individuals, 13 boxes in total, the balance board in&#xD;
           the easy mode to move forward, backward and side by trying to coincide to work to bring,&#xD;
           60 sec rest period will be given after each test. From the data obtained, how many boxes&#xD;
           are captured, forward-backward and mediolateral deviation values will be recorded as&#xD;
           absolute error and the total deviation value will be recorded as percentage and the best&#xD;
           result from 3 results will be taken as the measurement result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proprioception:The Humac Norm® isokinetic dynamometer will be used to evaluate&#xD;
           proprioceptive sensation (position and kinesthesia). Measurements will be made in&#xD;
           passive mode after the participants are properly positioned, taking into account that&#xD;
           the temperature of the unit is 25 °. In order to reduce the noise from the isokinetic&#xD;
           dynamometer, the participants will be wearing headphones and the evaluation environment&#xD;
           will be quiet. By giving verbal warnings and standard commands, the motivation of&#xD;
           individuals will be kept high.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Joint Position Sense: The degrees determined to assess passive motion are 45 ° and&#xD;
           60 ° of knee flexion. Initial position was determined as 90 ° knee flexion and angular&#xD;
           velocity 4 ° / s. Individuals will be asked to wait for 5 seconds and focus on this&#xD;
           position. The first test will be carried out with eyes open for trial purposes. Then,&#xD;
           once the eyes are closed, passive movement will be ensured. Participants will be asked&#xD;
           to press the warning button when they think that they have reached the target angle,&#xD;
           then this movement angle will be recorded. For target angle, 3 repetitions will be made&#xD;
           and 60 seconds of rest time will be given between tests. Statistically, these target&#xD;
           angles will be averaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Kinaesthesia: The knee for measurement will be adjusted at 15 ° position. The&#xD;
           dynamometer angle will be adjusted to 1 ° / s angular velocity and the knee will be&#xD;
           extended. The participants will be asked to press the dynamometer button as soon as they&#xD;
           feel the movement in the knee joints and the angle of the knee at this point will be&#xD;
           recorded. The average of three repetitions will be taken. A rest period of 60 seconds&#xD;
           will be given between each repeat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pulmonary Evaluation:Respiratory muscle strength will be evaluated by means of maximal&#xD;
           intraoral pressure measurements. Maximal inspiratory intraoral pressure (MRP) will be&#xD;
           used to measure inspiratory muscle strength. Maximal expiratory intraoral pressure&#xD;
           measurement (MEP) will be used to measure expiratory muscle strength. The best of the&#xD;
           three measurements will be recorded.The spirometry will be evaluated by using spirometry&#xD;
           for respiratory muscle endurance.The participant will be asked to breathe deep and fast&#xD;
           for 12 seconds.Then the measured maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV, L / min) will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
