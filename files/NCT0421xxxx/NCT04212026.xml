    <textblock>
      This proof of concept trial aims to assess whether the combination of IRE with Nivolumab is&#xD;
      safe and effective to treat metastatic pancreatic cancer, based on the available preliminary&#xD;
      evidence that IRE is able to cause a systemic anti-tumor immune response (i.e. abscopal&#xD;
      effect), which may enhance the effect of subsequent Nivolumab treatment. In addition, the&#xD;
      trial aims to clarify the systemic effects of IRE over time and thereby to provide more&#xD;
      insight in the mechanism of work of the technique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of patients newly diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is&#xD;
      extremely poor with a 5-year overall survival rate of less than 5%. To improve this dismal&#xD;
      outcome, new treatment approaches are urgently needed. So far, immune-checkpoint therapy was&#xD;
      not successful in patients with PDAC. Given the poor response to conventional chemotherapy,&#xD;
      there is an imperative need to make PDACs amenable to immune-checkpoint therapy. Irreversible&#xD;
      electroporation (IRE) is a relatively novel and safe ablation technique that destroys tumors&#xD;
      by using apoptosis-inducing electrical currents inducing local and systemic pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine expression and enhances the presence of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, while the apoptotic&#xD;
      cell material preserves neo-antigen properties detectable by dendritic cells. This effect&#xD;
      might be further enhanced by immune-checkpoint therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of our study is to convert immunologically cold PDACs into hot PDACs by&#xD;
      triggering an enhanced local and systemic immune response. We hypothesize that among patients&#xD;
      with metastatic PDAC, the IRE of one liver metastasis followed by the administration of an&#xD;
      immune-checkpoint inhibitor leads to a measurable radiological response in a selected&#xD;
      non-treated liver metastasis. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the immune response is both&#xD;
      local in the form of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS) and an immunologically activated&#xD;
      tumor microenvironment in the IRE-treated metastasis, as well as systemic as evidenced by an&#xD;
      abscopal response in the IRE-untreated metastatic and primary site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the trial is to examine whether for patients with metastatic PDAC the&#xD;
      combination of IRE of one liver metastasis followed by the administration of five doses of&#xD;
      nivolumab leads to a measurable radiological response in a selected non-treated liver&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate that the trial treatment leads to a measurable immune response, multiple&#xD;
      translational research projects will assess the effect of IRE and nivolumab on the&#xD;
      development of the local and peripheral tumor immune response over time.&#xD;
