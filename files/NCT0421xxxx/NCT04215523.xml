  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are building an empirical evidence base for real world data through large-scale&#xD;
      replication of randomized controlled trials. The investigators' goal is to understand for&#xD;
      what types of clinical questions real world data analyses can be conducted with confidence&#xD;
      and how to implement such studies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE&#xD;
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical&#xD;
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance claims&#xD;
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly&#xD;
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.&#xD;
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a&#xD;
      statistical balancing of measured covariates according to standard practice. Investigators&#xD;
      assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that&#xD;
      failure to replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims&#xD;
      data for replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the&#xD;
      validity of the original RCT finding.&#xD;

        This study will involve a new user, parallel group, cohort study design comparing&#xD;
        dapagliflozin to the DPP-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) antidiabetic class. DPP4is serve as a proxy&#xD;
        for placebo, since this class of antidiabetic drugs is not known to have an impact on the&#xD;
        outcome of interest. The comparison against DPP4 inhibitors is the primary comparison. The&#xD;
        patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during the baseline period of 180&#xD;
        days before initiation of canagliflozin or a comparator drug (cohort entry date). Follow-up&#xD;
        for the outcomes (a. 3P-MACE and b. composite of heart failure hospitalization/all-cause&#xD;
        mortality), begins the day after drug initiation. As in the trial, patients are allowed to&#xD;
        take other antidiabetic medications during the study.&#xD;

             attack (TIA), stroke, any revascularization, decompensated HF, sustained tachycardia&#xD;
             &lt;8 weeks prior to randomization. Patients with acute cardiovascular events can be&#xD;
             enrolled in the run-in period as long as randomization does not occur within 8 weeks&#xD;
             of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Systolic BP &gt;180 or diastolic BP &gt;100 mmHg at randomization&#xD;

             to complete the study including but not limited to cardiovascular (NYHA class IV CHF,&#xD;
             recurrent ventricular arrhythmias) or non-cardiovascular disease (e.g., active&#xD;
             malignancy with the exception of basal cell carcinoma, cirrhosis, chronic lung&#xD;

             (reasonable compliance defined as 80 - 120%, unless a reason for non-compliance is&#xD;
             judged acceptable by the Investigator). If for any reason, the Investigator believes&#xD;
             that the patient will not tolerate or be compliant with IP or study procedures, the&#xD;
             patient should not be randomized and considered a run-in failure. Patients will be&#xD;
             excluded during run-in and should not be randomized if the following are observed from&#xD;
             laboratory or observation during enrollment and run-in assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. HbA1c ≥12% or HbA1c&lt;6.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. AST or ALT &gt;3x ULN or Total bilirubin &gt;2.5 x ULN&#xD;

         17. Hematuria (confirmed by microscopy at Visit 1) with no explanation as judged by the&#xD;
             Investigator up to randomization. If bladder cancer is identified, patients are not&#xD;
             eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any reason the Investigator believes the patient is not likely to be compliant with&#xD;
             the study medication and protocol.&#xD;
