    <textblock>
      The factors affecting the rate of primary caesarean section births are complex, and&#xD;
      identifying interventions to reduce this rate is challenging. Effective interventions&#xD;
      targeting at women are mainly represented by Childbirth training workshops, psychoeducation&#xD;
      and psychosocial couple-based programs. Considering non medical interventions targeting&#xD;
      mothers, the pattern of breathing during labor that can help for vaginal delivery is a&#xD;
      controversial topic. There are no data to support a policy of directed maternal breathing or&#xD;
      pushing during vaginal delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The abdomino-perineal concept was originally a postpartum rehabilitation technique.&#xD;
      Currently, applications are increasing. During labor, expiration channeled by a flow&#xD;
      regulator device offers support to women enduring the pain of uterine contractions. During&#xD;
      the second stage, the expiratory regulated pushing allows a long, efficient and very&#xD;
      intuitive push.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of this regulated expiratory breathing method was introduced in the study unit in&#xD;
      January 2018. Despite a positive experience both reported by women and midwives,&#xD;
      investigators have so far only subjective feedback without objective measurable clinical&#xD;
      impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, investigators are conducting this scientific study whose main objective is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To Evaluate the impact of a regulated expiratory breathing method on childbirth process .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rates of cesarean delivery continue to rise worldwide, with recent (2016) reported rates of&#xD;
      24.5% in Western Europe, 32% in North America, and 41% in South America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary cesarean deliveries account for more than half of all cesarean deliveries, and the&#xD;
      most common indication for repeat cesarean delivery is previous cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the reduction in primary cesarean delivery rate represents a meaningful&#xD;
      objective.&#xD;
