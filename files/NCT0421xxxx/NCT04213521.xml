  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of multisensory balance training on the&#xD;
      levels of visual dependence and sensory organization capacity in community-dwelling older&#xD;
      adults. Participants in the experimental group received multisensory balance training while&#xD;
      those in the control group received conventional balance training without sensory&#xD;
      manipulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older people often find it difficult to maintain balance with their eyes closed, which&#xD;
      emphasizes the importance of vision. The greater influence of vision on orientation and&#xD;
      balance has been observed by manipulating static and dynamic visual cues-for instance,&#xD;
      tilting the frame of reference or moving visual scenes. Older people-particularly those prone&#xD;
      to falls-have been reported to make significantly greater errors in subjective visual&#xD;
      verticality and exhibit greater sway and continued center of gravity oscillation during and&#xD;
      following visual disturbances. They also adopted hip strategies to restore balance in&#xD;
      response to visual perturbation, indicating that they were unstable in the event of visual&#xD;
      disturbance. These results indicate that older people may have higher levels of visual&#xD;
      dependence than younger adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying mechanism of visual dependence remains unclear. Visual dependence is&#xD;
      considered a form of sensory reweighting deficit. In a situation of sensory conflict, the&#xD;
      central nervous system must first recognize the discrepancy and reduce the weighting&#xD;
      (suppress) of the inaccurate input while increasing the weighting of the input from the&#xD;
      sensory systems that are deemed to provide more reliable information. This complex process of&#xD;
      sensory organization is termed multiple-sensory reweighting and is vital in maintaining&#xD;
      balance and orientation in a continuously changing and complex environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have suggested that visual dependence could benefit from promoting desensitization&#xD;
      and increased visual motion tolerance through visual adaptation and habituation exercises in&#xD;
      vestibular rehabilitation. This may be because the majority of visually dependent adults have&#xD;
      the comorbid symptom of visual vertigo. However, according to the National Audit Survey in&#xD;
      the United States, one-third of patients with vestibular disorders and visual dependence lack&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of dizziness or vertigo. Recent evidence has demonstrated that healthy&#xD;
      older adults with greater levels of visual dependence did not have dizziness; therefore, it&#xD;
      is unclear whether visual adaptation exercises can effectively reduce the degree of visual&#xD;
      dependence in such people. However, visual dependence can be considered as a sensory&#xD;
      reweighting deficit; therefore, multisensory balance training with manipulation of the&#xD;
      visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive inputs could be an alternative for decreasing visual&#xD;
      dependence through improving the integration and reweighting of sensory systems. In fact,&#xD;
      multiple studies have documented that multisensory balance training improves mobility and&#xD;
      balance in older adults with instability or a history of falls; however, few have&#xD;
      investigated its effectiveness on visual dependence and in healthy elderly people. Therefore,&#xD;
      the aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of multisensory balance training on&#xD;
      the levels of visual dependence and sensory organization capacity in older adults.&#xD;

    <description>It is used to objectively determine a patient's ability to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks. It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function. A total score of 56 indicates functional balance and but less than 45 indicates individuals may be at greater risk of falling.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-intervention at 4-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It measures balance confidence level and contains 16 items scored on a range from 0% to 100%. The score of 0 indicates no confidence and 100 indicates full confidence.</description>

    <measure>Timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-intervention at 4-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It measures functional mobility. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. Normal healthy elderly usually complete the task in 10 seconds or less. Very frail or weak elderly with poor mobility may take 2 minutes or more. A score of more than or equal to 14 seconds has been shown to indicate high risk of falls.</description>

    <description>The participants in the multisensory balance training group were provided with multiple-sensory balance exercises using visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular manipulations. The exercises involved movements of the eye, head, and body to stimulate the vestibular system-postural control exercises in different positions (feet together, tandem stance, and one leg stance), use of a soft surface to reduce the proprioceptive inputs, and exercises with closed eyes to deprive them of visual cues.</description>
