    <textblock>
      two groups of patients undergoing total thyroidectomy one group received calcium and vit d&#xD;
      prophylaxis the other group received no prophylaxis the investigator measured calcium level&#xD;
      post and preoperative and development of tetant was recorded&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is randomized controlled trial carried out on 86 patients undergoing total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy in the period between January 2018 and November 2019. Patients were randomly&#xD;
      allocated into two groups each one 43 patients the first group is the supplementation group&#xD;
      where patients received oral vitamin D 40000 IU and calcium tablets 1 g once before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient included in this study are those above 18 years old undergoing total thyroidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients excluded from this study are those with&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous thyroid surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malabsorption diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous parathyroid disease or surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitamin D deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypo or hyper calcaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASA class 3,4&#xD;
&#xD;
      all patients in this study were subjected to thorough history taking full clinical&#xD;
      examination, body mass index calculation, proper assessment of the original thyroid disease&#xD;
      requiring surgery, preoperative investigations done as usual in addition to serum calcium,&#xD;
      serum magnesium, serum vitamin D and serum parathormon level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum calcium and serum parathormon were tested after 6, 12 and 48 postoperative hours,&#xD;
      patients were discharged on the third postoperative day except if further hospitalization was&#xD;
      indicated, after discharge patients were followed up in the outpatient clinic by one of the&#xD;
      surgical team, serum calcium and parathormon level were tested after1 months, 3 months and&#xD;
      after 6th months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the development of hypocalcaemia either clinically or&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical hypocalcaemia means development of perioral and \ or acral tingling and numbness,&#xD;
      twitches of the perioral region on tapping in front of the ear&quot; Chvostec's sign'', muscle&#xD;
      twitches and development of carpopedal spasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory hypocalcaemia means serum calcium level below 8.5 mg\dl. Secondary outcome is the&#xD;
      postoperative parathormon level. Preoperative data, postoperative clinical follow up and&#xD;
      laboratory data were collected and analyzed using SPSS 22 program package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principles of total thyroidectomy; Total thyroidectomy was performed under general&#xD;
      anesthesia, through lower neck collar incision, skin and platysma muscle flap was raised till&#xD;
      the thyroid cartilage, opening the midline raphe, exploration of each thyroid lobe and&#xD;
      tracing the inferior thyroid artery while emerging from underneath the carotid artery, the&#xD;
      inferior thyroid artery was identified with its branches supplying the parathyroid gland,&#xD;
      which was identified and preserved with its blood supply, the recurrent laryngeal nerve was&#xD;
      searched for in the triangle between the carotid artery , trachea and the inferior thyroid&#xD;
      artery. The external laryngeal nerve was identified and preserved 1 cm superior to the upper&#xD;
      thyroid pole. If radical thyroidectomy was deemed the same principles of preserving&#xD;
      parathyroid glands and their blood supply, recurrent and external laryngeal nerves. If the&#xD;
      surgeons ere sure of damaging or removing the parathyroid glands a half of one of them was&#xD;
      minced and transplanted in the subcutaneous tissue of the left forearm&#xD;
