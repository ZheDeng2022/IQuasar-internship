  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs)&#xD;
      can differentiate into oligodendrocytes and neurons, and improve the recovery of nerve&#xD;
      function, which strongly suggests the feasibility and effectiveness of hUCB-MSCs as an&#xD;
      intervention treatment for spinal cord injury. At present, there are only a few clinical&#xD;
      centers in which hUCB-MSCs transplantation for treatment of chronic spinal cord injury has&#xD;
      been performed and a certain degree of efficacy has been achieved. However, this has not been&#xD;
      supported by systematic standardized randomized controlled trials. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators design a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel, controlled trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      (hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs to treat spinal cord injury. The primary objective of this study was to&#xD;
      investigate whether hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation can improve the locomotor function of&#xD;
      patients with spinal cord injury. The secondary objectives were to investigate whether&#xD;
      hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation can improve the muscle tension of patients with spinal&#xD;
      cord injury and investigate the complications and safety of hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

      Patient recruitment will be performed via information dissemination on bulletin boards to&#xD;
      advertise the study among patients at the clinics and wards of the First Affiliated Hospital&#xD;
      of Dalian Medical University, China. Patients interested in participation in this study or&#xD;
      their legal guardians contact the project manager via telephone. Patients will be screened&#xD;
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria after providing signed informed consent.&#xD;
      Eligible patients with chronic spinal cord injury will receive intravenous, lumbar, and local&#xD;
      administration of hUC-MSCs/hUCB-MSCs (provided by Cell Bank of Stem Cell Clinical Research&#xD;
      Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University). The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure of this study is neurologic function scores, including ASIA (American Spinal Injury&#xD;
      Association) motor score, ASIA sensory score, ASIA impairment scale (ASIA classification),&#xD;
      and acupuncture score. These scores will be used to evaluate the recovery of nerve function&#xD;
      after spinal cord injury and determine the therapeutic efficacy and persistence. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures of this study include Walking Index of Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI),&#xD;
      Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), Kunming Locomotion Scale (KLS), Modified Ashworth&#xD;
      Scale (MAS), and Visual Analogous Scale (VAS) scores and the incidence of adverse reactions.&#xD;
      At 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, patients will be followed up to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation in the treatment of spinal cord&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
