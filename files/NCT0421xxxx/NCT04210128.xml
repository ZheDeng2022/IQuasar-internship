      The purpose of this study is to see if continuous glucose monitoring can identify how often&#xD;
      people who have pre-diabetes or medical obesity or well-controlled diabetes experience very&#xD;
      high glucose values while receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer or pancreatic.&#xD;

    <description>A blinded continuous glucose monitor (specifically a Freestyle Libre Pro) will be worn for a 14 day period by patients during the first and third cycles of breast neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At the end of that period (after completion of the one round of chemotherapy) readings will be downloaded from the sensor and the sensor will be removed. Readings will be evaluated by the treating endocrinologist as well as the study team and appropriate clinical interventions.</description>
