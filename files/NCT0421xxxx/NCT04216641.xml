  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer promotes weight loss; it can also lead to particular complications for patients during&#xD;
      treatment. A team led by Dr Michael Sawyer, showed the deleterious impact of undernutrition&#xD;
      on the benefits of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer patients are at high risk of undernutrition, which is generally more pronounced for&#xD;
      solid tumours (upper digestive tract, ENT, bronchial tubesâ€¦). This undernutrition leads to&#xD;
      major weight loss and wasting, and may represent the first sign of a call for a diagnosis of&#xD;
      cancer. Cancer-related undernutrition is multi-factorial in origin and has multiple&#xD;
      consequences; it has its own prognostic value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy treatments can induce various adverse effects in patients, including sensory&#xD;
      disturbances at the beginning of treatment in addition to disturbances that may already be&#xD;
      present before any treatment. Altered taste and odour, observed in 86% of patients, can&#xD;
      induce a change in food preferences, promote the development of aversions, and therefore,&#xD;
      lead to a significant reduction in the pleasure of eating. Loss of appetite, decreased food&#xD;
      intake and the development of aversions to certain foods are situations experienced by a&#xD;
      large proportion of patients undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of taste disorders in patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment is&#xD;
      established through the use of questionnaires, interviews and taste tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the perception and identification of salty, sweet, bitter and sour flavours are&#xD;
      common in patients undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of CANUT is to study the effect of pathology and chemotherapy on gustatory and&#xD;
      olfactory mechanisms and in particular on interindividual differences in the perception and&#xD;
      appreciation of food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators propose to adapt foods to best respond to sensory disorders&#xD;
      related to the disease and/or treatment.&#xD;
