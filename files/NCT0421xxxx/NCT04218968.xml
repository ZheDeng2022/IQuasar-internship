  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term effects of treatment with the&#xD;
      adrenergic blocker carvedilol on serial DaTscan, a dopamine transporter (DAT) single photon&#xD;
      emission computerized tomography (SPECT) imaging technique in a population of subjects with&#xD;
      defined pre-motor Parkinson's disease risks (i.e., REM sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) and at&#xD;
      least one among hyposmia, constipation, depression and color vision abnormality) and abnormal&#xD;
      123. I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary procedures in this study are MIBG scan, DAT scan, Neuromelanin Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging (NM-MRI), and carvedilol titration. Subjects will return for research visits and&#xD;
      imaging every six months,for three years. We hypothesize that the rate of decline in DAT&#xD;
      scan123I-Ioflupane uptake will be slower in subjects who have received the adrenergic blocker&#xD;
      carvedilol, resulting in a decreased clinical phenoconversion rate to parkinsonism. If this&#xD;
      is true, it might create a considerable window of opportunity for treatment with adrenergic&#xD;
      blockers - or similar compounds able to reduce Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) hyperactivity&#xD;
      - which may result in long-term benefits such as delaying the neurodegenerative process and&#xD;
      the onset of neurological symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>Peripheral Insulin Resistance (IR) will be defined by testing for fasting plasma insulin (FPI), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). HOMA index will be calculated by the formula: HOMA-IR = (FPI x FPG)/405 . A cutoff HOMA index of 2.0, equivalent to &lt;50% sensitivity, will be used to define IR. Subjects were considered to have IR if they either had a HOMA≥2.0 and/or HbA1c≥5.7 . In addition, measures of insulin sensitivity in neuronal-origin enriched plasma EVs (central IR) will be used to test the association of changes in such sensitivity to changes in MIBG uptake and clinical scores from baseline and every 6 months. For that purpose, plasma samples will be collected and stored and -80oC to allow for isolation of neuronal origin EVs at the completion of the study</description>
