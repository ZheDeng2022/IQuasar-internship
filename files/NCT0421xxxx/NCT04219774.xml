  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complete occlusion of the Internal carotid artery (ICA) by atherosclerotic disease (COICA)&#xD;
      causes approximately 15%-25% of ischemic strokes in the carotid artery distribution. Patients&#xD;
      treated with medical therapy have a 7%-10% risk of recurrent stroke per year for any stroke&#xD;
      and a 5%-8% risk per year for ipsilateral ischemic stroke during the first 2 years after ICA&#xD;
      occlusion. Internal carotid artery occlusion causes an estimated 61,000 first-ever strokes&#xD;
      per year in the US an incidence more than twice the annual occurrence of ruptured&#xD;
      intracranial aneurysms Additionally, 40% of subjects with COICA who present with transient&#xD;
      ischemic attack (TIA) and 70% of COICA who present with stroke have cognitive decline with&#xD;
      increased risk of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's' disease (AD) with time (2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptomatic COICA subjects are at increased risk of developing cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      progressive development of vascular dementia and AD with time. Our proposal leverages several&#xD;
      compelling retrospective and prospective preliminary data from human to perform this&#xD;
      exploratory trial with go/no-go criteria to proceed to a phase 3 based on the data generated&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized open blinded end-point (PROBE) study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 2 randomized single-center open label clinical trial with randomization of&#xD;
      1:1 to either best medical management vs. best medical management and endovascular&#xD;
      revascularization of COICA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening, Enrolling, &amp; Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who presents to our tertiary hospital with a diagnosis of COICA will undergo&#xD;
      full evaluation including 1) documenting previous history of transient ischemic attack (TIA)&#xD;
      and/or stroke; 2) cervical and brain CT angiography (CTA) to document complete occlusion; 3)&#xD;
      CT perfusion (CTP) to assess for presence of penumbra evident by increased mean transient&#xD;
      time (MTT) in the ipsilateral side of COICA; and 4) Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA)&#xD;
      score. If any subject is found to have complete occlusion of COICA, evident of&#xD;
      abnormal/prolongation of MTT on CTP, previous history of TIA and or stroke, and MoCA &lt;26 or&#xD;
      abnormal response on another neuropsychological assessment preformed in the screening&#xD;
      battery, then further evaluation is obtained including: MRI spectroscopy to assess for&#xD;
      presence/absence of lactate in the ipsilateral watershed area (centrum semiovale), and size&#xD;
      of ipsilateral hippocampus and amygdala, additional cognitive testing battery, and digital&#xD;
      subtraction angiography (DSA) to document adequately the type of COICA the subject have (type&#xD;
      A-D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject meets all inclusion criteria (complete occlusion, MoCA &lt;26 and/or abnormal other&#xD;
      neuropsychological test result, abnormal CTP) they will be randomized, after consent is&#xD;
      obtained. If all inclusion criteria are met other than the CTP, they will be enrolled but not&#xD;
      randomized. These subjects will only be eligible for best medical management- not surgical&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any subject does not have complete occlusion or abnormal MoCA &gt;26 or other&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment, then the subject is excluded and no further testing needed&#xD;
      (see exclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject meets all inclusion criteria, then a baseline of complete neurological&#xD;
      testing, full demographics, CTA or MRA, CTP, MoCA, additional neurological testing, MRI&#xD;
      spectroscopy and DSA are obtained and subject is randomized 1:1 to either best medical&#xD;
      management or best medical management + endovascular balloon angioplasty and stenting. Follow&#xD;
      up clinic visits are arranged at 6 and 12 months. Repeat testing of MoCA and additional&#xD;
      cognitive testing battery are done at these clinical follow-up visits (6 and 12 months). MRI&#xD;
      of the brain and is done at 6 and 12 months. DSA is performed at 1 year follow-up for&#xD;
      intervention subjects to assess brain bio-markers and revascularization respectively.&#xD;

Scores from tests in the proposed neuropsychological battery will be converted to z-scores. This is the following battery:&#xD;
