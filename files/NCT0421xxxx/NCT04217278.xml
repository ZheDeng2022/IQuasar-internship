  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment options for older adults with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) and Myelodysplasia&#xD;
      (MDS) are limited. Although stem cell transplantation remains one of the most effective&#xD;
      treatments it is associated with severe side effects which have until recently prevented its&#xD;
      use in older adults. In the last decade the use of reduced intensity transplants has allowed&#xD;
      the extension of the potentially curative effect of transplantation to older patients in whom&#xD;
      it was previously precluded. Although a major advance such transplants are associated with a&#xD;
      high risk of disease relapse particularly in patients with high risk disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate new transplant strategies with the aim of improving the outcome of&#xD;
      patients with AML and high risk MDS after stem cell transplantation. Three approaches to&#xD;
      improve transplant outcome will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparing the new pre-transplant consolidation therapy vyxeos with the standard&#xD;
           consolidation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparing new conditioning therapies in patients under the age of 55 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparing new conditioning therapies in patients aged 55 and over&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up for a minimum of 2 years.&#xD;

      This is a randomised, international, phase II/III, multicentre, clinical trial in patients&#xD;
      with AML and MDS undergoing allo-SCT. Patients with AML or MDS who fulfil the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be invited to participate in the trial across centers performing allo-SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to treatment based on a minimisation algorithm prepared at the&#xD;
      Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit (CRCTU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation 1 (R1) will compare the novel consolidation therapy vyxeos with the standard&#xD;
      consolidation therapy intermediate dose cytarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation 2 (R2) will compare the novel conditioning regimen&#xD;
      thiotepa/busulphan/fludarabine (TBF) with the standard conditioning therapy&#xD;
      fludarabine/busulphan (FB4) in patients aged under 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation 3 (R3) will compare the novel conditioning regimen mini&#xD;
      thiotepa/busulphan/fludarabine (mini TBF) with the standard regimen fludarabine/busulphan&#xD;
      (FB2) in patients aged 55 years of age and over.&#xD;
