  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to collect data for development of an algorithm for&#xD;
      continuous, non-inflating measurement of absolute, long term Blood Pressure, using&#xD;
      CardiacSense1BP device and to evaluate the safety of the CardiacSense1BP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will take place in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) or in the CICU (Cardiac Intensive&#xD;
      Care Unit) units, on non-anaesthetized subjects with an arterial line inserted into the&#xD;
      radial artery. Continuous recording will be performed in parallel using invasive arterial&#xD;
      line recording and CardiacSenseBP1 non-invasive recording. The ECG data recorded in the ICU&#xD;
      will also be obtained. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 subjects will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will possibly be connected to the CardiacSense1BP device a few times to check&#xD;
      repeatability. The first measurement will be of up to 24h. Subsequent measurements will be of&#xD;
      up to 5h. Data analysis will be performed offline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is collected for CardiacSense1BP device algorithm development.&#xD;
