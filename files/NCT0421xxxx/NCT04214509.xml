  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to identify and systematically characterize Parkinson's patients with&#xD;
      mutations in the LRRK2 gene. In about 90% of Parkinson's patients the cause of the disease is&#xD;
      unclear. Based on current knowledge, it can be assumed that there are several causes and that&#xD;
      the causes may be differ between patients; this makes research into the pathogenesis and&#xD;
      possible therapies very difficult. In the case of monogenic Parkinson's diseases, which are&#xD;
      due to changes in one gene (e.g. LRRK2), the function of the gene and possible disease&#xD;
      mechanisms can be investigated. LRRK2-associated Parkinson's syndrome is clinically&#xD;
      indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's disease. It is inherited autosomal dominant,&#xD;
      that means if one of the two gene copies is altered, the disease occurs. However, the disease&#xD;
      does not occur in every mutation carrier, the penetrance is reduced and the mechanisms for&#xD;
      that are still unclear. Ideally, knowledge of what influences penetrance could make it&#xD;
      possible to exert targeted influence and prevent the disease. The comprehensive investigation&#xD;
      of mechanisms of reduced penetrance but also of the effects of the mutation itself requires&#xD;
      systematic investigations of as many affected persons as possible. We therefore aim to&#xD;
      identify 4,000 people internationally, of them 1,500 with LRRK2-associated Parkinson's&#xD;
      syndrome, 500 with LRRK2-mutations but without Parkinson's symptoms, 500 without mutations&#xD;
      and without Parkinson's symptoms, 500 Parkinson patients with mutations in other genes than&#xD;
      LRRK2 and 1,000 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease from the same populations. The&#xD;
      participants will undergo a comprehensive survey on Parkinson's symptoms, concomitant&#xD;
      diseases, environmental factors and medication and there is the possibility of more detailed&#xD;
      genetic examinations. Participants will be asked to donate samples of blood, urine and&#xD;
      household dust.&#xD;

      Blood and urine samples will be biochemically analysed to determine factors leading to&#xD;
      incomplete penetrance in LRRK2 positive carriers and biomarkers of Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In blood samples DNA and DNA methylation, RNA and proteins will be analysed. Urine samples&#xD;
      will be analysed using NGS-based sequencing of the mitochondrial genome and search for&#xD;
      mitochondrial DNA deletions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dust will be analysed toxicologically.&#xD;
