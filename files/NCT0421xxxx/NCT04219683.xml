  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Segmental mandibulectomy, often employed for resection of a tumour, and occasionally for&#xD;
      trauma, osteoradionecrosis, or osteomyelitis, adversely affects patient's quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) to a varying degree. It inflicts a significant defect in the head and neck region,&#xD;
      impacting on facial appearance, and the functions of speech, malocclusion, mastication,&#xD;
      swallowing, and health-related QoL. Mandible resection thus creates a significant impact on a&#xD;
      patient's life, both aesthetically as well as functionally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restoration of the defects following resection of any part of the mandible presents a&#xD;
      challenging problem for reconstructive surgeons. Since the introduction of fibula free flap&#xD;
      (FFF) by Taylor in 1975, it has become the most popular choice for mandible reconstruction.&#xD;
      Hidalgo popularized the FFF, and reported on its versatility with satisfactory outcomes. The&#xD;
      utility and techniques of free flap mandible reconstruction have advanced in the past 2&#xD;
      decades, with success rate up from 82.6% to 100%. As the longest bone segment available for&#xD;
      reconstructive purpose, FFF is known for its wide variety of applications, following mandible&#xD;
      resection, including angle-to-angle reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fibula-free flap is currently considered the most popular, 'the gold standard and the&#xD;
      workhorse flap' for mandibular reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, because of the limited diameter of the fibula flap compared with the height of the&#xD;
      mandible, vertical distance between the reconstructed segment and the occlusal plane can be&#xD;
      substantial. This is a particular problem in the dentate mandible, especially when&#xD;
      rehabilitation with dental implants or an implant-borne denture is contemplated. Insufficient&#xD;
      bone height leads to overloading of osteointegrated implants and endangers the longevity of&#xD;
      the prosthetic restoration. Insufficient bone height and poor soft tissue overlying the bone&#xD;
      flap also create an unfavourable environment for the tissue-borne prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such issues are particularly acute in patients with intact alveolar bone and dentition at&#xD;
      healthy sites. The double-barrel technique, distraction osteogenesis, non-vascularized bone&#xD;
      grafts, and guided-bone regeneration have all been used to resolve this. The double-barrel&#xD;
      technique is a good method, but drawbacks include excess height of the neomandible and the&#xD;
      considerable time required to contour and adapt the upper barrel. Distraction osteogenesis is&#xD;
      a valuable and predictable treatment option; however, its wide application is limited by&#xD;
      complexity of the surgery and the need for additional secondary surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To Overcome these challenges the investigators design a technique for mandibular&#xD;
      reconstruction where free vascularized fibula flap is splitted and non-vascularized fibula&#xD;
      graft is harvest from same leg and is placed between two splitted parts of free fibula flap&#xD;
      to increase vertical height of fibula.&#xD;
