      The goal of this prospective, randomized study is to compare the outcomes of patients&#xD;
      undergoing primary TKA after photographing final knee range of motion immediately&#xD;
      post-operatively and sharing these photographs with patients at their first follow-up&#xD;
      appointment versus a group that does not see a photograph.&#xD;

      The goal of this prospective, randomized study is to compare the outcomes of patients&#xD;
      undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) after photographing final knee range of&#xD;
      motion immediately postoperatively and sharing these photographs with patients at their first&#xD;
      follow-up appointment versus a group that does not see a photograph. The knee will be&#xD;
      photographed in maximum flexion and extension. The primary objectives will be to compare the&#xD;
      range of motion of the operative knee at 2 weeks and 6 weeks postoperatively. In the&#xD;
      investigator's institution, patients who have failed to achieve 90 degrees of flexion at a&#xD;
      postoperative period of 6 weeks undergo manipulation of the knee under anesthesia (MUA). The&#xD;
      investigators will also measure how many patients require MUA in the photograph group and&#xD;
      non-photograph group. MUA will be performed if patients fail to achieve 90 degrees of flexion&#xD;
      at 6 weeks post-op.&#xD;
