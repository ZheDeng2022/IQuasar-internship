    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-drug epidemological cohort study aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      relatives of these cases with CTX-specific gene mutation and clinical features of CTX disease&#xD;
      over CTX index cases diagnosed with CTX disease throughout the clinics in Turkey. Relatives&#xD;
      included in the study (relatives of CTX index cases) will be taken into clinical and genetic&#xD;
      evaluation. Relatives will not receive any experimental intervention or treatment because of&#xD;
      their participation in the study. Therefore, this study does not include a treatment protocol&#xD;
      or does not have a predetermined visit flow chart. However, relatives of CTX index cases&#xD;
      should give consent to genetic testing.&#xD;

      WORK DESIGN STAGES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The CTX index case will be identified and the CTX genetics will be reapproved. The&#xD;
           following steps will be provided for all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Re-validation of CTX genetics: Cases of CTX indexes that are unrelated and clearly&#xD;
                identified the CTX homozygous inheritance identified in the CYP27A1 gene by&#xD;
                kinship.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documenting the nuclear and extended family structure and extracting family trees&#xD;
                (interview with index cases and parents of index cases)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of all potential symptoms compatible with CTX disease, including data&#xD;
                based on the CTX suspicion index (Mignarri Index) in the nuclear and extended&#xD;
                family&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of patients who have died due to unexpected death or unwillingness to&#xD;
                participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Specific members of nuclear and extended family relatives will be contacted to&#xD;
                propose genetic counseling. Approvals for genetic testing will be asked and&#xD;
                necessary information forms will be provided. A total of 5 ml of blood will be&#xD;
                collected from each patient for DNA analysis. Blood samples will be analyzed at the&#xD;
                Damagen Genetic Diagnosis Center (Ankara), after which no samples will be stored&#xD;
                and all samples will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collecting blood samples from index cases and, where possible, all nuclear family&#xD;
                members (such as parents and siblings)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The target cohort will be defined in each family according to the interview results. If&#xD;
           the study physician predicts that there are fewer than 50 patients in a large family for&#xD;
           the study and follow-up period, this family will be excluded from the study. The initial&#xD;
           objective will be to involve grandparents, all their children, married wives and&#xD;
           grandchildren. This choice can be adapted by the physician depending on the special&#xD;
           situation in the family according to the results of individuals who have undergone&#xD;
           genetic mutation tests in the nuclear family, if any, and the definition of nuclear and&#xD;
           extended relatives may change in consanguineous families. All extended family members of&#xD;
           each identified CTX case will be invited to perform the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Genetic counseling (ideally per family)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Approvals for genetic testing will be asked and necessary information forms will be&#xD;
                provided. A total of 5 ml of blood will be collected from each patient for DNA&#xD;
                analysis. Blood samples will be analyzed at the Damagen Genetic Diagnosis Center&#xD;
                (Ankara) and no samples will be stored after the analysis and all samples will be&#xD;
                destroyed. Documentation of key data for each case&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Confirming that the family tree is correctly identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documenting patients who have died due to unexpected death or unwillingness to&#xD;
                participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Perform limited neurological examination for key signs and symptoms and document it&#xD;
                according to the CTX suspicion index (Mignarri Index).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Testing all samples by DNA sequencing for the identified mutation analysis. According to&#xD;
           the results, large family cohort will be extracted. In some families, this number can&#xD;
           reach up to 600-800 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Re-inviting all study cases with disease genotypes for extended neurological examination&#xD;
           and medical / genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To offer genetic counseling to all study patients with carrier genotypes so that they&#xD;
           can make informed decisions about marriage and the next generation (the study&#xD;
           coordinator will propose the medical follow-up of new cases diagnosed genetically as&#xD;
           CTX).&#xD;
