      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of semaglutide on intra-hepatic&#xD;
      triglyceride (IHTG) content in people living with HIV (PLWH), central adiposity, insulin&#xD;
      resistance or pre-diabetes, and hepatic steatosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of semaglutide on intra-hepatic triglyceride (IHTG)&#xD;
      content in people living with HIV (PLWH), central adiposity, insulin resistance or&#xD;
      pre-diabetes, and hepatic steatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive semaglutide subcutaneously once weekly for 24 weeks, followed&#xD;
      by 24 weeks of observation off of the study drug. IHTG will be quantified by magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) evaluations at two time points&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend several study visits through Week 48. Participants will complete&#xD;
      food diaries, adherence and strength assessments, and report on hypoglycemia, vision changes,&#xD;
      physical activity, diet, quality of life, and acceptability of study drug. Blood will be&#xD;
      collected at all visits and stool samples at two visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must remain on their non-study-provided antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than&#xD;
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;

                  studies, or for sites located in countries other than the United States, a kit&#xD;
                  that has been certified or licensed by an oversight body within that country and&#xD;
                  validated internally. Non-US sites are encouraged to use US FDA-approved methods&#xD;

                  reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid&#xD;
                  assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or&#xD;
                  different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot&#xD;
                  or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two separate reports of HIV-1 RNA measurements &lt;50 copies/mL, and no HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
