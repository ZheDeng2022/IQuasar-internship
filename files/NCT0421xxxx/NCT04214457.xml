  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of an accurate and non-invasive diagnostic method is a priority in areas such&#xD;
      as gynecology and oncology, specifically to improve the health of those patients with&#xD;
      surgical indication for diagnosis of myometrial tumors: leiomyomas and/or leiomyosarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has been successfully applied in&#xD;
      different areas of knowledge, being effective not only for the detection of DNA mutations,&#xD;
      but also providing through bioinformatic tools, new insights in the understanding of&#xD;
      chromosomal instability. In addition, the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) through&#xD;
      this type of techniques could revolutionize the non-invasive detection and monitoring of this&#xD;
      type of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims to perform the differential molecular analysis of myometrial tumor&#xD;
      tissue (uterine leiomyomas / leiomyosarcomas), as well as peripheral blood of a group of&#xD;
      patients with surgical indication of hysterectomy, laparoscopic or laparotomic myomectomy by&#xD;
      diagnosis of myometrial tumors. Thus, the obtained samples will be processed for the&#xD;
      realization of techniques of massive parallel sequencing or NGS that, together with a&#xD;
      specialized bioinformatic software, will facilitate the interpretation of the obtained data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination of both platforms, sequencing and bioinformatics, will offer a high potential for&#xD;
      the discovery of genetic variants and genomic markers. Depending on the results of these&#xD;
      analyses, differential diagnosis of leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma could be determined, in&#xD;
      addition to increasing knowledge of myometrial biology and associated pathologies in a&#xD;
      clinical and therapeutic context. Moreover, the application of this technology could allow&#xD;
      the development of biomarkers and targeted therapies effective in the treatment of uterine&#xD;
      leiomyomas and/or leiomyosarcomas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leiomyomas (LM) are the most common benign gynecological tumors that affect approximately 70%&#xD;
      of women of reproductive age, being responsible for 200,000 hysterectomies per year in the&#xD;
      United States (USA). Despite its benign nature, LM represents a major public health problem&#xD;
      due to its significant level of morbidity, which manifests as a spectrum of clinical symptoms&#xD;
      such as heavy menstrual bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain, infertility and recurrent pregnancy&#xD;
      loss, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare uterine malignancy that arises from the smooth muscle&#xD;
      of uterine wall. It accounts for only 1-2% of uterine malignancies and occurs mainly after&#xD;
      menopause. LMS is notorious for its aggressive nature and poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although uterine LM and LMS are considered biologically unrelated tumors due to their&#xD;
      cytogenetic and molecular disparity, both share morphological features that can complicate&#xD;
      the diagnosis through current clinical tests or factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, long-term therapeutic options for LM are limited. Currently, laparoscopic&#xD;
      morcellation is the most widely used surgical technique in the treatment of large LM.&#xD;
      However, this type of surgery carries the risk of occult dissemination of malignant tumors&#xD;
      such as LMS, characterized by early metastases, poor prognosis and high recurrence rates,&#xD;
      with limited therapeutic efficacy. In fact, the United States Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) has estimated that 1 in 352 of women with surgical indication of LM could have LMS, and&#xD;
      treatment in this case could result in tumor spread. Given this need, Igenomix, through a&#xD;
      recent pilot study with 26 samples, has identified new genetic targets that potentially&#xD;
      differentiate leiomyosarcomas and leiomyomas, through integrated comparative genomic and&#xD;
      transcriptomic analyses. This allowed to lay the foundations, not only to improve the&#xD;
      understanding of the pathogenesis of these uterine tumors, but also provides a first step&#xD;
      towards the preoperative diagnosis of leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas by liquid biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this pilot study, a new clinical study is proposed to proceed with further&#xD;
      identification of genetic markers and develop a preoperative diagnosis of LM and LMS by&#xD;
      liquid biopsy. A total sample size of 1,000 patients with suspected LMS is expected to be&#xD;
      recruited in this study, considering the frequency of surgeries in which obtaining a sample&#xD;
      is intended, as well as the frequency of patients who will accept tissue donation for&#xD;
      research. Moreover, a cut-off point with a preliminary analysis every 100 patients will be&#xD;
      established, in which the laboratory data is combined with those derived from the&#xD;
      Pathological Anatomy (Gold Standard), so that when a total of 40 LMS is reached the study&#xD;
      will end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the development of the study, after obtaining informed consent from eligible patients,&#xD;
      the samples (tumor tissue and peripheral blood) will be collected at the time of surgery,&#xD;
      which the patient had already planned by medical indication according to the usual clinical&#xD;
      practice. Thus, the participation of the subject in this study will entail only a single&#xD;
      visit coinciding with the day of the surgery. In addition, samples available from patients&#xD;
      that underwent surgery before the study could be also included if, after being duly informed,&#xD;
      the patient agrees to participate in the study and signs the study consent form.&#xD;
      Exceptionally, samples from patients who could not consent due to major reasons (such as&#xD;
      death of the subject or impossibility to be found) could also be included in the study upon&#xD;
      approval of the appropriated Ethic Committee according to the local regulations for this type&#xD;
      of situations. In any case, the investigators will ensure that there is no expressed&#xD;
      objection from the donors in their clinical history and that samples will be codified in&#xD;
      order to assure anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be sent to histopathological diagnosis and to Igenomix, that will develop and&#xD;
      optimize laboratory protocols to detect changes at the DNA (Whole Exome Sequencing) and RNA&#xD;
      (RNAseq) level in order to achieve the described outcomes. This new approaches focused on&#xD;
      NGS, could allow not only the detection of tumor-specific mutations but, in combination with&#xD;
      bioinformatics tools, could provide new knowledge to understand chromosomal instability in&#xD;
      the tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the histopathological diagnosis, patients will be treated by their respective&#xD;
      doctors and followed up to determine their evolution. If the proposed hypothesis from NGS&#xD;
      results is confirmed and the objectives are achieved, in a second phase of the project, a&#xD;
      diagnostic tool will be developed to extend the non-invasive genetic diagnosis of uterine&#xD;
      leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas in peripheral blood through the free DNA analysis of&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells. The possibility of being able to quantify and characterize the&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by means of this type of techniques, could revolutionize the&#xD;
      non-invasive detection and the follow-up of this type of tumors.&#xD;
