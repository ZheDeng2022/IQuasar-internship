    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 15 patients with cystic fibrosis 18 years of age and older who&#xD;
      present with constipation. The investigators will assess baseline motility symptoms with a&#xD;
      survey. Patients will then ingest a SmartPill (trademark) to obtain baseline motility within&#xD;
      the GI lumen. All patients will undergo intervention with taking polyethylene glycol (PEG) or&#xD;
      Miralax (brand name) 17 grams once daily. After two weeks of therapy, the patient will repeat&#xD;
      the motility survey and again ingest a smart pill to assess the change in motility symptoms&#xD;
      while on therapy.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder involving mutation of the cystic&#xD;
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The consequences of this genetic mutation&#xD;
      leads to dysregulated epithelial fluid transportation. Abnormalities of the CFTR protein have&#xD;
      multisystem motility complications - it affects primarily the lungs, pancreas, vas deferens,&#xD;
      and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Cystic Fibrosis causes multiple issues in the GI tract.&#xD;
      The CFTR protein is expressed throughout the GI tract at the apical enterocyte membrane. Per&#xD;
      recent studies, it has the highest concentration in the duodenum and decreases as the small&#xD;
      bowel terminates into the large intestine. Patients often experience symptoms secondary to&#xD;
      dysmotility from abnormal salt and water regulation into the gastrointestinal lumen. Cystic&#xD;
      Fibrosis patients are at risk for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), intestinal&#xD;
      dysbiosis, inflammation, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), constipation, and&#xD;
      postprandial delayed gastric emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have been done to evaluate gastrointestinal motility in the CF patients. One&#xD;
      study reviewed gastric muscle rhythms in CF patients via pre and post-prandial&#xD;
      electrogastrography (EGG) and found postprandial bradygastria. Patients had symptom&#xD;
      improvement with initiation of cisapride however this drug is not FDA approved in different&#xD;
      continents. Another study researched GI transit times via the magnet-based motility tracking&#xD;
      system and found increased transit in the upper small intestine compared to control&#xD;
      populations. Overall, CF patients were found to have delayed small intestine transit time&#xD;
      with the magnetic pill reaching the cecum in only 2 of 10 CF patients in a 7 hour period&#xD;
      compared to 14 of 16 control patients. Hydrogen Breath tests have diagnosed SIBO in CF&#xD;
      patients however overall delay in intestinal transit affect interpretation of results.&#xD;
      Empiric treatment with antibiotics or laxatives is recommended with some improvement in&#xD;
      patient symptoms. Mouse studies have shown that use of Miralax (brand name) or polyethylene&#xD;
      glycol (PEG) laxative decreased bacterial overgrowth in 90% of Cystic Fibrosis mice. Further&#xD;
      studies showed that daily PEG use decreases positive breath tests in a small study of CF&#xD;
      patients. While there have been multiple studies showing symptomatic improvement of SIBO and&#xD;
      DIOS with PEG and/or other laxative agents, none have measured whether or not these&#xD;
      medications improve intestinal transit time. The aim of this research project is to evaluate&#xD;
      total intraluminal transit time in CF patients and the effects of PEG on transit time and&#xD;
      patient symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective cohort study. This is an investigator initiated study. Once enrolled,&#xD;
      patients will spend a total of 4 weeks in the study. All participants will receive the&#xD;
      intervention. There will be no randomization in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information pulled from the patient's medical record includes the patient's name, medical&#xD;
      record number, date of birth, cystic fibrosis genotype, medication list, and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial recruiting visit: Informed consent to participate in the research study will be&#xD;
           obtained.The patient will need to have a 2 week washout period where all non-essential&#xD;
           medications that alter gut motility are temporarily stopped. The medications withheld&#xD;
           will be at the discretion of the physician.This list will be provided to the patient.&#xD;
           The patients on pancreatic enzyme replacement must remain on this as to not affect study&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second visit: The patient will complete Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaire (R4DQ) for&#xD;
           Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in Adults (FGIDs). This Questionnaire is&#xD;
           considered a research procedure. Once procedural informed consent is obtained, the&#xD;
           patient will be fitted for the recorder and ingest the SmartPill. The patient will&#xD;
           return the receiver up to seven days after the capsule was ingested.The SmartPill is&#xD;
           considered a research procedure. If the SmartPill is not excreted after day 7, the&#xD;
           patient will obtain an outpatient abdominal X-ray to determine if the SmartPill device&#xD;
           is retained in the intestines. A pregnancy test will be performed prior to any potential&#xD;
           radiation exposure for female patients of child-bearing ages, 13-50 years old. The&#xD;
           X-ray, if completed, is considered a research procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           **If there is concern the SmartPill may be retained in the intestine, the patient may be&#xD;
           asked to take a Patency agile capsule. This will require the patient to obtain a&#xD;
           abdominal X-ray 24 hours after ingestion as an outpatient to localize the capsule's&#xD;
           location. This is considered standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study period (two weeks): After 7 days, the patient will begin intervention with&#xD;
           polyethylene glycol (PEG) 17 g therapy for total of 2 weeks. If persistent symptoms (no&#xD;
           bowel movements in &gt; 24 hours, abdominal pain, straining, bloating), then the patient&#xD;
           can increase to 17 g twice daily. The patient will call the office after 1 week to&#xD;
           determine if step up to twice daily therapy is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients will receive a log to record time of PEG ingestion, if PEG was taken with&#xD;
           meals, a log of other medications taken during the intervention timeline, and recording&#xD;
           symptoms of constipation. Patients will be advised to avoid non-essential drugs that can&#xD;
           alter gut motility (see attached list found on the patient log) during the treatment&#xD;
           period. The study drug is considered standard of care procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Third visit: Two weeks following initiation of therapy, the patient will repeat the Rome&#xD;
           IV Diagnostic Questionnaire for Adult FGIDs (R4DQ) and ingest the second SmartPill to&#xD;
           assess for change in gut motility. Procedural informed consent will be obtained prior&#xD;
           the questionnaire and ingestion of the SmartPill. This Questionnaire and SmartPill&#xD;
           device is considered a research procedure. The patient will return the receiver up to&#xD;
           seven days after the capsule was ingested.The SmartPill is considered a research&#xD;
           procedure. If the SmartPill is not excreted after day 7, the patient will obtain an&#xD;
           outpatient abdominal XRay to determine if the SmartPill device is retained in the&#xD;
           intestines. A pregnancy test will be performed prior to any potential radiation exposure&#xD;
           for female patients of child-bearing ages, 13-50 years old.The X Ray, if completed, is&#xD;
           considered a research procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           **If there is concern the SmartPill may be retained in the intestine, the patient may be&#xD;
           asked to take a Patency agile capsule. This will require the patient to obtain a&#xD;
           abdominal X Ray 24 hours after ingestion as an outpatient to localize the capsule's&#xD;
           location. This is considered standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Fourth visit: The patient will return the recorder equipment for analysis and will&#xD;
           complete a post study questionnaire and undergo review of their therapy log detailing&#xD;
           how the medication was taken. This Questionnaire is considered a research procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject participation in the study ends at this point.&#xD;
