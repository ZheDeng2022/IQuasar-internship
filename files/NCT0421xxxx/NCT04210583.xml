    <textblock>
      Twelve month extension of a previous study of Multi-Polar RF and PEMF technologies for the&#xD;
      treatment of vaginal laxity and for the treatment of the mons pubis and labia for improvement&#xD;
      in skin laxity. The study will enroll up to 50 subjects who completed the Venus Fiore CS0716&#xD;
      study for the treatment of vaginal laxity and treatment of the mons pubis and labia for&#xD;
      improvement in skin laxity. Subjects will be followed up at least six and twelve months&#xD;
      post-treatment. Analysis will be performed on all subjects who complete the six-month and&#xD;
      twelve month follow-up visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional non-surgical treatments to treat vaginal laxity include Kegel exercises or pelvic&#xD;
      floor therapy with electrical stimulation of the vaginal musculature to promote muscle&#xD;
      strength. Although surgery to tighten the vaginal introitus has been used, pain at the&#xD;
      incision site leading to dyspareunia, sometimes for months, limits its use. Surgery is also&#xD;
      recommended to reduce protuberant mons pubis and the outer labial lips of the labia majora.&#xD;
      Most often, the mons pubis has been treated by fat reduction, either by liposuction or open&#xD;
      excision along with a pubic skin lift. Surgery to reduce the excess skin of the labia majora&#xD;
      tends to be avoided due to a lack of operative techniques and a fear of creating sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction. Development of alternative methods of treatment, avoiding the usual surgical&#xD;
      complications is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of non-ablative radiofrequency (RF) therapy has been used previously for the external&#xD;
      and internal female genitalia without incident or complications. The use of Multi-Polar RF&#xD;
      and PEMF technology was already demonstrated to be safe and efficient in delivering heat to&#xD;
      the tissue. A previous study investigated the safety and efficacy of combining these&#xD;
      technologies for the treatment of vaginal laxity and in the treatment of the mons pubis and&#xD;
      labia for the improvement in skin laxity at four-months post-treatment. Efficacy and safety&#xD;
      was confirmed up to 4-months post-treatment. (Venus FioreTM CS0716 study, unpublished raw&#xD;
      data). However, the durability of the treatment is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate whether Multi-Polar RF and PEMF technologies for the treatment of&#xD;
      vaginal laxity and for the treatment of the mons pubis and labia is safe and efficacious at&#xD;
      six-months and twelve-months post-treatment.&#xD;
