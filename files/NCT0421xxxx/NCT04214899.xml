  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Collect data on Mexican patients diagnosed with Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction,&#xD;
      their treatments, and their progress in a real-world environment. Additional objectives will&#xD;
      be analyzed, such as mortality, the use of resources associated with the follow-up of this&#xD;
      group of patients and the barriers, if any, to receiving the indicated treatment.&#xD;

      -  Identify the main epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with Heart&#xD;
           Failure with reduced ejection fraction, as well as the medical treatment models used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the prescription rate of a cardiovascular pharmacological treatment and the&#xD;
           prescription and implant rate of a cardiac medical device in patients with Heart Failure&#xD;
           with reduced ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the mortality rate and its classification in patients with Heart Failure with&#xD;
           reduced ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the barriers, if any, to prescribing and implanting a cardiac medical device in&#xD;
           those patients with a Class I recommendation according to the ACC/AHA/HRS 2017&#xD;
           guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the population with a profile of 1.5 primary prevention of sudden cardiac&#xD;
           death (patients with Heart Failure in primary prevention who have one or more of the&#xD;
           following risk factors: syncope or pre-syncope; left ventricular ejection fraction less&#xD;
           than 25%; presence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia; more than 10 ventricular&#xD;
           extrasystoles per hour observed in a 24-hour Holter).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect data on the use of resources associated with the follow-up of patients diagnosed&#xD;
           with Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction during a period of 12 months to&#xD;
           perform a secondary economic analysis.&#xD;
