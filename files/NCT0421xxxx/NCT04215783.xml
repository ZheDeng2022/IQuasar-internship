  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this research study is to study the relationship between childhood asthma,&#xD;
      allergies, and early-life environmental factors that may cause childhood asthma and&#xD;
      allergies. Previous birth cohort studies have found early-life environmental factors such as&#xD;
      allergies, pollutants, viruses and bacteria have all contributed to the development of asthma&#xD;
      and allergies. Investigators are doing this research because there continues to be a strong&#xD;
      need to understand the root causes of asthma and allergies. The CANOE study is an&#xD;
      observational cohort study, which means investigators are not asking participants or&#xD;
      participant's child to change their medications and investigators will not be giving&#xD;
      participants or participant's child a study drug.&#xD;

      The CANOE study will provide an opportunity to collect novel longitudinal samples not&#xD;
      available from the current CANOE birth cohorts, as well as enhanced and standardized&#xD;
      environmental sampling in early life. One of the main goals of this study is to gather data&#xD;
      and specimens, beginning in the prenatal periods, that will assess environmental exposures to&#xD;
      toxins and microbes, and host characteristics including genetics, epigenetics, gene&#xD;
      expression, the proteome and metabolome, microbial colonization and viral respiratory&#xD;
      infections. The main study outcomes will be important interim conditions (e.g., recurrent&#xD;
      wheeze, early multiple sensitization) that are highly associated with the development of&#xD;
      asthma. Additional outcomes (perinatal outcomes, growth, neurocognitive development) will be&#xD;
      collected as part of the collaborative Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes&#xD;
      (ECHO)-wide Cohort Data Collection Protocol.&#xD;

Physician diagnosis of eczema/AD (either study physician or other physician by parental report) at any time,&#xD;
Objective SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) â‰¥ 8 at 1 or more study assessments. The range of the objective SCORAD lies between 0 and 83. Based on the objective SCORAD, the severity of AD can be classified into mild (&lt;15), moderate (between 15 and 40) and severe (greater than or equal to 40) AD.&#xD;
Parent report of an itchy rash outside of the diaper area lasting for at least 7 days and not diagnosed as another condition.</description>

      Cryopreserved samples of serum, plasma, urine, and nasal secretions or wash fluid, will be&#xD;
      analyzed for proteins or metabolites that may serve as biomarkers for exposures or for study&#xD;
      outcomes. A genetic sample (blood buffy coat or saliva) from the mother and child will be&#xD;
      saved (if they agree) for use later to look at DNA, RNA or both.&#xD;

        The study participants of CANOE will consist of four ethnically diverse cohorts from&#xD;
        predominantly urban and suburban families at 4 sites. Previous studies have identified&#xD;
        common themes in populations of children who differ by ethnicity and environmental&#xD;
        exposures. These include inverse relationships between wheezing and/or atopy and exposure&#xD;
        to specific microbes and allergens in early life. Obtaining prospective data from newly&#xD;
        recruited participants during the prenatal period offers multiple opportunities to optimize&#xD;
        sample collection for assessment of environmental exposures and enhance the scientific&#xD;
        value of the CREW consortium. To enrich the cohort for the development of wheezing and&#xD;
        allergic sensitization, we will enroll participants with a family history of asthma or&#xD;
        allergies.&#xD;

             testing which, in the opinion of the investigator or designee, may pose additional&#xD;
             risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant's ability to&#xD;
             comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or interpretation of the&#xD;
             data obtained from the study.&#xD;
