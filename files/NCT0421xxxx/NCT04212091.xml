    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      antiviral activity of the monoclonal antibody PGT121.414.LS administered alone and in&#xD;
      combination with VRC07-523LS via intravenous or subcutaneous infusions in healthy,&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected adult participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity&#xD;
      of the monoclonal antibody PGT121.414.LS administered alone and in combination with&#xD;
      VRC07-523LS via intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) infusions in healthy, HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      adult participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two parts (Part A and B). Part A will include four groups&#xD;
      (Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4) and Part B will include two groups (Groups 5 and 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A of the study, PGT121.414.LS will be administered via IV infusion at 3, 10, or 30&#xD;
      mg/kg (Groups 1-3) or via SC infusion at 5 mg/kg (Group 4). Participants in Part B will&#xD;
      receive consecutive administration of PGT121.414.LS followed by VRC07-523LS, at 20 mg/kg IV&#xD;
      each per dose (Group 5) or 5 mg/kg SC each per dose (Group 6). Participants will be followed&#xD;
      for 32 weeks after the last study product administration via IV infusion and 24 weeks after&#xD;
      the last study product administration via SC infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Groups 1, 2, and 3 will attend 8 months of study visits. Participants in&#xD;
      Group 4 will attend 6 months of study visits. Part B participants will attend 16 months of&#xD;
      study visits. Study visits may include physical examinations, blood and urine collection, and&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
