  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only about 30 percent of cancer patients have a clinical benefit upon cetuximab&#xD;
      administration. Pilot studies in colorectal and head and neck cancer patients have suggested&#xD;
      that cetuximab pharmacokinetics (PK), i.e. clearance values, could impact on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes such as survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining cetuximab plasma clearance requires sophisticated PK modeling using population&#xD;
      approaches, thus making it difficult to implement in routine clinical practice. In addition,&#xD;
      all the preliminary studies with cetuximab were based upon Elisa determination of cetuximab&#xD;
      plasma levels, an analytical method that fails to meet the requirements of daily practice in&#xD;
      laboratories performing therapeutic drug monitoring. This pilot study aimed at evaluating the&#xD;
      mass spec method analytical performance as part of a &quot; real life &quot; study, evaluating the&#xD;
      inter-patient variability of exposure levels in head and neck cancer patients, and&#xD;
      establishing a putative link between those exposure levels and clinical outcome. Results from&#xD;
      25 patients fully confirmed the analytical performance of the mass spec method (e.g., lack of&#xD;
      matrix effect, acceptable sensitivity to monitor trough levels, lack of impact of sampling&#xD;
      processing or freezing/thawing cycles). In addition, a large inter-individual variability&#xD;
      (Superior at 50 percent) was observed, both in the peak concentrations (Cmax) and in trough&#xD;
      levels (Cmin). Most interestingly, despite the limited number of patients enrolled, a&#xD;
      statistically significant association was shown between exposure levels (i.e. calculated AUC)&#xD;
      and clinical outcome (DCR). This difference was even more significant on Cmin, thus&#xD;
      suggesting that simple trough levels monitoring could help to predict efficacy. Further&#xD;
      analysis on survival showed that although not statistically significant, a trend towards&#xD;
      longer both progression-free survival and overall survival was observed in the subgroup of&#xD;
      patients with higher trough levels. In particular, 3-year survival was 29 percent and 0&#xD;
      percent in the subgroups with high and low trough concentrations, respectively (unpublished&#xD;
      data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond tumoral factors, these preliminary data suggest that cetuximab Cmin levels could be a&#xD;
      predictive marker of therapeutic efficacy and that simple therapeutic drug monitoring could&#xD;
      help to forecast clinical outcome or enable dosage adaptation.&#xD;
