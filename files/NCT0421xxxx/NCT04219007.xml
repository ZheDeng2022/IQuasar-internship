  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short stature can be caused by a number of genetic etiologies, many of which directly affect&#xD;
      the growth plate. The FGFR3/CNP pathway is central to growth of the chondrocyte. The study&#xD;
      team hypothesizes that patients with selected genetic causes of short stature that interact&#xD;
      with this pathway will benefit from treatment with vosoritide, a CNP analog, a selective&#xD;
      NPR-B agonist which directly targets the growth plate. This study will enroll patients with&#xD;
      short stature in selected genetic categories and will follow them for a 6 month observation&#xD;
      period to obtain a baseline growth velocity, safety profile and quality of life assessment.&#xD;
      Patients will then be treated with vosoritide for 12 months and will be assessed for safety&#xD;
      monitoring and improvement in height outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Vosoritide, also known as BMN 111 or modified recombinant human C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), is a 39-amino-acid peptide analog that includes the 37 C-terminal amino acids of the human CNP53 sequence plus the addition of 2 amino acids (Pro-Gly) on the N-terminus. This structural modification conveys resistance to neutral endopeptidase (NEP) degradation, resulting in prolonged half-life (t1/2) in comparison to endogenous CNP. This increase in t1/2 allows once daily subcutaneous (SC) administration.&#xD;
Vosoritide will be administered as a single 15 μg/kg subcutaneous injection given daily for 12 months.</description>

             any research-related procedure. Also, subjects under the age of 18 are willing and&#xD;
             able to provide assent (if required) after the nature of the study has been explained&#xD;
             and prior to performance of any research-related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;
             duration of the study&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Pre-pubertal defined as Tanner Stage 1 breasts in females and testicular volumes &lt;3 cc&#xD;
             in males. This must be confirmed at the Day 1 visit prior to initiation of vosoritide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient height &lt;-2.25 SDS. All height SDS values are calculated using the CDC growth&#xD;
             charts/data tables (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in genes known to cause the&#xD;
             specific genetic subgroups of short stature listed below are eligible for inclusion in&#xD;
             the study. Pathogenicity of variants will be classified as per the American College of&#xD;
             Medical Genetics criteria with the exception of ACAN mutations as detailed below&#xD;
             (Richards et al., 2015). Documentation of the presence of the variant must be obtained&#xD;
             using a lab results report from a CLIA certified laboratory. Classification of the&#xD;
             variant's pathogenicity status will be performed by the Children's National study&#xD;
             team.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A. CNP deficiency due to mutations in NPPC - Subjects with heterozygous or homozygous&#xD;
             defects in NPPC are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             B. Hypochondroplasia - Subjects with heterozygous variants in FGFR3 gene associated&#xD;
             with hypochondroplasia are eligible. Subjects with variants in FGFR3 known to cause&#xD;
             achondroplasia or thanatophoric dysplasia or SADDAN syndrome will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             C. Patients with heterozygous defects in NPR2 are eligible. Patients with homozygous&#xD;
             defects in NPR2 will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             D. Rasopathy patients (including Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome,&#xD;
             Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Neurofibromatosis Type 1) - This include patients with&#xD;
             heterozygous variants in the following genes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. BRAF ii. CBL iii. HRAS iv. KRAS v. LZTR1 vi. MAP2K1 vii. MAP2K2 viii. MRAS ix. NF1&#xD;
             x. NRAS xi. PPP1CB xii. PTPN11 xiii. RAF1 xiv. RRAS xv. RIT1 xvi. SHOC2 xvii. SOS1&#xD;
             xviii. SOS2&#xD;
&#xD;
             E. Patients with SHOX deficiency - Patients with either heterozygous, compound&#xD;
             heterozygous or homozygous defects in SHOX including patients with heterozygous or&#xD;
             homozygous deletions of the SHOX regulatory region known to cause SHOX deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
             F. Patients with heterozygous defects in ACAN - Patients must be heterozygous for a&#xD;
             mutation in the ACAN gene. As there are no validated in vitro assays that reliably&#xD;
             assess an individual variant's effect on aggrecan function, for the purpose of this&#xD;
             clinical trial a mutation in ACAN will be defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A heterozygous deletion of the entire gene or of &gt;1 complete exons of the gene&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Any truncating mutation including frameshift, nonsense, splice site mutations&#xD;
                  within 2 bases of the exon/intron boundary, and start loss variants&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Any missense mutation which meets all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. It has an aggregate minor allele frequency less than 1X10-5 based on the gnomAD&#xD;
             data (gnomad.broadinstitute.org) ii. It is predicted to be damaging by BOTH Polyphen2&#xD;
             and SIFT iii. It segregates with the short stature phenotype in available family&#xD;
             members or is a de novo mutation d. In-frame insertions or deletions of &gt;1 amino acid&#xD;
             e. In-frame insertions or deletions of 1 amino acid must meet the same criteria as&#xD;
             missense mutations. For the prediction programs, Alanine will be substituted for the&#xD;
             deleted amino acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Absence of growth hormone deficiency defined as an IGF-1 level above the lower limit&#xD;
             of the normal range of the assay. The IGF-1 may be repeated during the 6 month&#xD;
             observation period and prior to the Day 1 visit. If this repeat IGF-1 is above the&#xD;
             lower limit of the normal range of the assay, then the subject is deemed eligible. If&#xD;
             a patient has an IGF-1 level below the lower limit of the normal range of the assay,&#xD;
             two growth hormone stimulation tests must be performed using the routine local&#xD;
             protocols. Patients with a peak growth hormone level &gt;7 ng/ml will be considered&#xD;
             growth hormone sufficient and will be eligible for inclusion as per the Growth Hormone&#xD;
             Research Society International consensus (Collett-Solberg et al., 2019). If indicated&#xD;
             based on IGF-1 level from the referring clinician, the growth hormone stimulation test&#xD;
             must be done as part of routine clinical care prior to enrollment. The rationale for&#xD;
             using an IGF-1 below the normal range as the cut-off for further evaluation for growth&#xD;
             hormone deficiency is that in patients with a clear genetic explanation for their&#xD;
             short stature, an IGF-1 level anywhere within the normal range would be considered&#xD;
             reassuring and would not lead to a growth hormone stimulation test in a routine&#xD;
             clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject and their guardian must speak one of the 11 languages for which the&#xD;
             QoLISSY survey (a quality of life survey for short stature) is available. These&#xD;
             include: English, Spanish, German, Russian, Swedish, Flemish, Italian, Turkish,&#xD;
             French, Japanese, and Ukrainian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Growth plate fusion - Defined as a bone age via the Greulich and Pyle method of 13&#xD;
             years in females and 15 years in males. These patients have limited remaining growth&#xD;
             potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Concomitant treatment with growth hormone or recombinant IGF-1. Patients may have been&#xD;
             previously treated with growth hormone or IGF-1 therapy. If the patient is currently&#xD;
             on one of these therapies, they will be required to discontinue treatment in order to&#xD;
             begin the baseline observation period for this trial. That decision will be deferred&#xD;
             to their treating clinical endocrinologists in conjunction with the patient's&#xD;
             guardians. We anticipate that only patients who are having a poor response to their&#xD;
             therapy will be interested in enrolling in the current study as there is no rationale&#xD;
             for a patient who is receiving growth hormone therapy and having a positive response&#xD;
             to enroll in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior treatment with a GnRH analog, aromatase inhibitor or oxandrolone&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of any type of malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Chronic medical condition known to affect growth including but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A. Cystic fibrosis B. Diabetes C. Inflammatory Bowel Disease D. Celiac Disease E.&#xD;
             Asthma requiring a daily inhaled steroid dose &gt; 400 micrograms of inhaled budesonide&#xD;
             per day or equivalent F. Taking daily oral glucocorticoids for any reason G. Note -&#xD;
             ADHD treated with a stimulant and treated hypothyroidism with a normal TSH will NOT&#xD;
             exclude the subject from participating in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             H. Turner Syndrome or any other chromosomal aneuploidy I. Congenital heart disease&#xD;
             which places the subject at increased risk of an adverse cardiac outcome in the&#xD;
             setting of hypotension including but not limited to: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
             aortic stenosis with peak gradient &gt;50mmHg, severe aortic regurgitation (defined as&#xD;
             pressure half time &gt;500ms by echocardiogram), coronary insufficiency, or any anatomy&#xD;
             with a need for an afterload reducing agent. Any patient with baseline abnormalities&#xD;
             on echocardiogram will be reviewed with a pediatric cardiologist for appropriateness&#xD;
             for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Malnutrition - Defined as a BMI &lt;5th percentile (CDC growth charts)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any clinically significant abnormality on screening tests as determined by the&#xD;
             principal investigator. Abnormal screening labs may be repeated during the 6 month&#xD;
             observation period prior to Day 1. If they return to normal or non-clinically&#xD;
             significant deviations per the PI's determination, the subject may proceed with the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known or suspected allergy to trial medication, excipients, or related products&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The receipt of any investigational drug within 90 days prior to this trial&#xD;
