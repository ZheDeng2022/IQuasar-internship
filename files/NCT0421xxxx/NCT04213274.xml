  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of RPH-104 in subjects&#xD;
      with Schnitzler Syndrome using Schnitzler Disease Activity Score (SDAS), which includes the&#xD;
      Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) and the local laboratory C-reactive protein (CRP) result&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a double blind, placebo controlled&#xD;
      treatment period (14 days), followed by an 8 week safety follow up period after the second&#xD;
      dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with an established diagnosis of Schnitzler Syndrome (SchS) will participate in a&#xD;
      Screening period of up to 28 days after signing an informed consent form (ICF). Subjects will&#xD;
      be advised to schedule the Day 0 visit with the study staff as soon as the symptoms of SchS&#xD;
      flare occur during the Screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria at the site visit during the&#xD;
      screening period, other screening visits are allowed within this period until the subject&#xD;
      meets the study criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 14 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (in a 1:1 ratio)&#xD;
      to receive a double blind, single subcutaneous (SC) injection of study drug (80 mg RPH-104 or&#xD;
      matching placebo) on Day 0. On Day 14, subjects will receive a second dose of randomized&#xD;
      treatment as well as an additional dose of 80 mg RPH-104 or placebo based on response to&#xD;
      treatment, such that responders (SDAS = 0) will receive a dose of placebo, and non responders&#xD;
      defined as no response (no change in SDAS) or partial responders (SDAS ≥ 1, and activity&#xD;
      reduction by 1 or more points of SDAS compared to baseline) will receive an 80 mg RPH 104&#xD;
      dose. (Schnitzler Disease Activity Score includes the PGA score and C-reactive protein (CRP)&#xD;
      result: If the PGA and CRP grades are not of the same severity, the higher severity level of&#xD;
      either PGA or CRP will be used to determine the SDAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be stopped after Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Death is reported in 2 subjects assigned to the RPH 104 treatment arm or after receiving&#xD;
           RPH 104 on Day 14 (i.e., non responder to the Day 0 study drug dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two subjects assigned to the RPH 104 treatment arm or after receiving RPH 104 on Day 14&#xD;
           (ie, non responder to the Day 0 study drug dose) report liver function test&#xD;
           abnormalities which meet Hy's Law criteria (ie, increased ALT and/or AST 3 fold or&#xD;
           greater from upper limit of normal (ULN) combined with jaundice or weakness or&#xD;
           hypochondrial pain/severity or increased Total Bilirubin (TBil) level 2 fold or greater&#xD;
           from ULN, [not explained by any other causative factors like virus]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of SchS symptoms will be assessed daily from Day 0 through Day 28 using the PR&#xD;
      SchS Scale, at clinic visits on Day 0, Day 14, and Day 28 using the Patient Global Impression&#xD;
      of Severity (PGIS), at clinic visits on Day 14 and Day 28 using the Patient Global Impression&#xD;
      of Change (PGIC), and at each clinic visit using the PGA, CRP, SAA, and SDAS. Subjects will&#xD;
      be followed through Day 70 for safety (A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will&#xD;
      periodically review and evaluate the accumulated study data for subject safety).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  5. Males, female partners of sexually active male subjects, and women of childbearing&#xD;
