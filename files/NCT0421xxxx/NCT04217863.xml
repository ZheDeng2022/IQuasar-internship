  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Multicenter study is planned to investigate the effectiveness of the guided disclosure&#xD;
      protocol for the promotion of post-traumatic growth (PTG), in the traumatic stress subjects&#xD;
      and to determine whether PTG is associated with psychophysiological alterations i.e.&#xD;
      (C-Reactive Protein, Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor, Interlukin-6, Cortisol, Heart Rate&#xD;
      Variability and brain waves). Study subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be randomized&#xD;
      into two groups. Guided disclosure protocol (GDP) will be used as intervention vs the&#xD;
      control. Blinded treatment will be provided and the subjects will be made to complete study&#xD;
      questionnaires (Screening, Traumatic Stress Scale SSS, Trauma Symptom Checklist,&#xD;
      Post-traumatic growth Inventory) at baseline and at post-intervention (3-months later).&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as multicenter randomized controlled trial. On the basis of&#xD;
      eligibility criteria subjects providing consent to participate in the study will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups, experimental group including those who receive the intervention&#xD;
      and a control group receiving control intervention. The study outcomes will be monitored in&#xD;
      subjects of both groups at different intervals i.e. at baseline and at 3-month follow-up&#xD;
      (post-interventional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Subjects for the present study will be recruited from 5 centers (based in&#xD;
      Karachi, Pakistan). The targeted population includes subjects from diverse ethnicity and&#xD;
      considered eligible for participation in the study if they indicated in a pre-screening form&#xD;
      that they had experienced traumatic event. These subjects will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      the study through advertisement on notice board of each center. A written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from each study subject after providing detailed information regarding&#xD;
      objectives of the study and its duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental intervention (GDP):&#xD;
&#xD;
      It includes three writing sessions of 20 minutes where the participants will be made to&#xD;
      recall the facts regarding the traumatic event first and then the emotions triggered related&#xD;
      to the revealed facts will be channelized. The information related to the immediate priority&#xD;
      changes due to the revival of the traumatic history and its reflection on current feelings&#xD;
      will be collected. Moreover, the learned coping mechanisms will also be inquired and how the&#xD;
      traumatic event altered their vision and their personalities and how it helps in coping with&#xD;
      future difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original instructions will be translated into local language and altered according to the&#xD;
      specific traumatic experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the following, a fusion of the tasks concerning each of the three writing sessions is&#xD;
      shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will be required to describe memories associated with traumatic event in a&#xD;
           sequential order, with an objective and detached attitude&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. They will be asked to describe&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Their opinion regarding the traumatic event and emotions perceived during the&#xD;
                experience&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Its impact on their daily lives, and how it has altered their attitudes toward&#xD;
                life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The actual situation will be focused, while reviving the whole traumatic event&#xD;
           experience which aids in exploring the following aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Present thoughts and feelings regarding the traumatic experience, and also clarify&#xD;
                the differences between the ones felt at the time of traumatic event in comparison&#xD;
                to the current feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  How much they understand and appreciate themselves for successfully dealing with&#xD;
                the traumatic event&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To what extent the traumatic event has modified their vision, attitude, knowledge,&#xD;
                and skills, and how it can help in their future;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  What will be their future reactions to other similar events. For the writing&#xD;
                session it is mandatory to maintain standard experimental environment with maximum&#xD;
                silence so that the subject can write peacefully without getting disturbed. Two&#xD;
                weeks after the initial assessment, the first writing session will be performed&#xD;
                followed by two sessions once every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In control intervention the subjects will be required to take three 20-minute writing&#xD;
      sessions, in which they will be asked to write about their daily events of the past week, the&#xD;
      writing must focus on the facts and highlight an objective and detached attitude. It has&#xD;
      shown potential improvements after the guided disclosure protocol (GDP). Works through the&#xD;
      placebo effect. Same protocol will be followed for these subjects as the one used for GDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A day prior to each writing session, in both conditions either experimental or control the&#xD;
      researcher will communicate with each study subject via telephone in order to give them a&#xD;
      reminder to perform the writing task and to check their understanding regarding the&#xD;
      instructions given in the booklet. Details regarding the inability to contact the subject&#xD;
      will also be recorded in the patient form.&#xD;
