  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/II study of combination therapy with APG-1252&#xD;
      plus paclitaxel in patients with relapsed/refractory small-cell lung cancer(SCLC). The phase&#xD;
      Ib portion will be done using time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM)&#xD;
      methodology to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      APG-1252 with a fixed dose of paclitaxel. The phase II portion will utilize a Simon two-stage&#xD;
      design to determine the efficacy of the combination therapy with response rate as the primary&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon enrollment, patients will undergo a comprehensive history and physical exam, along with&#xD;
      baseline laboratory assessment. Baseline CT imaging will be required within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
      study entry. Archival tissue is mandatory; a fresh biopsy of the primary tumor or a&#xD;
      metastatic lesion prior to initiation of therapy is optional and post-treatment tumor biopsy&#xD;
      is strongly encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase Ib portion, eligible patients will receive APG-1252 at the assigned dose-level&#xD;
      on days 1, 8 and 15 plus a fixed-dose of paclitaxel 80 mg/m˄2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day&#xD;
      cycle. There will be three dose-levels of APG-1252 (-1, 80 mg; 1, 160 mg; 2, 240 mg) with the&#xD;
      first patient starting at dose-level 1 and subsequent patients at dose-levels determined by&#xD;
      the TITE-CRM methodology. There will be no intra-patient dose-escalation. Patients will be&#xD;
      continuously assessed for adverse events, including DLTs which are defined in the protocol.&#xD;
      Response assessment by CT imaging will occur every 2 cycles and treatment will continue until&#xD;
      progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, patient preference to stop treatment,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, or administrative discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase II portion, eligible patients will receive APG-1252 at the RP2D determined in&#xD;
      the phase Ib portion on days 1, 8 and 15 plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m˄2 on days 1 and 8 of a&#xD;
      21-day cycle. Response assessment by CT imaging will occur every 2 cycles and treatment will&#xD;
      continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, patient preference to stop&#xD;
      treatment, withdrawal of consent, or administrative discontinuation.&#xD;

    <description>APG-1252 (Ascentage Pharma) is a highly potent Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor with high binding affinity for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w. APG-1252 possesses strong antitumor activity as a single-agent against tumor cells addicted to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, and exhibits a much broader antitumor activity when combined with chemotherapeutic agents.</description>
