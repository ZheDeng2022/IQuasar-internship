  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking to further our knowledge on disease biology and treatment selection&#xD;
      for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this study is to see how useful it is to&#xD;
      look for changes and characteristics in your genes (molecules that contain instructions for&#xD;
      the development and functioning of the cells) and the genes within the tumour. These&#xD;
      characteristics may be useful in choosing treatments for patients for the future.&#xD;

      There will be two study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patients with suspected or diagnosed localized gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patients diagnosed with de novo metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Fresh&#xD;
           tumour, adjacent normal tissue materials, and blood samples will be acquired and&#xD;
           utilized to generate molecular data. Stool or rectal swab samples will also be acquired&#xD;
           for microbiome analysis. Physiologic, quality of life, epidemiologic, frailty, and other&#xD;
           clinical data will be systematically collected as standard of care to serve as clinical&#xD;
           correlates for the molecular data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility to produce a potential molecular signature in a clinically meaningful time&#xD;
           point in patients with locally advanced GEA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study the molecular characteristics of GEA in patients with localized and resectable&#xD;
           disease and identify predictive signatures of response to induction therapy and the&#xD;
           development of novel treatment regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To validate previously identified mutational signatures that defined subgroups of GEA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility to produce a potential molecular signature in a clinically meaningful time&#xD;
           point for patients with advanced GEA on 1st line chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use of genotypes and genomic analyses to define therapies, and develop predictive and&#xD;
           prognostic models&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the feasibility of prospectively identifying distinct genomic characteristics&#xD;
           which associate with response to systemic therapy and survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ENDPOINTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility of obtaining timely sequencing data (8-12 weeks) to guide treatment for&#xD;
           patients progressing on 1st line treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Feasibility of using ctDNA, metabolome, immune profiling and other emerging technologies&#xD;
           to guide treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish a program of personalized care for GEA patients in terms of pre-treatment&#xD;
           assessment (Physiological and Frailty Risk Assessment, QOLQ, 4. Sarcopenia and Adiposity&#xD;
           measurements) and treatment based on clinical-genomic correlations&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Establishment of repository of biospecimens (tumour, blood and microbiome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Establishment of robust preclinical models of GEA: PDO and PDX models&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assess the feasibility of using PDO models to identify drug sensitivity to guide&#xD;
           treatment decisions&#xD;
