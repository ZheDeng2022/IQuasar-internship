  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To address the multifaceted challenges associated with tuberculosis (TB) in-person directly&#xD;
      observed therapy (DOT), the World Health Organization recently recommended countries maximize&#xD;
      the use of digital adherence technologies. Sub-Saharan Africa needs to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of such technologies in local contexts and proactively contribute to global&#xD;
      decisions around patient-centered TB care. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      pillbox-enabled self-administered therapy (SAT) compared to standard DOT on adherence to TB&#xD;
      medication and treatment outcomes in Ethiopia. It also aims to assess the usability,&#xD;
      acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention from the patient and provider&#xD;
      perspectives. It is designed as a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label,&#xD;
      non-inferiority, effectiveness-implementation hybrid, mixed-methods, two-arm trial.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the intervention arm (n = 72) will receive 15 days of HRZE-isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol-fixed-dose combination therapy in the evriMED500 medication event reminder monitor device (Wisepill Technologies, South Africa) for self-administration. When returned, providers will count any remaining tablets in the device, download the pill-taking data, and refill based on preset criteria. Participants can consult the provider in cases of illness or adverse events outside of scheduled visits.</description>
