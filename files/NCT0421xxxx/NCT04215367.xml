      Daily intake of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), which is the major component of the&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet and also a source of monounsaturated fat, may be partly responsible for&#xD;
      the increased life expectancy of the Mediterranean people. A high dietary intake of EVOO is&#xD;
      correlated with lower incidence of cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic diseases,&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis Oleocanthal, a phenolic derivative of extra virgin olive&#xD;
      oil, has important health promoting anti-cancerous properties, since it can inhibit the&#xD;
      growth and promote the apoptosis of several cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary intake of olive oil&#xD;
      rich in oleocanthal on hematological, metabolical, cell progression markers and disease&#xD;
      progression in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. The aim is also to study the&#xD;
      possible association of apoptosis in the mechanism of action of virgin olive oil phenols in a&#xD;
      patient with CLL in order to find the possible mechanism of the cellular action of&#xD;
      oleocanthal in neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening of &gt;300 EVOO samples the investigators selected an EVOO with high&#xD;
      oleocanthal and oleacin concentration of 416 and 284 mg/Kg respectively (EVOO OC/OL). Pilot&#xD;
      dietary intervention was made in a group of 21 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia&#xD;
      (CLL) who did not follow any treatment. EVOO was administered 40 ml/day for six months.&#xD;
      Biochemical, hematological and molecular markers were studied six month before the&#xD;
      intervention and six month during the intervention&#xD;

      Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is the major component of the Mediterranean diet. More than 200&#xD;
      different chemical compounds have been detected in olive oil, including fatty acids, sterols,&#xD;
      carotenoids, terpenoids, flavonoids, tocopherols and olive polyphenols. Virgin olive oil&#xD;
      contains a variety of important phenolic components, mainly corresponding to the compounds&#xD;
      tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, oleocanthal (OC) ,oleacin (OL) ,ligstroside and oleuropein aglycones&#xD;
      .Among these olive phenols, oleocanthal , a dialdehydic form of dicarboxymethyl ligstroside&#xD;
      aglycone which has been isolated from EVOO, presents a wide range of biological effects&#xD;
      including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective and antidiabetic&#xD;
      activities and for this reason has attracted more scientific attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), the most commonly diagnosed adult leukemia in Western&#xD;
      countries, is responsible for about 1 in 4 cases of all leukemias. It is characterized by the&#xD;
      accumulation of monoclonal B-cells in bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymphatic tissues and&#xD;
      spleen, while it is often asymptomatic and slow in its development. Patients with CLL do not&#xD;
      always require immediate therapy. However, patients who appear symptoms have an approximate&#xD;
      median survival range from 18 months to 6 years depending on the clinical stage. Criteria for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of CLL are monoclonal B lymphocytes ≥5000 lymphocytes/ml in the peripheral&#xD;
      blood for at least 3 months, prolymphocytes ≤55%, co-expression of claster of diferentiation&#xD;
      (CD)5 and B-cell surface antigens CD 19, CD 20, and CD 23, low levels of CD 20, CD 79b and&#xD;
      low expression of surface immunoglobulins (sIg), and kappa or lambda light chain restriction.&#xD;
      The standard clinical procedures to estimate prognosis are the clinical staging systems&#xD;
      developed by Rai et al and Binet et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of apoptosis in hematopoiesis may provide information about the mechanism which is&#xD;
      responsible for the regulation of progenitor's and stem cell's proliferation. The dysfunction&#xD;
      of apoptosis has found to be associated with leukemia. An increase in the expression of&#xD;
      Apo-1/fas (CD 95) apoptotic marker in myeloid progenitor cells in CLL patients and a&#xD;
      corresponding decrease in the apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor has been&#xD;
      described. Recent studies showed also that the increase in CLL patients' lymphocytes may be&#xD;
      due to the disturbed balance between the proliferation and apoptosis of CLL cells while the&#xD;
      changes in apoptosis-related protein expression are recognized during all the stages of Binet&#xD;
      in CLL. The p38 levels are reduced (resistance to apoptosis) and Induced myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1) and Survivin levels are elevated, so as to enhance the&#xD;
      survival of B lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survivin is a protein inhibitor of apoptosis which inhibits caspases and blocks cell death.&#xD;
      It is highly expressed in most cancers, including hematological, and is associated with a&#xD;
      poor clinical outcome. The apoptotic marker CD 95 (Apo-1/fas) and its ligand, CD 95 is a&#xD;
      death receptor ligand that mediates apoptosis induction in order to maintain immune&#xD;
      homeostasis and has the capacity to mediate apoptosis induction in cancer cells, generating&#xD;
      an 18-kilodalton fragment termed caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 (cCK-18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oleocanthal has been shown to induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis in vitro in human acute&#xD;
      promyelocytic leukemia and in myeloma cells. It may also cause primary necrosis and cellular&#xD;
      apoptosis by inducing lysosomal membrane permeability in different cancer cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study taking into account the strong apoptotic properties of oleocanthal in&#xD;
      vitro, was to investigate its ability, under real clinical settings, to affect the&#xD;
      hematological and biochemical profile; also the cellular apoptotic markers Survivin, cCK18-&#xD;
      (caspase activity marker) and Apo1fas/CD 95 in CLL patients after taking into consideration&#xD;
      the progression of their disease. For this reason was conducted a dietary intervention study&#xD;
      comparing the antineoplastic effects of an oleocanthal-rich EVOO in CLL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, a screening of 300 commercial samples (selected among a database of&#xD;
      &gt;3000 samples), obtained from olives (Olea europaea L.) harvested in 2017-2018 season, was&#xD;
      performed by the Quantitative NMR spectroscopy (qNMR) method in order to identify oils which&#xD;
      could fulfill the following criteria: The extravirgin oil would have high oleocanthal and&#xD;
      oleacin content (D1 index) and low or even no content in other secoiridoid conjugated&#xD;
      phenolics (3-8) or free tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol Specifically Oil rich in Oleocanthal was&#xD;
      obtained from Monovarietal oil of Lianolia Kerkyras variety provided by &quot;The Governor&quot;&#xD;
      Company from Agios Matthaios, Corfu, Greece. This oil contained: Oleocanthal 416±7 mg/Kg,&#xD;
      oleacin 284±10 mg/Kg, Tyrosol &lt; 10 mg/Kg, Hydroxytyrosol &lt; 10 mg/Kg (D1 = 700 mg/Kg). It&#xD;
      should be mentioned that apart the qNMR analysis, the hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol content was&#xD;
      also measured by the standard IOC method for measurement of olive oil biophenols. Selected&#xD;
      EVOO immediately after their analysis and until the beginning of the study period were stored&#xD;
      at 4 celsious degree in order to minimize possible alterations in chemical composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Twenty one patients from the hematologic clinic of the General hospital of Lakonia&#xD;
      (Greece), were enrolled to participate in the dietary intervention. CLL diagnosis was&#xD;
      confirmed by standard criteria. Patients were untreated, in Rai stage 0 to II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Intervention At the begin of the pilot study medical exams of each patient's history&#xD;
      were recorded for third and sixth month before dietary the intervention. The clinical record&#xD;
      before the dietary intervention concerns the hematological profile, biochemical exams&#xD;
      including, lipidemic profile, fasting glucose, Liver and kidney function markers, as well as&#xD;
      data concerning blood marrow biopsy, neoplastic markers and immunophenotype. Drug treatment&#xD;
      or comorbidities were also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the begin of the pilot dietary intervention a group of 21 patients with CLL consumed&#xD;
      before their meals, 40 ml/day of EVOO rich in olecanthal and oleacin (OC/OL) for 6 months, in&#xD;
      order to explore the effect of the dietary consumption of the A-EVOO on the studied&#xD;
      hematological, biochemical and molecular markers. The amount of the consumed EVOO OC/OL was&#xD;
      chosen according to a previous study. (15) Patients were advised to continue their regular&#xD;
      diet; their adherence to the study protocol was assessed by two 24-h telephone recalls every&#xD;
      two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood samples from the 21 patients with CLL were gathered at the begin, after 3&#xD;
      months and after 6 months from the begin of the dietary intervention. Whole blood count and&#xD;
      complete biochemical tests were performed for fasting glucose, blood lipid profile, and&#xD;
      markers of liver and kidney function. Serum analyses were conducted using the same procedure&#xD;
      and at the same lab with the use of a biochemical analyzer (Olympus AU-600, Olympus, Tokyo,&#xD;
      Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used according to the&#xD;
      instructions of the supplier to assay the apoptotic markers M30 Apoptosense-cCK18 (VLVbio&#xD;
      Hästholmsvägen, Sweden), Apo-1/Fas/CD 95 (Novus Biologicals, Colorado USA) and the&#xD;
      antiapoptotic marker Survivin (OriGene Technologies, Inc USA) into plasma samples of all the&#xD;
      patients at all the studied time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.24 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL. USA) and the&#xD;
      significance level was set at 0.05. Initially a descriptive analysis of the sample was&#xD;
      performed in terms of age, sex, clinical, biochemical and molecular markers. The markers were&#xD;
      found to be skewed at p &lt; 0.05 significance level when checked by using the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Therefore non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test were used to find out&#xD;
      the differences between the intervention and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences between the time intervals of the intervention was assessed with Friedman&#xD;
      non-parametric test followed by Dunn's test for multiple comparison Finally, the correlations&#xD;
      of the molecular markers with the clinical parameters included in the study and were checked&#xD;
      with Spearman Rho.&#xD;
