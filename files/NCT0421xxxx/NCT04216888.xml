  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to identify predictors of response to intranasal ketamine treatment in&#xD;
      patients with treatment-resistant depression. Participants will give a sample of blood and&#xD;
      undergo magnetic resonance imaging before and after a single intranasal ketamine treatment.&#xD;
      Participants will subsequently receive a second intranasal ketamine treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Able to read, understand, and provide written, dated informed consent prior to&#xD;
             screening. Participants will be deemed likely to comply with study protocol and&#xD;
             communicate with study personnel about adverse events and other clinically important&#xD;
             information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ability to participate in MRI (no history of claustrophobia, no presence of metallic&#xD;
             foreign bodies incompatible with MRI, as assessed with MRI checklist and clinical&#xD;
             interview).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorders (MDD), single or recurrent, and currently&#xD;
             experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE) of at least eight weeks in duration,&#xD;
             prior to screening, according to the criteria defined in the Diagnosis and Statistical&#xD;
             Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). The diagnosis of MDD will be made&#xD;
             by a site psychiatrist and supported by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5&#xD;
             (SCID-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has a history of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), as assessed by the investigator&#xD;
             using the Mass General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment History Questionnaire (MGH&#xD;
             ATRQ). TRD is defined as failure to achieve a satisfactory response (e.g., less than&#xD;
             50% improvement of depression symptoms), as perceived by the participant, to at least&#xD;
             1 &quot;treatment course&quot; of a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant therapy of at least 8&#xD;
             weeks duration (including the current antidepressant treatment). The adequacy of dose&#xD;
             and duration of the antidepressant therapy will be determined as per the MGH ATRQ&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Depression is of at least &quot;moderate&quot; severity, as determined by a Clinical Global&#xD;
             Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S) score greater than or equal to 4).&#xD;

             Childbearing potential, and meets the following criteria: i. Childbearing potential,&#xD;
