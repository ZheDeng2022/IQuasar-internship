  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to advance medication development for alcohol use disorder&#xD;
      by examining the efficacy and mechanisms of action of minocycline, a neuroimmune modulator,&#xD;
      as a potential treatment. This study has important clinical implications, as the available&#xD;
      treatments for alcohol use disorder are only modestly effective and testing novel medications&#xD;
      is a high research priority.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The research objective of this project is to characterize the role of the neuroimmune system&#xD;
      in alcohol use disorder (AUD). The proposed study employs a randomized, double-blind, and&#xD;
      placebo-controlled design to examine how neuroinflammation, as measured via neuroimaging&#xD;
      [e.g., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], relates to alcohol craving, neurocognitive&#xD;
      impairment (e.g., memory, attention, etc.), and alcohol use in non-treatment seeking&#xD;
      individuals with AUD. The study will also determine whether minocycline (MINO), an&#xD;
      FDA-approved antibiotic medication, affects any of the above listed measures. In the proposed&#xD;
      study, healthy controls (n = 36) and non-treatment seeking individuals with a current&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 AUD diagnosis (n = 36) will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either 200 mg of minocycline per day or placebo for approximately 28&#xD;
      days and complete two laboratory sessions. The first laboratory session will be performed&#xD;
      immediately before commencing the medication regimen (day 0) and the second will be completed&#xD;
      after taking the medication daily for approximately 28 days. Within each laboratory session,&#xD;
      participants will complete a cue reactivity paradigm, neurocognitive performance tasks, and a&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) session. Additionally, blood samples will be drawn on days&#xD;
      0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of treatment to measure circulating levels of proinflammatory molecules&#xD;
      in order to identify the specific immune signaling pathways underlying neuroinflammation in&#xD;
      AUD. Clinical labs (e.g., blood chemistry, liver function tests) and adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      will also be assessed at these five visits.&#xD;
