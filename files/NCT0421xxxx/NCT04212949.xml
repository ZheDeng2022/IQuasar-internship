  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to investigate the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation of the motor cortex combined with transforaminal epidural steroid injection in&#xD;
      patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment methods of lumbar radiculopathy include short-term bed rest, medical treatments,&#xD;
      physical therapy and rehabilitation techniques, psychotherapy, acupuncture, cryotherapy,&#xD;
      epidural steroid injections, and surgical treatment. Epidural steroid injection is an&#xD;
      effective treatment procedure in patients whose conservative treatment methods are not&#xD;
      successful. Fluoroscopy guided transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TESI) is the most&#xD;
      ideal procedure and it is considered as an effective treatment approach in radicular pain and&#xD;
      concomitant neuropathic pain because of reaching the target area, which is the origin of&#xD;
      pathology. Although radicular pain is usually caused by a peripheral lesion, central&#xD;
      sensitization and maladaptive plasticity have been shown to play an important role in the&#xD;
      development and chronicity of this pain. These data suggest that central pain processing&#xD;
      should be altered or stopped, especially in the presence of refractory pain. Repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)&#xD;
      are non-invasive brain stimulation techniques that are increasingly being used to treat&#xD;
      refractory neuropathic pain. Although short-term efficacy of rTMS treatment in radicular pain&#xD;
      management was shown in one study, long-term efficacy was not evaluated and the necessity of&#xD;
      trials evaluating long-term efficacy was reported. In accordance with these findings, we&#xD;
      aimed to investigate the long-term effect of rTMS treatment in patients with chronic lumbar&#xD;
      radiculopathy who received TESI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with chronic lumbar radiculopathy and planned to administer&#xD;
      fluoroscopy-guided TESI will be included in the study. Patients will be randomized into two&#xD;
      groups following TESI. Home-based exercise program will be given to both groups after&#xD;
      injection. One week after the injection, only the first group will receive 10 sessions of&#xD;
      rTMS treatment for 2 weeks in addition to the exercise program. rTMS treatment will be&#xD;
      performed with the device used in our clinic for neurological rehabilitation and pain&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed by a blind researcher using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for low&#xD;
      back and leg pain, the Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions (DN-4) for neuropathic pain, the&#xD;
      Oswestry Disability Index for disability, the Beck Depression Scale for depression, and the&#xD;
      Central Sensitization Inventory for central sensitization. All assessments will be performed&#xD;
      by the same physician before injection, first hour (only VAS), third week, third month, and&#xD;
      sixth month after the injection. All adverse events will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After data collection, analysis will be performed with the appropriate statistical method.&#xD;
