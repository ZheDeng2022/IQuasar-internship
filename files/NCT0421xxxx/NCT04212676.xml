  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the serious diseases with a high&#xD;
      prevalence and mortality, which adversely affects the quality of life, and is expected to&#xD;
      rank third in the global burden of disease in 2020. Although the primary pathophysiology of&#xD;
      the disease is pulmonary, it is emphasized that extrapulmonary involvement and comorbid&#xD;
      conditions adversely affect the severity and prognosis of the disease. In the treatment&#xD;
      guidelines for COPD, extrapulmonary systems and symptoms should also be evaluated. In this&#xD;
      context, the number of studies on the effects of postural stability, balance and fall has&#xD;
      increased recently, especially in COPD patients. Although the efficacy of pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation (PR) in COPD is well defined, it provides minimal gains in postural control&#xD;
      and balance. Alternative therapies are needed to improve postural stability, balance and fall&#xD;
      in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Awareness Therapy (BAQ) is an alternative method developed by French exercise instructor&#xD;
      and psychotherapist Jacques Dropsy in the early 1970s following the emergence of the concept&#xD;
      of body awareness, adapted to rehabilitation programs by Swedish and Norwegian&#xD;
      physiotherapists. Traditional physiotherapy methods are the basis of BAQ. In the treatment,&#xD;
      sensory stimulation and movement quality, rhythm, coordination, breathing, relaxation,&#xD;
      balance, coordination and proprioceptive exercises give more space. In the literature, BAQ&#xD;
      decreases pain, fatigue, eating and sleep problems in chronic musculoskeletal or rheumatic&#xD;
      pain, coronary artery disease and neurological patient groups. It is seen to increase the&#xD;
      quality of exercise, coordination, balance, postural control, quality of life and the&#xD;
      integration between mind-body. Movement awareness and mind-body-behavior interaction&#xD;
      developed in BAQ can help regulate emotional, mental, social and behavioral factors that&#xD;
      affect health. In addition to improving coping skills and cognitive behaviors among COPD&#xD;
      patients, it can contribute to positive gains in better movement, respiratory control and&#xD;
      balance. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of BAQ, which is integrated into&#xD;
      8-week pulmonary rehabilitation sessions, on postural stability, balance and fall conditions.&#xD;

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common disease that can be prevented and&#xD;
      treated, usually characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airway restriction due&#xD;
      to airway and / or alveolar abnormalities due to exposure to harmful particles or gases. At&#xD;
      the same time, it was emphasized that COPD is a systemic disease according to GOLD (Global&#xD;
      Initiative for Obstructive Lung Diseases) and extrapulmonary involvement and comorbid&#xD;
      conditions adversely affect the severity and prognosis of the disease. COPD is a chronic&#xD;
      condition in which physical function, social function and general health are severely&#xD;
      affected. Treatment in COPD is mainly aimed at effective disease management, prevention of&#xD;
      disease progression, improvement of symptoms, and improvement of exercise tolerance. In the&#xD;
      treatment guidelines for chronic lung diseases, extrapulmonary systems and symptoms should&#xD;
      also be evaluated. In this context, the number of studies on the effects of postural&#xD;
      stability, balance and fall has increased recently, especially in COPD patients. It is&#xD;
      reported that the ability of the trunk to participate in postural stability due to increased&#xD;
      resting breathing load, weakness of the muscle strength of the diaphragm, one of the major&#xD;
      muscles with significant impact on balance, weakness of peripheral muscle and systemic&#xD;
      inflammation lead to postural stability and balance risk in COPD patients. Clinical&#xD;
      investigations of COPD patients in proportion to the severity of the disease; functional&#xD;
      balance, coordination and mobility. Postural stability is defined as the act of maintaining,&#xD;
      obtaining or recovering an equilibrium state during any posture or activity. Loss of postural&#xD;
      control is one of the most common comorbidities in elderly individuals. Impaired postural&#xD;
      control is more common when the elderly person has a chronic disease. The PLATINO study&#xD;
      showed an increased prevalence of COPD in elderly individuals. Factors such as lower&#xD;
      extremity muscle weakness, functional performance deficit and adaptive capacity, and reduced&#xD;
      physical activity level in the elderly with COPD affect postural stability. In individuals&#xD;
      with COPD, responses to postural perturbations have been shown to decrease compared to&#xD;
      healthy controls. However, the ability to produce a successful postural reaction depends not&#xD;
      only on motor performance but also on the efficient use of proprioceptive inputs. In a&#xD;
      comprehensive study characterizing proprioceptive postural control in COPD, patients&#xD;
      concluded that postural stabilization was impaired compared to healthy controls using ankle&#xD;
      muscle proprioceptive signals more and back muscle proprioceptive signals less during balance&#xD;
      control. These findings may be a potential risk factor for the likelihood of falls in COPD&#xD;
      patients. Among the problems associated with COPD, there is considerable evidence that the&#xD;
      risk of falls in these individuals increases. Falling problems and COPD are two major&#xD;
      problems that bring great costs to the health system and especially affect elderly people.&#xD;
      The well-known fall risk factors in COPD patients are lower limb muscle weakness and loss of&#xD;
      mobility, characterized by a decrease in daily living activities. Although the efficacy of&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in COPD is well defined, it provides minimal gains in postural&#xD;
      control and balance. Alternative treatments are needed to improve balance and fall in COPD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Awareness Therapy (BAT) is an alternative method developed by French exercise instructor&#xD;
      and psychotherapist Jacques Dropsy in the early 1970s following the emergence of the concept&#xD;
      of body awareness and adapted to rehabilitation programs by Swedish and Norwegian&#xD;
      physiotherapists. Traditional physiotherapy methods are the basis of BAT. Focusing on the&#xD;
      senses, proprioceptive exercises aiming to improve the quality of movement, rhythm and&#xD;
      coordination with sensory stimuli. BAT treats the individual physically, physiologically,&#xD;
      psychologically and socially with a holistic approach and the treatment program is shaped&#xD;
      according to the patient's needs. Breathing exercises, relaxation exercises, movement&#xD;
      approaches specific to sensory awareness, positioning, stabilization, improving rhythm and&#xD;
      coordination, and improving the ability to perform the exercise with maximum awareness are&#xD;
      used in physiotherapy methods used in BAT. It consists of specific exercises, which include&#xD;
      focusing on how the body is used during movements, aiming at improving one's awareness,&#xD;
      ability to be careful, and quality of movement. In the literature, it is seen that Body&#xD;
      Awareness Therapy reduces pain, fatigue, eating and sleep problems in various patient groups&#xD;
      and increases the quality, coordination, balance, postural control, quality of life and&#xD;
      mind-body integration of the exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VFT has been gaining popularity in recent years among many health professionals, especially&#xD;
      physiotherapists. In BAT, movement is expressed by how one copes with the balance of the&#xD;
      person and associates himself / herself with the place and vertical axis in relation to the&#xD;
      environment. The integrity of postural stability is essential for comfortable breathing and&#xD;
      awareness, key points for dynamic balance, and quality of movement. Although VFT consists of&#xD;
      simple repetitive movements that maintain the ability to use stability limits, its main&#xD;
      component is to increase the individual's awareness of his / her movements. Thanks to the&#xD;
      neuroplasticity of the brain; multiple slow repetitive movements allow the participant to&#xD;
      experience the body and its limits. Movement consciousness that develops by cortical&#xD;
      processing of information about movement in the brain and facilitation of proprioceptive;&#xD;
      postural control improves balance and coordination. In many cases that require treatment as a&#xD;
      principled movement training technique behind mind-body interaction, which emphasizes motion&#xD;
      teaching based on sensory motor awareness and cognitive perception of movement. BAT aims to&#xD;
      normalize posture, balance, muscular tension and stiffness. Experiences learned by patients&#xD;
      help them divide difficult movements into simpler, lighter movements with less energy&#xD;
      consumption. Movement awareness and mind-body interaction during movement therapy can help&#xD;
      regulate emotional, mental, social and behavioral factors that affect health. In addition to&#xD;
      improving coping skills and cognitive behaviors among COPD patients, investigators think that&#xD;
      integrating them into pulmonary rehabilitation sessions can have positive effects on postural&#xD;
      stability, balance and fall, as they can help them move better and help postural control and&#xD;
      thus improve their ability to perform daily living activities.&#xD;

    <measure>Self-Efficacy Scale for the assessment of disease compliance:</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of Disease Compliance will be evaluated by the Self-Efficacy Scale in Chronic Diseases. It was developed by Lorig et al. (1996) to measure self-efficacy perceptions of individuals with chronic disease. The scale consists of three main concepts and a total of 10 sub-dimensions. The scale is answered in likert type which determines the self-efficacy perception increasing from 1 to 10. Number 1 in the scale represents yok I have no confidence, and number 10 represents &quot;I have full confidence&quot;. The total score of the individual is divided by the number of items and an average self-efficacy score is found. If this score is below 7, it means that strategies and problem-solving must be reassessed to prevent failure. A score of 7 or higher means that the individual has high self-efficacy and can achieve his / her thoughts. a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 100 points can be obtained from the survey.</description>
