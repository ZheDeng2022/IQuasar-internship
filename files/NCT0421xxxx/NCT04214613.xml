      higher rate of mortality, length of stay and discharge to a facility, but given the rare&#xD;
      nature of this complication relatively little is known about which factors predict these&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative stroke is a devastating complication of surgery that is currently poorly&#xD;
      characterized with limited clinical tools available to detect and prevent its occurrence.&#xD;
      Perioperative stroke is a cerebrovascular event that occurs after surgery, and affects&#xD;
      between 0.1-1.9% of patients having non-cardiac, non-neurologic surgery. Perioperative stroke&#xD;
      is relatively understudied compared to postoperative complications of similar incidence and&#xD;
      severity, such as cardiac complications. Over the past few decades, significant efforts have&#xD;
      been undertaken to reduce the risk of perioperative myocardial infarction and have led to a&#xD;
      decrease in incidence over time due to an advancements in risk stratification and&#xD;
      perioperative management. Although the incidence of perioperative stroke is similar or higher&#xD;
      than that of perioperative myocardial infarction, the risk of this complication has been&#xD;
      increasing over time and perioperative stroke remains relatively neglected. The current&#xD;
      literature has identified that patients who experience a stroke after surgery have a higher&#xD;
      rate of mortality, length of stay and discharge to a facility, but given the rare nature of&#xD;
      this complication relatively little is known about which factors predict these outcomes&#xD;
      amongst those who experience a perioperative stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Derive and externally validate risk prediction models for mortality (primary outcome),&#xD;
           adverse discharge, ICU utilization, tracheostomy/PEG/craniectomy, and length of stay&#xD;
           after perioperative stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe temporal trends in mortality after perioperative stroke between 2004 and 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore mediators of mortality risk after perioperative stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a retrospective analysis of the prospectively-collected American College of&#xD;
      Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database between 2004 and 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The derivation cohort will be extracted from the NSQIP database. The most recent year of the&#xD;
      dataset (2017) includes data on 1,028,713 cases from 708 sites. The validation cohort will be&#xD;
      extracted from Population Data BC, a collection of linked provincial databases providing&#xD;
      de-identified individual level data on all residents of BC (population 5.1 million). A date&#xD;
      range of January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2020 was chosen to reflect contemporary stroke&#xD;
      treatment practices (e.g., EVT), and the consistent use of ICD-10-CA coding since 2002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSQIP derivation cohort: Patients with perioperative stroke in the NSQIP database between&#xD;
      2004 and 2017 will be included. We will exclude neurosurgical (including carotid&#xD;
      endarterectomy) and interventional radiology procedures. The cardiac and non-cardiac surgery&#xD;
      populations will be analyzed separately given their unique stroke risk profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PopDataBC validation cohort: Patients with AIS will be identified using diagnosis codes&#xD;
      I63.0-163.9 from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Tenth Revision, Canada&#xD;
      (ICD-10-CA), which accurately and reliably identifies AIS in large administrative datasets,&#xD;
      with positive predictive value and sensitivity of greater than 97%. Patients who experienced&#xD;
      an ICD-10-CA admission diagnosis (top 3 positions) of AIS within 30 days of admission for&#xD;
      surgery, or as a discharge diagnosis from the index surgical hospitalization. Perioperative&#xD;
      patients will be further extracted from the overall AIS cohort if they received surgical&#xD;
      billing code in the 30 days prior to admission for stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables: Primary outcome is 30-day mortality; secondary outcomes are ICU&#xD;
      utilization, length of hospital stay, markers of severe stroke outcome (tracheostomy, PEG,&#xD;
      hemicraniectomy for cerebral edema), and adverse discharge (non-home facility or death).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidate predictor variables: Outcome after perioperative stroke is potentially related to&#xD;
      patient, surgical, and anesthetic factors, as well as characteristics of the stroke.&#xD;
      Candidate predictor variables will include patient characteristics (age, sex, comorbidities&#xD;
      including history of stroke), surgical characteristics (specialty, complexity, type,&#xD;
      emergency status), anesthetic technique (general vs regional/neuraxial), and stroke&#xD;
      characteristics (timing relative to operation, readmission for stroke vs inpatient stroke).&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be considered for transformation using fractional polynomials to&#xD;
      allow a continuous non-linear association. Some variables are not available across all years&#xD;
      of the dataset (e.g., prior history of TIA or CVA is available only until 2015); our&#xD;
      multivariable analysis will therefore exclude years 2016 and 2017 given the known clinical&#xD;
      importance of this variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Derivation and validation of risk prediction models. Multivariable models to&#xD;
      predict 30-day mortality following perioperative stroke will be created separately for&#xD;
      cardiac and non-cardiac surgery, given their unique mechanisms of stroke. To avoid&#xD;
      over-fitting, we will undertake a data reduction strategy and exclude variables with greater&#xD;
      than 10% missing data or less than 20 observations. Where &gt;1% but &lt;10% data are missing, we&#xD;
      will consider multiple or mean imputation; variables with &lt;1% missing data will be handled&#xD;
      through complete case analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-specified predictor variables will be used to construct a logistic regression model where&#xD;
      coefficients will be shrunken using elastic net penalization. This method for variable&#xD;
      selection and penalization was chosen because we anticipate possibility of a large number of&#xD;
      potential predictors relative to the number of outcomes and that several important predictors&#xD;
      will be collinear. By using elastic net regularization, we can employ a balance between least&#xD;
      absolute shrinkage and selector operator (LASSO) penalization and RIDGE regression. RIDGE&#xD;
      regression will allow us to keep important collinear predictors, but shrink their&#xD;
      coefficients (which could be inflated due to collinearity). LASSO methods will allow the&#xD;
      coefficients of some non-contributory predictors to zero, therefore, eliminating them from&#xD;
      the model. Included variables will be assessed for interactions and additional terms&#xD;
      considered to improve model performance as needed. Specifically, we will a priori examine the&#xD;
      following interactions: age*gender, surgical complexity (WRVU)*age, WRVU*specialty, and&#xD;
      specialty*anesthetic technique. Model discrimination will be evaluated using the area under&#xD;
      the receiver operating characteristic curve (c-statistic). Model calibration will be assessed&#xD;
      with a loess-smoothed plot of observed vs predicted risks over the risk spectrum. A similar&#xD;
      analysis will be used to create a prediction model for length of stay (which will be a&#xD;
      log-transformed linear model). As death is a competing outcome for discharge disposition,&#xD;
      adverse discharge will be modeled as an ordinal outcome (home, non-home discharge, or death).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internal validation: Following derivation, 5,000 bootstrap samples will be used for internal&#xD;
      validation and to generate an estimated optimism. Sensitivity analyses will test model&#xD;
      performance in different time epochs to assess the impact of year of surgery (e.g., 2 to&#xD;
      3-year epochs, depending on the number of observations available in each year). Following&#xD;
      derivation of the final model to predict mortality, we will derive a simplified predictive&#xD;
      index by converting the regression coefficients to points that reflect their relative&#xD;
      weights. The predictive accuracy of the resulting tool will be assessed in a similar fashion&#xD;
      to above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External validation: The final logistic model will be externally validated in the distinct&#xD;
      dataset obtained from PopDataBC after mapping NSQIP data elements to the PopDataBC database.&#xD;
      Regression coefficients will be applied to PopDataBC from the NSQIP-derived model to&#xD;
      calculate expected outcome probabilities and compare predicted to observed outcomes.&#xD;
      Discrimination and calibration will be measured, with an area under the receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic curve &gt;0.70 considered acceptable model discrimination and Hosmer-Lemeshow&#xD;
      test with p&gt;0.05 indicating acceptable goodness of fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Temporal trends in mortality. We will perform an exploratory unadjusted ordinary&#xD;
      least squares regression model with annual mortality rate after perioperative stroke as the&#xD;
      dependent variable and year as the predictor to estimate the yearly change in mortality rate&#xD;
      over time. A multivariable linear regression model will be specified, adjusting for important&#xD;
      predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Mediators of mortality risk. To explore possible effect modification of&#xD;
      pre-stroke mortality risk by post-stroke events, we will specify a series of logistic&#xD;
      regression models with death as the dependent variable and the probability of death from our&#xD;
      primary model as a linear predictor. We will then add pre-specified predictors (above), each&#xD;
      as an additional variable, to explore whether the probability of death increases or decreases&#xD;
      based on addition of the postulated effect modifying variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender/Sex-based analysis: We will explore the relationship between gender and outcomes after&#xD;
      perioperative stroke by performing subgroup analyses on women and men, and characterizing and&#xD;
      comparing the baseline features and outcomes of these two populations. We will further&#xD;
      include gender a priori as a predictor in the adjusted model, and examine interactions with&#xD;
      other variables. We are unable to examine non-binary gender as NSQIP provides only &quot;male&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;female&quot;, or &quot;unknown&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power: We used the methods of Riley et al to estimate the required sample&#xD;
      size to derive a stable logistic regression model that minimizes overfitting. Using 30 model&#xD;
      parameters and an estimated outcome prevalence of 25% mortality in people with stroke,3 we&#xD;
      estimated the required minimal sample sizes based on potential model discrimination&#xD;
      (c-statistic) and explained variance (Cox-Snell R2). If our model achieves a c-statistic of&#xD;
      0.7 (R2 0.09), we require 2,754 participants. Stronger discrimination (c-statistic 0.8, R2&#xD;
      0.2) would reduce the required sample size to 1,145. The NSQIP database 2004-2017 contains&#xD;
      6.6 million patients, and based on our preliminary analysis of the 2015 dataset, 99.5% will&#xD;
      be non-cardiac surgery with a 0.19% incidence of stroke, and 0.5% will be cardiac surgery&#xD;
      with a 1.76% incidence of stroke. We therefore estimate a total of 12,434 and 5,808&#xD;
      non-cardiac and cardiac perioperative strokes, respectively. As only years 2004 through 2015&#xD;
      will be included in the multivariable prediction modeling (4.6M), we estimate approximately&#xD;
      8,700 and 4,000 strokes after non-cardiac and cardiac surgery, respectively, will be&#xD;
      available for this analysis, far exceeding estimated requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A p value &lt;0.05 will be considered significant for all analyses and all data analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using STATA 15 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).&#xD;
