  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator propose a prospective study using blood samples (liquid biopsy) of estrogen&#xD;
      receptor (ER)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients to understand the prevalence&#xD;
      of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutation variants and the correlation with hormonal therapy&#xD;
      (HT)-based treatment resistance in Asian ER-positive/human epidermal growth receptor-2&#xD;
      (HER2)-negative MBC population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The investigator will use next-generation targeted sequencing covering the entire ESR1&#xD;
      ligand-binding domain (LBD) region to understand 1. the spectrum and prevalence of specific&#xD;
      ESR1 mutation variants in Asian women, and 2. the preliminary correlation of Asian-specific&#xD;
      prevalent ESR1 LBD mutation variants such as Y537C with treatment efficacy. For the second&#xD;
      purpose, the investigator will specifically focus on patients with ESR1 Y537C mutation, while&#xD;
      the results from patients with wild type ESR1 and patients with D538G or Y537S mutant will be&#xD;
      severed as control for preliminary comparison.&#xD;

      Approximately 8 ml plasma sample will be prepared from 20 ml whole blood to be used for&#xD;
      circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) extraction using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit&#xD;
      (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, Cat. No. 55114). DNA concentration will be determined by the Qubit&#xD;
      fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) and DNA integrity will be&#xD;
      analyzed using the capillary electrophoresis (AATI Fragment analyzer).&#xD;
