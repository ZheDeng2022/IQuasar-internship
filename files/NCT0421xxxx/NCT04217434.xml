    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to clinically evaluate and compare various patient centered outcomes&#xD;
      using diode LASER in Continuous mode (CW) and Pulsed Mode (PM) using 300µm and 400µm fiber&#xD;
      for depigmentation procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The colour of gingiva has a tremendous impact on the esthetics of the smile. Clinically&#xD;
      gingival melanin hyperpigmentation is presented as 'black gum' which is common esthetic&#xD;
      problem especially for those who have gummy smile. Currently the growing aesthetic concerns&#xD;
      among the patients require the removal of hyper pigmented gingival areas to create an&#xD;
      aesthetically-pleasant smile. The harmony of the smile is determined not only by the shape,&#xD;
      position and colour of the teeth or lips as well as by the by the gingival tissues.Several&#xD;
      attempts have been made for removal of gingival pigmentation by different techniques like&#xD;
      scalpel, electrocautery, LASER etc. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages.&#xD;
      In the present study an effort has been made to compare two different modes viz. Continuous&#xD;
      mode and Pulsed mode of LASER in the treatment of depigmentation.Diode LASERs for dentistry&#xD;
      operate in the near infrared region. The most commonly used wavelengths are 810, 940 and 980&#xD;
      nm , because these wavelengths are very well absorbed by pigmented tissues, haemoglobin and&#xD;
      melanin.There are several different ways LASER light operates: Continuous wave (CW), Pulse&#xD;
      wave mode (PM). The continuous wave diodes emit continuous LASER energy with a fixed power&#xD;
      output for the entire duration. Pulse modulated diodes create a 'pulse' by cutting the beam&#xD;
      or turning LASER on &amp; off [1s] at regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first years of diode LASER treatment in dentistry only CW mode was possible but&#xD;
      application of 3-4 Watt in CW mode led to carbonization of the soft tissue.To approach better&#xD;
      results in soft tissue treatment without much carbonization it was necessary to interrupt the&#xD;
      CW mode. That was done by chopping the CW mode. Pulses down to several 100μs were&#xD;
      released.LASER in Continuous wave mode is suggested in some studies to cause increase in&#xD;
      surgical site temperature which may cause necrosis or jeopardize healing. Application of the&#xD;
      LASER in Pulsed mode prevents overheating of surrounding tissues. This study aims to&#xD;
      determine the comparative increase in the onsite temperature between the two modes.Decrease&#xD;
      in post-operative pain is likely to reduce the consumption of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      Drugs (NSAID's). The study aims to quantify the need for NSAID's post-operatively in both&#xD;
      Pulsed and continuous wave modes and also in 300µ and 400µ fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in the diameter of the fibers used in LASER irradiation could bring about a change&#xD;
      in the outcome of the procedure as small diameter fibers means high energy density, faster&#xD;
      cutting and more heat whereas with larger diameter fibers more energy is needed to cover a&#xD;
      broader area to work more quickly and less heat.&#xD;
