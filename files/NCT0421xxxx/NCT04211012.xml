    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label，phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Toripalimab plus nab-paclitaxel with or without cisplatin as first-line treatment&#xD;
      of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.Each enrolled Patient&#xD;
      will receive Toripalimab plus nab-paclitaxel with or without cisplatin until progressive&#xD;
      disease or intolerable toxicity occurs, then enter a survival follow-up period.&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel with or without cisplatin will be administered for up to 6 cycles, and&#xD;
      Toripalimab up to 2 years.&#xD;
