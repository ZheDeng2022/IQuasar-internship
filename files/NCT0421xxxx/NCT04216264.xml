  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about different approaches to promoting&#xD;
      healthy growth among infants, and understanding parents' likes and dislikes of an approach to&#xD;
      reducing risk factors for obesity later in life. The study includes filling out some forms&#xD;
      with questions about your baby and your thoughts about your baby's growth and health, and&#xD;
      engaging in a pattern of changes in or prevention of risk factors in the first year of life.&#xD;
      Parents will receive information about changes and some tools and materials to take home with&#xD;
      them. Some parents may receive phone calls between visits as well. The study takes place from&#xD;
      soon after birth through the infant's age of 9 months. The estimated total time of&#xD;
      interaction between the study staff and parents during the study period is 4 hours.&#xD;
