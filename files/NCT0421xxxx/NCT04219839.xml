      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effectiveness of educational videos&#xD;
      for patients who have just had kidney transplant compared to usual patient education&#xD;
      practices. Eligible patients will have the opportunity to enroll in this study after their&#xD;
      transplant procedure either before hospital discharge or at their first follow up clinic&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;

      Participants will then complete a demographic survey and knowledge assesment to establish&#xD;
      their baseline of knowledge regarding post-transplant care, medication adherence and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction. Participants will then be randomly selected to receive either the usual patient&#xD;
      education care provided for patients following kidney transplant, or to receive the usual&#xD;
      care plus access to educational videos designed especially for post- transplant patients.&#xD;
      Videos can be viewed on a tablet computer with their transplant team during clinic visits and&#xD;
      at home using a smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 months post-transplant, all participants will be asked to repeat the knowledge&#xD;
      assessment. Hospital re-admissions and patient satisfaction will be measured at 6 months&#xD;
      after transplant.&#xD;
