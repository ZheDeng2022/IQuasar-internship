  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will increase sleep duration in participants who maintain less than 6 hours&#xD;
      sleep per night, to target the recommended 7 hours of sleep per night. The focus of this&#xD;
      study is determine how increasing nightly sleep duration in these individuals who maintain&#xD;
      less than 6 hours sleep per night changes their plasma metabolome and insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
      The primary outcome will examine changes in branched-chain amino acids and the secondary&#xD;
      outcome will examine changes in insulin sensitivity. The investigators will also determine if&#xD;
      changes in plasma metabolites can be used as a biomarker to discriminate between adequate&#xD;
      versus insufficient sleep.&#xD;

      Impaired sleep affects millions of people each year representing an important public health&#xD;
      issue. This project will utilize metabolomics approaches to identify potential mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying increased cardiometabolic risk associated with insufficient sleep and to identify&#xD;
      potential biomarkers in the blood that respond to insufficient sleep. Investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a controlled in-laboratory insufficient protocol where participants will sleep in the&#xD;
      lab for one night with sleep timing based on their habitual insufficient sleep schedule. In&#xD;
      the morning, plasma will be collected for metabolomics analyses and participants will&#xD;
      complete an oral glucose tolerance test for insulin sensitivity analyses. Participants will&#xD;
      then complete a 4 -week increased sleep duration intervention targeting the recommended 7&#xD;
      hours of sleep per night. Following this intervention participants will again sleep in the&#xD;
      lab for one night on their new sleep schedule. In the morning, plasma will be collected for&#xD;
      metabolomics analyses and participants will complete an oral glucose tolerance test for&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity analyses. Investigators anticipate these findings will be the first step&#xD;
      in developing biomarkers of impaired sleep under free-living sleep conditions, and to&#xD;
      determine how such biomarkers relate to insulin sensitivity changes associated with sleep&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
