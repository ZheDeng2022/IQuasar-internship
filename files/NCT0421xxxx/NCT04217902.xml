  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Population aging and the increase in incidence and prevalence of potentially disabling&#xD;
      chronic conditions make health care more and more complex and costly. In this context,&#xD;
      timelines are longer and adherence to care provision and health status are more variable -&#xD;
      both within and between patients - and care is provided by different health care&#xD;
      professionals, as well as services outside the health system, which may work at various&#xD;
      levels of service integration. For diabetes, this is especially the case: patients at high&#xD;
      risk for multimorbidity interact with multiple health care professionals, such as primary&#xD;
      care physicians, diabetes specialists, nurses, nutritionists and therapeutic educators, with&#xD;
      different perspectives to treatment. The patient is frequently the only link between the&#xD;
      different health care professionals, and very often the main source of information regarding&#xD;
      performed procedures, diagnoses and treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A current challenge facing all health care stakeholders, including policy makers,&#xD;
      practitioners, businesses, and patients, is to coordinate the available services and&#xD;
      integrate care ensuring safety, effectiveness, and comprehensiveness in relation to the needs&#xD;
      of individual users across the lifespan. Routine collected data can provide key information&#xD;
      to completely assess a patient's health status and thus help evaluating and deciding adapted&#xD;
      steps in treatment to stabilize or improve clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, the Dossier Medical Partag√© (Shared Medical Record) represents an effort to&#xD;
      centralize and improve accessibility, to patients and professionals alike, of medical&#xD;
      information. This system is yet little adopted and there is the need for added value&#xD;
      initiatives to exploit the tool's potential. In other countries, like the UK, the&#xD;
      governmental unit NHSX develops public policies and good practices for the digital&#xD;
      transformation of the NHS. In the United States, working groups like the Health Information&#xD;
      Technology Working Group, in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney&#xD;
      Diseases, develop electronic care plans using Electronic Health Record data for chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease patients. These initiatives, among others, show the necessity of simple,&#xD;
      visual communication in order to build a comprehensive care delivery pathway to inform&#xD;
      decision and further care planning, according to health goals set by shared decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to describe individual experiences of chronic care delivery of people living&#xD;
      with diabetes and also from healthcare professionals working in diabetes care from 3&#xD;
      different domains: clinical (relevant clinical criteria necessary for the decision-making&#xD;
      process, goal setting and planning), technological (tools used in routine practice and in&#xD;
      patients' daily lives), and behavioural (behaviours and interactions that build the patient's&#xD;
      pathway and strategies implemented by patients and professionals to help the decision-making&#xD;
      process).&#xD;

    <description>Socioeconomic status will be assessed, health literacy using the Brief Health Literacy Screening (BHLS), and a semi-directed interview will be undertaken with people living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The latter aims t obtain a description of their experiences concerning how their care delivery pathways were built over time, how health-related decisions are made individually and what data they consider health care professionals they interact with should systematically have access to (considering the 3 domains previously described). Health care professionals will also be interviewed regarding their experiences and needs in diabetes care, in the shared decision-making process and in establishing care coordination.</description>
