  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) is a significant health challenge&#xD;
      that so far has received too little attention. We lack knowledge on how pain is experienced,&#xD;
      its consequences and of perceived support in managing pain. The overarching aim of the&#xD;
      CPPain-program is to reduce pain experience, pain interference (e.g. pain burden) in children&#xD;
      and adolescents living with CP. CPPain has a prospective cohort comparative design and will&#xD;
      include before- and after measurements and process evaluation of a nested intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol concerns qualitative and quantitative data collection for the baseline of the&#xD;
      CPPain program. The aim of the baseline data collection is to contribute in-depth knowledge&#xD;
      of the pain burden in children and adolescents with CP. This knowledge is required to develop&#xD;
      targeted pain-diminishing interventions in this vulnerable group of children with a high&#xD;
      burden of challenges related to their chronic disease. In the next step, nested intervention&#xD;
      will be co-created with children and adolescents with CP, their parents as well as health&#xD;
      care professionals, and other professional caregivers involved in or responsible for&#xD;
      management of pain based on existing research and baseline findings.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and aim. Children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) are at high risk for&#xD;
      pain and their pain is frequently underestimated and undermanaged. They often experience a&#xD;
      substantial pain burden from the pain itself and its influence on all aspects of their life,&#xD;
      for example ability to perform daily activities, participate socially, sleep, or on overall&#xD;
      quality of life. The overarching aim of the CPPain-program is to reduce the pain burden in&#xD;
      children and adolescents living with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. The CPPain has a prospective cohort comparative design and will include before-&#xD;
      and after measurements and process evaluation of a nested intervention. This registration&#xD;
      concerns the CPPain baseline and includes a multinational survey (the CPPain survey) and&#xD;
      qualitative interviews with children and adolescents with CP, their parents/caregivers and&#xD;
      health care professionals. The nested intervention will later be developed based on findings&#xD;
      from the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data collection (the CPPain survey). The study population for the CPPain survey&#xD;
      will include children younger than 18 years with a CP diagnosis (=primary participants) and&#xD;
      their siblings (12-17 years) as controls. Parents of all primary participants will provide&#xD;
      proxy report. Children with CP &gt; 8 years of age and cognitively able (approx. 50%) and&#xD;
      siblings (12-17 years) will provide self-report. The survey will include a set of previously&#xD;
      published and validated measures that assess aspects of pain (experience, interference and&#xD;
      management), performance of daily activities, mental health, Health-Related Quality of Life&#xD;
      (HRQoL), and participation. These measures include modified versions of Dalhousie Pain&#xD;
      Interview (DPI) and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), The&#xD;
      Caregiver Priorities and Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities (CPCHILD), Revised&#xD;
      Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS-25), KidScreen, and Child and Adolescent Scale&#xD;
      of Participation (CASP). We have also added a researcher-developed questionnaire on COVID-19&#xD;
      and pain. We will have three versions of the survey: Parent proxy, Self-report - full&#xD;
      (12-18), and self-report - abbreviated (8-12 and older children with cognitive limitations).&#xD;
      In addition to self- and/or proxy-reported survey data, demographic and disability-related&#xD;
      data already registered in either national registers or electronic medical charts will be&#xD;
      collected. Survey data will primarily be collected using an electronic survey. The Clinical&#xD;
      Data Management System (CDMS) used for the eCRF in this study is Viedoc. The setup of the&#xD;
      study specific eCRF in Viedoc will be performed by Research Support Services CTU, Oslo&#xD;
      University Hospital (OUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data collection. Potential participants for the child and parent interviews will&#xD;
      be identified from the CPPain survey or clinicians in the child habilitation services.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are school-aged children and adolescents (8-18 years) with cerebral palsy&#xD;
      who have pain, determined from their or their parents' responses to the modified Dalhousie&#xD;
      Pain Interview. If the child is unable to self-report or do not wish to participate only the&#xD;
      parent/caregiver will be included.A purposeful sampling strategy will be used to ensure a&#xD;
      diverse sample concerning child and parent age and gender, as well as the child's level of&#xD;
      physical and cognitive disability and severity of pain burden. We estimate that we will&#xD;
      include 15-20 child/parent dyads, but the final number will depend upon the richness of the&#xD;
      material and data saturation.Both individual semi-structured interviews and focus groups will&#xD;
      be used to answer the research objectives. Interview guides cover experiences with pain and&#xD;
      its impact on life and living for children and parents respectively, parents' perception of&#xD;
      their child's pain burden and its impact, as well as how pain is managed, including a&#xD;
      detailed mapping of both the current and ideal help network. From the existing help network,&#xD;
      identified by interview participants, health care professionals will be identified and&#xD;
      recruited for a second round of interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis. Quantitative questionnaire and register data will be analyzed using&#xD;
      appropriate statistical methods for comparing groups and analyzing time trends in close&#xD;
      cooperation with the study's statistician. Stratification will be used to investigate sub&#xD;
      groups. Analysis will be adjusted for appropriate sociodemographic variables. SPSS will be&#xD;
      the main tool for statistical analysis, while some of the more complex analysis will require&#xD;
      the use of R. Other specialized software will be applied as needed. Qualitative data from&#xD;
      interviews and from unstructured responses to survey questions will be analyzed using&#xD;
      appropriate qualitative methods; primarily content, thematic and/or network analysis. NVivo&#xD;
      will be the main qualitative analysis tool. Qualitative and quantitative data will be&#xD;
      combined and analyzed from either a quantitative or qualitative perspective to provide a more&#xD;
      comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon.&#xD;
