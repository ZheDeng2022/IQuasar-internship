  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating Disorders (ED) are a major public health problem. Current care remains only partially&#xD;
      effective and the pathophysiology of the disorders remains to be deepened. With regard to&#xD;
      compulsive ED (bulimia and binge eating disorder), our clinical experience suggests that one&#xD;
      of the major triggers for crisis may be related to glycemia. In fact, bulimia could be&#xD;
      considered as a vicious circle where the binge eating disorder is going to be followed by a&#xD;
      food restriction in order to control weight , putting the subject in a situation of &quot;energy&#xD;
      deficiency&quot; which will favor the emergence of new crises . Technological advances have&#xD;
      resulted in the emergence of new measuring devices, such as &quot;tracking&quot;, which records&#xD;
      continuous glycemia, which would allow us to explore these clinical hypotheses.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, exploratory, proof-of-concept study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients will be recruited from the day hospital of the Endocrinology and Nutrition&#xD;
      Department of the University Hospital of Montpellier, Lapeyronie and from Emergencies and&#xD;
      Post-psychiatric Emergencies Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the inclusion visit, the dietician will explain to the patient the use of the dietary&#xD;
      book and the glycemic sensor which will be allocated to it. The patient will also answer to&#xD;
      self-questionnaires about his eating behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No nutritional approach will be addressed so as not to alter the patient's eating behavior&#xD;
      and not to influence the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be followed-up during 14 days.&#xD;
