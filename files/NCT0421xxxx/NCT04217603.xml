  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to perform a prospective, randomized, double-blinded,&#xD;
      pacebo-controlled clinical trial to determine the influence of a non-invasive positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilation device on exercise capacity and symptoms in adult patients with ECAC.&#xD;
      Primary outcome will include the total distance traversed by the study subject during a&#xD;
      standard 6-minute walk test, and secondary outcomes will include peak flow measurement and&#xD;
      symptom reporting before and after the exercise testing. The study will focus on the use of&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. CPAP is FDA-approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      various medical conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and heart failure, but is not&#xD;
      FDA-approved for the treatment of ECAC. The study will enroll 32 ambulatory study subjects&#xD;
      with confirmed ECAC at the BIDMC, and each study subject will be monitored for up to 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      Basal 6MWT performed as a standard of care in these patients will be compared to intervention&#xD;
      ones to see if there is an improvement of at least 24 meters in their 6MWT distance, then&#xD;
      both groups will be compared to see if there is a statistically significant difference&#xD;
      between groups. Subjects, treating physicians and the research fellow performing the 6MWT&#xD;
      will be blinded to the intervention; the only un-blinded personnel to the intervention will&#xD;
      be the study coordinator who will be in charge of setting the CPAP before every intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the standard of care of our institution, patients that are referred due to&#xD;
      suspicion of ECAC undergo initial PFTs, 6MWT and dynamic CT scan. With this information,&#xD;
      patients are evaluated in clinic by the interventional pulmonary and thoracic surgery team&#xD;
      who decide if the patient has the mentioned disease based on the previous testing. To&#xD;
      corroborate the findings patients with moderate so severe disease are taken into a&#xD;
      bronchoscopy with dynamic maneuvers as part of the standard of care. Initial bronchoscopic&#xD;
      examination will be performed as described in the following section &quot;I-Dynamic Bronchoscopy&#xD;
      Protocol&quot; as part of the standard of care of patients. After initial evaluation, during the&#xD;
      same intervention, all patients that agree to participate in our study will go through a CPAP&#xD;
      calibration procedure; in order to determine the adequate pressure to achieve airway patency&#xD;
      of at least 70% during end exhalation in each individual case. After regular bronchoscopic&#xD;
      examination, a full face F&amp;P SimplusTM CPAP mask (Fisher &amp; Paykel, Irvine, CA, USA) will be&#xD;
      placed in all patients to prevent un-blinding the treating physician. The mask will be&#xD;
      connected to a dual axis swivel adapter (T-adapter) and the bronchoscope will be advanced to&#xD;
      the nares through the swivel adaptor; air leak will be prevented by the tight disposable cap&#xD;
      of the swivel adaptor as described by Murgu et al.20&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calibration process will be performed following the technique first described by Ferguson&#xD;
      et al10, bronchoscope will be positioned to assess the area with ECAC previously identified&#xD;
      during regular examination; bronchoscope will be placed in the center of the lumen while&#xD;
      assuring a constant 1-cm distance between the tip of the bronchoscope and the target area&#xD;
      being measured, images will be taken during end inspiration and end expiration, gradual&#xD;
      increases of 1 cmH2O in the CPAP pressure will be made until a 70% or less collapse is seen&#xD;
      during end expiration by the bronchoscopist. At any given pressure increase the assessment of&#xD;
      airway collapse will be made in 3 different respiratory cycles, the whole procedure will be&#xD;
      recorded and posteriorly analyzed using morphometric bronchoscopy (Image J analysis program)&#xD;
      as described in the &quot;Morphometric Bronchoscopy&quot; section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population Subjects (&gt;18 years of age) with previous diagnosis of ECAC confirmed by&#xD;
      dynamic CT scan and/or bronchoscopy, who are currently receiving adequate medical therapy&#xD;
      (Optimal medication doses and interventions defined by Interventional Pulmonary team) for&#xD;
      comorbidities such as COPD, GERD, asthma, etc and are able to perform a 6 MWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracheobronchomalacia Evaluation CT Central Airway Protocol: All patients will be imaged&#xD;
      according to our standard low dose CT central airway protocol21, which includes imaging&#xD;
      during end-inspiratory and continuous dynamic expiratory phases. A multidetector row, helical&#xD;
      CT scanner (LightSpeed; GE Medical Systems; Milwaukee, WI; or Aquilion; Toshiba America&#xD;
      Medical Systems; Tustin, CA) which includes 4, 8, 16, and 64 detector-row systems will be&#xD;
      used. Helical scanning will be performed in the cranio-caudal dimension during both&#xD;
      respiratory phases. An experienced thoracic radiologist will review the CT images on a&#xD;
      picture archiving and communication system (PACS) [Path-Speed, General Electric Medical&#xD;
      Systems]. Using a computerized tracing tool in our PACS system, the inner wall of the airway&#xD;
      will be hand traced at the level of maximal collapse in dynamic expiratory images to&#xD;
      calculate the cross-sectional area of the airway (mm2). At the same level on end-inspiration&#xD;
      images, the cross-sectional area of the airway lumen will be determined by using the same&#xD;
      method. The percentage of luminal collapse between both respiratory phases will be calculated&#xD;
      using the following formula= [1 - (Aee/Aei)],) X100, where Aee is luminal area at end&#xD;
      expiration and Aei is luminal area at end inspiration. Mild ECAC is diagnosed if the percent&#xD;
      of luminal collapse during dynamic expiration is 70-80%, moderate from 80-90% and severe&#xD;
      &gt;90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-Dynamic Bronchoscopy Protocol All patients who are enrolled for the study will undergo&#xD;
      bronchoscopy under minimal sedation using intravenous midazolam and fentanyl to allow&#xD;
      spontaneous respiration. Lidocaine (1%, 20 ml), will be delivered by atomizer to the&#xD;
      posterior oropharynx until the gag reflex is suppressed. The larynx, vocal cords,&#xD;
      aryepiglottic folds and entire tracheobronchial tree will be irrigated with 1% lidocaine in&#xD;
      2-ml aliquots delivered through the bronchoscope during the procedure. An Olympus BF P180&#xD;
      video bronchoscope (Olympus America, Melville, NY) with a 4.9-mm outer diameter and 2.0-mm&#xD;
      working channel will be used to minimize any stenting effect. The bronchoscope will be&#xD;
      introduced into the proximal trachea at the level of the cricoid. At that point, patients&#xD;
      will be instructed to take a deep breath, hold it and then blow it out (forced expiratory&#xD;
      maneuver). Maneuver will be done at the following six sites: proximal trachea at the level of&#xD;
      the cricoid; mid-trachea 5 cm proximal to the carina; distal trachea 2 cm proximal to the&#xD;
      carina; right main stem bronchus at the right tracheobronchial angle; bronchus intermedius&#xD;
      and left main bronchus at the left tracheobronchial angle. The maneuver will be repeated&#xD;
      three times to ensure maximal airway narrowing during exhalation. All bronchoscopies will be&#xD;
      video recorded and reviewed after the procedure to assess the degree of airway collapse. Mild&#xD;
      ECAC is defined as a collapse 70-80%, moderate 80-90% and severe &gt;90% of the airway during&#xD;
      exhalation. This is standard of care for patients with EDAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collapse degree is assessed trough forced expiratory maneuver, a nasal CPAP device&#xD;
      (Define model) will be used in the patient, forced expiratory maneuvers will be repeated with&#xD;
      different CPAP configurations until a 70% or less airway collapse is achieved. Calibration at&#xD;
      which 70% airway collapse is achieved will be recorded and posteriorly used as the CPAP&#xD;
      volume for the second 6MWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphometric bronchoscopy Cross-sectional area (CSA) of the airway will be calculated after&#xD;
      the procedure by using the Image J analysis program (available free of charge at&#xD;
      http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) using two different measurement techniques as it was described&#xD;
      by Murgu et al.22 The graphical measurement method uses color levels within the image to&#xD;
      identify an appropriate region to be measured. Images are imported into Image J and a color&#xD;
      balance window is opened (Image &gt; Adjust &gt; Color Balance). The histogram is then set to RGB&#xD;
      color. The minimum and maximum bars are adjusted so that the resulting line corresponds to&#xD;
      the highest point of the histogram. Only red, yellow, white, and black colors then remain.&#xD;
      The black area, which represents the region to be measured for CSA, is selected using a wand&#xD;
      tool. Using the region of interest (ROI) Manager (Analyze &gt; Tools &gt; ROI Manager) the selected&#xD;
      area is then calculated in pixels. The manual measurement method requires that the operator&#xD;
      selects the area to be measured by first opening the image using Image J. Using the polygon&#xD;
      selections tool, the area of interest is then selected, and the ROI manager is used as in the&#xD;
      graphical method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally to provide an objective measurement in our patients, a collapsibility index (CI) will&#xD;
      be calculated: difference in airway lumen size between end inspiration and end expiration: CI&#xD;
      = (CSAinspir - CSAexpir)/(CSAinspire x 100%). Then measurements obtained for each patient&#xD;
      during 3 respiratory cycles will be compared to discard that there is any significant&#xD;
      statistical difference between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six Minute Walk Test The 6MWT is a test that requires a 100-ft hallway but no exercise&#xD;
      equipment or advanced training for technicians. It evaluates the global and integrated&#xD;
      responses of all the systems involved during exercise, including the pulmonary and&#xD;
      cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular&#xD;
      units, and muscle metabolism. Testing will be performed by the study personnel in a&#xD;
      controlled environment. Supplies such as oxygen, sublingual nitroglycerine, aspirin, and&#xD;
      albuterol (metered dose inhaler or nebulizer) will be available. The distance walked will be&#xD;
      reported in meters. Data from both groups will be compared in order to verify if CPAP has a&#xD;
      positive impact on exercise capacity in these patients. Since subjects have never used CPAP&#xD;
      before and are not used to the device a 10 minute Run-in period will be allowed in which the&#xD;
      CPAP will be placed while the patient is seating to allow he/she to get used to the sensation&#xD;
      generated by the machine, at this time the study personnel will also look for air leaks that&#xD;
      could compromise the results of the study. Either a regular CPAP or a sham-CPAP will be used&#xD;
      for the Run-in period depending on the result of the randomization; this will be done to&#xD;
      avoid the patient noticing the difference between this period and the 6 MWT which could&#xD;
      happen if only regular CPAP was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sham-CPAP The Sham-CPAP will be created following the methods of Farre et al23 And Rodway et&#xD;
      al.24 An enlarged air leak incorporated into the exhalation valve will be positioned between&#xD;
      the mask and the CPAP tubing, allowing airflow resistance of the exhalation port to be almost&#xD;
      eliminated by increasing its area, thereby virtually cancelling positive pressure. Also an&#xD;
      orifice restrictor in the CPAP circuit will be connected between the CPAP unit and the tubing&#xD;
      in order to load the blower with the same airflow resistance as in true CPAP. These changes&#xD;
      allow the ventilator operating noise and the airflow through the exhalation port remain&#xD;
      unchanged, which are crucial to a CPAP placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment CPAP naïve patients with a diagnosis of ECAC will be informed about the trial and&#xD;
      if interested will be recruited for our randomized controlled study. Patients who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria by the principle investigator or co-investigators will be approached&#xD;
      during an office visit to our Chest Disease Clinic at BIDMC&#xD;
