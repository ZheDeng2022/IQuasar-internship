    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the accuracy of Butterfly IQ ultrasound for&#xD;
      intra-articular hip injections, and to see if an injection given intra-articular before&#xD;
      incision provides any benefit in preemptive pain relief or blood loss reduction.&#xD;

      This study is designed to be prospective randomized (1:1) controlled independent trial.&#xD;
      Subjects are male and female, aged 18 and above, who are suitable candidates for either a&#xD;
      unilateral (i.e. single) total hip replacement. Subjects that are scheduled with a single,&#xD;
      extensively trained Physician Assistant assisting in their surgery will be exclusively&#xD;
      included. This is single site study with projected enrollment of 150 subjects&#xD;
