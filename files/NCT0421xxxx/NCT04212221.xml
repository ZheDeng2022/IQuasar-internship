    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts: Phase I is a dose escalation study to determine the&#xD;
      Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of MGD013 monotherapy and that of MGD013 when in combination&#xD;
      with Brivanib Alaninate (ZL-2301) in subjects with advanced liver cancer (including&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma). Phase II is a dose expansion&#xD;
      study and consists of two parts: Part 1 is to assess the safety and efficacy of MGD013&#xD;
      monotherapy and MGD013 in combination with ZL-2301 in subjects with advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC); in Part 2, a therapeutic method (MGD013 monotherapy or MGD013 in combination&#xD;
      with ZL-2301, determined by the sponsor according to the obtained data) will be selected for&#xD;
      dose expansion study in HCC subjects who have previously failed immune checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
      treatment, to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of the study treatments in the&#xD;
      specific group of subjects.&#xD;

    <description>After determining the RP2D of MGD013 monotherapy, MGD013 at the fixed dose will be combined with Brivanib Alaninate. Dose escalation study of the combination therapy in Phase I will adopt traditional 3+3 dose escalation scheme; the dosage of Brivanib will start from 200 mg QD, and may escalate to 400 mg QD, 600 mg QD and a maximum of 800 mg QD to to determine the RP2D of MGD013 in combination with Brivanib Alaninate. Then Phase II dose expansion study will initiate, patients will receive the fixed dose of MGD013 and Brivanib Alaninate combination therapy with RP2D determined in Phase I study.</description>
