  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glioblastoma is a type of brain cancer. Treatments include radiation, chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      surgery. But survival rates are poor. Researchers think that the drug selinexor, when&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy and radiation, might help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn the highest dose of selinexor that people with brain cancer can tolerate when given&#xD;
      with temozolomide and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with brain cancer that has not been treated with chemotherapy or&#xD;
      radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before participants start treatment, they will have tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological and physical evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible CT scan or MRI of the brain if they have not had one in 3 weeks. Participants will&#xD;
      lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. They may have a dye injected into a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys about their well-being&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have radiation to the brain for up to 6 weeks. This will usually be given&#xD;
      once a day, Monday through Friday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting the second day of radiation, participants will take selinexor by mouth once a week.&#xD;
      They will take it in weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5. The timing may be changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting the first day of radiation, participants will take temozolomide by mouth once a day&#xD;
      until they complete radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood tests once per week during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 1 month after they complete treatment. Then they&#xD;
      will have visits at least every 2 months for the first 2 years, then at least every 3 months&#xD;
      for another year. Visits will include MRIs and blood tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although radiation has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with glioblastoma&#xD;
           (GBM), median survival remains poor. Even with the addition of temozolomide (TMZ) to&#xD;
           surgical resection and radiotherapy, most GBMs will recur in field or adjacent to the&#xD;
           high dose radiation volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High rates of local failure indicate that GBM cells in situ are relatively&#xD;
           radioresistant and that the effectiveness of GBM radiotherapy would benefit from&#xD;
           additional radiosensitization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selinexor has recently been shown to enhance the radiosensitivity of glioma cells both&#xD;
           in vitro and in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Assess the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of selinexor when combined with&#xD;
      temozolomide and radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and gliosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men and women greater than 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed newly diagnosed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) greater than or equal to 70&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have not previously been treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a Phase I trial to determine the safety and tolerability of selinexor in&#xD;
           combination with external beam radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide in patients with&#xD;
           newly diagnosed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma using a &quot;3 plus 3 design,&quot; and three dose&#xD;
           escalation levels, with 3 patients per dose level (provided no DLT), a maximum of 21&#xD;
           patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be treated with external beam radiation therapy in a standard manner with&#xD;
           temozolomide given daily during radiation. Selinexor will be administered concurrent&#xD;
           with the RT/temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We anticipate accrual of 21 evaluable patients which will take approximately 2 years.&#xD;
           The accrual ceiling has been set to 24 patients&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Histological diagnosis&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Patients must be eligible for definitive external beam radiotherapy and&#xD;
                  temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Age &gt;18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on&#xD;
                  the use of Selinexor in combination with Temodar in patients &lt;18 years of age,&#xD;
                  children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients should have a KPS greater than or equal to 70&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1.5x10^9/L; platelet count &gt;100x10^9/L; and&#xD;
                  hemoglobin (Hb) &gt;9.0 g/dL within 7 days prior to enrollment. Note: the use of&#xD;
                  transfusion or other intervention prior to cycle 1 day 1 to achieve Hb &gt;9.0 g/dL&#xD;
                  is acceptable.&#xD;

               6. Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and&#xD;
                  the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. The effects of Selinexor on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
                  reason and because Selinexor agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in&#xD;
                  this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men&#xD;
                  must agree to use&#xD;
&#xD;
                  adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
                  prior to study entry, for the duration of study treatment and for one month after&#xD;
                  treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
                  her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
                  physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Patients must have had surgery and/or biopsy not greater than 8 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  initial evaluation to be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents and have had prior therapy&#xD;
             including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have previously received radiation therapy (RT) to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who received chemotherapy for the treatment of their glioma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who are being treated with implanted gliadel wafers&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who are being treated with tumor treating fields&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to selinexor or temozolomide used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with coagulation problems and medically significant bleeding in the month&#xD;
             prior to start of treatment (peptic ulcers, epistaxis, spontaneous bleeding). Prior&#xD;
             history of DVT or PE is not exclusionary&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with active uncontrolled or suspected infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with severe liver dysfunction defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) or called as Alanine&#xD;
&#xD;
             aminotransferase (ALT) greater than or equal to 3 x ULN = 135 U/L; for the purpose of&#xD;
             this study, the ULN for SGPT is 45 U/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) or called as Aspartate&#xD;
                  aminotransferase (AST) greater than or equal to 3 x ULN = 150 U/L; for the&#xD;
                  purpose of this study, the ULN for SGOT is 50 U/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum albumin less than or equal to 2 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known active hepatitis A, B, or C infection&#xD;

             side effects between HAART therapy and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must not have significantly diseased or obstructed gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
             malabsorption, uncontrolled vomiting or diarrhea, or inability to swallow oral&#xD;
             medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Selinexor could have the potential&#xD;
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             Selinexor, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             Selinexor. These potential risks may also apply to temozolomide used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with pre-existing known or suspected radiation sensitivity syndromes will be&#xD;
             excluded due to potential confounding effect on outcome.&#xD;
