  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute exacerbation of COPD usually presents with more sputum production leading to worsening&#xD;
      airflow obstruction. Often patients complain of sensation of sputum (phlegm) stuck in throat,&#xD;
      which leads to worsening cough and respiratory distress. In an acute exacerbation setting&#xD;
      high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), which is a modality that provides humidified and warm&#xD;
      oxygenated air at flow of upto 60L/min, has shown to reduce blood carbon dioxide level and&#xD;
      respiratory rate. However, studies investigating other effects of HFNC in this setting are&#xD;
      lacking. To investigators' knowledge, this is the first study investigating effects of HFNC&#xD;
      on sputum clearance in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of HFNC on sputum clearance in acute&#xD;
      exacerbation of COPD. Primary objective of the study is to determine whether HFNC improves&#xD;
      clearability and wettability of sputum produced during acute exacerbation of COPD. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives of the study include subjective assessment of cough severity as well as need for&#xD;
      escalation of care after HFNC use versus conventional flow nasal oxygen (CFNO) use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and the 4th&#xD;
      leading cause of mortality in the world. Acute exacerbation of COPD usually presents with&#xD;
      more sputum production leading to worsening airflow obstruction. During an exacerbation, high&#xD;
      flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has shown to reduce blood carbon dioxide level and respiratory&#xD;
      rate. However, studies investigating other effects of HFNC in this setting are lacking. To&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge, this is the first study investigating effects of HFNC on sputum&#xD;
      clearance in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD who are receiving oxygen therapy via&#xD;
      conventional nasal cannula or are on room air will be randomized into high flow nasal cannula&#xD;
      (HFNC) or conventional flow nasal oxygen (CFNO) group for 24 hours. HFNC group will receive&#xD;
      heated (approximately 37 ⁰C) and humidified (100% relative humidity) oxygenated gas delivered&#xD;
      at high flow at 50L/min. CFNO group will receive ambient temperate and non-humidified&#xD;
      oxygenated gas delivered at flow of up to 8L/min (standard care). Sputum sample will be&#xD;
      collected at time = 0 hours (baseline), 4 +/- 1 hours, 8 +/- 2 hours and 24 +/- 2 hours.&#xD;
      Visual analogue score (VAS) regarding cough severity and Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum&#xD;
      Scale (BCSS) regarding cough frequency and ease will be obtained at time = 0 and 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes of the study are the difference in clearability and wettability of sputum&#xD;
      sample. Clearability is measured by the distance sputum sample travels in an artificial&#xD;
      trachea after a simulated cough. The longer the displacement, the more the clearability.&#xD;
      Wetability is measured by determining the contact angle the sputum sample makes on a glass&#xD;
      surface. The smaller the contact angle, the more the wettability. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      subjective assessment of cough using VAS and BCSS scales, as well as need for escalation of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
