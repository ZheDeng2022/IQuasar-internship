  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-time-in-human (FTIH), Phase 1 study to determine the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      AZD0466 in patients with solid tumors, lymphoma and multiple myeloma at low risk for tumor&#xD;
      lysis syndrome (TLS), as well as in patients at intermediate risk or high risk of TLS with&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies for whom no standard therapy exists. Once an MTD/RP2D has been&#xD;
      determined in the dose escalation portion, further disease-specific expansions (solid tumor&#xD;
      and hematologic) will be undertaken. Combinations of AZD0466 with other standard of care&#xD;
      treatments may be evaluated in the future.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a FTIH study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD0466 at&#xD;
      increasing doses in patients with malignancies for whom no standard therapy exists, including&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors, lymphoma and multiple myeloma with a low risk for TLS (Arm A), and&#xD;
      relapsed, refractory hematological malignancies with an intermediate to high risk of TLS (Arm&#xD;
      B). The study will also characterize the PK of AZD0466 and explore potential biological&#xD;
      activity by assessing pharmacodynamics, exploratory biomarkers, and anti-tumor activity. Once&#xD;
      an MTD/RP2D has been determined during escalation, further disease-specific expansions,&#xD;
      possibly including, but not limited to small cell lung cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia,&#xD;
      and acute myeloid leukemia will begin.&#xD;
