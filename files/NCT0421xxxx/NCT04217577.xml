      The purpose of this pilot study is to explore whether dried plum (prunes) added to the diet&#xD;
      is effective in reducing or reversing bone loss following spinal cord injury (SCI). The&#xD;
      investigators will look for changes in bone mineral density as well as evidence in the blood&#xD;
      of markers of bone activity. The first part of the study is to check whether participants&#xD;
      with SCI can and will eat the required amount of dried plums (prunes) on a daily basis. The&#xD;
      second part of the study is to follow participants over one year and look for changes in bone&#xD;
      mass and blood markers.&#xD;

      Recruitment &amp; screening: SCI clinicians will invite patients from the VA SCI Center census to&#xD;
      participate in the pilot in person during a clinic visit or inpatient admission. If the&#xD;
      patient is interested, one of the study team will explain the study and obtain consent. The&#xD;
      study will be performed on an outpatient basis with return to the VA for study visits at 3, 6&#xD;
      ,9 , and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will mail Opt-Out Letters to individuals who have been identified as&#xD;
      potentially eligible. The Opt-Out Letter will include a Response Letter and a Return&#xD;
      Self-addressed Stamped Envelope (attached). If the investigators do not receive a NO response&#xD;
      by phone or mail after 2 weeks, they will attempt to call using an Opt-Out Telephone Script&#xD;
      and Recruitment Script (Attached).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening is primarily done based on interest, medical history and contraindications. There&#xD;
      may be blood values, collected at baseline that indicate ineligibility, but these will be&#xD;
      determined on individual cases. Interest in the study and commitment to maintain the study&#xD;
      diet/intake will be important to ascertain - although the investigators anticipate that there&#xD;
      may be dropout or reduced compliance with time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For the first month, each participant will consume 6-8 prunes per day to determine&#xD;
           tolerability. Starting in Month 2, each participant will consume approximately 10-16&#xD;
           prunes/day (&lt;120 g), depending on the size of the prune. The smaller prunes weigh about&#xD;
           7 g and the larger weigh up to 10 g. It will be suggested to consume 5-8 prunes twice&#xD;
           per day for breakfast and dinner. However, this is not a requirement, so long as the&#xD;
           per-day goal is met. If a participant does not eat the daily requirement one day they&#xD;
           will be encouraged to make up the difference over the next 6 days such that the total is&#xD;
           equal to the required 100-112 total prunes for the week. If however, they miss multiple&#xD;
           days of prune consumption, they will be asked to contact the study coordinators to&#xD;
           develop a reasonable plan to get back on track.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants will be asked to track consumption regularly by use of a chart. They will&#xD;
           be instructed to note days when they missed or consumed fewer prunes. They will also be&#xD;
           instructed to note any changes in bowel or other function and contact study staff with&#xD;
           any questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bone mineral density by dual xray absorptiometry (DXA) to include the following sites:&#xD;
           total body, spine, bilateral hip, bilateral knee. Total body scans will be obtained at&#xD;
           baseline and at 12 months; all other scans will be obtained at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood assessments will be collected at the same intervals and will include serum&#xD;
           concentrations of C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), which is a bone resorption marker, and&#xD;
           Procollagen Type I Intact N-Terminal Propeptide (P1NP), a bone formation marker to&#xD;
           measure the rate and direction of bone metabolism during the study. Serum will be frozen&#xD;
           for batch processing. Safety labs will also be drawn including a comprehensive metabolic&#xD;
           panel, primarily to monitor renal function, calcium concentration, and blood sugar.&#xD;
           Magnesium and phosphorus levels will also be analyzed. De-identified, coded blood&#xD;
           samples will be sent to Quest Diagnostics Lab (contracting lab) for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Surveys will be administered to the participants at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. These&#xD;
           will include the Global Health Scale- to evaluate overall health and well-being, the&#xD;
           Spinal Cord Injury Quality of Life Questionnaire (SCI-QOL) on Bowel Management as well&#xD;
           as the Bristol Stool Chart-to ascertain any affects the consumption of prunes have on&#xD;
           participants' bowel habits. Finally participants will be given a brief questionnaire&#xD;
           regarding their activity level, general health status, lifestyle habits, and&#xD;
           participation characteristics while in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Contact: For the first month, study staff will call each participant weekly to ask&#xD;
      about any concerns or issues related to prune consumption. After this, calls will be less&#xD;
      frequent, biweekly for the next month(s) and once per month after this. As this is a pilot&#xD;
      study, the investigators may adjust the call frequency as needed to determine if more or&#xD;
      fewer calls are needed. One of the main goals of this pilot is to determine feasibility&#xD;
      related to regular consumption; the investigators feel that useful information can be&#xD;
      gathered by calling rather than waiting for the participant to contact us.&#xD;
