  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gout is a kind of crystal-associated arthropathy caused by monosodium urate deposition, which&#xD;
      is directly related to hyperuricemia caused by purine metabolic disorder and/or decreased&#xD;
      uric acid excretion. It belongs to the category of metabolic rheumatism. Gout can be&#xD;
      complicated with kidney disease. The severe cases can occur joint destruction, renal function&#xD;
      damage, and often accompanied by hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, arteriosclerosis and&#xD;
      coronary heart disease and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of gout varies greatly from different countries. But on the whole, the&#xD;
      prevalence of gout is increasing year by year, and the incidence of gout is getting younger.&#xD;
      With the continuous improvement of living standards in today's society, middle-aged men have&#xD;
      quietly become a high incidence group of gout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiological basis of gout is hyperuricemia, so reducing uric acid is the core of&#xD;
      gout treatment. The reducing uric acid in patients with gout is a long-term process, and the&#xD;
      drug can not be stopped after the serum uric acid is reduced to normal. Once patients with&#xD;
      gout stop taking uric acid-lowering drugs, serum uric acid quickly returns to the&#xD;
      pre-treatment level, which can not only cause gout attack again, but also bring the risk of&#xD;
      kidney and cardio-cerebrovascular involvement if serum uric acid does not reach the control&#xD;
      standard for a long time. Therefore, uric acid-lowering therapy requires the use of a minimum&#xD;
      dose of uric acid-lowering drugs to maintain long-term uric acid levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, with the aggravation of environmental pollution and the postponement of&#xD;
      childbearing age, the incidence of male infertility is increasing year by year. However,&#xD;
      there are relatively few studies on the effect of gout caused by hyperuricemia on male sperm&#xD;
      quality. With the rejuvenation of gout patients and the long-term nature of uric&#xD;
      acid-lowering therapy, the safety of uric acid-lowering drugs in male gout patients of&#xD;
      childbearing age during pregnancy is not sure. Coupled with the opening of China's&#xD;
      comprehensive second-child policy, more and more male gout patients join this fertility&#xD;
      group. Unfortunately, so far, no animal or human trial has observed the effect of uric&#xD;
      acid-lowering drugs on sperm quality. For this reason, this study intends to carry out this&#xD;
      observational clinical trial to evaluate the effect of long-term use of uric acid-lowering&#xD;
      drugs on male sperm quality by collecting relevant data of patients with gout treated with&#xD;
      uric acid-lowering drugs. Aim to provide a theoretical basis for the safety of uric&#xD;
      acid-lowering drugs during pregnancy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1. Research drugs. Three kinds of uric acid lowering drugs, allopurinol, febuxostat and&#xD;
           benzbromarone, will be evaluated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design and sample size calculation. This study was designed as a single-center&#xD;
           prospective cohort study. Age-matched sperm donors from the human sperm bank of the&#xD;
           Peking University Third Hospital were selected as the control group. After a careful&#xD;
           search of the relevant literature, there are no reports of similar studies, so it is&#xD;
           impossible to accurately estimate the sample size. Therefore, this study planned to&#xD;
           enroll 20 patients with gout who were using allopurinol, febuxostat and benzbromarone to&#xD;
           reduce uric acid, respectively. And 60 normal male donors were recruited as control. It&#xD;
           is planned to recruit 5 gouty patients and 5 control males every month. Therefore, the&#xD;
           whole study needs to last at least 12 months after initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research process. The process of this study does not affect the routine diagnosis and&#xD;
           treatment procedures of patients with gout. Our research team is made up of doctors&#xD;
           majoring in rheumatology and andrology. Therefore, we can make routine clinical&#xD;
           diagnosis and treatment according to the specific conditions of patients with gout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Screening period. It will takes about 2 weeks, including the following forms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with gout are in acute attack. According to the guidelines for the diagnosis&#xD;
           and treatment of gout, we should first give them anti-inflammatory and analgesic&#xD;
           treatment. Cyclooxygenase(COX) non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
           drugs(NSAIDs) or colchicine can be selected to control acute symptoms. Then we performed&#xD;
           the semen analysis after the joint swelling and pain is completely improved. If the&#xD;
           patient meets our admission criteria, urate-lowering therapy should be initiated&#xD;
           according to the clinical practice. And we regard this time as week 0. NSAIDs or&#xD;
           colchicine can be prophylacticly used for at least 2 weeks combined with urate-lowering&#xD;
           treatment in case of gout flare.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with gout in remission. For this kind of patients, we directly conduct semen&#xD;
           analysis. If the results meets our admission criteria, urate-lowering therapy should be&#xD;
           initiated according to the clinical practice. We also regard this time as week 0. And&#xD;
           the preventive use of NSAIDs or colchicine is the same as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2) Follow-up stage. The follow-up cycle was calculated after the beginning of&#xD;
           urate-lowering therapy. We will detect the blood routine, urine routine, liver and&#xD;
           kidney function and serum uric acid at the time of screening and week 2, week 4, week 8&#xD;
           and week 12 visits. The patients will receive the repeated sperm analysis at week 4 and&#xD;
           week 12, respectively. At the same time, we will collect all the corresponding data on&#xD;
           the case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4、Patient withdrawal. Patients can drop out of the trial at any time. Researchers can&#xD;
           also persuade patients to withdraw for a variety of reasons, including baseline&#xD;
           screening for sperm quality below World Health Organization (WHO) standards, adverse&#xD;
           events, safety concerns, or patients' failure to comply with the trial regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5、Eliminated cases. For some reason, those who are not completed as planned and whose&#xD;
           observation records are incomplete are eliminated cases. Those who are interrupted due&#xD;
           to serious adverse reactions should be regarded as cases of adverse reactions and shall&#xD;
           not be included in the statistics of comparative analysis of semen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6、Treatment regimen. Baseline screening: if the patient meets the selection criteria and&#xD;
           is not in the gout attack period, we can consider the direct start of uric acid-lowering&#xD;
           drug treatment. The choice of uric acid-lowering drugs should be based on the patient's&#xD;
           drug use taboos for real-world choice. If the patient is in the attack stage of acute&#xD;
           arthritis, we need to control the acute symptoms, and we can consider using COX&#xD;
           non-selective NSAIDs, and then start the uric acid treatment after the joint symptoms&#xD;
           are completely improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uric acid-lowering therapy: the beginning of uric acid-lowering therapy must be combined with&#xD;
      COX non-selective NSAIDs or colchicine to prevent gout.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allopurinol, the initial dose of 125mg once a day. If serum uric acid is not less than&#xD;
           360 µm/L after 2 weeks, the dose can be increased to 250mg once a day, and the highest&#xD;
           dose does not exceed 500mg every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Febuxostat, the initial dose of 20mg once a day. If serum uric acid is not less&#xD;
                than 360 µm/L after 2 weeks, the dose can be increased to 40mg once a day, and the&#xD;
                highest dose does not exceed 80mg every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Benzbromarone, the initial dose of 25mg once a day. If serum uric acid is not&#xD;
                     less than 360 µm/L after 2 weeks, the dose can be increased to 50mg once a&#xD;
                     day, and the highest dose does not exceed 100mg every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     7、Assessment. We will use three methods to assess male fertility: basic semen&#xD;
                     analysis, sperm DNA integrity analysis, and measurement of sperm damage via&#xD;
                     oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       1. Basic semen analysis and sperm DNA fragmentation were performed at&#xD;
                          Reproductive Medicine Centre, Peking University Third Hospital using&#xD;
                          standard laboratory procedures, per WHO guidelines (2010 5th edition).&#xD;
                          This is a microscopic evaluation of fresh semen that assesses sperm&#xD;
                          concentration, viability, motility, and morphology. Frozen semen&#xD;
                          specimens were evaluated for oxidative stress damage by a clinical&#xD;
                          central laboratory specialized in molecular medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       2. Sperm Testing for DNA Fragmentation and Oxidative Damage:&#xD;
&#xD;
                          The sperm DNA fragmentation assay was utilized to assess sperm DNA&#xD;
                          integrity based upon the literature report (Cytometry 1985; 6(3): 238-53)&#xD;
                          in which sperm DNA is stained with acridine orange and analyzed by flow&#xD;
                          cytometry.Two measurements are then produced: %DFI (DNA fragmentation&#xD;
                          index) which indicates level of sperm DNA breaks and %HDS (high DNA&#xD;
                          stainability) which is reported to correlate to levels of immature sperm&#xD;
                          and somatic cells such as white blood cells. Sperm damage from oxidative&#xD;
                          stress (OS) was measured using the Oxidative Stress AdductsTM test&#xD;
                          (ReproSource, Inc. Woburn, MA) which measures by pectrophotometry the&#xD;
                          levels of molecules (adducts) covalently formed by reaction of lipid&#xD;
                          aldehydes present in sperm membranes under conditions of OS with cellular&#xD;
                          structures such as DNA based on the method previously described by Gomez&#xD;
                          et al (Gut 1987; 28(8): 1008-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
                       3. Serum samples for the analysis of serum uric acid were collected at the&#xD;
                          time of screening, week 2, week 4, week 8 and week 12, or early&#xD;
                          termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
                          8、Samples collection, preservation and destruction&#xD;
&#xD;
                     a. Semen samples were collected by masturbation after an instructed period of&#xD;
                     2 to 3 days without ejaculation in the semen collection room of Peking&#xD;
                     University third Hospital after signing the informed consent according to the&#xD;
                     trial scheme. After semen liquefaction (30 minutes to 1 hour), an aliquot was&#xD;
                     used for semen analysis and a second aliquot of raw semen was frozen within 2&#xD;
                     hours of collection at -80° C.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     b. Semen samples are uniformly preserved until destroyed after the end of this&#xD;
                     trial. The test time is expected to be 2-3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     c. At the end of the trial, the semen samples were uniformly destroyed. The&#xD;
                     frozen semen was reheated at room temperature and completely soaked in 0.5%&#xD;
                     sodium hypochlorite disinfectant. Finally, the disinfection solution&#xD;
                     containing semen was treated as medical waste.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     9、Quality control.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     a. Carry out publicity and education to the subjects to reduce the rate of&#xD;
                     loss of follow-up; b. Semen quality analysis system was used to detect semen&#xD;
                     quality indexes such as sperm density, motility, forward motility ratio and so&#xD;
                     on. Quality control of standard samples was carried out for every 10 samples&#xD;
                     tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     10、Statistical analysis. We will use SPSS 20.0 software for statistical&#xD;
                     analysis. All statistical tests are bilateral test, P value less than or equal&#xD;
                     to 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant. When comparing the&#xD;
                     difference of curative effect between the parameters before and after gout&#xD;
                     treatment, paired t-test was used if the measurement data were in accordance&#xD;
                     with normal distribution. Independent sample t-test was used for comparison&#xD;
                     among different intervention groups. Nonparametric test is used if the&#xD;
                     measurement data do not conform to the normal distribution. Chi-square test&#xD;
                     was used to compare the counting data between groups.&#xD;
