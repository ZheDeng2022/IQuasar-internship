  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are increased in children on conventional&#xD;
      haemodialysis. Haemodiafiltration (HDF) is a newer type of dialysis which has two main types&#xD;
      (post-dilution and predilution HDF). Post-dilution HDF is associated with better vascular&#xD;
      health, blood pressure and growth in children. Furthermore, pre-dilution HDF is shown to&#xD;
      remove a wider spectrum of uremic toxin compared to post-dilution HDF in adults. The&#xD;
      investigators need more data to define the optimum dialysis modality for children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Hypothesis: In children with end stage kidney disease pre-dilution HDF (pre-HDF) achieves&#xD;
      improved clearances across a wide molecular weight range compared to post-dilution HDF&#xD;
      (post-HDF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of Investigation: Prevalent patients on thrice weekly HD or HDF who have a single pool&#xD;
      Kt/v&gt;1.2 will be randomized in to either study arm A (pre-HDF, post-HDF) or B (post-HDF,&#xD;
      pre-HDF) after a conditioning period on post-HDF. Dialysis prescription will be kept constant&#xD;
      during study periods including blood flow, dialysate flow, dialysate content, filter type and&#xD;
      size. Pre-dialysis and post-dialysis bloods will be drawn at baseline and at the end of each&#xD;
      treatment with either modality. Reduction ratios of small and middle molecular weight toxins&#xD;
      and protein bound toxins as well as markers of inflammation and nutrition will be compared&#xD;
      between two modalities. Assessment of blood pressure (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring)&#xD;
      and patient wellbeing (questionnaire) will be performed at the end of each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be recruited from paediatric dialysis units in London, Istanbul Heidelberg and&#xD;
      Lyon with extension to other centres to be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: If the results of this study demonstrate better clearance with pre-dilution HDF&#xD;
      compared to post-dilution HDF, this will inform a future long-term outcome study comparing&#xD;
      different HDF modalities and will contribute to define optimum dialysis modality for&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
