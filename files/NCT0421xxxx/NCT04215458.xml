      The pathogeneses of many inflammatory diseases are not completely understood, yet,&#xD;
      dysregulation of the human microbiota is increasingly being investigated as a possible&#xD;
      contributing factor. The human microbiota includes bacteria, archaea, viruses and fungi. In&#xD;
      general, little is known about the fungal colonization in inflammatory skin diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to examine the prevalence of microbiome in skin and oral mucosa of a variety&#xD;
      of patients and healthy volunteers visiting the Dermatological outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a case-control study comparing the incidence of colonization or&#xD;
      infection in skin and oral mucosa of patients with different skin diseases and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with selected skin diseases, staff at Zealand University Hospital in Roskilde,&#xD;
      relatives to staff and students with relation to the Dermatologic Department will be asked to&#xD;
      fill out a short questionnaire and have swaps taken from oral mucosa, as well as skin&#xD;
      scrapings and tape strips from lesional skin (only patients) and non-lesional skin (all).&#xD;

      Background and aim The pathogeneses of many inflammatory diseases are not completely&#xD;
      understood, yet, dysregulation of the human microbiota is increasingly being investigated as&#xD;
      a possible contributing factor. The human microbiota includes bacteria, archaea, viruses and&#xD;
      fungi. In general, little is known about the fungal colonization in inflammatory skin&#xD;
      diseases although Candida species in oral mucosa, skin and feces seem to be increased in&#xD;
      patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Inflammation is also an important part of the&#xD;
      pathogenesis in other skin diseases such as hidradenitis suppurativa, acne, vasculitis and&#xD;
      inflammatory ulcers. Possibly, increased fungal colonization may be present in many&#xD;
      inflammatory skin diseases, yet, this has not previously been investigated. Studies of&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases involving other body areas such as systemic lupus erythematosus,&#xD;
      Sj√∂gren's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spondyloarthritis have also demonstrated increased&#xD;
      colonization with Candida species. However, it is unclear, whether colonization with Candida&#xD;
      is a cause or a result of inflammatory disease. Treatment of inflammatory diseases with&#xD;
      systemic immune-modulating drugs or recurrent antibiotic therapy may also affect yeast&#xD;
      colonization. Emergence of biological therapies that directly or indirectly modulates the&#xD;
      Interleukin (IL) 17-pathway emphasizes the need for further knowledge, since the IL-17&#xD;
      pathway is involved in the defense against yeast infections in healthy individuals. Until&#xD;
      now, investigations of yeast colonization have primarily focused on Candida and Malassezia.&#xD;
      Whether other species of yeasts may be of interest is still uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to examine the prevalence of microbiome and infection in skin and oral mucosa&#xD;
      of a variety of patients and healthy volunteers visiting the Dermatological outpatient&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study execution The project is carried out as a collaboration between Dermatological&#xD;
      Department, Roskilde University Hospital and Statens Serum Institut (SSI) under the&#xD;
      leadership of primary investigator, Senior Doctor in Dermatology, PhD, Ditte Marie Lindhardt&#xD;
      Saunte. The project is supported by Medical Doctor in Dermatology, PhD Elisabeth Hjardem&#xD;
      Taudorf, Dermatological study nurse Helle Anette Jensen, and the established research group&#xD;
      at the Dermatological Department. The samples will be analyzed at SSI at the Dpt. of&#xD;
      bacteria, parasites, and fungi under PhD Henrik Vedel Nielsen and Head of Microbial&#xD;
      Bioinformatics, Department of Bacteria, Parasites and Fungi, PhD Marc Stegger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A case-control study comparing the incidence of yeast colonization or infection&#xD;
      in skin and oral mucosa of patients with different skin diseases and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      Patients with selected skin diseases, staff at Zealand University Hospital in Roskilde,&#xD;
      relatives to staff and students with relation to the Dermatologic Department will be asked to&#xD;
      fill out a short questionnaire and have swaps taken from oral mucosa, as well as skin&#xD;
      scrapings and tape strips from lesional skin (only patients) and non-lesional skin (all).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swaps will be examined at Dept. of Microbial Bioinformatics, Department of Bacteria,&#xD;
      Parasites and Fungi, Statens Serum Institut. The subgroup of patients initiating systemic&#xD;
      therapy for their skin disease at the first examination will be asked to repeat the&#xD;
      questionnaire, swaps, skin scrapings and tape strips after approximately three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical photos of lesional skin or mucosa will be taken and stored at a secure IT site&#xD;
      (Sharepoint and in SP clinical report) after written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Prevalence and Odds Ratios (OR) will be determined. With a two-sided significance&#xD;
      level of 95%, a power of 80 %, an expected ratio of healthy controls vs. patients with skin&#xD;
      disease of 0.5 and an expected OR of 2.73 a minimum sample size of 127 patients per skin&#xD;
      disease and 64 healthy controls are needed. We aim to include approximately of 130 patients&#xD;
      per skin disease. In total, a maximum of 700 individuals will be included, of which 70 will&#xD;
      be healthy controls. Inclusion of patients with rare skin diseases may necessitate fewer&#xD;
      patients in some groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, side effects and drawbacks All samples consist of non-invasive mucosal swaps, skin&#xD;
      scrapings or superficial tape strips which holds no risk of known adverse effects. It may be&#xD;
      associated with minimal discomfort during sample collection and participants may use an&#xD;
      additional 15 minutes of their time in order to receive information regarding the project.&#xD;
      Apart from that, this project causes no known risks, side effects or drawbacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biologic material Swaps from mucosal membranes and skin. There is no biobank involved in this&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economy The Dermatologic Department, Roskilde University Hospital provides sample materials&#xD;
      and Department of Bacteria, Parasites and Fungi, Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen analyzes&#xD;
      the samples. Both departments cover their own expenses. The project is completely independent&#xD;
      and does not receive financial support from third parties. None of the involved research&#xD;
      workers receive payment for participation or has conflicts of interest related to the&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remuneration for trial participants Participants will not receive any remuneration or&#xD;
      compensation related to study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of trial participants and informed consent Patients, relatives and staff&#xD;
      associated to the Dermatologic Department in Roskilde will be asked to participate. Patients&#xD;
      and relatives will be recruited during a routine visit to the clinic, while staff will be&#xD;
      offered participation during a regular staff meeting. A private consultation will take place,&#xD;
      where each participant will receive individual oral and written information about the project&#xD;
      in a quiet atmosphere. The participant can bring a bystander and will be offered time for&#xD;
      consideration. If requested, an extra interview with repeated possibility to bring a&#xD;
      bystander will be provided. If a person wants to participate in the project and meet criteria&#xD;
      for inclusion, informed consent will be signed, a short questionnaire filled out and samples&#xD;
      will be collected during their regular outpatient visit or by individual appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of results Positive as well as negative results will be published in relevant&#xD;
      international Scientific Journals and presented at Scientific meetings and congresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research ethics Many patients, staffs and relatives will be asked to participate in this&#xD;
      case-control study, spend a short amount of extra time during an appointment at the clinic&#xD;
      and may experience minimal discomfort during collection of samples. In contrast, information&#xD;
      about microbiome in different skin diseases may provide a completely new insight and form the&#xD;
      basis for further studies to detect the possible causality between microbiome and&#xD;
      inflammatory skin diseases. Thus, the potential small disadvantages for project participants&#xD;
      can by far be justified by the large amount of new knowledge obtained.&#xD;
