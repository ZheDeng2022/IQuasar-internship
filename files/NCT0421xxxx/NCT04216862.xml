    <textblock>
      Forward head posture (FHP) and Rounded shoulders (RS) are defined as protrusion of the head&#xD;
      and shoulders in the sagittal plane. Forward head posture is defined as the anterior&#xD;
      positioning of the cervical spine. Rounded shoulders also called protracted shoulder (PS) is&#xD;
      a protrusion of the acromion of the shoulder joint relative to the centerline of gravity of&#xD;
      the body, causing stooped posture along with elevation, protraction, and downward rotation of&#xD;
      the scapula, and an increased angle between the lower neck bone and upper spine. Many&#xD;
      Physical therapy treatment options are available to correct forward head posture and rounded&#xD;
      shoulders which focused to correct the muscle imbalance and restore the normal posture of&#xD;
      Cervical spine and shoulder. The objective of this study is to compare the outcomes of&#xD;
      Strengthening exercise with the outcomes of stretching exercise on the targeted muscle group&#xD;
      to correct forward head posture and rounded shoulders. The study will determine effective&#xD;
      management plan for correction of forward head posture and rounded shoulders. It will be&#xD;
      Experimental Randomized Controlled Trial. 26 Patients will be included through consecutive&#xD;
      sampling, with 13 patients in each of 2 groups. Subjects will be equally distributed to two&#xD;
      groups with use of dice roll method of randomization. From the two groups, one receiving&#xD;
      strengthening exercise treatment and other receiving stretching exercise treatment.&#xD;
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) V 25.will be used for Data analysis. Results&#xD;
      will be extracted. Conclusion will be made after comparing the pre and post treatment results&#xD;
      of both treatment approaches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forward head posture and Rounded Shoulder are related to muscle imbalance, which disturbs&#xD;
      length tension relationship of muscles. Weak and lengthened muscles in Forward head posture&#xD;
      and rounded shoulders are deep neck flexors which include longus capitis and longus coli and&#xD;
      weak scapular stabilizers and retractors which include Rhomboids and middle, lower trapezius,&#xD;
      Teres Minor and Infraspinatus. The overactive and shortened muscles participating in Forward&#xD;
      head posture and Rounded shoulders are Deep upper cervical extensors which include&#xD;
      longissimus capitis, Splenius Capitis, Cervical Multifidus, Upper Trapezius and Shoulder&#xD;
      protractors and elevators which include Pectoralis minor, Pectoralis major and Levator&#xD;
      Scapula. Previous researches suggests that weakened postural muscles should be strengthened&#xD;
      and shortened muscles should be lengthened in order to improve postural alignment and&#xD;
      alleviate Forward head posture and restoring the normal muscle balance between opposing&#xD;
      muscle groups (agonists and antagonists). The majority of treatments have focused on the deep&#xD;
      neck flexors, as they play a major role in stabilizing the alignment of the cervical spine.&#xD;
      Exercise improved the forward head and Rounded Shoulder significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of 50º as a reference angle for forward head posture was guided by previous&#xD;
      studies, with the latter reporting 55.02 ± 2.86 as a normal range. As is well known, subjects&#xD;
      with forward head posture have a significantly smaller cervical angle when compared with&#xD;
      normal subjects. In the present study, the investigators considered 52º as the reference&#xD;
      angle based on a previous study which evaluated 310 participants in a standing position and&#xD;
      reported 2.6º±15.3 as a normal range, and Brink et al, who evaluated 15 to 17 year-olds and&#xD;
      reported a mean shoulder angle value of 51.35º ± 17.2º, and based on the premise that&#xD;
      subjects with protracted shoulder have a significantly smaller shoulder angle when compared&#xD;
      with normal subjects. Individual will be considered to have rounded shoulder if the angle&#xD;
      will be less than 52º.&#xD;
