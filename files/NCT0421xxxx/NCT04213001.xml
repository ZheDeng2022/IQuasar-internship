  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. It is an important health problem that has&#xD;
      been increasingly encountered in recent years. With advances in treatment, the survival time&#xD;
      after breast cancer is prolonged, and as a result, many women face certain diseases during&#xD;
      this period. One of these diseases, breast cancer-related lymphedema, is characterized by&#xD;
      abnormal accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitial tissue, which can occur at&#xD;
      any time after breast cancer surgery or radiotherapy and is a major cause of morbidity.Early&#xD;
      and accurate diagnosis of lymphedema is very important for effective treatment. In routine&#xD;
      clinical practice there are various methods used to diagnose lymphedema such as history,&#xD;
      physical examination and limb circumference. Circumferential measurement is based on the&#xD;
      principle of circumference measurement at certain intervals (such as 4 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm) from&#xD;
      certain anatomical reference points on the extremities. Volume calculation can also be made&#xD;
      from a data obtained from circumferential measurements via a computer program.&#xD;
      Circumferential and volume measurements are used in the diagnosis, severity of lymphedema and&#xD;
      follow-up of treatment. Although it is the most commonly used method in practice,&#xD;
      circumferential measurements and volume measurements alone can ignore changes in tissue&#xD;
      structure and significant changes in the presence of latent lymphedema. At the same time,&#xD;
      circumferential measurements are made at regular intervals and the difference between the&#xD;
      healthy side and 2 cm or more is considered as lymphedema, which may neglect tissue and edema&#xD;
      changes in areas not in the measuring area. Ultrasonography, which has been used in the&#xD;
      measurement and evaluation of lymphedema in recent years, is a noninvasive economic method.&#xD;
      Skin and subcutaneous distance in lymphedema can be measured by ultrasonography, and changes&#xD;
      in tissue structure, fibrous tissue, adipose tissue and muscle tissue can be demonstrated.&#xD;
      Fibrotic changes in lymphedema tissue play a key role in progression. Subcutaneous ultrasound&#xD;
      echogenicity (SEG), which is thought to be a measure of lymphedema severity in extremities,&#xD;
      was determined as stages 0, 1 and 2. According to this; Stage 0: No increase in echogenicity&#xD;
      in the subcutaneous layer. That is, the subcutaneous fat layer is observed as black. Stage 1:&#xD;
      Diffuse increase in echogenicity, but identifiable horizontal or oblique-focused echogenic&#xD;
      lines caused by bundles of connective tissue may be seen. In this study, the investigators&#xD;
      aimed to determine the correlation between circumferential measurements and skin and&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue ultrasonography in breast cancer-related lymphedema patients.The primer&#xD;
      aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between circumferential measurements and&#xD;
      ultrasonographic measurements in breast cancer-related lymphedema. The secondary aim is to&#xD;
      investigate the relationship among the changes in subcutaneous tissue structure (subcutaneous&#xD;
      ultrasound echogenicity degree-SEG) and lymphedema severity in breast cancer-related&#xD;
      lymphedema.&#xD;

      Patients with unilateral breast cancer-related lymphedema will be included in the study. The&#xD;
      circumferences will be measured with a measuring tape from wrist ulnar styloid to axilla at 4&#xD;
      cm intervals. The point where the difference between the upper extremities was highest and&#xD;
      the control point with no difference in the lower extremities will be marked.&#xD;
      Ultrasonographic skin and subcutaneous thickness measurements will be performed from 4&#xD;
      quadrants; volar medial-lateral and dorsal medial-lateral sides of the extremity, with the&#xD;
      probe placed transverse and perpendicular to the skin at the marked points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of lymphedema was graded ultrasonographically according to the SEG scale. (Stage&#xD;
      0: No increase in echogenicity in the subcutaneous layer. That is, subcutaneous fat is&#xD;
      observed as black. Stage 1: Diffuse increase in echogenicity, but identifiable horizontal or&#xD;
      oblique-oriented echogenic lines caused by bundles of connective tissue can be seen. Stage 2:&#xD;
      A widespread increase in echogenicity echogenic lines cannot be identified.) Spearman test&#xD;
      was used for correlations and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was&#xD;
      used to estimate the diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a&#xD;
      statistically significant threshold. Differences between ultrasonographic measurements&#xD;
      between control points in lower extremities were compared with Wilcoxon test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum number of patients to be included in the study, according to the G-Power program,&#xD;
      effect size d = 0.5, alpha-α = 0.05 and power 0.80 was calculated to be at least 34.&#xD;
