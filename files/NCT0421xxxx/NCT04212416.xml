    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of leflunomide in treating patients with steroid&#xD;
      dependent chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). cGVHD is a common complication of bone&#xD;
      marrow transplant. GVHD occurs when immune cells transplanted from a donor (the graft)&#xD;
      recognize the transplant recipient (the host) as foreign, and cause damage to the skin,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract or other organs. Steroids are the first line of therapy and benefits&#xD;
      are seen in about one-third of patients with cGVHD. Prolonged use of steroids is associated&#xD;
      with multiple complications. Leflunomide may decrease the body's immune response and reduce&#xD;
      inflammation associated with cGVHD.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate safety and tolerability of leflunomide in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)&#xD;
      patients with steroid dependent chronic GvHD (cGvHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Characterize the toxicity profile of leflunomide in patients with steroid dependent cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Obtain preliminary evidence of leflunomide activity against GVHD by estimating the&#xD;
      response rate (as defined by 2014 National Institutes of Health [NIH] consensus development&#xD;
      project on clinical trials in cGVHD) in an expansion cohort of 12 patients with steroid&#xD;
      dependent cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate changes in cGVHD severity using physician-reported cGVHD activity assessment&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate changes in symptom activity using cGVHD activity assessment patient self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate failure-free survival and GVHD free survival. VI. Evaluate changes in steroid&#xD;
      doses while on therapy. VII. Evaluate rate of infectious complications during leflunomide&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the presence and percentage of immune cell subsets (including but not limited to&#xD;
      Th17 and Treg cells) in whole blood after leflunomide administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the changes in the presence and levels of GVHD inflammatory biomarkers and&#xD;
      cytokines (including but not limited to IL-17A, IL-21, and IL-2) in plasma after leflunomide&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of teriflunomide (active metabolite of leflunomide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive leflunomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for days 1-28. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients may optionally continue leflunomide for an additional 6 cycles as long as response&#xD;
      or stable disease is maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then&#xD;
      periodically thereafter.&#xD;

             study treatment on a developing fetus have the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant&#xD;

             signs, or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without&#xD;

             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical&#xD;
             study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with protocol therapy and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
