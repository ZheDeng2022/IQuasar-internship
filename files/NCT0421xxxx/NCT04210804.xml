  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 52 week double-blind placebo controlled study of omega-3 polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids (PUFAs) in bipolar disorder (who have a history of 3 or more episodes) to&#xD;
      ascertain if omega-3 PUFAs reduce the risk of further relapse for both / either depressive or&#xD;
      (hypo)manic episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-centre, 52 week, double-blind, randomised comparison of omega-3 PUFA (1g EPA&#xD;
      and 1g DHA) versus placebo as adjunctive treatment in individuals with bipolar disorder&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar Disorder is a chronic disabling psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent&#xD;
      episodes of mania or hypomania and depression. Bipolar Disorder can be separated into bipolar&#xD;
      I and bipolar II disorders with bipolar I disorder characterizing individuals who have&#xD;
      episodes of mania and depression, and bipolar II disorder characterizing individuals who have&#xD;
      episodes of depression with periods of hypomania, but not mania. Bipolar Disorder has an&#xD;
      estimated prevalence of approximately 1% and a roughly equal gender ratio. Treatment of&#xD;
      bipolar disorder is predominantly by pharmacological means with probably the most evidence&#xD;
      still supporting the role of lithium both for the treatment of bipolar disorder and&#xD;
      prophylaxis of further episodes (particularly (hypo)manic episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of other standard mood stabiliser agents are often utilised including sodium&#xD;
      valproate, carbamazepine and lamotrigine. Over the last 10 years, a number of antipsychotic&#xD;
      agents have attained a licence for the treatment of bipolar disorder including olanzapine,&#xD;
      quetiapine, asenapine and aripiprazole. All of these treatments are associated with&#xD;
      significant adverse effects. For example, lithium has been associated with hypothyroidism and&#xD;
      diabetes insipidus, interacts with a variety of other agents including non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics and requires careful blood monitoring to ensure that the&#xD;
      individuals blood level is within a therapeutic range (to avoid toxicity or subclinical&#xD;
      treatment). Sodium Valproate is associated with several adverse effects; principal amongst&#xD;
      these is teratogenesis in pregnancy, but also alopecia and a hand tremor. Carbamazepine is&#xD;
      associated with blood dyscrasias and hyponatraemia and interacts with many medications.&#xD;
      Lamotrigine has been utilised for the treatment of bipolar depression, however it can take&#xD;
      several months of treatment before one reaches therapeutic doses, and severe skin rashes&#xD;
      occasionally occur. In relation to the antipsychotic agents, olanzapine is associated with&#xD;
      significant weight gain, somnolence and metabolic syndrome, quetiapine is associated with&#xD;
      hypotension and somnolence, aripiprazole is associated with akathisia and asenapine is&#xD;
      associated with dizziness and somnolence. Whilst psychotherapy has demonstrated some benefit&#xD;
      for the treatment of bipolar depression, to date, the role of psychotherapy for the&#xD;
      management of (hypo)mania remains limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The putative role of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) principally&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the treatment of mood disorders&#xD;
      has been supported by a wide variety of epidemiological observations, tissue compositional&#xD;
      comparisons, clinical and treatment studies. For example, cross-national studies have found a&#xD;
      substantially higher incidence of depression, suicide, and bipolar disorder in cultures with&#xD;
      low omega-3 PUFA intake (due to low levels of fish consumption) with low levels of fish&#xD;
      consumption also independently associated with symptoms of depression. Lower concentrations&#xD;
      of both EPA and DHA have been found in red blood cells of depressed individuals compared to&#xD;
      healthy controls, and the ratio of EPA to the omega-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) has been&#xD;
      demonstrated both in depression and in mania. The most specific evidence for central tissue&#xD;
      compositional deficits is the finding of lower DHA in the post-mortem orbitofrontal cortex of&#xD;
      patients with both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several randomised controlled trials have also demonstrated a benefit for omega-3 PUFAs in&#xD;
      depression, although these findings are not universal and meta-analyses have noted&#xD;
      substantial heterogeneity in these findings. Although there have been multiple treatment&#xD;
      trials examining the putative antidepressant effect of omega-3 PUFAs in recurrent depressive&#xD;
      disorder, we are aware of only six randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trials to date&#xD;
      that have investigated if omega-3 PUFAs have a therapeutic role in bipolar disorder. In these&#xD;
      trials, results have been contradictory with two studies demonstrating a benefit for omega-3&#xD;
      PUFAs compared to placebo, with both of these trials demonstrating a reduction in depressive&#xD;
      but not manic symptoms. with one study using high dose EPA (6.2g) and DHA (3.4g) for a period&#xD;
      of 16 weeks, and another using lower formulations of EPA alone at doses of 1g or 2g for a&#xD;
      period of 12 weeks. In relation to the five negative trials to date; DHA alone (2g) was&#xD;
      administered to a small cohort of euthymic bipolar individuals (n=10; 6 = DHA, 4 = placebo)&#xD;
      over a 52 week period in one study. Another study administered high dose EPA (6g) however,&#xD;
      the drop-out rate was high at 54%. Two trials administered alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (the&#xD;
      parent omega-3 PUFA) or a mixture of PUFAs (3g EPA and 2g DHA) and pyrimidine cytidine&#xD;
      (n=15), with no benefit noted. One final study was presented in the form of a letter to the&#xD;
      editor and conducted in a small cohort of 15 individuals with minimal data provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is unclear if omega-3 PUFAs have a therapeutic role in bipolar disorder.&#xD;
      Studies to date have utilised a variety of PUFA formulations, for short time periods and have&#xD;
      included either modest numbers or have had high drop-out rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humans have limited capacity to synthesize EPA or DHA de novo and make only limited amounts&#xD;
      of DHA from the dietary precursor omega-3, ALA. Fish and shellfish are the primary dietary&#xD;
      sources of preformed EPA and DHA. Both of these omega-3 PUFAs play an important role in many&#xD;
      physiological processes including inflammation, and DHA is selectively concentrated in&#xD;
      synaptic neuronal membranes. EPA has significant immunological neurotrophic and hormone like&#xD;
      activities which may explain to date, the greater evidence for its antidepressant efficacy.&#xD;
      EPA is more rapidly incorporated into membrane phospholipids, increasing inflammation&#xD;
      resolution of circulating mononuclear cells, resulting in attenuated production of the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF). Both&#xD;
      major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder are associated with increased&#xD;
      circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α and perhaps the&#xD;
      demonstrated antidepressant effects of EPA may be related in some part to its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory role. Other postulated mechanisms for a putative role of omega-3 PUFAs in&#xD;
      bipolar disorder include suppression of neuronal signalling, second messenger generation,&#xD;
      calcium channel and protein kinase C activity and kindling. Western diets are deficient in&#xD;
      omega-3 PUFAs, largely due to relatively low seafood consumption and the food industry&#xD;
      preference for corn and soy oils high in the short-chain omega-6 PUFA acid linoleic acid.&#xD;
      However, omega-3 PUFAs are becoming an increasingly popular over-the-counter dietary&#xD;
      supplement and are an appealing option for treatment of both physical and psychiatric&#xD;
      illness, given the perception that they are a &quot;natural&quot; substance and that they possess a&#xD;
      very benign adverse effect profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, despite moderate evidence for the efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs in recurrent depressive&#xD;
      disorder (major depressive illness), little is known in relation to the possible efficacy of&#xD;
      omega-3 PUFAs in bipolar disorder. As stated, studies to date in bipolar disorder have&#xD;
      occurred in individuals with euthymia or mild depression and the maximum trial duration as&#xD;
      mentioned above except for one study with only 10 participants has been 16 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be adults (aged 18 or older) recruited from the local mental&#xD;
      health service, which include a specialised bipolar disorder clinic (n=40) and 12 other&#xD;
      out-patient clinics per week, where approximately another 160 individuals with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder attend. Approximately 130 individuals attending the service would satisfy criteria&#xD;
      for study inclusion and it is envisaged based on previous research by Hallahan and colleagues&#xD;
      in the same population, that 70% (n=91) would be willing to engage in this treatment trial.&#xD;
      If insufficient numbers are available to participate from the local mental health service,&#xD;
      significant links with adjoining HSE West services (within 1 hour of Galway) have been&#xD;
      developed for research purposes over the last seven years and additional participants could&#xD;
      be attained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a complete description of the study, written informed consent will be obtained from all&#xD;
      participants and signed agreement will be obtained from their treating psychiatrist. Previous&#xD;
      studies demonstrating a treatment effect in depression and both positive bipolar disorder&#xD;
      studies have had EPA as the sole or principal omega-3 PUFA, and thus the investigators felt&#xD;
      that it was important that EPA was a significant component of the PUFA formulation. Based on&#xD;
      a recent hierarchical meta-analysis conducted at NUI Galway, it is clear that EPA has some&#xD;
      clinical benefit for depression and DHA as the predominant component in a PUFA formulation&#xD;
      has no significant clinical benefit, however when both compounds were present, the beneficial&#xD;
      effect was at least as efficacious (marginally more efficacious but not to a statistical&#xD;
      significant level) than where EPA was the sole PUFA agent. Furthermore, as DHA enrichment and&#xD;
      turnover in the brain is slow (unlike EPA), with a half-life of approximately 2.5 years, it&#xD;
      is not surprising that relatively short RCTs would not demonstrate a benefit with DHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently individuals who consent to participate in this study will take either the active&#xD;
      agent which is Omega-3 PUFA: Dose = 1g Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and 1g Docosahexaenoic&#xD;
      Acid (DHA) taken po as a juice (200ml; Smartfish Nutrifriend 2000). Placebo will look and&#xD;
      taste identical to the active compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omega-3 PUFAs are freely available to attain in a variety of health shops, pharmacies and in&#xD;
      some general retail shops also. Consequently they are not in any phase of development,&#xD;
      however their benefit, long established for physical conditions such as arthritis has also&#xD;
      been postulated for mood disorders and evidence for benefit has been attained in a number of&#xD;
      randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses with no associated adverse consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 1-3 month placebo run in time, participants will take the active or placebo agent for&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No medical regulatory board approval was required (HPRA in Ireland) as this is a nutrient&#xD;
      rather than a medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims Primary: Undertake a 52 week single-centre, double-blind, placebo controlled study of&#xD;
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in bipolar disorder (who have a history of 3 or&#xD;
      more episodes) to ascertain if omega-3 PUFAs reduce the risk of further relapse for both /&#xD;
      either depressive or (hypo)manic episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Ascertain if there is any difference from baseline mood scores for both elation&#xD;
      and depression for omega-3 PUFAs compared to placebo. The investigators wish to ascertain&#xD;
      what proportion of individuals drop out of the study from both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be carried out utilising the Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences 24 (SPSS 24) or other statistical programmes as deemed necessary. Significance will&#xD;
      be set at 0.05 and all tests will be two-tailed. Parametric data will be analysed using&#xD;
      student t-tests or analysis of co-variance where appropriate and non-parametric data will be&#xD;
      analysed using chi-squared test. A repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) with baseline rating&#xD;
      scores entered as co-variates will be used to compare changes in psychopathology over time in&#xD;
      the two groups. Survivor analysis (Kaplan-Meier) will also be utilised in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No analysis has been conducted to date and the code for placebo or active groups has not been&#xD;
      broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychometric Instruments utilised include the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I&#xD;
      Disorders (SCID), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
      (HDRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale&#xD;
      and Clinical Global Impression (CGI).&#xD;
