&#xD;
         20. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;

             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;

&#xD;
         23. Known brain metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis&#xD;
