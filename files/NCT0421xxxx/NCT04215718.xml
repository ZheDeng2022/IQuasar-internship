      the investigators conducted this comparative clinical trial in the period between April 2017&#xD;
      and March 2019, on 92 patients with simple anal fistula, patients were randomly allocated&#xD;
      into 2 groups, group I the fistulotomy group; 46 patients they underwent fistulotomy and&#xD;
      marsupialization of wound edges. Group II, the fistulectomy group they underwent fistulectomy&#xD;
      with closure of the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was done using computer generated cards, the trial was approved by&#xD;
      institutional review board (IRB) and the ethical committee of our hospitals, all study&#xD;
      participants signed an informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The condition of this trial is simple anal fistula defined as non-branched fistula confined&#xD;
      to the lower third of the anal sphincter diagnosed by anorectal examination or MRI if needed,&#xD;
      the primary outcomes are; the time taken for complete healing, fistula recurrence and anal&#xD;
      incontinence diagnosed by Vaizey score patient's questionnaire. The secondary outcomes are&#xD;
      local wound complications and postoperative pain calculated by visual analogue score (VAS).&#xD;
      Study participants number was calculated through the IRB depending on the incidence of simple&#xD;
      anal fistula in our locality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      • patients above 18 years diagnosed with simple non recurrent anal fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anorectal malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific disease (Crohn's disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASA class III, VI and any contraindication for surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunocompromised patients and those on steroid therapy or cytotoxic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perianal collection. participants of this study were subjected to proper history taking&#xD;
           and full clinical examination for diagnosis of the condition, detection of any&#xD;
           associated disease and \ or exclusion factor. MRI was ordered if there is any doubt&#xD;
           about diagnosis, preoperative investigations were ordered as per usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure in both groups was carried out by the study surgeons, under general anesthesia&#xD;
      in lithotomy position, anorectal examination was done to identify the internal and external&#xD;
      openings, course of fistulous track and any side tracks if present. When the internal opening&#xD;
      couldn't be identified the operator used methylene blue dye injection through the external&#xD;
      opening. In fistulotomy group and after probing of the track it was let open by diathermy,&#xD;
      its floor was curetted and the wound edges marsupialized by polygalactin (Vicryl) sutures&#xD;
      3\0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fistulectomy group and after probing, the fistulous track was excised by diathermy&#xD;
      together with its internal and external openings, after hemostasis the wound was closed by&#xD;
      polygalactin (Vicryl) sutures 3\0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups the wound was dressed with non-adhesive dressing, Nonsteroidal analgesics were&#xD;
      given as per need and participants were discharged after 24 hours if there is no&#xD;
      contraindication to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge study participants were encouraged for self-cleaning by antiseptic baths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up was carried out in the outpatient clinics by the study surgeons, the clinic visits&#xD;
      were planed every week for 12 weeks then monthly for another three months, in each visit the&#xD;
      investigator recorded the state of wound healing, anal continence, postoperative pain, any&#xD;
      local wound complications, and any recurrence after complete healing in the follow up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative data, demographic data, operative time, intraoperative complications and follow&#xD;
      up data were collected and properly analyzed using paired t test and Z tests in SPSS 22&#xD;
      program package.&#xD;
