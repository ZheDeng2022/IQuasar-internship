  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether submucosal or subserous injection of&#xD;
      indocyanine green during laparoscopic lymphadenectomy for patients with gastric cancer was&#xD;
      different. The patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (cT1-4a, N0/+, M0) were studied.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, with the successful application of ICG (indocyanine green) fluorescence&#xD;
      imaging technology in laparoscopic equipment, scholars have found that ICG near-infrared&#xD;
      imaging has better tissue penetration and can better identify lymph nodes in hypertrophic&#xD;
      adipose tissue than other dyes under visible light, which makes ICG fluorescence imaging&#xD;
      guide laparoscopic radical resection of gastric cancer lymph node dissection has become a new&#xD;
      exploration direction. ICG near-infrared imaging technology has important research value,&#xD;
      good application prospects, and broad development space in laparoscopic radical resection of&#xD;
      gastric cancer. However, at present, the application of ICG near-infrared imaging technology&#xD;
      in laparoscopic radical resection of gastric cancer is still in the exploratory stage, and&#xD;
      there is no unified standard. Therefore, in the world, there is still a lack of high-level&#xD;
      evidence-based evidence of large-sample prospective randomized controlled trials to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of submucosal or subserous injection of ICG in&#xD;
      guiding laparoscopic D2 resection of gastric cancer. The investigator first carried out this&#xD;
      study in the world to evaluate the lymph node dissection and perioperative safety of gastric&#xD;
      cancer patients who received a submucosal injection of ICG and subserous injection of ICG&#xD;
      during laparoscopic radical gastrectomy in the same period, to promote the standardized&#xD;
      development of ICG near-infrared imaging in laparoscopic radical gastrectomy.&#xD;
