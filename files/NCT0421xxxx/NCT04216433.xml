  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the spirit of improving patient safety and quality of healthcare in our region, the&#xD;
      Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council Education and Research Foundation (Foundation) and Baylor&#xD;
      Research Institute sought and obtained federal funding support (AHRQ grant) to develop an&#xD;
      Abdominal Aortic Aneurism (AAA) surgery registry in North Texas. Participating centers will&#xD;
      directly benefit from this project and will have access to a de-identified version of the&#xD;
      registry data through their collaboration. These data may be used for quality improvement&#xD;
      initiatives and/or to conduct your own research. In summary, this effort represents a&#xD;
      substantial investment (with no costs to facilities) in improving outcomes for patients with&#xD;
      AAA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, little is known about who receives which type of surgery. What data are available&#xD;
      are largely from single-centre studies, with study populations of a few hundred to a thousand&#xD;
      patients, comparing outcomes for open and endovascular repair and collecting patient&#xD;
      characteristic data largely for risk adjustment. Data on endovascular vs open AAA repair from&#xD;
      the population-based registry will provide important information regarding the current use of&#xD;
      these two treatment strategies, as well as allowing comparison of long-term outcomes for each&#xD;
      according to different patient characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed registry has the potential to provide means for internal quality assessment for&#xD;
      the participating institutions. The de-identified registry will be made available to&#xD;
      researchers at their request. This registry, focusing on AAA in the Dallas-Fort Worth&#xD;
      metroplex, will provide data with the potential to improve treatments for more than 800,000&#xD;
      patients in the US.&#xD;
