  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major cardiovascular events are greatest in liver transplant recipients with sustained&#xD;
      post-transplantation diabetes1. However, the optimal A1c target after transplantation has not&#xD;
      been studied. The objective is to understand the optimal A1c target post liver and combined&#xD;
      liver and kidney transplant. Strict A1c control will improve mortality and cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk post liver and combined liver and kidney transplant and improve complications post liver&#xD;
      and combined liver and kidney transplant.&#xD;

      Major cardiovascular events are greatest in liver transplant recipients with sustained&#xD;
      post-transplantation diabetes. However, the optimal A1c target after transplantation has not&#xD;
      been studied. The objective is to understand the optimal A1c target post liver and combined&#xD;
      liver and kidney transplant. Strict A1c control will improve mortality and cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk post liver and combined liver and kidney transplant and improve complications post liver&#xD;
      and combined liver and kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strict blood sugar control in non-transplant patients with diabetes mellitus has shown&#xD;
      unfavorable results in previous studies. However, no optimal A1c level has been studied in&#xD;
      liver and combined liver and kidney transplant patients. Furthermore, guidelines for A1c&#xD;
      target post-transplant are of expert opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the impact of hemoglobin A1c on all-cause mortality among&#xD;
      patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing liver or combined liver and kidney transplantation&#xD;
      between 2008 to 2018. The second objective is to assess the impact of hemoglobin A1c on&#xD;
      complications post liver or combined liver and kidney transplantation.&#xD;

        Data will be obtained from UNOS, which is a large, non-profit organization, database about&#xD;
        organ transplant recipients in the United States. Data will be collected from January 2008&#xD;
        to December 2018, and compared outcomes (as mentioned above) between liver and combined&#xD;
        liver and kidney transplant recipients with A1c values &lt;6.0, 6.1 to 7.0, 7.1 to 8.0, 8.1 to&#xD;
        8.9, or &gt;9.0.&#xD;
