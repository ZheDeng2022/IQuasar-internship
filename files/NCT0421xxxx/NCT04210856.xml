  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an established consensus between researchers that the contact with natural&#xD;
      environments has beneficial influence on mental health and well-being of people exposed to&#xD;
      them. The knowledge in this area is based mostly on the correlational analyses, but more&#xD;
      research is needed to explore the causal relationships between the human and his environment.&#xD;
      More specifically, in order to identify specific restorative mechanisms in response to the&#xD;
      specific types and components of the designed landscapes, especially in the highly urbanized&#xD;
      context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will attempt to find the psychophysiological responses in human brain to&#xD;
      landscapes videos (in the lab), and real landscapes with different visual quality, carefully&#xD;
      pre-selected and analysed in terms of landscape composition. In the study the rigorous&#xD;
      experimental protocol will be administered in order to acquire qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      data both self-reported and measured by neuroscience tools, in order to demonstrate the&#xD;
      causal effect of landscape exposure on the brain activity patterns and mood of healthy and&#xD;
      depressed individuals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Understanding of the impact of urban green landscapes with different design and levels of&#xD;
      contemplativeness on brain function may pave the way to more scientifically informed and more&#xD;
      healthy planning and design of urban living environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also the exposure to certain types of landscapes may be useful in mental health promotion and&#xD;
      support for the existing treatments in patients with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims The aim of the study is to assess the effects of passive exposure (viewing)&#xD;
      images of differently designed landscapes on the brain activity of two groups: 1) healthy&#xD;
      individuals and 2) patients with depression, using electroencephalography (EEG) and&#xD;
      Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). The investigators also want to compare effects&#xD;
      of exposure to images with the in-situ immersion with the real environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the assumption that there are certain types and components of the living&#xD;
      environments that influence our mental health and well-being even if one is passively exposed&#xD;
      to them, the investigators want to to assess the effects of passive exposure to three&#xD;
      differently designed, representative landscapes on the brain activity of healthy individuals.&#xD;
      And to compare effects of exposure to images with the in-situ immersion with the real&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesise that landscapes, that the Therapeutic Garden, which&#xD;
      also achieved a high score in the Contemplative Landscape expert evaluation scale, will&#xD;
      induce the brain activity patterns commonly associated with the relaxation, and bottom-up&#xD;
      attention, unlike the other selected sites with lower scores. Additionally, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that in the real landscape exposures they will observe this phenomenon more&#xD;
      intensely than in the case of images exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS The investigators will recruit 100 right-handed healthy participants aged 21-75&#xD;
      y.o. Based on previous studies using fNIRS to study motor task (Siedel et al., 2017), the&#xD;
      minimum number of participants is 50 participants per group. As a result, recruitment of 100&#xD;
      participants in order to ensure the minimal number of participants in the case of dropouts&#xD;
      was proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left-handedness;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serious visual impairment; reported psychiatric, neurological or cognitive diseases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reported use of medication that could alter the functioning of the Central Nervous&#xD;
           System at the time of the experiment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  existence of a pacemaker, intracranial electrodes, implanted defibrillator or plates,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  otologic surgery in the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also recruit 100 right-handed patients with diagnosed depression at&#xD;
      the Neuroscience Clinic or Psychiatric ward in National University Hospital (NUH)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age of 21 to 75&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right-handed only&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They must suffer from depressive disorder,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major neurological disorders e.g. epilepsy, stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any form of cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major heart diseases: e.g. ischemic heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major lung diseases: e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major liver disease e.g. liver failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major kidney disease e.g. kidney failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target individuals will be recruited by word of mouth. The principal investigator or&#xD;
      co-investigator will approach the participants who fulfil the inclusion criteria and explain&#xD;
      the purpose and procedure of this project. If the participant agrees to participate in this&#xD;
      project, he or she will sign the consent form after reading the Participant Information Sheet&#xD;
      that provides information about this study. Then the investigators will arrange the time&#xD;
      schedule to perform the sessions for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approvals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For healthy participants: Ref #: S-18-352 For patients: NHG DSRB Ref # 2018/01036&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS NEUROIMAGING EQUIPMENT The NIRS and EEG data will be collected using NIRSport (LLC&#xD;
      NIRx Medical Technologies). The former consists of 8 illumination sources and 8 detection&#xD;
      sensors with two wavelengths of 760nm &amp; 850nm, yields 128 data channels, with a sampling rate&#xD;
      62.5 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latter is V-Amp 16-channel portable EEG system, with active -dry type of electrodes&#xD;
      (actiCAP Xpress), bandwidth of 0Hz (DC) - 500Hz(-3 dB) and sampling rate up to 20.000 Hz.&#xD;
      Both devices are lightweight, portable and adjusted to the outdoor environment data&#xD;
      collection, and mountable on one single cap to reduce discomforts of long data collection for&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a non-randomised within subjects clinical trial. All participants will attend&#xD;
      four landscape viewing sessions while having their brains imaged using the fNIRS and EEG&#xD;
      (both machines combined into 1 cap), they will also complete an emotional state assessment&#xD;
      questionnaire (Profile of Mood States - POMS, [Shacham,1983]), landscape preference&#xD;
      questionnaire (Self-Assessment Manikin) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).The latter will&#xD;
      serve as a control for the extreme scores in the healthy population i.e. if a healthy&#xD;
      patricipants score shows that this participant may suffer from undiagnosed depression their&#xD;
      data may be eliminated from the further analysis. The participant with high depression score&#xD;
      will be advised to seek clinical assessment by psychiatrist. First session will take place in&#xD;
      the research room at the BIGHEART premises (lab indoor environment), and three remaining&#xD;
      sessions in the 3 oudoor preselected sites (real landscapes) - see Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1. Location of the data collection sessions, and estimated time of participation&#xD;
      Viewing session Site Adress Estimated Time&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lab (indoors) BIGHEART, 14 Medical Drive, #14-01. 50min&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Site 01 (outdoors) Therapeutic Garden @Hortpark, 33 Hyderabad Rd, Singapore 20min&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Site 02 (outdoors) Casa Clementi, Clementi Ave 1, Singapore 20min&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Site 03 (outdoors) Sheltered sidewalk, 32 New Market Rd, Singapore 20min&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indoor Experimental protocol The first, lab-based session will start with informed consent,&#xD;
      and completion of pre-experiment POMS (profile of mood state) questionnaire. The participant&#xD;
      code will be then attributed to each participant, their personal information will not be used&#xD;
      any more in the study: they will not be needed in the future and will not need to be stored.&#xD;
      All electronic devices in the room are to be switched off except necessary data collection&#xD;
      equipment. The room temperature and humidity will be kept the same across all participants&#xD;
      and conditions. Before the data collection each participant will have the multimodal NIRS and&#xD;
      EEG device positioned on their heads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to sit comfortably on a chair and without talking or moving&#xD;
      calmly observe the landscape views displayed in front of them, while simultaneously their&#xD;
      brain signals will be recorded using NIRS and EEG. Resting state activity for each&#xD;
      participant will be recorded preceding the display of the videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 1 minute of resting state (baseline) recording followed by the landscape 9&#xD;
      fixed-frame videos viewing, displayed for 20 seconds, repeated 3 times each in a randomized&#xD;
      order to avoid order bias. In between the landscapes there will be a fixation cross displayed&#xD;
      for 5 seconds. So the overall time of recording EEG/fNIRS signal will take about 13 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that four questionnaires will be completed by the participant, including respectively:&#xD;
      (1) post-experimental POMS questionnaire, (2) landscape preference questionnaire, (3)&#xD;
      Depression scale (BDI questionnaire) and (4) socio-demographic questionnaire. There are some&#xD;
      questions that may be deemed sensitive to some participants, in this case they are allowed to&#xD;
      skip an uncomfortable question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole procedure (including explanation, consent taking, questionnaire and cognitive&#xD;
      tasks) should be completed within 50 min. The fNIRS and EEG signals recorded during&#xD;
      landscapes viewing as well as each cognitive task will be stored in the computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outdoor Landscape Experiment multimodal NIRS and EEG In this study participants will be&#xD;
      invited to the site session, morning (between 10AM and 12PM) or afternoon (between 2PM and&#xD;
      4PM). For the safety of participants and sound quality of the study design the weather during&#xD;
      the session must be normalized: not too hot, dry with clear or partly cloudy sky. In the&#xD;
      event of the bad weather conditions (rain, storm, heat wave) the sessions will be postponed.&#xD;
      The travel expenses for a participant getting to the sites will be included in the&#xD;
      reimbursement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of possibility of disruption of the public space (especially in the case of Site 03),&#xD;
      only up to 2 participants can have the session scheduled at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the pre-experimental POMS questionnaire, participants will be seated in&#xD;
      front of an actual landscape view, and advised to calmly observe it, without moving. The&#xD;
      researchers will control for the outdoor brightness using the standard light-meter, thus the&#xD;
      onsite data collection should be performed at the similar time of a day, with the similar&#xD;
      weather conditions and keeping all other factors (such as other visitors and any other&#xD;
      distracting phenomena) at the similar levels across all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the rest of the outdoors experimental procedures will be similar to the laboratory&#xD;
      procedure except no consent (the consent signing will take place prior to the outdoors&#xD;
      sessions), no socio-demographic and no BDI questionnaire will be performed. Participants will&#xD;
      be seated in front of each of 3 landscape views at a location, and for the baseline recording&#xD;
      the white glasses will be put on their eyes to cover the view. After baseline recording they&#xD;
      will passively watch the landscape view for 1 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After data collection the devices will be dismounted from the head of participant and the&#xD;
      POMS questionnaire will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time of the participation in the outdoor session will be therefore shorter, estimated at&#xD;
      20 minutes.&#xD;
