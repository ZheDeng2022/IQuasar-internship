    <textblock>
      This is an open, dose escalation/dose extension study of LCAR-T2C CAR-T cells administrered&#xD;
      to patients with T lymphocyte tumor. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy of LCAR-T2C CAR-T cells. The auto-CAR-T cells will be infused in&#xD;
      single-dose.&#xD;
