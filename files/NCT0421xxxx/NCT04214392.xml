      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#xD;
      T cells with a chlorotoxin tumor-targeting domain in treating patients with MPP2+&#xD;
      glioblastoma that has come back (recurrent) or that is growing, spreading, or getting worse&#xD;
      (progressive). Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective&#xD;
      immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the feasibility and safety of dual delivery of chlorotoxin&#xD;
      (EQ)-CD28-CD3zeta-CD19t-expressing CAR T-lymphocytes NCI SYs (chlorotoxin [CLTX]-CAR T cells)&#xD;
      for participants with MMP2+ recurrent or progressive glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose schedule (MTD) and a recommended phase 2 dosing plan&#xD;
      (RP2D) for dual delivery of CLTX-CAR T cells for participants with MMP2+ recurrent or&#xD;
      progressive glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe persistence, expansion, and phenotype of endogenous and CLTX-CAR CAR T cells in&#xD;
      tumor cyst fluid (TCF), peripheral blood (PB), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Describe cytokine levels in PB, TCF, and CSF over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. In research participants who receive the full schedule of 3 cycles of CLTX-CAR T cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIa. Estimate the six month progression free survival (PFS) rate. IIIb. Estimate the nine&#xD;
      month overall survival (OS) rate. IIIc. Estimate disease response rates. IIId. Estimate&#xD;
      median overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. In study participants who undergo an additional biopsy/resection or autopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVa. Evaluate CAR T cell persistence in the tumor tissue and the location of the CAR T cells&#xD;
      with respect to the injection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVb. Evaluate CLTX-targeted antigen expression levels on tumor tissue pre and post CAR T cell&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Use mathematical modeling of tumor growth to evaluate benefit of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive chlorotoxin (EQ)-CD28-CD3zeta-CD19t-expressing CAR T-lymphocytes NCI SYs via&#xD;
      dual delivery starting on day 0 for 3 weekly cycles over 28 days. Each treatment cycle begins&#xD;
      with one or two CAR T cell infusions (one at each catheter site) and lasts for 1 week.&#xD;
      Beginning 1 week after cycle 3, patients may continue with CAR T treatment per principal&#xD;
      investigator and patient discretion. Treatment continues in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 3, 6, 9, and 12&#xD;
      months, and then yearly for up to 15 years.&#xD;
