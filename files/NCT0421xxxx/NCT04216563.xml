  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ABL001 works in treating patients with chronic myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia who are on therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor. ABL001 may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving ABL001 and&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor together may work better than tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone in&#xD;
      treating patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the clinical activity of the combination of asciminib (ABL001) and a tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor (TKI) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in complete&#xD;
      cytogenetic response (CCyR) but detectable BCR-ABL1 transcript.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of the combination of ABL001 and TKI on the rate of mismatch&#xD;
      repair (MR)4, MR4.5, and sustained MR4.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate treatment-free remission after at least 2 years of sustained deep&#xD;
      molecular remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety of the combination of asciminib and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the event-free survival (EFS), survival free from transformation to&#xD;
      accelerated and blast phase (TFS), and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) clearance using droplet digital&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) detecting the BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effect of therapy on quiescent leukemic Philadelphia chromosome positive&#xD;
      (Ph+) stem cells (CFSEmax/CD34+).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the effect of this combination on mutations in ABL1 and mutations in clonal&#xD;
      hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP)-associated genes using molecular barcode&#xD;
      sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the effect of therapy on bone marrow progenitors in clonogenic assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To describe immune effects of the combination of TKI and ABL001. VI. To describe patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes (PRO) using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-CML instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive asciminib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 36 months while receiving&#xD;
      standard of care dasatinib or nilotinib in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients may continue to receive asciminib after 36 months at the discretion of&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4-8 weeks for 6 months&#xD;
      and then every 3-6 months thereafter.&#xD;

          -  The effects of ABL001 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to&#xD;
             use highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 30 days after&#xD;
             study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she&#xD;
             or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately. Allowable methods of birth control: Total abstinence (when this&#xD;
             is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject). Periodic abstinence&#xD;
             (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are&#xD;
             not acceptable methods of contraception. Female sterilization (have had surgical&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal&#xD;
             ligation at least six weeks before the start of study treatment. In case of&#xD;
             oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed&#xD;
             by follow up hormone level assessment. Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
             screening). The vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject.&#xD;
             Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of&#xD;
             an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal&#xD;
             contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone&#xD;
             vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. Sexually active males must use a&#xD;
             condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for 30 days after stopping&#xD;
             treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be&#xD;
             used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal&#xD;
             fluid&#xD;
