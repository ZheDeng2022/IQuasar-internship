      This study assesses the acute effects of a standardized 20-minute vaping episode compared to&#xD;
      a non-vaping control condition on ad libitum food intake during a 30-minute buffet meal,&#xD;
      occurring approximately 45 minutes after the vaping episode&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weight control is a common motive for cigarette smoking and nicotine has been shown to&#xD;
      suppress appetite and increase resting metabolic rate, and also serves as a behavioral&#xD;
      alternative to eating or a distraction from hunger or food craving. Data on the acute effect&#xD;
      of e-cigarette use ('vaping') on ad libitum food intake are non-existent. Given that many&#xD;
      e-cigarette users report vaping for weight control and that certain e-cigarettes are being&#xD;
      actively marketed for weight management and/or suppression of food cravings, addressing this&#xD;
      research gap is of the utmost importance.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study consists of a baseline assessment which is followed by two within-subject, laboratory conditions that differ by the product used: 1) JUUL e-cigarette with a 5% nicotine pod, 2) no active e-cigarette use (uncharged JUUL with empty pod). The condition orders (i.e., 1 then 2, or 2 then 1) will be randomly ordered and assigned following enrollment. During the vaping condition, participants will be asked to take 20 e-cigarette puffs over 20 minutes before consuming an ad libitum buffet meal. During the alternative control condition, participants will have access to an uncharged JUUL with an empty pod for 20 minutes (instead of vaping) before consuming an ad libitum buffet meal.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to use a JUUL device to vape 20 puffs over 20 minutes. Participants will use JUUL pods with ~5% nicotine by weight. The anticipated amount of nicotine that will be absorbed with 20 puffs is approximately 1.6 mg, which is equal to approximately 1.5 cigarettes.</description>
