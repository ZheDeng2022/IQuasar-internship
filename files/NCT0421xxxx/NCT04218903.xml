  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combined training is a cornerstone intervention to improve functionality and to reduce blood&#xD;
      pressure in older adults with hypertension. Acute blood pressure lowering after exercise&#xD;
      seems to predict the extent of blood pressure reduction after chronic training interventions.&#xD;
      Based on that, the same weekly amount of exercise performed more frequently could be more&#xD;
      beneficial to blood pressure management. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of a combined exercise program performed four versus two times per week on 24-h&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in older individuals with&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic blood pressure reduction due regular exercise seems to result from the sum of the&#xD;
      acute decreases that follows each exercise bout (i.e., post-exercise hypotension), a&#xD;
      physiological effect associated with chronic blood pressure reduction that may predict the&#xD;
      extent of blood pressure lowering after chronic training interventions. Based on this, the&#xD;
      same weekly amount of exercise performed more frequently, splitting the total overload into&#xD;
      multiple sessions, could be more beneficial for blood pressure control. Although physical&#xD;
      exercise guidelines suggest a total weekly volume in minutes (i.e., 150 minutes per week),&#xD;
      it's unclear if the same amount of exercise performed in different weekly frequencies could&#xD;
      induce different blood pressure responses. In addition, other important cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors such as glycemic levels can also be influenced by exercise frequency. Reduction in&#xD;
      glycosylated hemoglobin is associated with exercise frequency in diabetic patients,&#xD;
      reinforcing the relevance to compare exercise interventions using different weekly training&#xD;
      frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of a combined exercise program&#xD;
      performed four versus two times per week on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure and other&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged and older individuals with hypertension. The main&#xD;
      outcome is the change from baseline to 12 weeks of follow-up in 24-h, daytime, nighttime&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure, and glycosylated hemoglobin between the&#xD;
      intervention groups. Secondary outcomes are the difference between mean change in endothelial&#xD;
      function, as well as cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and quality of life. We&#xD;
      anticipate that at 12 weeks, combined exercise program, performed four or two times per week&#xD;
      with equalized weekly volume/overload, will improve all outcomes in comparison to the&#xD;
      baseline values and these improvements in blood pressure and glycosylated hemoglobin will be&#xD;
      more pronounced in four times per week group when compared with two times per week group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized, parallel group, two-arm, superiority trial. Ninety-eight&#xD;
      participants aged 50-80 years with a previous physician diagnosis of hypertension will be&#xD;
      randomized to perform two or four sessions per week of combined training using the same total&#xD;
      weekly overload. Primary outcomes will be 24-h ambulatory blood pressure and glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin; secondary outcomes will be endothelial function, physical fitness and quality of&#xD;
      life. The outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks period.&#xD;
