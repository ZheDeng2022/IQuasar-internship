  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, half of the participants will be asked to floss as normal, while the other&#xD;
      half will receive professional instructions on flossing from a dentist. The investigators&#xD;
      want to see if the participants who have professional flossing instructions are able to&#xD;
      remove plaque in between the teeth more effectively, and have less gum bleeding over time.&#xD;
      The investigators also want to see if participants who receive professional flossing&#xD;
      instructions get better at the technique over time, and if they can match the dentist's skill&#xD;
      by the end of the study.&#xD;

      Primary Aim: To determine whether subjects instructed with a specific flossing technique have&#xD;
      less gingival inflammation as evidenced by bleeding on probing (BoP) than subjects without&#xD;
      flossing instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To compare the effect of flossing by a dental professional with a patient's&#xD;
      self-flossing following instruction in removing interdental plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To compare the completeness of plaque removal by the subjects instructed&#xD;
      during the initial visit (Group A [test]) with their completeness at the final (fourth)&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To compare the clinician's completeness of plaque removal at the fourth visit&#xD;
      with the completeness of plaque removal by the subjects in both groups (Groups A [test] and B&#xD;
      [control]). Each group will be analyzed separately. In Group A, a comparison of the plaque&#xD;
      removal by the subjects and by the clinician will made with respect to the completeness at&#xD;
      the first visit versus the final visit.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects chewed a Sunstar Butler GUMâ„¢ disclosing tablet, and once dissolved in the saliva they swished it in their mouth for 30 seconds. Then they expectorated and rinsed their mouth with water. A plaque index (Modified O'Leary Plaque Score Index Chart) was recorded in which the all teeth surface are stained using a plaque disclosing dye. Plaque was marked as whether present or absent interproximally only for each tooth (buccal and lingual surfaces).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must show &gt; 20% interproximal sites (mesial facial and mesial lingual and&#xD;
             distal facial and distal lingual) with BoP. This includes mesial and distal sites next&#xD;
             to edentulous areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have &gt; 24 natural teeth including teeth with crowns with margins&#xD;
             confluent with the natural tooth as long as they do not violate the biologic width.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Third molars will be excluded from study; unless the third molars are in the&#xD;
             anatomical position of second molars. However, subjects with third molars present will&#xD;
             be accepted into the study unless there are other factors that exclude them.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must report having had a professional dental prophylaxis within four months&#xD;
             of beginning the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to floss daily and to be taught and use a specific technique&#xD;
             of flossing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who use tobacco products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with fixed or removable orthodontic appliances&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with splinted fixed prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are incapable of flossing their teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with defective interproximal restorations or interproximal caries that are&#xD;
             clinically evident and impacting gingival health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects where malposed teeth preclude the use of floss&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with probing depth greater than or equal to 5mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant (self-reported) due to the greater bleeding tendency due to&#xD;
             the hormonal changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a systemic disease that affects the gingiva or are taking medications of&#xD;
             which affect the gingiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-English speaking subjects, as study assessments and instructions will be in&#xD;
             English only. There is no direct benefit to subjects for taking part in this study,&#xD;
             therefore the exclusion of non-English speaking subjects is not an ethical concern.&#xD;
