      The experiment seeks to determine the impact of a sleep health and fatigue education and&#xD;
      training program on diverse indicators of sleep and fatigue among Emergency Medical Services&#xD;
      (EMS) personnel. The overarching goals of this research study are to [1] enhance our&#xD;
      understanding of the relationships between shift work, sleep, and fatigue in EMS operations;&#xD;
      and [2] determine whether or not providing education and training to EMS personnel on the&#xD;
      importance of sleep health and dangers of fatigue impact indicators of sleep and fatigue. The&#xD;
      investigators will accomplish these goals by using a cluster-randomized trial study design&#xD;
      with a wait-list control group.&#xD;

      The overarching goals of this research study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. enhance our understanding of the relationships between shift work, sleep, and fatigue in&#xD;
           EMS operations; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. determine whether or not providing education and training to EMS personnel on the&#xD;
           importance of sleep health and dangers of fatigue impact indicators of sleep and&#xD;
           fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit EMS nationwide for EMS agencies to participate in this study&#xD;
      and focus on moderately sized EMS agencies with between 50 and 300 employees (yet we will not&#xD;
      outright exclude smaller or larger organizations). Agencies that run dual ground-based and&#xD;
      air-medical EMS services are eligible. Maximum enrollment at the agency-level is n=30 EMS&#xD;
      agencies. Agencies will be randomized upon enrollment to one of two arms: [1] Intervention&#xD;
      group; or [2] the Wait-List control group. The intervention group will receive immediate&#xD;
      access to the intervention materials (the 10 brief Sleep Health Education Modules). The&#xD;
      wait-list control group will receive access to intervention materials at 3 months post&#xD;
      enrollment/baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each agency, the investigators will recruit individual EMS clinicians to participate.&#xD;
      Goal enrollment within each agency is a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 50 EMS clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individual EMS clinician participants will undergo informed consent, answer a baseline&#xD;
      survey, and be queried via mobile phone text message at regular intervals which will begin&#xD;
      upon enrollment. These mobile phone text message queries will assess indicators of sleep and&#xD;
      fatigue. All participants will be asked to answer two follow up surveys at 3 months and 6&#xD;
      months. The total duration of study participation is 6 months. The primary outcome of&#xD;
      interest is sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The&#xD;
      secondary outcome of interest is fatigue as measured by the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire&#xD;
      (CFQ).&#xD;
