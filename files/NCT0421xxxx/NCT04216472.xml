  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nab-paclitaxel and alpelisib works in treating patients&#xD;
      with triple negative breast cancer with PIK3CA or PTEN alterations that does not respond to&#xD;
      anthracycline chemotherapy (anthrocycline refractory). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Alpelisib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel and alpelisib before surgery may help shrink the tumor before surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if alpelisib in combination with nab-paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting&#xD;
      will improve rates of pathologic response (pathological complete response [pCR/RCB-0] or&#xD;
      minimal residual disease [RCB-I]) from 5% to 20% in patients with chemotherapy insensitive&#xD;
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with PIK3CA alterations (including PTEN loss). (Cohort&#xD;
      1) II. To determine if alpelisib in combination with nab-paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      setting will improve rates of pathologic response (pCR/RCB-0 or RCB-I) from 5% to 20% in&#xD;
      patients with chemotherapy insensitive TNBC with PTEN alterations. (Cohort 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the radiographic response rate for alpelisib in combination with nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      as measured by ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (partial response +&#xD;
      complete clinical response) in chemotherapy insensitive TNBC with PIK3CA (Cohort-1) or PTEN&#xD;
      (Cohort-2) alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine toxicity of alpelisib in combination with nab-paclitaxel given in the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant setting following anthracycline based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine progression free survival (PFS) at 3 years for patients treated with alpelisib&#xD;
      in combination with nab-paclitaxel given in the neoadjuvant setting in chemotherapy&#xD;
      insensitive TNBC with PIK3CA (Cohort-1) or PTEN (Cohort-2) alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess biomarkers of response and resistance to alpelisib and nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the role of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) allele fraction in&#xD;
      predicting response to alpelisib and nab-paclitaxel in early stage TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive alpelisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for&#xD;
      4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may then&#xD;
      undergo surgery to remove the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then&#xD;
      periodically until up to 3 years after surgery.&#xD;
