      The goal of this research study is identify new host response proteins, pathways and&#xD;
      mechanisms that are associated with responsiveness to GBM treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will serve as a tool for physicians when making treatment decisions. The investigators&#xD;
      also aim to identify the metabolic pathways that could lead to better therapeutic options.&#xD;
      The patients will be given their treatment according to the institute's standard of care. The&#xD;
      patients will provide up to 5 blood samples and clinical data will be collected from their&#xD;
      medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained from the blood samples and the medical records of the patients will be used&#xD;
      to search for potential mechanisms that are involved in response to treatment, and to&#xD;
      identify potential targets to increase the response, and hence, increase treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness or suggest potential new treatments.&#xD;
