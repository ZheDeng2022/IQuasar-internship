    <textblock>
      A parallel-group randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the efficacy of a mobile&#xD;
      health (m-Health) program on influencing diet, supplement use and physical activity during&#xD;
      pregnancy. Pregnant women will be randomly assigned to the intervention and the&#xD;
      non-intervention arm. The intervention arm will receive free of cost m-Health application&#xD;
      that will screen on the diet, supplement use and physical activity at enrollment and at 4&#xD;
      follow-ups, each 6 weeks apart. Based on the information provided by women, they will receive&#xD;
      personalised recommendations based on an algorithm developed using the World Health&#xD;
      Organization's guidelines on nutrition during pregnancy and American College of Obstetricians&#xD;
      and Gynaecologists guidelines for physical activity during pregnancy. The non-intervention&#xD;
      arm will receive standard face-face counselling. The changes in diet and supplement use of&#xD;
      both groups will be assessed using the Dietary Risk Score. Also, biochemical assessment of&#xD;
      micronutrients will be carried out on a subset. the change in physical activity will be&#xD;
      assessed by the mean duration of reported activity. The secondary outcomes include the&#xD;
      evaluation of compliance and usability of the m-Health application. Also, the effect of the&#xD;
      m-Health application on maternal, newborn and infant outcomes will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A parallel-group randomized controlled trial will be implemented with pregnant women at the&#xD;
      antenatal clinics of the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) Karachi. Pregnant women in their&#xD;
      first trimester, registered or planning to register at AKUH with access to personal&#xD;
      smartphones with internet connection will be considered eligible for the study. For pregnant&#xD;
      women in the intervention arm, mobile health application will be provided on their&#xD;
      smartphones that will screen their socio-demographic characteristics, diet and supplement use&#xD;
      and physical activity habits. Based on the information provided by women, personalized&#xD;
      recommendations and a dietary risk score will be generated upon completion of the&#xD;
      questionnaire. A similar process will be repeated on 4 follow-ups, each 6 weeks apart after&#xD;
      enrollment in the study. Also, push notifications consisting of tips and recommendations will&#xD;
      be sent to women a maximum of 3 times a week on dietary, supplement use and physical&#xD;
      activity. The women in the non-intervention arm will be provided with standard face-face&#xD;
      counselling at similar time points as of intervention group, using the bilingual educational&#xD;
      leaflet of the Aga Khan University Hospital &quot;Diet during Pregnancy&quot; and the American College&#xD;
      of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidelines for physical activity during pregnancy. The&#xD;
      primary outcome of the study is improvement in the dietary and supplement use that will be&#xD;
      assessed through Dietary Risk Score. A selective subset of participants from both the group&#xD;
      will undergo free of cost biochemical assessment micronutrients (serum calcium, vitamin D,&#xD;
      iron and folate). The secondary outcomes include assessing the compliance and usability of&#xD;
      m-Health application among the pregnant women enrolled in the intervention arm. Other&#xD;
      secondary outcomes include evaluating the effect of m-Health coaching on maternal, newborn&#xD;
      and infant outcomes among pregnant women in the intervention arm compared to the pregnant&#xD;
      women in the non-intervention arm&#xD;

    <measure>Dietary Risk Score (DRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, from enrollment till last follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary Risk Scores (DRSs) will be calculated based on the consumption of food items from six main food groups and will range from 0-18. Based on the portions and quality of diet, the score for each group will be 0, 1.5 or 3. The total score will be the sum of individual group scores. Higher the aggregate score, poorer the dietary quantity and quality and vice versa. Hence, a score of 18 will indicate a highly inadequate dietary intake; a score of 9 denotes nearly adequate and a score of 0, an adequate diet.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Supplement use Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, from enrollment till last follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Supplement use will be assessed by recording the frequency of consumption of folic acid, iron, calcium and vitamin D in the questionnaire. The frequency will be categorized as daily (7 days a week), often (4-6 days a week) and sometimes (1-3 days a week). Also, a total score ranging from 0-12 will be assigned where each supplement use will be scored 0 for daily, 1.5 for less than daily and 3 for no consumption. The total score will be the sum of each supplement score and will be monitored at each follow-up.</description>

Women will receive advice in the form of recommendations after completing the questionnaire. Also, push messages containing tips and recommendations for diet, supplement use and physical activity would be delivered a maximum of three times a week. Furthermore, a subset of participants would undergo objective dietary assessment through biochemical testing of serum folate, serum ferritin, and serum calcium and serum vitamin D at baseline and at end line.</description>
