  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gummy smile is one of the major esthetic problems nowadays; it is due to several causes that&#xD;
      either dental or skeletal. Etiology of the gummy smile is altered passive eruption, vertical&#xD;
      maxillary excess, different gingival enlargement conditions, deficient maxillary lip length&#xD;
      and excessive maxillary lip mobility, dento alveolar extrusion, combination of all these&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altered passive eruption is considered to be one of the most major causes, it is classified&#xD;
      into two types according to the location of the mucogingival junction with respect to the&#xD;
      bone crest and each type has two subtypes . Esthetic crown lengthening is the treatment of&#xD;
      choice for subtype B in both types as bone removal is mandatory to create a space for the&#xD;
      biological width.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the studies stated that there is some degree of relapse of the gingival tissues after&#xD;
      the procedures in the follow ups, that relapse was related to the biotype of the gingival&#xD;
      tissues, the flap placement close or far from the bone can be correlated to the suturing&#xD;
      technique used for closure of the tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigator's study comparing of two different suturing technique was done to&#xD;
      evaluated their effect on gingival tissue relapse, 30 patients (26 females and 4 males) were&#xD;
      divided between 2 groups each group consisted of 15 patients. In the first group periosteal&#xD;
      suturing technique was done in the second figure of eight (modified interrupted) suturing&#xD;
      technique was.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the tissue relapse was done through the assessment of the amount of the&#xD;
      attached gingival tissues level of gingival margin and marginal tissue contour before and&#xD;
      after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study showed that tissue relapse was more in the periosteal suturing&#xD;
      technique group that was related to the pressure on the tissues due to the fixation of the&#xD;
      suture at the periostium, the papillary tissue also showed more inflammation in the follow up&#xD;
      period prior to suture removal. The figure of eight group showed less relapse and tissue&#xD;
      inflammation as it prevents flap edge overlap and is tension free therefore better blood&#xD;
      supply to the tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were generally satisfied post-surgical with their smile, gingival tissue visibility&#xD;
      and teeth dimensions inspite of the relapse but it was better than prior to surgery. Also&#xD;
      they would recommend it to other patients complaining from the same problem.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thirty patients (26 females, 4 males), who were candidates for esthetic crown lengthening,&#xD;
      participated in this prospective clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (15 patients) (Periosteal suture) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esthetic crown lengthening procedure: internal bevel, sulcular and interdental incisions,&#xD;
      flap elevation, bone removal then External vertical mattress suture was done (periosteal&#xD;
      suture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (15 patients) (Figure of eight suture) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esthetic crown lengthening procedure: internal bevel, sulcular and interdental incisions,&#xD;
      flap elevation, bone removal then modified interrupted suture was done (Figure of eight&#xD;
      suture).&#xD;
