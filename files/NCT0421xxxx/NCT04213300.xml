  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the association between a low carbohydrate diet, quality&#xD;
      of life and glycaemic control in Australian adults with T1DM. The first phase of the study&#xD;
      will develop and validate a diabetes specific quality of life questionnaire for adults with&#xD;
      T1DM. The second phase will undertake a low carbohydrate diet intervention and examine its&#xD;
      association with quality of life and glycaemic control, pre and post the dietary&#xD;
      intervention. The novel outcomes will include a new validated Australian T1DM specific&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire and an investigation as to whether a low carbohydrate diet&#xD;
      mediates the relationship between quality of life and glycaemic control in Australian adults&#xD;
      with T1DM.&#xD;

      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To develop a reliable and valid diabetes specific quality of life questionnaire for use&#xD;
      in Australian adults living with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a new Australian diabetes specific quality of life online questionnaire&#xD;
           integrating participant feedback using a one to one interview method;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pilot the study developed online questionnaire with adults that have type 1 diabetes&#xD;
           mellitus and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conduct factorial validation of the study developed online questionnaire using advanced&#xD;
           statistical modelling techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the association between a low carbohydrate diet,&#xD;
      quality of life and glycaemic control in adults living with T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the association between quality of life and glycaemic control in adults with&#xD;
           T1DM;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implement a low carbohydrate diet in a cohort of adults living with T1DM;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the association between a low carbohydrate diet and glycaemic control in adults&#xD;
           with T1DM: pre and post intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine the association between quality of life and a low carbohydrate in adults with&#xD;
           T1DM: pre and post intervention and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Investigate whether a low carbohydrate diet mediates the relationship between quality of&#xD;
           life and glycaemic control in adults with T1DM.&#xD;
