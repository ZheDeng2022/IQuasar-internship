  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will assess the ability of daily consumption of two servings of California&#xD;
      strawberries to alter gut microbiome composition, leading to increased bile secretion and&#xD;
      decreased plasma cholesterol in a free-living population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, parallel design. Thirty&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to consume two servings of standardized freeze-dried strawberry&#xD;
      powder (2 x 13g) daily or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of follow up with beige&#xD;
      diet only to observe whether the effect can be sustained for 2 weeks. Blood will be collected&#xD;
      at baseline (week 0), weeks 4 and week 6 after strawberry consumption. On the day prior to&#xD;
      the study visits participants will collect a stool and a 24-hr urine sample and bring to the&#xD;
      lab. In addition, body weight and composition will be determined and questionnaires and 3-day&#xD;
      food record will be completed. Twenty-four hour urine content of pelargonidin glucuronide&#xD;
      will be measured for compliance. Plasma and fecal cholesterol and bile acids will be&#xD;
      determined at baseline (week 0) and weeks 4 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned an enrollment number after signing the informed consent form&#xD;
      approved by the UCLA Medical Internal Review Board. Subjects will undergo a physical exam,&#xD;
      complete medical history, and blood draw. A standard chem. panel will be performed at the&#xD;
      UCLA clinical laboratory. Eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study upon completion&#xD;
      of screening evaluations and will be randomized to the strawberry or placebo arm at their&#xD;
      baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in healthy free-living subjects (18-55 years). Subjects consume&#xD;
      13 grams standard strawberry powder in the morning and afternoon/evening or placebo powder&#xD;
      for 4 weeks. Subjects will be instructed to eat a beige diet (low fiber&lt;10g and low&#xD;
      polyphenols &lt;3 servings of polyphenol rich fruit/vegetables per day) during the entire study&#xD;
      period. 24 hr urine pelargonidin glucuronide will be measured at weeks 2 (baseline), 6 and 8&#xD;
      for compliance. In addition, pelargondin, ellagic acid, dimethylellagic acid glucuronide and&#xD;
      urolithin glucuronide will be measured in plasma and urine to determine strawberry&#xD;
      phytochemical bioavailability and intestinal/microbiome metabolic capacity. Participants will&#xD;
      meet with the dietitian for assessment of habitual dietary pattern and instructions on&#xD;
      maintain on a beige diet. A list of foods with high fiber and phenolic compounds will be&#xD;
      provided and subjects are instructed to follow the diet during the entirety of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized freeze-dried strawberry powder and a strawberry placebo powder provided by the&#xD;
      California Strawberry Commission will be used. Ten grams of freeze dried powder is equivalent&#xD;
      to about 110 g fresh fruit. One serving of fresh strawberry (one cup) is estimated to weigh&#xD;
      144 g and therefore is equivalent to 13 g of freeze dried powder. Subjects will consume two&#xD;
      packages of 13 g of strawberry powder per day. The powder can be mixed into beverages and&#xD;
      consumed with breakfast and dinner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strawberry powder ingredients include Individually Quick Frozen (IQF) strawberries. Placebo&#xD;
      powder ingredients include fructose, sucrose, dextrose, tapioca maltodextrin, modified food&#xD;
      starch, erythritol, cellulose gum, citric acid (anhydrous), N-C Strawberry Flavor Natual&#xD;
      WONF, xanthan gum, malic acid, sugar beet fiber, silicon dioxide, nat. strawberry-type&#xD;
      flavor, FD&amp;C Red #40, FD&amp;C Yellow 6, FD&amp;C Blue 2.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Typically consume low fiber/polyphenol diet (beige diet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eating a high fiber/polyphenol diet or taking any medication or dietary supplement&#xD;
             which interfere with the absorption of polyphenols.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of gastrointestinal surgery, diabetes mellitus on medications, or other&#xD;
             serious medical condition, such as chronic hepatic or renal disease, bleeding&#xD;

             coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty within 6 months prior to screening, current&#xD;
             diagnosis of uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic BP &gt;160mmHg, diastolic BP&#xD;
             &gt; 95mmHg), active or chronic gastrointestinal disorders, bulimia, anorexia, laxative&#xD;
             abuse, or endocrine diseases (except thyroid disease requiring medication) as&#xD;
             indicated by medical history or routine physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening laboratory value outside of the laboratory normal range that is considered&#xD;
             clinically significant for study participation by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is known HIV positive (subjects who are HIV positive are known to have high evels of&#xD;
