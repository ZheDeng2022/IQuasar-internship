  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pectus excavatum is the most common chest wall deformity in children, accounting for 90% of&#xD;
      all congenital chest wall deformities. It occurs in one to eight per 1000 live births. The&#xD;
      severity of the pectus deformity may become more noticeable during pubertal growth spurs and&#xD;
      repair is therefore usually performed in the teenage years. A common operative procedure to&#xD;
      repair a pectus deformity is the minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE). The&#xD;
      MIRPE involves the substernal placement of a contoured metal bar secured to the lateral&#xD;
      aspect of the ribs. This metal bar allows for correction of the concave deformity by applying&#xD;
      constant outward pressure to the underside of the sternum. Although the cosmetic results are&#xD;
      excellent, patients do report significant pain from the constant pressure exerted on the&#xD;
      chest wall from the metal bar. Pain management approaches tend to differ on both the provider&#xD;
      and institutional level. There is a lack of evidence regarding which postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      method is best. To address this research gap, this proposal aims to conduct a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trail using the three most commonly used methods; 1) patient controlled analgesia&#xD;
      (PCA); 2) erector spinae blocks (ESB) with continuous infusion pumps; and 3) video-assisted&#xD;
      intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pectus excavatum deformity is a common condition in a pediatric surgical practice. While&#xD;
      MIRPE provides excellent cosmetic results and is associated with shorter operative time and&#xD;
      lower intraoperative blood loss, the immediate correction of the concave deformity with a&#xD;
      metal bar places patients in a difficult pain control situation. While multiple postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia modalities have been studied, there is still a need for a large, prospective,&#xD;
      randomized trial that is appropriately powered to evaluate the best pain control modality&#xD;
      after MIRPE. Of the clinically appropriate interventions, ESB and INC have been shown to have&#xD;
      comparable LOS after the operation, especially when employed as part of an enhanced recovery&#xD;
      pathway (ERP) bundle. Comparing these newer analgesia modalities to the more established PCA&#xD;
      approach may help identify the most effective postoperative pain control approach that&#xD;
      maximizes the safety profile while minimizing the use of narcotic pain medications after&#xD;
      MIRPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of INC,&#xD;
      PCA and ESB with continuous local anesthetic infusion via a pain pump delivery system. All&#xD;
      groups will follow a multimodal enhanced recovery pathway. Groups will different only in the&#xD;
      use of INC, PCA, or ESB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since previous studies have reported similarly short LOS for both ESB and INC, but no&#xD;
      prospective, direct comparisons of these techniques have been done, we believe comparing&#xD;
      these two groups to the more established PCA modality will further advance the field of post&#xD;
      MIRPE pain management by providing precise estimates of length of stay (LOS), hospital&#xD;
      resource utilization, and other important outcomes that have not received sufficient&#xD;
      attention including pain, quality of life, resumption of activities of daily living, and a&#xD;
      rigorous survey for potential adverse outcomes. The investigators specifically hypothesize&#xD;
      that because of the long-term analgesia of up to 2-3 months, the INC group may experience not&#xD;
      only shorter LOS but decreased narcotic use than the ESB and PCA groups, and also improved&#xD;
      quality of life, with fewer encounters in the postoperative period (30 days) for pain related&#xD;
      concerns.&#xD;
