    <textblock>
      The placenta accreta is defined as a placenta that is abnormally adherent to the myometrium.&#xD;
      It can thus invade the entire thickness of the myometrium (placenta increta) or even exceed&#xD;
      the serosa and invade neighboring organs (placenta percreta). It is a rare obstetric&#xD;
      pathology with significant morbidity, and its management most often requires hemostatic&#xD;
      hysterectomy. Its frequency has increased significantly in recent decades due to the&#xD;
      increased rate of caesareans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maternity center of Tunis ( CMNT ) is a level 3 maternity center, supporting over 12 000&#xD;
      births yearly, where the caesarean section's rate is very high, close to 45% of deliveries.&#xD;
      Recently we noted an increase in abnormal placental invasion incidence : in 2018, we report&#xD;
      over 60 cases of placenta accreta,increta and percreta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection of these patients can help reduce potential risks. Ultrasound and MRI are the&#xD;
      main diagnostic tools, but each one has weaknesses. Biological approch of this diagnosis is&#xD;
      not well studied. Recently, BNP has been shown to be associated with increased angiogenesis.&#xD;
      Because placenta accreta is characterized by abnormal uteroplacental neovascularization, it&#xD;
      has been hypothesized that serum BNP levels may be related to abnormal invasion of the&#xD;
      placenta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, only one study investigated the relationship between cardiac biomarkers&#xD;
      (Pro-BNP, CK, CK-MB and troponins) and abnormalities of placental adhesion. The main&#xD;
      conclusion was that the Pro-BNP could predict placental accretisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the BNP as a mean of screening, could enrich our diagnostic arsenal. The purpose of our&#xD;
      study is to determine whether or not BNP can predict abnormal placental invasion during&#xD;
      pregnany.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a monocentric , prospective, observational study, including 60&#xD;
      pregnant women, with history of at least one previous uterine scar, and scheduled for&#xD;
      cesarian delivery. The participants will be divided into 3 equal groups according to the&#xD;
      imaging data obtained by a senior ultrasonographer , and the MRI data when necessary :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonography will be performed in all participants. If placenta previa is diagnosed,&#xD;
      without any suggestive signs of abnormal placental invasion, the patient is assigned to group&#xD;
      P.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If placenta previa is diagnosed, and associated to suggestive signs of abnormal placental&#xD;
      invasion,the patient is assigned to group I and an MRI will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the ultrasonography is free of any suggestive signs of placenta previa, the patient is&#xD;
      assigned to group N.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group P : pregnant women with placenta previa on ultrasound and no suggestive signs of&#xD;
           abnormal placental invasion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group I : pregnant women with placenta previa on ultrasound, and suggestive signs of&#xD;
           abnormal placental invasion on ultrasound .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group N : pregnant women without suggestive signs of placenta previa or abnormal&#xD;
           placental invasion on ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written and informed consent are obtained, a standard battery of blood tests including&#xD;
      serum BNP will be runned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every patient, the following will be recorded : anthropometric measurements, previous&#xD;
      obstetric and medical history, emergency or elective surgery, anesthetic technique,&#xD;
      per-operative findings (placenta previa, placenta previa with abnormal placental invasion&#xD;
      (accreta, increta, percreta), placenta normally located), amount of blood products&#xD;
      transfused, nature of haemostasis procedures, complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded, if their condition may cause a rise in serum BNP during the sample&#xD;
      collection, those being: preterm premature rupture of membranes, acute anaemia or&#xD;
      metrorrhagia, active labor, severe infections, arterial hypertension, known pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, symptoms of heart failure, known hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
      history of valvular or congenital heart disease, atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias,&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney failure or renal&#xD;
      dysfonction, liver dysfonction, severe metabolic and hormone abnormalities ( thyrotoxicosis&#xD;
      or diabetic ketosis ), drug use possibly affecting cardiovascular system ( beta-blocker or&#xD;
      other cardiovascular drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timing of delivery is usually between 36 and 37 weeks for group P and I, and after 38&#xD;
      weeks for group N.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be performed in pregnant women from group I and P. Regional&#xD;
      anesthesia will be performed in pregnant women from group N.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic management during anesthesia for group I will require placement of 2 peripheral&#xD;
      large-bore venous access, a desilet catheter in the femoral vein, and an arterial line&#xD;
      preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients from group P, 2 peripheral large-bore venous access will be placed&#xD;
      preoperatively. A desilet catheter and arterial line will be obtained if necessary upon the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients from group N, 1 peripheral large-bore venous access will be placed prior to the&#xD;
      beginning of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood transfusion requirements will be based on the hemodynamic status, the amount of blood&#xD;
      loss, the need of catecholamines and the anesthesiologist's experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peroperatively, final diagnosis will be made according to surgical findings. If placenta is&#xD;
      completely and easily removed, the diagnosis of abnormal placental invasion will not be&#xD;
      retained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If placenta could not be easily and completely removed, the diagnosis of abnormal placental&#xD;
      invasion in established, and the case is carried out according to our surgical and anesthetic&#xD;
      standards of management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting all groups, blood samples will be analysed for BNP, in a unique serie of&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
