    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, prospective, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of PARP inhibitor niraparib combined with oral etoposide chemotherapy in women with&#xD;
      platinum resistant or refractory recurrent ovarian cancer. Subjects will receive niraparib&#xD;
      and oral etoposide in 30-day treatment cycles. After 6-8 cycles, oral etoposide will be&#xD;
      discontinued. Subjects will receive niraparib alone until disease progression, intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity or withdrawal of informed consent. The primary endpoint is progression free survival&#xD;
      evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include overall response rate , duration of response, disease control rate, CA125 response&#xD;
      rate and safety.&#xD;
