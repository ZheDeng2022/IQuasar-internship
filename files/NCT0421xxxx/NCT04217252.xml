      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical value of high throughput sequencing of&#xD;
      infectious pathogens for patients with severe infection, and to establish foundation for high&#xD;
      throughput sequencing to be the clinical routine infection pathogen examination. This study&#xD;
      is a diagnostic study, and the sample size is 320 cases. 320 participants from the department&#xD;
      of hematology and intensive care unit who meet the inclusion criteria are randomly divided&#xD;
      into the control group and the experimental group with 160 cases in each group. Both the&#xD;
      participants of the control group and the experimental group undergo routine clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis methods and treatment. In addition, the participants of the experimental group are&#xD;
      collected the samples including whole blood, cerebrospinal fluid or alveolar lavage fluid&#xD;
      required for high throughput sequencing of infectious pathogens during sample collection for&#xD;
      routine pathogenic examination of infection. The pathogen diagnosis rate and the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy rate between the conventional infectious pathogen tests and the high throughput&#xD;
      sequencing of infectious pathogens will be compared in the experimental group. By gathering&#xD;
      statistics of consultation hours and cost efficiency, the effect of high throughput&#xD;
      sequencing of infectious pathogens on the diagnosis and treatment efficiency of the&#xD;
      experimental group and the control group will be compared, and through these indicators,&#xD;
      clinical application value for the diagnosis of severe infection patients by high throughput&#xD;
      sequencing of infectious pathogens can be evaluated.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical value of high throughput sequencing of&#xD;
      infectious pathogens for patients with severe infection, and to establish foundation for high&#xD;

&#xD;
      This study is a diagnostic study, and the sample size is 320 cases. 320 participants from the&#xD;
      department of hematology and intensive care unit who meet the inclusion criteria are randomly&#xD;
      divided into the control group and the experimental group with 160 cases in each group. Both&#xD;
      the participants of the control group and the experimental group undergo routine clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis methods and treatment. In addition, the participants of the experimental group are&#xD;
      collected the samples including whole blood, cerebrospinal fluid or alveolar lavage fluid&#xD;
      required for high throughput sequencing of infectious pathogens during sample collection for&#xD;
      routine pathogenic examination of infection. For the experimental group participants, the&#xD;
      clinicians will comprehensively determine the follow-up diagnosis methods and treatment&#xD;
      according to the clinical routine infection pathogen tests results combining with the results&#xD;
      of high throughput sequencing of infectious pathogen, while the control group participants&#xD;
      proceed to undergo follow-up diagnosis methods and treatment according to the results of the&#xD;
      clinical routine infection pathogen examination. If the results of high throughput sequencing&#xD;
      of infectious pathogens of the test group are inconsistent with the results of clinical&#xD;
      routine infection pathogen examination, the follow-up diagnosis and treatment of the&#xD;
      participants will be based on the results of clinical routine infection pathogen examination&#xD;
      with priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For sample size assessment, we have predicted the pathogen diagnosis rate of routine clinical&#xD;
      pathogen detection methods and high-throughput sequencing of infectious pathogens (α=0.05,&#xD;
      β=0.10 (power=0.9)), considering that the maximum rate of missing cases was 20%, and finally&#xD;
      got the sample content. And this study will include all subjects selected and randomized into&#xD;
      a full analysis set under the intent-to-treat principle. After excluding participants with&#xD;
      insufficient sample, withdrawing from the trial midway, giving up treatment and leaving the&#xD;
      hospital, or lost to follow-up, the remaining participants will be included in the protocol&#xD;
      set under the per-protocol principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for statistical analysis, the pathogen diagnosis rate and the diagnostic accuracy rate&#xD;
      between the conventional infectious pathogen tests and the high throughput sequencing of&#xD;
      infectious pathogens will be compared in the experimental group. By gathering statistics of&#xD;
      consultation hours and cost efficiency, the effect of high throughput sequencing of&#xD;
      infectious pathogens on the diagnosis and treatment efficiency of the experimental group and&#xD;
      the control group will be compared, and through these indicators, clinical application value&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of severe infection patients by high throughput sequencing of infectious&#xD;
      pathogens can be evaluated.&#xD;
