      In seeking to understand the capacity for psilocybin to reduce migraine headache burden, this&#xD;
      study will investigate single and repeated dosing of psilocybin up to two doses. In seeking&#xD;
      to identify an underlying mechanism in psilocybin's effects, neuroinflammatory markers for&#xD;
      migraine headache will be measured.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Migraine headache is a common medical condition and a top cause of disability worldwide.&#xD;
      Treatment options for migraine headache are many and varied, though an approximated 10% of&#xD;
      migraineurs is refractory to medication and thus, there is a need to develop alternative&#xD;
      treatments. There is anecdotal evidence supporting lasting therapeutic effects after limited&#xD;
      dosing of psilocybin and related compounds in headache disorders. The cause of this unique&#xD;
      effect remains unknown, though the drug class has demonstrable anti-inflammatory activity, a&#xD;
      biological process relevant to migraine and other headache disorders. In seeking to&#xD;
      understand the capacity for psilocybin to reduce migraine headache burden, this study will&#xD;
      investigate single and repeated dosing of psilocybin up to two doses. In seeking to identify&#xD;
      an underlying mechanism in psilocybin's effects, neuroinflammatory markers for migraine&#xD;
      headache will be measured. The results from this study will serve in the development of&#xD;
      larger investigations seeking to understand the effects of psilocybin and related compounds&#xD;
      in headache disorders.&#xD;
