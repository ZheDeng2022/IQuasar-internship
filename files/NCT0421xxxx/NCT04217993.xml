    <textblock>
      This phase IIB, open-label, multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral&#xD;
      Jaktinib Hydrochloride Tablets in Intermediate-risk and High-risk Myelofibrosis and&#xD;
      Previously Treated With Ruxolitinib. The experiment is divided into two parts: dose&#xD;
      exploration and extended research.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      dose exploration: It is planned to enroll about 6 subjects. According to the baseline value&#xD;
      of platelet count at the time of enrollment, different doses (100mg Qd or 150mg Qd or 200mg&#xD;
      Qd or 100mg Bid) of Jaktinib Hydrochloride Tablets will be Treated. The trial is in progress&#xD;
      Adjust the dose according to relevant laboratory indicators. When at least one subject has a&#xD;
      spleen volume reduction of ≥35% from the baseline, the sponsor and the investigator will&#xD;
      jointly decide whether to enter the extended study part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended research: It is planned to enroll about 43 subjects, and the initial dosage of&#xD;
      Jaktinib Hydrochloride Tablets is planned to be 100mg Bid.&#xD;
