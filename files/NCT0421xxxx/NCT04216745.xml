      Under physiological conditions, bile is sterile. Major factors maintaining sterility of bile&#xD;
      are a competent sphincter of Oddi and antegrade flow of bile. Other factors are bile salts in&#xD;
      the bile duct, Kupffer cells and tight junctions between the hepatocytes that guard against&#xD;
      bacteria getting in from the portal circulation. Any break in these physiological barriers&#xD;
      leads to infection of the bile. The main source of infection in most cases is the duodenum.&#xD;
      Hematogenous spread through the portal venous flow is another route. In addition, bile duct&#xD;
      obstruction e.g., stone, is associated with bacterial colonization within the stagnant bile&#xD;
      and with increasing biliary pressure, bacteria may translocate into the circulation causing a&#xD;
      systemic infection .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients without stone disease, previous biliary intervention is associated with high&#xD;
      rates of infection. Bacteremia as a complication of biliary intervention tends to occur in&#xD;
      patients with obstructed bile flow, especially those who have previously undergone orthotopic&#xD;
      liver transplantation (OLT), surgery to the biliary tree, sphincterotomy, or placement of a&#xD;
      biliary stent. The risk of systemic infection is high when adequate biliary drainage has not&#xD;
      been achieved after intervention, which typically involves endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute cholangitis is acute inflammation and infection in the bile duct. It is diagnosed in&#xD;
      6-9% of patients with gallstone disease and 1-3% after ERCP. It can progress from a local&#xD;
      biliary infection to advanced systemic disease with sepsis and multiple organ dysfunctions&#xD;
      with significant mortality rates (10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbial infection causing acute cholangitis is mainly bacteria and fungi. Despite blood&#xD;
      cultures provide an opportunity to detect the causative organism, they remain negative in&#xD;
      more than half of the cases with cholangitis. The growth is often mono-microbial organism,&#xD;
      predominantly Gram-negative organisms. However, bile cultures often have a poly-microbial&#xD;
      growth especially in patients with an indwelling biliary stent where, Gram-negative bacteria,&#xD;
      in particular Escherichia coli, are the most common pathogens isolated from infected bile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fungal infection of the biliary tract increase in the last years and can lead to biliary&#xD;
      obstruction. The most common fungal infection in biliary tract is candidiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the rapid development of multi-drug resistant organisms, the choice of appropriate&#xD;
      empiric antimicrobial therapy has become more complicated. Thus, knowledge of the common&#xD;
      etiologic agents and their local susceptibility profile is essential to ensure the&#xD;
      appropriate choice and timely administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;
