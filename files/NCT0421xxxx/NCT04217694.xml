    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies the feasibility of giving memantine for the reduction of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment after radiation therapy in pediatric patients with central nervous&#xD;
      system tumors. Memantine may reduce the effects of radiation therapy on memory and thinking.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility of twice daily memantine started before radiation therapy (RT)&#xD;
      and one month after RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility of twice daily (BID) memantine started before RT and continued&#xD;
      3 and 6 months after RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the change in neurocognitive function (NCF) as found by formal neurocognitive&#xD;
      testing between baseline and 12 months post-RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the change in NCF between baseline and the end of RT, 3,and 6 months after RT&#xD;
      using both neuropsychological testing and the CogState exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate changes in quantitative volumetric brain imaging using Neuroquant software&#xD;
      analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging before and 12 months after radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To correlate cognitive changes detected by CogState composite score and formal&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Disease-free (of primary tumor) and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive memantine orally (PO) BID beginning at the time of study enrollment (no&#xD;
      later than 1st day of RT) up to 6 months after completion of standard of care RT in the&#xD;
      absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients also complete CogState cognitive testing at&#xD;
      baseline, at completion of RT, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after completion of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

    <description>Will be summarized and reported descriptively. This will be assessed using results from neurocognitive testing. Differences between scores from baseline and 12 months post-RT will be calculated, along with corresponding 90% confidence intervals. Change index (reliable change index [RCI]) will be calculated as well over this time period. A paired t-test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used as applicable. Additional analyses concerning change in NCF using additional subscales from the results of neurocognitive testing may be performed, but will be hypothesis generating and considered exploratory. These may include the use of other neurocognitive testing subscales using t-tests or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, variations of RCI, and linear regression to assess the relationship of each subscale with changes in NCF.</description>

    <description>Determined by the CogState composite score. Will be summarized and compared to baseline values. A paired t-test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used as applicable. Additional analyses concerning NCF at or between various time points may be performed, but will be hypothesis generating and considered exploratory. These may include comparisons of NCF between baseline and the end of RT, 3 months, and 12 months post-RT using a t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as well as creation of a linear mixed model to longitudinally assess changes over time. Subscales of the results from the CogState may also be used for these analyses.</description>
