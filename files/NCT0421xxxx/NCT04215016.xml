  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, dose escalation, phase I study, aiming to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Autologous Humanized Anti-CD19 and Anti-CD20 Dual Specific Chimeric&#xD;
      Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells in patient with relapsed or refractory diffuse B cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD19 CAR-T cell therapy has made breakthroughs in the treatment of B cell lymphoma and&#xD;
      leukemia, but 30% of patients still have antigen escape, which may be related to variants in&#xD;
      tumor cells and the expansion of CD19-negative tumor cells after treatment with CD19 CAR-T&#xD;
      cells. CD19/CD20 bispecific CAR-T cell targeting multiple antigens can attack tumor cells&#xD;
      while overcoming tumor antigen escape caused by a single target, maximizing efficacy and&#xD;
      duration of treatment, and can also solve the problem of uneven distribution or low&#xD;
      expression of single target on the tumor surface.&#xD;
