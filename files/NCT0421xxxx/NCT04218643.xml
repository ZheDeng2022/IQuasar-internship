  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This comparative treatment study aims to challenge a current clinical practice. Specifically,&#xD;
      whether the use of ultrasound-guided peripheral intravenous catheter insertion results in&#xD;
      lower post insertion failure rates with longer utility time compared to peripheral&#xD;
      intravenous catheters (PIVC) inserted in the standard manner during the emergency department&#xD;
      (ED), observation and in-patient stay. There are two secondary aims to the study: a)&#xD;
      determining if ultrasound-guided peripheral intravenous catheter insertion results in lower&#xD;
      post removal complication rates compared to PIVCs inserted in the standard manner; and b)&#xD;
      determining if catheter-to-vein ratio can predict post insertion success of PIVCs and what&#xD;
      catheter-to-vein ratio is most successful. In this study, catheter-to-vein ratio is defined&#xD;
      as the diameter of the lumen of the vein divided by the outside diameter of the catheter.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized prospective trial comparing US-guided PIVC insertion with standard&#xD;
      PIVC insertion technique. This study will evaluate the predictive strength of&#xD;
      catheter-to-vein ratio to PIVC post insertion success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is all patients presenting to the ED. The sample population will be&#xD;
      patients requiring a PIVC for treatment or diagnostic purposes and don't have an existing&#xD;
      PIVC (EMS or other). Inclusion and exclusion criteria focusing on most suitable participants&#xD;
      and safety will determine the participant population. Participants will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of two cohorts; 1) PIVC insertion based on standard technique and 2) US-guided PIVC&#xD;
      insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two data collection phases in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase one occurs in the emergency department (ED). ED staff will be notified of the study&#xD;
      period, however to minimize bias, details of the study will not be given. Patients in this&#xD;
      phase include those registered in the ED seeking treatment. To identify potential candidates,&#xD;
      the investigator will perform an initial screening by communicating with ED staff. Initial&#xD;
      screenings will be recorded without using any identifying data. When a potential participant&#xD;
      is identified, the investigator will then coordinate with ED staff, approach the candidate&#xD;
      and confirm that they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the patient qualifies for&#xD;
      enrollment, the investigator will review the study purpose including risks and benefits of&#xD;
      enrolling, and have the patient sign the consent form. Randomization will occur after&#xD;
      obtaining consent. Patients will have a PIVC inserted by any qualified Nurse or Medic. The&#xD;
      PIVC will be placed according to the Reading Hospital Peripheral Intravenous Therapy for&#xD;
      Adults guideline. After the PIVC (Standard or US-guided) is inserted, the investigator will&#xD;
      then measure the vein prior to any infusion that could distort vein measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All investigators involved with vein measurement will complete vein measurement training. The&#xD;
      vein size will be measured using one of the following US machines: SonoSite Edge II or&#xD;
      X-Porte each equipped with a 13-6 MHz, 6 cm linear probe (FUJIFILM SonoSite, Inc. Bothell,&#xD;
      WA, USA). The investigator will then record collected data on the phase one data collection&#xD;
      form and place the form in a secure container. A member of the research team will then&#xD;
      collect the completed data collection forms and enter the data in a secured study database.&#xD;
      To limit bias, investigators will not inform the ED staff of the specifics of this study and&#xD;
      will only provide enough information for data to be collected safely and accurately. In the&#xD;
      event that a PIVC could not be successfully inserted according to the randomized technique,&#xD;
      the PIVC will be analyzed in an intention to treat (ITT) format and the participant will&#xD;
      receive vascular access as per the treatment team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase two of data collection is divided into two parts, and participants in this phase&#xD;
      include those that had a PIVC inserted by either randomized method and were subsequently&#xD;
      placed in an observation status, inpatient status or discharged home. Phase two part one&#xD;
      occurs after the PIVC has been removed. Data collection is performed electronically and may&#xD;
      also involve verbal follow up. Trained investigators will obtain an active list of subjects&#xD;
      whose PIVC was removed. Each subject will have a blank phase two part one data collection&#xD;
      form completed in its entirety when possible. Subjects who remain on an inpatient or&#xD;
      observation status will be followed in the electronic health record (EHR). In this study post&#xD;
      insertion failure is identified when any of the following reasons for PIVC removal has been&#xD;
      entered into the participants EHR: leakage, drainage, phlebitis, painful, occluded,&#xD;
      infiltrated, and catheter damage. If more than one of these reasons has been entered, the&#xD;
      investigator will further investigate the EHR to determine the primary reason for removal. If&#xD;
      electronic data is not sufficient and the subject is still hospitalized, the investigator&#xD;
      will attempt to visit the subject for completion of data collection. Completed phase two part&#xD;
      one forms will be placed in a secure container until entry into the study database. Following&#xD;
      data entry, paper forms involved in this part will be destroyed. Subjects with a PIVC that&#xD;
      was removed for a reason not determined as a failure will proceed into phase two part two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase two part two occurs when a PIVC was removed without complication. A trained&#xD;
      investigator will obtain a list of subjects whose PIVC was removed without complication. The&#xD;
      investigator will determine if 48 hours has passed since the removal of the PIVC. If so, a&#xD;
      post removal follow-up interview is performed if the patient is still admitted in the&#xD;
      hospital or a phone interview is conducted if the patient was discharged home. Participant&#xD;
      charts will also be reviewed for any subsequent ED or primary care physician visits related&#xD;
      to PIVC complication(s). The investigator completes the phase two part two data collection&#xD;
      form and places it in a secured container. A time limit of 48 hours to contact the&#xD;
      participant has been set for this study. A member of the research team will then collect the&#xD;
      data collection forms and enter the data in the secured study database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline failure rate for post-insertion PIVCs at Reading Hospital is 30%. Our study has&#xD;
      set an a priori improvement of an absolute percentage change of 10% as significant. Using a&#xD;
      single tail change in improvement (alpha = 0.025) with the intervention with an 80% power, we&#xD;
      calculated the number needed for each cohort to be 291 subjects, however we will randomize&#xD;
      for 360 in each cohort for a total of 720 subjects to allow for attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the statistical package 'R', a series of random numbers will be generated to allocate&#xD;
      individual patients to groups. This random number series will be validated for randomness&#xD;
      using the 'runs test' available in SPSS. A conservative P value of 0.50 will be used to&#xD;
      determine if the sequence of numbers is random. Randomization will continue until a sequence&#xD;
      with a p-value greater than 0.50 is obtained. Once completed, the random number sequence will&#xD;
      be saved to an Excel file and passed to Reading Hospital researchers for processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will occur in two separate phases. First descriptive analysis for all variables&#xD;
      for patients within each group. For this analysis discrete variables will be reported as&#xD;
      count, and percent within each category. For continuous variables statistics will include&#xD;
      mean, minimum and maximum values, standard deviation and median. Significance testing will be&#xD;
      conducted between groups. Discrete variables will use chi-square test and continuous&#xD;
      variables will use group or independent t-test. An a priori p-value of 0.050 will determine&#xD;
      statistical significance between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of this analysis will include inferential statistics on the comparison&#xD;
      between groups for both primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes to be compared between the PIVC insertion techniques include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Failure rate (overall and individual cause/reason).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Utility time&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Catheter-to-vein ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of failure rate chi-square analysis will be used between the two groups.&#xD;
      Utility time will be analyzed by group t-test. Catheter to vein ratio will be aggregated&#xD;
      among all patients within group and a rate analysis defined by Fleiss will be used to&#xD;
      determine if the ratios between treatment cohorts are significantly different. A standard&#xD;
      p-value of 0.05 will be used for these analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe post removal complication rates among traditional and US-guided PIVC insertion&#xD;
           techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identifying a catheter-to-vein ratio that predicts complication&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complication rate will be analyzed by standard rate analysis by Fleiss. Complication&#xD;
      rates will be calculated as the number of complication divided by the number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine the catheter to vein ratio that may predict a complication, both groups&#xD;
      will be added together in aggregate, and a ROC curve will be calculated using the catheter to&#xD;
      vein ratio as the independent variable and the complication (0, 1) as the dependent variable.&#xD;
      Standard methodology to determine the cutoff point will be used, (diagonal line drawn to ROC&#xD;
      curve then projected down to sensitivity value) to determine the cutoff point. Standard ROC&#xD;
      descriptive statistics will be used including area under the curve, standard error of the&#xD;
      area, 95% confidence interval of the area, p-value as well as sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      the cutoff value. The null hypothesis for the ROC curve will be area is equal to 0.50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the exploratory nature of these analysis there will be no corrections for multiple&#xD;
      comparisons.&#xD;
