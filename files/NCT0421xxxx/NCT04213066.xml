  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Taiwan's population with amblyopia is 2-5%. Amblyopia affects the daily&#xD;
      life and learning ability. The human visual system can be developed normally with exposure of&#xD;
      clear images on the retina, which often drive the development and projection of optic nerves&#xD;
      progressively. In general, the visual acuity progresses gradually with age. A normal vision&#xD;
      is relatively mature until 8 years old. Several types of amblyopia (strabismic amblyopia,&#xD;
      refractive amblyopia, and deprivation amblyopia) are identified. The refractive amblyopia and&#xD;
      deprivation amblyopia must be corrected by wearing glasses or surgeries. Otherwise, amblyopia&#xD;
      is often corrected by occlusion of the dominant eye or amblyopia training. The Cambridge&#xD;
      Stimulator (CAM) with rotating grating is commonly used in clinic in Taiwan. The principle of&#xD;
      the CAM allows subjects to draw pictures on the plate in coincidence with occlusion of the&#xD;
      dominant eye. The parents have to go with their children to a hospital weekly. The CAM&#xD;
      training is a stereotyped visuomotor behavior, which usually causes fatigue and uninteresting&#xD;
      results for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, some computer games have been incorporated with CAM training. However, their&#xD;
      clinical impact on amblyopia is largely unknown. Moreover, most of studies don't have&#xD;
      long-term tracking, and they only use limited assessments. In this project, a home-based&#xD;
      training would be built for children with amblyopia. A CAM training with a hierarchical&#xD;
      structure with story-based organization would be implemented in the tablet. It will save time&#xD;
      for children and parents for traffic between the home and hospital. The CAM training with&#xD;
      organized structure would increase acceptability and create subjects' motivation for&#xD;
      long-term training. In addition, a stochastic resonance theory would be incorporated with the&#xD;
      CAM training to potentiate the learning curve of a visuomotor skill in young children. Five&#xD;
      systematic assessments, including visual acuity, grating acuity, contrast sensitivity, and 2&#xD;
      measurements of visual evoked potentials (VEPs), would be used. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that the rotating grating stimulation and stochastic resonance stimulation&#xD;
      groups showed significant enhancement of the visual functions compared with the control group&#xD;
      and performance of the VEPs toward better eye through the home-based training apparatus.&#xD;
