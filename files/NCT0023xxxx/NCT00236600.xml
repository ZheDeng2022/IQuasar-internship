      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of topiramate 96mg and 192mg&#xD;
      daily) with placebo in the treatment of obesity following an intensive non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      weight loss program.&#xD;

      Although dietary modification coupled with increased exercise is the preferred treatment of&#xD;
      obesity, these lifestyle changes alone are often insufficient in achieving and maintaining&#xD;
      weight reduction in obese patients. Topiramate is not approved for the treatment of obesity.&#xD;
      This double-blind, placebo controlled study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      topiramate in maintaining weight loss achieved by an intensive non-drug weight reduction&#xD;
      program. Enrolled patients will undergo run-in phase (8 weeks of intensive non-drug weight&#xD;
      reduction therapy consisting of a low calorie diet, a behavioral modification program, and an&#xD;
      exercise program). Those patients who achieve weight loss of &gt;= 8% of enrollment body weight&#xD;
      and meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized to either 96mg or 192mg of&#xD;
      topiramate, or placebo. After 8 weeks of dose titration, the patients will receive one year&#xD;
      of treatment. Effectiveness will be assessed by body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), number&#xD;
      and proportion of 5%, 10% and 15% weight loss responders, number and proportion of patients&#xD;
      who maintain 50%, 75%, and 100% of weight lost during run-in phase, waist and hip&#xD;
      circumferences, fasting lipid profile, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, fasting insulin,&#xD;
      two-hour glucose tolerance test, uric acid level, blood pressure, body composition,&#xD;
      echocardiography, and Health Related Quality of Life scores. Safety evaluations (incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events, electrocardiograms, vital signs, etc) will be performed throughout the study.&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that topiramate is more effective than placebo in maintaining weight&#xD;
      reduction in obese patients following intensive non-drug weight reduction program. During the&#xD;
      initial 8 weeks, the doses of topiramate or placebo will be gradually increased to the target&#xD;
      doses (either 96mg or 192mg) daily by mouth and the doses will be maintained for one year.&#xD;
