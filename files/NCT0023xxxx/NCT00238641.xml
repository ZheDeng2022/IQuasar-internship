  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In children with cerebral palsy, stiffness of the arm can develop early and delay or prevent&#xD;
      the acquisition of normal hand skills. Improvement in functional use of the hand may&#xD;
      therefore be dependent upon early treatment of upper extremity hypertonia. We propose to test&#xD;
      a series of injections of Myobloc™ in a non-randomized one-way crossover pilot clinical trial&#xD;
      and dose-finding study, with clinical assessments and blinded video evaluations. Ten children&#xD;
      age 2-17 years with increased tone at the elbow or wrist will be expected to complete the&#xD;
      study. A 1-month baseline evaluation period will be followed by an injection of low-dose&#xD;
      Myobloc™ to affected muscle(s) of the arm according to standardized per-kilogram dosing with&#xD;
      a maximum of 25U/kg in each affected arm. Three months later, a second injection of up to&#xD;
      50U/kg will be performed in each affected arm. Three months after the second dose, a third&#xD;
      dose of up to 100U/kg will be performed in each affected arm. Neurological assessments will&#xD;
      be performed at study entry, prior to each injection, and at 1 and 3 months following each&#xD;
      injection. Routine physical therapy and non-study medications will be continued during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Subjects: 10 subjects age 2-17 years with hypertonia affecting one or both upper extremities,&#xD;
      but without injections of neuromuscular blocking agents for six months prior to enrollment,&#xD;
      or surgery on the upper extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Injection of Myobloc™ in 2 sites per muscle for up to two muscles of each upper&#xD;
      extremity (biceps, brachioradialis), at a maximum dose of 25Units/kg/arm for the first&#xD;
      injection, a maximum of 50Units/kg/arm for the second injection, and a maximum of&#xD;
      100Units/kg/arm for the third injection. If there is significant weakness or worsening of&#xD;
      function following any injection, the dose will not be increased for subsequent injections.&#xD;
      Injections will be performed after placement of topical anesthetic (ELA-MAX™ cream), using&#xD;
      EMG guidance to identify active muscles contributing to hypertonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the time it takes to complete&#xD;
      maximum arm extension during voluntary reaching, measured from the coraco-acromial joint to&#xD;
      the midpoint of the dorsum of the wrist. Change scores will be calculated between intake and&#xD;
      1 month (baseline effect), 1 month and 2 months (first injection effect), 4 months and 5&#xD;
      months (second injection effect), and 7 months and 8 months (third injection effect). A&#xD;
      device called a Shape Tape (Measureand, Inc.) will be used to measure this outcome. Shape&#xD;
      Tape is a flexible strip of portable spring steel with optic fiber that provides&#xD;
      instantaneous readouts to a portable computer of bends and twists and other forms of movement&#xD;
      capture that can be conducted in a clinical setting. The Shape Tape is fastened loosely to&#xD;
      the body part under measurement (in this case, the subject's wrist and shoulder) with either&#xD;
      medical-grade adhesive tape or Velcro. The shapetape is connected to a portable computer, and&#xD;
      custom software allows measurement of the average velocity of hand movement during reaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures: The rater will compare improvement or worsening in global arm&#xD;
      function through the Unified Dystonia Rating Scale (UDRS), the motor subscale of the Unified&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease rating scale (UPDRS), and the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia scale (BFM).&#xD;
      Comparisons will be performed between intake and 1 month (baseline effect), 1 month and 2&#xD;
      months (first injection effect), 4 months and 5 months (second injection effect), and 7&#xD;
      months and 8 months (third injection effect). Other secondary measures include neurological&#xD;
      examination, Ashworth spasticity scale, and comparisons of numerical stiffness measures as&#xD;
      measured by the Rigidity Analyzer Device. A parent rating scale, the Pediatric Quality of&#xD;
      Life Inventory (PedsQL), will be used to determine overall functional improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The outcomes will be tested at the 0.05 level of significance using&#xD;
      repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Friedman nonparametric test applied to&#xD;
      the 4 repeated change scores for each of the primary and secondary outcome measures. Tests of&#xD;
      significance for the secondary measures will be corrected for multiple comparisons.&#xD;
