    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document the long term safety of a long-acting injectable&#xD;
      formulation of risperidone in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia who have&#xD;
      previously been treated with long-acting risperidone. Efficacy will also be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, long-term study of a flexible dose of a long-acting injectable&#xD;
      formulation of risperidone (risperidone LAI) injected into the muscle at 2 week intervals for&#xD;
      at least 12 months in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. It is an extension of an open&#xD;
      label study of patients with schizophrenia (RIS-USA-259) switching from treatment with an&#xD;
      oral antipsychotic medication to long-acting injectable risperidone. Safety evaluations&#xD;
      include incidence of adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
      (biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), electrocardiograms (ECGs), and Extrapyramidal&#xD;
      Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), a scale for assessing muscle tone, gait, and abnormal movements.&#xD;
      Efficacy assessments include measurements using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for&#xD;
      Schizophrenia (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S).&#xD;
      Risperidone (25-50milligrams [mg]) injections, long-acting formulation, every 2 weeks for at&#xD;
      least 1 year. Dosages may be increased (50 mgs maximum) or decreased at discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator. Supplementary risperidone tablets (1mg) may be administered.&#xD;
