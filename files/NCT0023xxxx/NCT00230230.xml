  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and&#xD;
      active-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of SCH 486757 in subjects with&#xD;
      persistent cough resulting from a recent viral upper respiratory infection (URI). The primary&#xD;
      objective is to assess the efficacy of SCH 486757 administered at a dose of 100 mg twice&#xD;
      daily for 5 days in the reduction of cough severity score compared with placebo. The key&#xD;
      secondary objective is to evaluate the reduction in the number of coughs with SCH 486757&#xD;
      compared with placebo. Because codeine is a widely used as a cough medication, it is included&#xD;
      as a treatment arm in the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be 18 to &lt;65 years of age, of either sex, and of any race.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the prescreening visit (Visit 1), subjects must have a history of a persistent&#xD;
             cough resulting from a recent viral URI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be sufficiently clinically symptomatic at the screening visit (Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the Baseline/Treatment Day 1 Visit (Visit 3), subjects must demonstrate an average&#xD;
             cough severity score of at least 2 (moderate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be in good health, free of any clinically significant disease, other&#xD;
             than cough, that might interfere with the study schedule, evaluation, or&#xD;
             interpretation of study-derived data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to give written informed consent and able to adhere to dose&#xD;
             and visit schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical laboratory tests (complete blood count, blood chemistries, and urinalysis)&#xD;
             and electrocardiograms must be within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using a medically accepted method of&#xD;
             birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             (beta-hCG) (prescreening sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant or nursing females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to the study medications or to their&#xD;
             excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have used any study medication, including placebo, in an investigational&#xD;
             protocol within 30 days prior to the prescreening visit (Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving concurrent prohibited medications, unless they observe the washout&#xD;
             period prior to the screening and baseline visits (Visits 2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are family members of the investigational study staff involved with this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects previously enrolled into this study (ie, signed informed consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with current evidence of clinically significant pulmonary (especially&#xD;
             conditions that involve coughing), hematopoietic, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal,&#xD;
             neurologic, psychiatric, autoimmune, or other disease that precludes the subject's&#xD;
             participation in the study. In particular, diabetics, uncontrolled hypertensives, and&#xD;
             subjects with clinically significant cardiomyopathy, prostatic hypertrophy, glaucoma,&#xD;
             and psychiatric disorders are to be excluded from participation in this study.&#xD;
             Particular attention should be given to exclude subjects with conditions that would&#xD;
             currently interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the&#xD;
             study medication or interfere with the subject's ability to reliably complete the&#xD;
             diary card.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who require chronic use&#xD;
             of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with current or history of frequent clinically significant sinusitis or&#xD;
             chronic purulent postnasal drip.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of allergies to more than two classes of medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects whose ability, in the opinion of the investigator or designee, to provide&#xD;
             informed consent is compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of noncompliance with medications or treatment protocols, or&#xD;
             with a history of drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current smokers, ex-smokers who stopped smoking in the previous 6 months, or subjects&#xD;
             with a cumulative smoking history &gt;10 pack-years will be excluded. (Pack-years is a&#xD;
             way to measure the amount a person has smoked over a long period of time. It is&#xD;
             calculated by multiplying the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day by the&#xD;
             number of years the person has smoked, eg, a 10 pack-year history is equal to smoking&#xD;
             1 pack per day for 10 years or 2 packs per day for 5 years, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with current reflux disease.&#xD;
