      Six sites of the Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Consortium (plus 2 additional sites)&#xD;
      will participate in this study. The participating sites will be that of the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator (PI), Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA (Benjamin D. Gold, MD);&#xD;
      Texas Children's Hospital / Baylor College of Medicine (George Ferry, MD and Tony Olive, MD);&#xD;
      Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA (Bob Baldassano, MD); University of&#xD;
      Chicago Children's Hospital, Chicago, IL (Barbara Kirschner, MD); University of California,&#xD;
      San Francisco (Mel Heyman, MD); Mass General Hospital / Harvard University (Harland Winter,&#xD;
      MD); V.A. Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA (David Relman, MD); Children's&#xD;
      Center For Digestive Healthcare, Atlanta, GA (Stanley Cohen, MD); and Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA (Drs. Jeannette Guarner, Siobhan O'Connor and Thomas&#xD;
      Shinnick)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of study is 2 yrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improve the methods to collect biopsies from the colon and ileum, tissue storage&#xD;
           techniques and best methods to detect specific infections in children with Crohn's&#xD;
           disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if there are specific infectious agents that are more common in children with&#xD;
           Crohn's disease, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if there are types of children with Crohn's disease (e.g., children living in&#xD;
           Boston, African American children) who may be more at risk for getting the infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design involves children ages 6 months through 17 11/12 years of age who are&#xD;
      undergoing a clinically-indicated colonoscopy. Subjects will be grouped into cases and&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any child ages 6 mos through 17 11/12 years of age, undergoing a clinically-indicated&#xD;
           colonoscopy as determined by the treating physician, is eligible for enrollment. About&#xD;
           500 patients will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cases will consist of those children within the defined age group, who are undergoing&#xD;
           diagnostic colonoscopy and have the definitive diagnosis of Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children who have the diagnosis of indeterminate colitis or ulcerative colitis for the&#xD;
           purpose of this R03, will be excluded as cases and from initial analysis, but will have&#xD;
           tissue specimens banked for subsequent evaluation for infectious agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Controls will consists of children within the defined age group, undergoing clinically&#xD;
           indicated colonoscopy and who are not diagnosed with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis&#xD;
           or indeterminate colitis (e.g., juvenile polyps, irritable bowel syndrome or functional&#xD;
           bowel disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool specimen (5ml/1 tsp) will be collected to test for different types of bacteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A questionnaire will be administered to each research volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each subject's medical information (i.e. diagnosis, disease stage, and laboratory&#xD;
           results) will be stored electronically in a separate access-based database. A unique&#xD;
           identifier will be assigned to each patient entered into the study and will also be used&#xD;
           for blinding of the specimens analyzed by the pathologist and by molecular assays for&#xD;
           infectious agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colonoscopy will be performed by the treating pediatric gastroenterologist and biopsies&#xD;
           obtained in the usual standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical biopsies from the rectum, left, right, transverse colon and cecum will be&#xD;
           placed in formalin containing vials as per standard of care for the clinical pathologist&#xD;
           and diagnostic evaluation.&#xD;

      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes CD and ulcerative colitis (UC), is estimated&#xD;
      to affect approximately 1 - 2 million Americans. Recent studies strongly suggest that these&#xD;
      disorders are increasing in prevalence in developed and developing countries, and in first&#xD;
      generation immigrants to industrialized nations. Changing epidemiology of IBD implies that,&#xD;
      in addition to a genetic susceptibility for disease, an environmental trigger or exposure&#xD;
      likely impacts disease expression. However, the specific pathobiology and etiology of IBD&#xD;
      remain unclear. Knowledge of the host genetic basis of IBD has advanced, including&#xD;
      characterization of a novel susceptibility gene in adult and adolescent CD (NOD2/CARD-15)&#xD;
      located on the pericentromeric region of chromosome 16. Recent studies not only implicate&#xD;
      NOD2/CARD-15 in susceptibility to CD, but also suggest a link between the innate immune&#xD;
      response to bacterial components and development of disease. Thus, well-designed&#xD;
      investigations of infectious etiologies of CD, with sufficient power to detect differences in&#xD;
      infection between IBD and non-IBD patients, are critically needed. Yet, deficiencies in the&#xD;
      methods and tools for such studies still exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both infectious and noninfectious mechanisms of pathogenesis remain plausible but&#xD;
      unconfirmed. To date, scientific evidence cannot conclude whether one or more infectious&#xD;
      pathogens triggers or determines the development and outcomes of CD or UC. Persistent&#xD;
      exposure to &quot;normal resident flora&quot; in an abnormally permeable gut might also conceivably&#xD;
      determine disease. Thus carefully designed investigations that apply systematically&#xD;
      evaluated, reliable and reproducible detection assays are needed to confirm or disprove&#xD;
      infectious hypotheses of causation. The first step is a pilot study that validates study&#xD;
      design and complementary assays (morphology-, molecular- and culture-based) and uniformly&#xD;
      applies these to target patient and control tissues (i.e., pediatric endoscopic biopsies). It&#xD;
      must focus on newly diagnosed CD (surrogate for &quot;incident&quot; CD) in a well-characterized group&#xD;
      of patients and appropriate, well-selected controls who meet uniform case and control&#xD;
      definitions. It must develop reproducible methods to ensure that results from different&#xD;
      studies can be compared and appropriate clinical interpretations made in order to translate&#xD;
      research results into treatment and prevention strategies that decrease the burden of CD. At&#xD;
      this time, deficiencies in both methodology and laboratory technology impede successful&#xD;
      conduct and interpretation of the needed studies on causality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on age of onset, newly diagnosed children with IBD, may be closer to triggering&#xD;
      immunopathogenic events that initiate the inflammatory response than adults. They may also&#xD;
      represent a unique population for the study of environmental factors (e.g., infection), i.e.,&#xD;
      younger age usually brings shorter and less complicated exposure histories to confound&#xD;
      analyses. It is reasonable to postulate that a single agent or polymicrobial insults, in the&#xD;
      genetically susceptible host, may determine the development or course of CD and it may be&#xD;
      easier to identify some infectious determinants in childhood CD. We hypothesize that adequate&#xD;
      collection of intestinal tissue biopsies from uniformly defined pediatric CD cases and&#xD;
      controls and validation of sensitive and specific laboratory tools to detect potential&#xD;
      infectious triggers of CD in these particular specimen types are needed to test causality for&#xD;
      infection in CD. The Pedi IBDC, 6 large, geographically diverse U.S. centers represents an&#xD;
      excellent platform to investigate potential infectious factors in CD, annually evaluating and&#xD;
      recording clinical and epidemiologic data on ~288 newly diagnosed pediatric CD cases in a&#xD;
      comprehensive data repository. The Pedi IBDC has a system to assess the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of its research. The Consortium also provides a pool of cases and controls in which to&#xD;
      implement standardized specimen collection techniques under a well-conceived algorithm. The&#xD;
      R03 assembled research team draws on a wide range of expertise and institutional resources in&#xD;
      epidemiology, infectious disease pathology, molecular microbiology, mycobacteriology and&#xD;
      virology, and the conduct of clinical trials. The multi-disciplinary expertise of this&#xD;
      proposal can test and validate in small endoscopic biopsies the histopathology and molecular&#xD;
      microbial detection assays previously validated in alternative paraffin-embedded or frozen&#xD;
      tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The R03 funding mechanism will facilitate tissue collection and banking techniques and&#xD;
      evaluations of a panel of assays to detect select infectious agents ranging from those&#xD;
      thought not to cause CD to those speculated as etiologic, from non-pathogenic commensals to&#xD;
      known and undetermined pathogens. Therefore, our specific study aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. standardize the collection (e.g., anatomic site of biopsy origin, biopsy number and&#xD;
           collection technique), processing and banking of gastrointestinal tissue biopsies&#xD;
           obtained during clinically-indicated endoscopy of well-characterized children with CD&#xD;
           followed by the Pedi IBDC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. verify and standardize the definition of appropriate controls, evaluating both&#xD;
           &quot;non-diseased&quot; biopsies from cases and clinically-indicated biopsies from children&#xD;
           without IBD (e.g., juvenile polyposis, Hirschsprung's disease) to improve the design of&#xD;
           future studies;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. standardize and validate in pediatric biopsies detection methods to identify potential&#xD;
           infectious risk factors for CD through parallel, paired and complementary&#xD;
           pathology-based (IHC), broad range amplification-based molecular (PCR) and&#xD;
           organism-specific (e.g., MAP) molecular analysis, and primary culture of tissue&#xD;
           specimens taken from well-defined cases and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, molecular characterization of microbiota in the feces from cases and controls&#xD;
      will be compared to microbial detection in their respective tissue biopsies. Successful&#xD;
      completion of these goals will provide a platform for imminent comprehensive investigations&#xD;
      that characterize clinically relevant microbial risk factors for CD in the child and quite&#xD;
      possibly the adult patient.&#xD;
