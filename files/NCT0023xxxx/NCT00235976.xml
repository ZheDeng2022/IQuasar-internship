  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, observer-blinded, dose-response study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy in tracheal intubation and safety of gantacurium chloride for injection&#xD;
      in healthy adult patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gantacurium chloride for injection (previously referred to as AV430A) is a new,&#xD;
      investigational non-depolarizing ultra-short acting neuromuscular blocking agent (NMB).&#xD;
      Preliminary results in animals and healthy human subjects (Phase 1 studies in adult&#xD;
      volunteers) suggest that gantacurium chloride for injection may provide a useful adjunct to&#xD;
      general anesthesia by permitting rapid intubation. This Phase 2 study will provide more&#xD;
      definitive information on the ultra-short acting profile of the compound by determining the&#xD;
      quality of intubation in patients, at 60 seconds, as assessed by a blinded intubator. In&#xD;
      addition, the safety of the compound will be assessed. In this study, the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of gantacurium chloride for injection will also be compared to a reference drug,&#xD;
      succinylcholine, and to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the dose-response relationship of&#xD;
      gantacurium chloride for injection on tracheal intubation conditions after a single rapid&#xD;
      bolus intravenous (i.v.) dose as a component of a propofol/opioid induction-intubation&#xD;
      sequence and to assess the safety profile of this compound.&#xD;
