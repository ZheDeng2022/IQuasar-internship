      The primary aim of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the overall clinical response rate of weekly Topotecan and Taxotere in&#xD;
           women with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, endometrial and uterine cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy with weekly Topotecan&#xD;
           and Taxotere in patients with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, endometrial or&#xD;
           uterine cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the progression free survival and overall survival in women treated with&#xD;
           weekly Topotecan and Taxotere in patients with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal,&#xD;
           endometrial and uterine cancers who have been previously treated with chemotherapy&#xD;
           and/or radiation therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial carcinoma is the most common gynecologic cancer, accounting for 6,500 deaths in&#xD;
      2002 in the United States. There has been a 128% increase in endometrial cancer deaths over&#xD;
      the past decade mainly due to recurrences. Although primary surgery with or without adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy can cure most patients, effective therapy for those patients with advanced or&#xD;
      recurrent disease is needed. Due to the advanced age of this patient population and&#xD;
      associated medical comorbidities, these patients are not always ideal candidates for&#xD;
      experimental therapies exploring dose intensity or toxic agents. Treatment options for&#xD;
      advanced or recurrent disease are limited. Cytotoxic therapy has made little impact on&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data has demonstrated efficacy of Topotecan in advanced or recurrent endometrial&#xD;
      cancer. A Phase II trial performed primarily by the New York Gynecologic Oncology Group&#xD;
      through ECOG found Topotecan to be an active first line treatment for metastatic or recurrent&#xD;
      endometrial cancer. The overall response rate was 20% with 3/40 patients complete responders.&#xD;
      A Phase II trial by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) of 29 patients with advanced or&#xD;
      recurrent endometrial cancer reported a 10% overall response rate to 5-day intravenous&#xD;
      Topotecan. However, 55% of patients had stable disease. Reported side effects were mainly&#xD;
      hematologic, specifically, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Finkler and Holloway reported a&#xD;
      phase I/II trial using weekly Topotecan in recurrent endometrial cancer. 23% of patients had&#xD;
      partial response to therapy, with a decrease in grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      compared to the 5-day infusion. In a pilot study examining the role of 5-day Topotecan in&#xD;
      uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC), Chambers et al. report 11 of 12 patients who&#xD;
      received Topotecan as front-line therapy to be disease-free at 13 months median follow-up.&#xD;
      Anemia and neutropenia were managed effectively with hematopoietic stimulating factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taxanes have also been reported to be effective in the treatment of advanced and recurrent&#xD;
      endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer cell lines have demonstrated sensitivity to&#xD;
      paclitaxel. Response rates of 35%-37% have been reported in two separate phase II trials.&#xD;
      Günthert et al., reported a complete response to Taxotere in a patient with recurrent&#xD;
      endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taxotere is an agent well documented in the management of advanced ovarian cancer, with a&#xD;
      response rate of approximately 30% in platinum-refractory patients. Taxotere has also&#xD;
      demonstrated clinical response in patients classified as paclitaxel-refractory, confirming an&#xD;
      incomplete cross-resistance between these two agents. Based on these data, there is reason to&#xD;
      believe that the combination of Topotecan and Taxotere in the second-line setting may prove&#xD;
      promising in patients initially treated with paclitaxel and platinum-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topotecan and Taxotere have known activity in ovarian cancer patients. Recent weekly dosing&#xD;
      schedules suggest similar activity in ovarian cancer patients with less toxicity. Ovarian&#xD;
      cancer patients who have significant Taxane-related side effects, including neuropathy, do&#xD;
      well with weekly Taxotere. Both Topotecan and Taxotere have documented efficacy in recurrent&#xD;
      endometrial cancer, but no study, to date, has utilized them in combination for the treatment&#xD;
      of endometrial cancer. In addition to utilizing this regimen in a phase II setting for&#xD;
      recurrent ovarian cancer, we propose a phase II trial utilizing this combination for the&#xD;
      treatment of recurrent endometrial cancer. The justification for including all of these tumor&#xD;
      types in the same protocol is the known similar response rates of these Gynecologic tumors to&#xD;
      all chemotherapies. The endpoints and power are designed for all of the histologic types, but&#xD;
      subset analysis will be used for each tumor type after completion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the broad spectrum of antitumor activity of both Topotecan and Taxotere, several&#xD;
      phase I/II trials have been conducted with this combination regimen. Lu and colleagues at MD&#xD;
      Anderson administered docetaxel (Taxotere) intravenously on Day 1 followed by bolus daily&#xD;
      intravenous Topotecan on days 1-3 with subcutaneous Neupogen (Filgrastim) support on days&#xD;
      4-13. Dose limiting toxicity for the regimen was febrile neutropenia, and the recommended&#xD;
      dose for phase II trials was docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and topotecan 1.4 mg/m2 IV on&#xD;
      days 1-3 with Neupogen (filgrastim) 5 mcg/kg/d SC on days 4-13. Three of the 11 patients&#xD;
      enrolled experienced a response with the combination (1 CR and 1 PR in nasopharynx cancer and&#xD;
      1 PR in SCLC). Aijaz and colleagues at New York Medical Center conducted a similar pilot&#xD;
      study in patients with recurrent ovarian and primary peritoneal cancer. In this trial, all of&#xD;
      the patients received docetaxel 80 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and topotecan 1.0 mg/m2 IV on days 1-5.&#xD;
      The patients also received Neupogen (filgrastim) 10-mcg/kg beginning on day 6 and continuing&#xD;
      until the neutrophil count recovered to ≥ 10,000/mL. The regimen was relatively well&#xD;
      tolerated, with neutropenia being the most frequently reported side effect. Preliminary&#xD;
      antitumor activity was impressive, with 1 complete response, 4 partial responses, and 4&#xD;
      stable diseases reported among the twelve patients enrolled in the pilot study. A final phase&#xD;
      I study combining topotecan and docetaxel was also conducted at The University of Wisconsin&#xD;
      by Stella and colleagues. In this trial docetaxel was administered IV on day 1 followed by&#xD;
      daily IV bolus Topotecan on days 1-5. In contrast to the previous studies, prophylactic&#xD;
      growth factor support was not administered following chemotherapy administration. Because of&#xD;
      significant myelosuppression at the initial dose level, the protocol was amended and the&#xD;
      starting dose of Topotecan was reduced. As expected, the dose-limiting toxicity was&#xD;
      myelosuppression consisting of both neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose for the combination regimen was docetaxel 60 mg/m2 IV on day 1 followed by Topotecan&#xD;
      0.75 mg/m2/d on days 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the combination of Topotecan and Taxotere has been used in a Phase I setting in&#xD;
      platinum sensitive patients with recurrent ovarian and primary peritoneal cancers. Eleven&#xD;
      patients have been treated to date with weekly docetaxel 30 mg/m2/wk plus topotecan 3.5&#xD;
      mg/m2/wk. Two patients were non-evaluable, one due to rapidly progressive disease and one due&#xD;
      to noncompliance. Of the nine evaluable patients, five patients experienced dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities as follows,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. cycle 1 day 15 (C1D15) held due to platelets 33K in a heavily pretreated patient,&#xD;
           including previous oxaliplatin,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. C1D15 dose decreased due to grade 3 diarrhea,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. C1D8 held due to grade 3-4 nausea and vomiting (may have been disease related),&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. C1D15 held due to platelets 49 K (74 yo, heavily pretreated including previous XRT),&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. C1D15 held due to platelets 43K and declining creatinine clearance of 43 ml/min (3 prior&#xD;
           regimens, including XRT, PS 2 and history of thrombocytopenia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One additional patient is planned to complete this dose level, to provide 10 evaluable&#xD;
      patients. Of the 36 patients receiving 76 cycles of therapy, myelosuppression was brief and&#xD;
      reversible with no febrile neutropenia. Per verbal communication from Dr. Burris, the&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose will be docetaxel 30 mg/m2/wk plus topotecan 3.5 mg/m2/wk on days&#xD;
      1, 8 and 15 every 28 days for minimally pretreated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to possible synergy with this combination of drugs in other tumor types, the&#xD;
      weekly dosing may have a better safety profile. The dose-limiting toxicity for Topotecan when&#xD;
      administered on a daily x 5-administration schedule is myelosuppression. However, when the&#xD;
      drug is administered on a weekly administration schedule, the myelosuppression is ameliorated&#xD;
      and is no longer dose limiting. Additionally, weekly docetaxel administration is gaining in&#xD;
      popularity in the clinical arena due to the improved toxicity profile of the drug. The&#xD;
      possibility of synergy with the improved safety profile secondary to weekly dosing makes this&#xD;
      combined dosing regimen a rational possibility for this patient population.&#xD;
