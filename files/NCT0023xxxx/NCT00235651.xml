  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to quantify the dose of aerosol medication deposited in the&#xD;
      lungs of lung transplant recipients receiving a single nebulized treatment of aerosolized&#xD;
      Abelcet速 (lipid complexed amphotericin-B). This study is being performed to determine the&#xD;
      range of deposited doses and patterns of distribution that could be expected in this&#xD;
      population so that the ultimate efficacy of this preparation can be evaluated. A radioisotope&#xD;
      technique will be utilized to track the medication dose. The study will include 12 subjects&#xD;
      who will perform one testing session lasting approximately 3 hours. An Investigational New&#xD;
      Drug Application (IND) detailing this protocol has been submitted by the principal&#xD;
      investigator (PI) and approved by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] (72,521).&#xD;

      Research Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will need to complete one visit that will take about 3 hours of their time. All&#xD;
      testing will be performed in the Nuclear Medicine Department located on the first floor of&#xD;
      the Presbyterian Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For women who could possibly be pregnant, a small amount of urine will be used for&#xD;
           pregnancy testing to be performed on the study day prior to any drug delivery. Pregnant&#xD;
           women, or women who are currently breast-feeding an infant, will not be allowed to take&#xD;
           part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will be asked a few questions that will not take more than five minutes by one&#xD;
           of the investigators or study coordinator. These questions include information about&#xD;
           past medical history, surgical dates, medications, etc. The patient's medical record&#xD;
           will be reviewed for demographic information (age, sex, and race), lab results (standard&#xD;
           post transplant care), medication information, as well as any testing/procedures that&#xD;
           they have undergone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fifteen minutes prior to the administration of radiolabeled Abelcet速 by nebulizer, we&#xD;
           will measure and assess blood pressure and heart rate, assess lung sounds, perform&#xD;
           pulmonary function testing, and re-verify that the subject has no known allergies or&#xD;
           previous adverse experiences with radiopharmaceuticals. Female subjects will receive a&#xD;
           urine pregnancy test on the day of testing, prior to drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects will be seated between the heads of a dual-head gamma camera so that the region&#xD;
           from the top of the head to the stomach is viewable by this device which depicts&#xD;
           radioactivity inside of the body. Subjects will then inhale the test aerosol. The&#xD;
           aerosol will be delivered using an Aeroeclipse breath actuated Nebulizer driven by a&#xD;
           DeVilbiss 8650D compressor set to 40psig. The anterior head of the gamma camera will be&#xD;
           moved away from the subject during aerosol administration, but imaging will be performed&#xD;
           through the posterior head throughout the drug delivery. Drug delivery will take&#xD;
           approximately 25 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. When the nebulized dose has been completely delivered the nebulizer and associated&#xD;
           equipment will be removed from the room, and the anterior head of the gamma camera will&#xD;
           be brought back into close proximity to the subject. A series of 30s images will be&#xD;
           taken depicting the drug deposited in the subjects. The first 4 images will be taken&#xD;
           manually at high-pixel resolution. The camera will then be set to automatically acquire&#xD;
           images for the next 20 minutes at lower resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Radioactivity will be used as an analog for drug dose. The starting dose of&#xD;
           radioactivity added to the nebulizer will be compared to the dose found in the nebulizer&#xD;
           and exhalation filters after dose delivery, in order to determine the total dose&#xD;
           deposited. The regional breakdown of the deposited dose will be determined using the&#xD;
           gamma camera images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. While the camera heads are still in close proximity to the subject, a small amount of&#xD;
           Xenon [Xe-133] gas will be administered to the subjects via mask so that the shape of&#xD;
           the lungs can be depicted and imaged. This gas will then be washed out through an&#xD;
           absorbent filter. The gas inhalation will take approximately 6 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After the completion of imaging (approximately 30 minutes after drug administration)&#xD;
           subjects will be moved to a small exam room where again blood pressure, heart rate, and&#xD;
           lung sounds will be reassessed. Pulmonary function tests will be re-performed and the&#xD;
           change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] (if any) caused by the drug will&#xD;
           be determined. Subjects will be treated with bronchodilators if exam reveals any signs&#xD;
           of bronchoconstriction resulting from the aerosol. In addition, adverse events will be&#xD;
           monitored and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring/Follow Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo the following monitoring procedures to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of the experimental procedures that are not part of standard medical&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The monitoring/follow-up procedures include a follow-up phone call from the study&#xD;
           coordinator to check for any side effects of the experimental procedure. This call will&#xD;
           take place the day after the participant has completed the experimental procedure. This&#xD;
           call will take no longer than 5-10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Thirty days after participants have completed the experimental procedure, the study&#xD;
           coordinator will call the participant to check for any side effects associated with the&#xD;
           experimental procedure. This call will take no longer than 5-10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this phone call the patient will have completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The half-life of the radiopharmaceutical [Technetium (Tc-99m)] used for labeling of the drug&#xD;
      is 6.02 hours. The serum half-life for amphotericin after intravenous (IV) Abelcet&#xD;
      administration is of the order of 170 hours (Abelcet label). Detectable concentrations of&#xD;
      Amphotericin have been found in the BAL fluid of the lungs after 192 hours post&#xD;
      administration of inhaled Abelcet in our previous studies. The longer half-life associated&#xD;
      with the active medication necessitates the longer follow up period.&#xD;
