  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the pharmacodynamics (the way a drug works in the&#xD;
      body) of rabeprazole and pantoprazole on intragastric acidity and esophageal acid exposure in&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients with nighttime heartburn. Patients will be&#xD;
      given one dose of each medication with a washout period of 6 to 13 days between doses&#xD;
      (&quot;washout period&quot; means they will receive no further proton pump inhibitor medication for&#xD;
      6-13 days, allowing the 1st dose to completely leave their bodies). Rabeprazole is approved&#xD;
      in the United States for the short-term treatment (4-8 weeks) in the healing and symptomatic&#xD;
      relief of erosive or ulcerative GERD with symptoms of daytime or nighttime heartburn,&#xD;
      maintenance of healing of erosive or ulcerative GERD, and treatment of symptomatic GERD. The&#xD;
      dosage regimen for all GERD indications is 20 mg once a day. Other indications include&#xD;
      healing of duodenal ulcers, Helicobacter pylori eradication to reduce the risk of duodenal&#xD;
      ulcer recurrence, and treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including&#xD;
      Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. The most common side effect of rabeprazole is headache. In&#xD;
      clinical trials headache was assessed as possibly related to rabeprazole in 2.4% of subjects&#xD;
      vs. 1.6% for placebo. Pantoprazole at a dose of 40 mg once a day is indicated for the&#xD;
      short-term treatment (up to 8 weeks) in the healing and symptomatic relief of erosive&#xD;
      esophagitis, and the maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and reduction in relapse&#xD;
      rates of daytime and nighttime heartburn symptoms in patients with GERD. Other indications&#xD;
      include pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. The most&#xD;
      common side effects are headache and diarrhea.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a single dose of two drugs,&#xD;
      rabeprazole and pantoprazole, on reducing the amount of acid in the stomach and esophagus in&#xD;
      subjects with GERD. This study is conducted at one investigational center. The investigator&#xD;
      will be blinded (he or she will not know whether the patient is taking rabeprazole or&#xD;
      pantoprazole). The study is a comparative, randomized, single dose, two-way crossover,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic study examining the effectiveness of rabeprazole or pantoprazole on stomach&#xD;
      acidity and esophageal acid exposure in GERD patients with nighttime heartburn. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized (like with the toss of a coin) to one of two sequences in receiving study&#xD;
      medication; either one dose of rabeprazole in the first treatment period followed by one dose&#xD;
      of pantoprazole in the second treatment period or one dose of pantoprazole in the first&#xD;
      treatment period followed by one dose of rabeprazole in the second treatment period. The&#xD;
      study will measure how the acid levels in the stomach and esophagus change after one dose of&#xD;
      either study medication. The primary endpoint will be the percent of time that the stomach pH&#xD;
      is greater than 4 (a pH level considered to be normal) during the 24-hour period after a&#xD;
      single dose of each study medication. Another endpoint will be the 24-hour esophageal reflux&#xD;
      time after a single dose of study medication. The esophageal acid exposure is determined by&#xD;
      measuring how much acid flows backwards from the stomach to the esophagus. Patients will&#xD;
      participate in two 48-hour treatment periods during which intragastric (stomach) and&#xD;
      esophageal pH will be recorded at 8-second intervals using a probe inserted through the nose&#xD;
      and down to the stomach. The two treatment periods will be be separated by a washout period&#xD;
      of 6 to 13 days. On each day of the treatment periods, patients will be dosed in the morning.&#xD;
      During each treatment period, patients will receive placebo on Day 1, and active treatment&#xD;
      (either rabeprazole or pantoprazole) on Day 2. The main objective of the study is to compare&#xD;
      the effects of a single dose of rabeprazole 20 milligrams to pantoprazole 40 milligrams on&#xD;
      intragastric acidity and esophageal acid exposure in GERD patients with a history of&#xD;
      nighttime heartburn and safety will be monitored in the study. Rabeprazole 20 milligram&#xD;
      tablet once by mouth; pantoprazole 40 milligram tablet once by mouth&#xD;
