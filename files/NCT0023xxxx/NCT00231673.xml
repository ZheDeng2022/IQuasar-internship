  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of topiramate on clinical and&#xD;
      electrophysiological parameters in patients with diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy. The&#xD;
      study will also evaluate the safety of topiramate in this patient population.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      topiramate on clinical and electrophysiological parameters in patients with diabetic&#xD;
      peripheral polyneuropathy. Patients will undergo the Baseline Phase when they are tapered off&#xD;
      other pain medications, have diabetes controlled and eligibility reassessed. Patients will&#xD;
      then be randomized to receive either topiramate or placebo and enter the Double-Blind Phase,&#xD;
      which consists of Titration Period (topiramate dose will be titrated from 25mg/day to&#xD;
      200mg/day over 42 days) and Maintenance Period (study medication will be continued for 12&#xD;
      weeks). After the Double-Blind Phase, study medication will be tapered off during the Taper&#xD;
      Phase, whose duration will vary depending on each patient. The evaluations include&#xD;
      electrophysiological assessment, quantitative sensory assessment, and clinical assessment&#xD;
      such as subjective pain scales. Safety evaluations (vital signs, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      evaluations, physical and neurological examination, and evaluations of adverse events) will&#xD;
      be conducted during the trial. During the first 42 days, doses of topiramate gradually&#xD;
      increase to achieve the target dose (200mg daily by mouth), and then the dose is maintained&#xD;
      for 12 weeks, after which the dose is slowly reduced and stopped over 12 weeks.&#xD;
