      Study of the long term outcomes and economic impact of the pulmonary artery catheter in acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS/ALI) patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is a commonly used device that provides hemodynamic data&#xD;
      to guide care of the critically ill, such as patients with acute lung injury or the acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS/ALI). Clinicians believe PAC use improves decision-making&#xD;
      and patient outcomes but evidence is lacking and recent data suggest the PAC may increase&#xD;
      mortality as well as considerably increasing costs. In response, the NHLBI funded a large&#xD;
      multicenter trial (Fluid And Catheter Treatment Trial (FACTT) (N01-HR-46054-46064)) where&#xD;
      ARDS/ALI patients were randomized to receive a PAC or the less invasive central venous&#xD;
      catheter (CVC) and received a liberal or conservative fluid management protocol in response&#xD;
      to data provided by the PAC or CVC. The primary end-point is in-patient mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are complementing FACTT with a concurrent economic analysis of the PAC. Our aims are to:&#xD;
      1.) compare differences between study arms in long-term survival, quality of life, and&#xD;
      quality-adjusted survival; 2.) compare differences between study arms in acute care and&#xD;
      long-term costs; 3.) calculate the cost-efficacy of PAC use (i.e., the balance of costs and&#xD;
      effects under the controlled environment of the FACTT trial), and; 4.) estimate&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness under more &quot;real-world&quot; conditions and produce life-time&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness ratios, thereby facilitating comparison of our results to other&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are achieving Aims 1-3 by augmenting FACTT data collection with detailed information on&#xD;
      hospital costs, extended survival follow-up for a minimum of one year, and post-discharge&#xD;
      patient interviews to determine quality of life and resource use in the first year. We will&#xD;
      achieve Aim 4 by constructing a microsimulation model first calibrated by results from FACTT&#xD;
      and published data on life-expectancy and costs and then adjusted to reflect the broader&#xD;
      patient case-mix and clinical effects of PAC use in routine clinical practice. We are using&#xD;
      patient-level data from the King County Lung Injury Project epidemiology study (NHLBI&#xD;
      HL-96-014) to adjust case-mix and patient-level data from a large pragmatic trial of PAC use&#xD;
      in the United Kingdom to adjust the clinical effects of PAC use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of our adjunct to FACTT will substantially amplify the value of the data being&#xD;
      collected and provide, for the first time, robust estimates from randomized data of the&#xD;
      economic effects of the widespread application of this important technology.&#xD;
