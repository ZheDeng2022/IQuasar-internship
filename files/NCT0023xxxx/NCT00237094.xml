  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have demonstrated that intensive disease management of diabetes and its associated&#xD;
      risk factors, hypertension and dyslipidemia, can prevent the progression of vascular&#xD;
      complications. However, implementation of well defined guidelines for intensive disease&#xD;
      management has been suboptimal. Barriers to success occur at multiple levels, including&#xD;
      health care systems, health care providers and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In rural regions of the U.S., reduced availability of primary care providers and specialty&#xD;
      services, including diabetes education, present additional barriers to effective diabetes&#xD;
      care. Use of a nurse practitioner led interdisciplinary team to intensively manage urban and&#xD;
      rural diabetic patients, utilizing telehealth technology to provide care to rural areas, will&#xD;
      help begin to address these barriers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term goal of the project is to develop a practical and sustainable system of&#xD;
      intensive diabetes management that will be effective in helping diabetic patients achieve and&#xD;
      maintain goals within established treatment guidelines regardless of geographic location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine in both urban and rural areas if a nurse practitioner led team approach to&#xD;
           intensive diabetes management and education improves disease-specific outcomes and&#xD;
           patient education compared to traditional care (current diabetes management of urban&#xD;
           patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if telehealth is an effective and accepted mechanism for delivery of a&#xD;
           nurse practitioner led team approach to intensive diabetes management and education in&#xD;
           rural areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if a nurse practitioner led intensive disease management team can identify&#xD;
           patient risk factors (psychological, financial, and work-related factors) that may be&#xD;
           barriers to patient adherence, earlier in the management of urban diabetic patients&#xD;
           compared to traditional care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare volume and type of service utilization of a nurse practitioner led team&#xD;
           approach to diabetes management and education to that of traditional care in both urban&#xD;
           and rural areas. Disease-specific outcomes will include physiologic variables (HbA1c,&#xD;
           blood pressure, lipid levels), measurement and documentation of preventive services&#xD;
           (dilated eye exam, monofilament exam, microabumin testing) and patient's knowledge of&#xD;
           disease tested by questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results should show improved outcomes and patient knowledge in urban and rural patients&#xD;
      receiving intensive disease management compared to traditional care.&#xD;
