      A single-blind switching study in which forty subjects currently being treated with&#xD;
      risperidone will be randomly assigned to either stay on risperidone or switched to&#xD;
      quetiapine. Various behavioral and biological measures will be used to compare smoking&#xD;
      behavior over time in these two groups.&#xD;

      STUDY SYNOPSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects enrolled: Forty patients (Two groups - 20 each)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centers: One&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single-blind, Switching Paradigm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension: None specifically, although patients who do have a good clinical response to the&#xD;
      treatment will probably be maintained on their medication at the discretion of their treating&#xD;
      psychiatrist through normal hospital channels and, therefore, if desired, it would be&#xD;
      possible to formally re-evaluate their condition at some later time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of subject participation: 14 weeks Duration of each study phase: Screening:&#xD;
      1-7 days Lead-in treatment with risperidone: 2 weeks Switching phase: 50% of the patients&#xD;
      will be switched over a two-week period to quetiapine Active two group treatment: 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit interval or frequency: variable, depending on measurement Weekly - dispensing drug &amp;&#xD;
      treatment team meeting Bi-weekly - labs &amp; certain side effect ratings Monthly - efficacy&#xD;
      measures and side effect ratings Baseline, Week 6 &amp; Week 12 - cognitive measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment/enrollment duration: Approximately 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific subject population/disease state/disorder being studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia (all sub-types, including schizoaffective disorder) who&#xD;
      are active heavy smokers (at least one pack of cigarettes per day) will be recruited. To be&#xD;
      included each patient will need to have received an adequate dose and duration of risperidone&#xD;
      treatment (monotherapy of at least 6 mg total daily for three months or more) and who had a&#xD;
      less-than-optimal response treatment. Specifically, a less-than-optimal response to&#xD;
      risperidone is defined as a Total PANSS Score of 60 or more. Additionally, we will not enroll&#xD;
      clinically stable patients who are satisfied with their ongoing treatment or patients judged&#xD;
      to be treatment refractory (using Kane's criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject setting: both Norristown State Hospital inpatients and those enrolled in a partial&#xD;
      hospital program will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial: On the grounds of Norristown State Hospital are three partial hospital programs&#xD;
      administered by the Montgomery County Office of Mental Health. These are highly structured&#xD;
      programs that will allow us to recruit subjects who are outpatients but living in&#xD;
      well-supervised programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient: Norristown State Hospital 1001 Sterigere Street Norristown, PA 19401&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug and dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexible: To be enrolled, all patients will have had an adequate treatment of risperidone&#xD;
      (defined as monotherapy of at least 6 mg total daily for three months or more) prior to&#xD;
      enrollment. For those switched from risperidone to quetiapine, it is expected this&#xD;
      cross-titration will take two weeks (longer titration may be used if necessary due to higher&#xD;
      levels of risperidone). By the end of the first week, the risperidone will be reduced by 50%&#xD;
      of the patient's original dosage, with the target dose of quetiapine being 400 mg total daily&#xD;
      dose at the end of the first week. By the end of the second week of titration, the&#xD;
      risperidone will be discontinued, and the treating psychiatrist will continue to increase the&#xD;
      quetiapine to the target of 600 mg total daily dose based on his/her clinical judgement, then&#xD;
      to reach 800 mg total daily dose by the end of the fourth week. A lower dose will be possible&#xD;
      due to emergent side effects, but any patient not able to tolerate at least 400 mg/day of&#xD;
      quetiapine will be dropped from the study. Quetiapine will be dosed BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator(s) and dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexible: As stated above, all patients will have had an adequate treatment of risperidone&#xD;
      prior to enrollment. It is expected that the majority of those patients remaining on&#xD;
      risperidone will continue to be treated at the 6 mg/day dose, although their treating&#xD;
      psychiatrist will be able to suggest a lower dose due to side effects or increase the dose as&#xD;
      necessary for greater efficacy. Any patient requiring less that 4 mg/day or more than 10&#xD;
      mg/day will be dropped from the study. While risperidone is usually dosed on a once per day&#xD;
      basis, throughout the switching phase of the study it will be dosed BID. The possibility&#xD;
      exists that once/daily versus twice/daily dosing could be a factor that influences medication&#xD;
      compliance rates between the groups, and a source of bias. Twice/daily dosing for both groups&#xD;
      would also help to insure the blinding of the raters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that no formal consensus exists regarding the milligram-to-milligram&#xD;
      equivalency of risperidone and quetiapine. However, based on personal communication with&#xD;
      Herbert Meltzer, M.D., it seems that these dose ranges are thought to be comparable (1 mg&#xD;
      risperidone = approximately 100 mg quetiapine). Thus, the ideal comparison of 6 mg/day&#xD;
      risperidone to 600 mg/day quetiapine should avoid criticism, although, the final group mean&#xD;
      doses will finally be determined on the basis of individual patient treatment response and&#xD;
      emergent side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other treatments or programs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no other study related treatment programs, although each patient (whether&#xD;
      inpatient or partial hospital patient) will continue to receive their usual hospital or&#xD;
      clinic care on a regular basis. It is critical to note, however, that any patient receiving&#xD;
      ancillary behavioural, psycho-educational, or pharmacologic treatment for smoking cessation&#xD;
      will not be enrolled due the inherent bias and/or uncontrolled variance introduced by&#xD;
      additional treatments.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients (male or female) between 18-65 years of age must be diagnosed as having&#xD;
             DSM-IV schizophrenia (any subtype including schizoaffective disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have shown a less-than-optimal clinical response to an adequate course&#xD;
             of risperidone treatment and must be willing to agree to the possibility of receiving&#xD;
             quetiapine as an alternative treatment for their mild to moderate psychotic symptoms.&#xD;
             We define an adequate course of treatment as three or more months of at least 6 mg/day&#xD;
             of risperidone. We define less-than-adequate treatment as a Total PANSS Score of 60 or&#xD;
             more.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be active cigarette smokers. We define active cigarette smoking as&#xD;
             patients who consume one pack of cigarettes or more per day. Although there is no&#xD;
             standard for defining active cigarette smokers, it has been our experience that the&#xD;
             high rate of smoking activity on the hospital wards can have the effect of small&#xD;
             elevations in cotinine levels even among &quot;non-smoking&quot; patients through second hand&#xD;
             smoke. Therefore, we want to insure that we enroll &quot;heavy&quot; smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be able to fully participate in the informed consent and HIPAA process,&#xD;
             or have a legal guardian able to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had an adequate clinical response to risperidone and are considered&#xD;
             by themselves or their treating psychiatrist to be clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are judged to be treatment refractory, which we define as documented&#xD;
             treatment failure with 3 FDA-approved antipsychotic medications administered for an&#xD;
             adequate duration in a sufficient dosage (6 or more weeks of 1000 mg/day&#xD;
             chlorpromazine equivalents).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients at the time of screening who have clinically significant akathisia (Barnes&#xD;
             global score &gt;2), Parkinsonian symptoms symptoms (Simpson Angus total score &gt;3), or&#xD;
             significant EPS (indicated by treatment with benztropine, lorazepam or propranolol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECG abnormalities consistent with significant or acute cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of significant or unstable hypertension during the screening examination&#xD;
             outside the range from 90/60 to 140/90, or a pulse outside of the range of 60 to 100&#xD;
             beats per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any history of seizures or primary CNS disease (other than tardive dyskinesia or&#xD;
             extrapyramidal symptoms from psychotropic medications), comatose states, bone marrow&#xD;
             depression, significant cardiovascular, renal or hepatic disease, brain trauma,&#xD;
             chronic obstructive lung disease and/or pulmonary emphysema, or a mental deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Active drug or alcohol addiction within the past 3-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Symptoms of significant physical illness in the 4-week period prior to enrollment,&#xD;
             excluding mild upper respiratory or gastrointestinal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Clinical laboratory findings that indicate the presence of a pathological condition in&#xD;
             the judgment of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Having received any investigational drug in the 4 weeks preceding the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Pregnant or lactating patients are excluded. Pregnancy must be excluded by laboratory&#xD;
             tests prior to beginning the study. Female patients judged to have potential for&#xD;
             pregnancy (sexually-active females who do not use an approved form of contraception)&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. At serious suicidal risk.&#xD;
