  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Pilot study is designed to explore the rate of local side effects of fluticasone as&#xD;
      delivered by Advair and to determine the best outcome measure to assess these effects. This&#xD;
      study is the initial step, and will be followed by a larger scale study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. The inflammation is associated with&#xD;
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness, airflow obstruction, and respiratory symptoms including&#xD;
      wheezing, coughing and chest tightness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective controller asthma medications. They are&#xD;
      indicated for management of persistent asthma at all levels of severity. They have been&#xD;
      documented to improve symptoms and pulmonary function and reduce exacerbations, need for&#xD;
      quick-relief medications and airway hyperresponsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite their benefits, inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with adverse local&#xD;
      effects. These include oral candidiasis and dysphonia. However, though these risks have been&#xD;
      reported, they have not been carefully studied. The incidence of oral candidiasis in newly&#xD;
      treated subjects and its onset within a carefully monitored timeframe have not been&#xD;
      adequately assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more overtly undesirable effect is dysphonia. Data on it are usually collected from&#xD;
      spontaneous reports by patients in clinical trials. However, awareness of dysphonia requires&#xD;
      a certain degree of subjective discomfort to initiate the report. Subjective awareness of&#xD;
      dysphonia often varies based on an individuals voice requirements. A singer, for example, is&#xD;
      usually acutely aware of minor voice changes in contrast to someone who does not depend on&#xD;
      voice quality. Nonetheless, voice abnormalities can probably occur with similar frequency in&#xD;
      patients who are concerned or not concerned with their voice due to inhaled corticosteroids.&#xD;
      New subjective scales for reporting on an individual's voice have recently been validated and&#xD;
      published in other areas. These scales have not been validated in patients with asthma or in&#xD;
      subjects using inhaled corticosteroids. New technologies for objective voice assessment have&#xD;
      also been developed and these permit greater ability to quantify voice changes. These&#xD;
      advances permit better measures of the potential adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids&#xD;
      on voice both with regard to onset of abnormalities and with regard to magnitude of effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is an initial probe into clarifying the potential of the inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate delivered in the Advair DISKUS device to produce oral&#xD;
      candidiasis and voice changes, and to determine the best measurement to quantitate&#xD;
      objectively that effect.&#xD;
