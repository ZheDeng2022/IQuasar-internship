  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether a test titration regimen of ACTIQ&#xD;
      treatment will reduce the number of inadequately managed episodes of breakthrough pain for an&#xD;
      individual patient by attaining a successful dose of ACTIQ treatment more quickly. The&#xD;
      successful ACTIQ dose provides a satisfactory combination of efficacy and tolerability after&#xD;
      a single administration, as assessed by the patient.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Patients are included in the study if all of the following criteria are&#xD;
        met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient is at least 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  women must be surgically sterile, 2 years postmenopausal, or if of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential, must use a medically accepted method of birth control (ie, barrier method&#xD;
             with spermicide, steroidal contraceptive [oral, implanted, and Depo-Provera&#xD;
             contraceptives must be used in conjunction with a barrier method], or intrauterine&#xD;
             device)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient experiences persistent pain associated with cancer or cancer treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  for at least 7 days before enrolment, the patient has taken either the equivalent of&#xD;
             60 to 1000 mg/day of oral morphine around-the-clock (ATC) or 25 to 300 micrograms/hr&#xD;
             of transdermal fentanyl to treat persistent pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient regularly experiences between 1 and 4 episodes of cancer-related BTP per&#xD;
             day while taking ATC opioid therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient experiences at least partial relief of cancer related BTP by administering&#xD;
             conventional opioid BTP medication at a dose approximately in the range of one-fifth&#xD;
             to one-sixth the 24-hour sustained release dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient is capable of self-administering ACTIQ by sucking lozenge, producing&#xD;
             sufficient saliva to dissolve the lozenge over 15 minutes, and swallowing the saliva&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a responsible adult caregiver is available to assist the patient in case of emergency&#xD;
             if the patient will be taking ACTIQ at home&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient willingly provides informed consent to participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: Patients are excluded from participating in this study if 1 or more of&#xD;
        the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient experiences uncontrolled or rapidly escalating pain, as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator, such that ATC administration of pain medication might be expected to&#xD;
             change between the first and last administrations of ACTIQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient has known or suspected hypersensitivities and/or allergies to fentanyl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient has a recent history or current evidence or abuse of alcohol or any other&#xD;
             drug substance, licit or collection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient has neurological or psychiatric disease sufficient, in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, to compromise data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient received strontium-89 therapy within 6o days prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient received any other therapy (eg, radiotherapy) within a 1 week period prior&#xD;
             to entering the study that, in the investigator's opinion, could alter pain or&#xD;
             response to pain medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient has moderate to severe oral mucositis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient is pregnant, nursing, or is of child-bearing potential or not taking&#xD;
             adequate contraceptive measures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient has previously been treated with ACTIQ&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient has participated in a trial of an unapproved drug in the previous 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient has been diagnosed with either severe respiratory depression or severe&#xD;
             obstructive lung conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the patient has used monoamine-oxidase inhibitors (MAOI's) within the 2-week period&#xD;
             prior to entering the study&#xD;
