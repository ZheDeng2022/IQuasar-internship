  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incretin hormones (GIP and GLP-1) stimulate insulin release in a glucose dependant manner,&#xD;
      hence are necessary for maintenance of normal glucose tolerance. Both GIP and GLP-1 are&#xD;
      degraded and inactivated by DPP-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LAF 237 is an inhibitor of DPP-4 that has been shown to increase meal-stimulated levels of&#xD;
      intact GLP-1 in animals and patients with T2DM..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to explore the acute effects of LAF237 on the rate of&#xD;
      appearance and disappearance of glucose in type 2 diabetics. Secondary objectives include the&#xD;
      effect on FPG, insulin secretion rates, glucagon and FFA levels, and rate of glucose entry&#xD;
      from the GI tract.&#xD;

      Study Design Double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, two -period crossover study.&#xD;
      Sixteen (16) both sexes diabetic patients will be enrolled and randomized to receive one of&#xD;
      two treatment sequences (LAF-placebo or placebo-LAF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening, patients will begin a weight maintaining diet containing 50% carbohydrates, 30%&#xD;
      protein and 20% fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days from screening patients will be scheduled for treatment 1. Patients will begin&#xD;
      a 10-hour overnight fast on Day -1 at ~21h00. Patients will be admitted to GCRC next day.&#xD;
      Fasting plasma glucose sample will be drawn and following this the patient will be served a&#xD;
      standard breakfast containing 1/5 of their caloric allotment (50% carbohydrates, 30% protein&#xD;
      and 20% fat). At noon patient will be fed a standard lunch containing 2/5 of their caloric&#xD;
      allotment (50% carbohydrates, 30% protein and 20% fat). At 14h30 (-210) an infusion of 3-3H&#xD;
      glucose will be started and continued until 08h00 next day (20 µCi x FPG/100 continuous,&#xD;
      0.20/min). At 17h30 (-30) patients will ingest 100 mg of LAF237 or placebo with 200 ml of&#xD;
      water. At 18h00 (time zero) patients will be served a dinner (2/5 of their caloric&#xD;
      allotment). The carbohydrates (glucose) in the meal will be labeled with 75 µCi of&#xD;
      [1-14C]-glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At -60, -50, -40, -35, -30, -20, -10, -5, and 0 minutes before dinner plasma samples for&#xD;
      determination of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagons, GLP-1, GIP, FFA, lactate, and amino&#xD;
      acid concentrations and 3-3H glucose radioactivity will be drawn. Following dinner, further&#xD;
      blood samples will be drawn every 15 minutes for 3.5 hours (18h00-21h30) and every 30 minutes&#xD;
      for the next 10.5 hours (22h00-08h00 Day 2). Post dinner samples will be analyzed for the&#xD;
      above parameter as well as for 14C glucose radioactivity. At 08h00 on Day 2, both catheters&#xD;
      will be removed and the patients will be fed breakfast and then released from the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to blood samples, urine from dinner time until 08h00 on Day 2 will be collected.&#xD;
