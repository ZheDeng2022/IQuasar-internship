      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of topiramate to&#xD;
      standard antiepileptic drugs in children and adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Topiramate is a drug that is currently widely used for the treatment of seizures in adults&#xD;
      and pediatric patients (2 to 16 years of age). This is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      parallel-group study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of two dosages of topiramate&#xD;
      (100 or 200mg per day) compared with standard antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine or&#xD;
      valproate) in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. The study is composed of three phases:&#xD;
      baseline (up to 7 days), double-blind treatment, and a blinded extension. The double-blind&#xD;
      phase is divided into two periods: titration, in which the dose of drug is gradually&#xD;
      increased (approximately 35 days), and stabilization (of variable duration, with regular&#xD;
      scheduled visits up to 92 days and then every 3 months thereafter). The dose of study drug&#xD;
      remains constant during the stabilization period. In the blinded extension, patients&#xD;
      completing the double blind phase are given the opportunity to take the other study&#xD;
      medication in a blinded fashion (patient unaware of identity of the drug). This phase&#xD;
      continues until the patient leaves the study or the data base for the double blind phase is&#xD;
      finalized. The primary assessment of effectiveness is the time to first seizure from Day 15&#xD;
      of the study. Safety assessments include the frequency of adverse events during the study,&#xD;
      results of clinical laboratory tests (hematology and biochemistry), measurements of vital&#xD;
      signs and body weight, and physical examination findings. The study hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      200mg dose of topiramate is superior to the 100mg dose in delaying the time to first seizure&#xD;
      and is well-tolerated. Oral topiramate (25milligram [mg] or 50mg capsules or&#xD;
      tablets),starting at 25mg/day (Week 1),increasing to 100mg or 200mg/day (Week 5).Increasing&#xD;
      carbamazepine to 600mg/day or valproate to 1250mg/day (Week 5).Maximum dosages continue for a&#xD;
      variable time and then taper over 4 weeks to starting dose.&#xD;
