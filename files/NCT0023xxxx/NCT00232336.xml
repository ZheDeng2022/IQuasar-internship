      The purpose of this study was to collect pilot data on whether quetiapine may be effective in&#xD;
      the reduction of cocaine use and cravings in cocaine dependent individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems are involved in cocaine use and&#xD;
      cravings. Atypical antipsychotics act on these neurotransmitter systems, and therefore, may&#xD;
      be beneficial in the treatment of cocaine addiction. This open label study assessed the&#xD;
      efficacy of quetiapine for the treatment of cocaine use and craving in non-psychotic, cocaine&#xD;
      dependent participants over 6 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome measures included&#xD;
      self-report of cocaine use and self-report of cocaine cravings. This study also evaluated&#xD;
      whether the severity of addiction predicts quetiapine efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males and females, ages 18 - 65, with a DSM IV diagnosis of cocaine dependence were recruited&#xD;
      for an open label trial of quetiapine dosed at 300-600 mg/day, with a target dose of 600&#xD;
      mg/day. Subjects were followed at weekly study visits to monitor general psychiatric and&#xD;
      physical status, medication compliance, efficacy, and adverse events. Study participation&#xD;
      included psychiatric and medical examinations, an electrocardiogram, an eye exam, laboratory&#xD;
      tests, urine drug screens, electrocardiograms, and psychiatric and substance abuse&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-three males were initiated on quetiapine treatment, the following results include the&#xD;
      first twenty-two study completers. Twenty-two males (36-56 years) diagnosed with cocaine&#xD;
      dependence without a psychotic disorder, were initiated on a six-week, open-label trial of&#xD;
      quetiapine, 300-600 mg/day (QHS). Five participants discontinued prior to completing the&#xD;
      first week of treatment, and 14 of 22 subjects completed the study. The mean dose of&#xD;
      quetiapine was 429 mg/day. An intent-to-treat analysis found a significant decrease in&#xD;
      cravings on the Brief Substance Craving Scale after six weeks (p &lt; 0.01, Cohen's d = 1.23;&#xD;
      repeated measures mixed effects random regression). Cocaine use, addiction severity, and&#xD;
      psychopathology also decreased numerically, but not statistically, from baseline to end of&#xD;
      study. Adverse effects were generally mild. Addiction severity did not predict quetiapine&#xD;
      efficacy. Four subjects withdrew due to sedation; 2 were discontinued by the investigators,&#xD;
      and 2 were lost to follow up. Study completers experienced a statistically significant mean&#xD;
      weight gain of approximately 4.60 (95% CI, -6.05 - 3.17 kg)(mean baseline weight 86.9 (SD&#xD;
      18.38) kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quetiapine treatment appears to have improved cocaine dependence, specifically cocaine&#xD;
      cravings, in non-psychotic individuals. The observed weight change may reflect both weight&#xD;
      gain associated with cocaine dependence and medication side effect. Controlled research is&#xD;
      warranted to better define the potential role for quetiapine in the treatment of cocaine&#xD;
      dependence.&#xD;
