  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic gallbladder cancer or cholangiocarcinoma. Sorafenib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking&#xD;
      blood flow to the tumor&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the objective response probability (complete responses and partial responses)&#xD;
      for BAY 43-9006 in patients with unresectable or metastatic gallbladder or&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess overall survival, time to treatment failure and progression-free survival in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen. IV. To evaluate in a&#xD;
      preliminary fashion relevant prognostic and predictive molecular markers of clinical outcome&#xD;
      in gallbladder and cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  In calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is&#xD;
                  done is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the Monday&#xD;
                  two weeks later would be considered day 14; this allows for efficient patient&#xD;
                  scheduling without exceeding the guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must&#xD;
