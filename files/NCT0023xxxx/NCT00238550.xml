  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to investigate the benefit of adding CBME to the existing treatment&#xD;
      regime in the management of painful neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The addition of CBME to the existing treatment regime will result in a significant&#xD;
           improvement in both primary and secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The side effect profile and tolerability of CBME will be minimal and comparable to&#xD;
           placebo.&#xD;

      1. To investigate the benefit of adding CBME to the existing treatment regime in the&#xD;
           management of painful neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the tolerability and side effect profile of CBME.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the effects of CBME treatment on vibration perception thresholds (VPT) and&#xD;
           nerve conduction study parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the effects of CBME on central nervous system deep nuclei using MR&#xD;
           Spectroscopy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnoses of diabetes will be based on the criteria set by the World Health Organisation.&#xD;
