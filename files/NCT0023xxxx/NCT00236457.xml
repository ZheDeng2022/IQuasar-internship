  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document both short-term, as well as long-term efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of a long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone, in comparison with olanzapine&#xD;
      for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many schizophrenia patients currently take oral antipsychotic medications daily, but&#xD;
      long-acting injectable formulations may eliminate this need for the daily medication. This is&#xD;
      an open-label study of a flexible does of a long-acting formulation of risperidone injected&#xD;
      into the muscle at 2 week intervals over 12 months in patients with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder. A comparator group will receive daily tablets of olanzapine, a&#xD;
      psychotropic agent available for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective&#xD;
      disorders. This is a two-part trial. Patients will be titrated to the most effective dose of&#xD;
      trial medication during the first 13 weeks and analyzed for short-term efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      treatment at Week 13. Patients will be then assessed for maintenance of efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      resource use at Week 52 (second part of study). Efficacy assessments include the Structured&#xD;
      Clinical Interview - Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (SCI-PANSS), overall severity of&#xD;
      illness measured by the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, and quality of life assessed&#xD;
      by Wisconsin Quality of Life Index (W-QOLI). Safety evaluations include incidence of adverse&#xD;
      events, Simpson and Angus Rating Scale for extrapyramidal symptoms, physical examinations,&#xD;
      clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry, haematology, and urinalysis), and electrocardiograms&#xD;
      (ECGs). The primary study hypothesis is that treatment with long-acting risperidone injected&#xD;
      intramuscularly every 2 weeks is not inferior to treatment with daily olanzapine in terms of&#xD;
      short-term efficacy and is well tolerated by patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective&#xD;
      disorder. Risperidone injections (25mg or 50mg) every 2 weeks for 12 months. Investigator may&#xD;
      decrease or increase dosages (max 50mg) or supplement risperidone injections with risperidone&#xD;
      tablets (4mg/day max.). Control group receives olanzapine tablets (5mg) daily, adjusted as&#xD;
      necessary (max 20mg).&#xD;
