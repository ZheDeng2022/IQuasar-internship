      This multinational study will investigate the inheritance of genetic retinal degeneration in&#xD;
      families of different nationalities and ethnic backgrounds in order to identify the genes&#xD;
      that, when altered, cause retinal degeneration. The retina is a light-sensitive membrane&#xD;
      lining the back part of the eye. It relays vision signals to the brain, which the brain&#xD;
      interprets into sight. When the retina degenerates, vision is altered and possibly lost. The&#xD;
      findings of this study should help improve diagnosis and methods of treatment for these&#xD;
      disorders. Participating institutions include: the National Institutes for Health in&#xD;
      Bethesda, Maryland; the University of Miami in Florida; the Casey Eye Institute in Portland,&#xD;
      Oregon; the Byrd Health Sciences Center in Morgantown, West Virginia; the University of Texas&#xD;
      Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, Texas; the University of Tennessee Health Sciences&#xD;
      Center in Memphis; the Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, India; National Center of&#xD;
      Excellence in Molecular Biology in Lahore, Pakistan; and the Jules Gonin Hospital in&#xD;
      Lausanne, Switzerland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with retinitis pigmentosa and closely related diseases such as Usher syndrome,&#xD;
      snowflake vitreoretinal dystrophy and Bietti crystalline dystrophy may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and surgical history, including family history of vision problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination to clarify the type of retinal degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination, including tests of color vision, field of vision and ability to see in&#xD;
           the dark&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroretinogram to test the function of visual cells. For this test, the patient sits&#xD;
           in a dark room for 30 minutes with his or her eyes patched. Then, a small electrode&#xD;
           (silver disk) is taped to the forehead and the eye patches are removed. The surface the&#xD;
           eyes is numbed with eye drops, and contact lenses are placed on the eyes. The patient&#xD;
           looks inside a large dark globe that emits a series of light flashes. Then a light is&#xD;
           turned on inside the globe and more lights flash. The contact lenses sense small&#xD;
           electrical signals generated by the retina when the light flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hearing tests for patients with a personal or family history of deafness. Tests include&#xD;
           an audiogram, ear examination and test of middle ear function. For middle ear function&#xD;
           testing, the patient feels a little air pressure change for a moment and hears some&#xD;
           tones. Another test requires the patient to sit quietly with electrodes on the head,&#xD;
           forehead and earlobes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Balance testing, including walking in a straight line, standing with eyes closed in the&#xD;
           dark and other tests of coordination, and caloric testing. For the caloric testing, any&#xD;
           ear wax in the ear canal is removed before the test begins. Then, electrodes are placed&#xD;
           on the skin near the eyes and on the forehead. A small amount of cool (sometimes cold)&#xD;
           or warm water is instilled into each ear canal, first one and then the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collection for genetic testing.&#xD;

      Objective: This project, Molecular Genetics of Retinal Degenerations will study the&#xD;
      inheritance of genetic retinal degenerations, both Mendelian and complex, in families of many&#xD;
      nationalities and ethnic backgrounds in order to identify the genes that, when mutated, cause&#xD;
      retinal degenerations and the pathophysiology through which they act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The number of subjects to be enrolled has no logical upper limit, but will&#xD;
      be at least 250 and below 5,000 during the next 5 years. The study consists of ascertaining&#xD;
      individuals, and especially families with multiple individuals, affected by retinal&#xD;
      degenerations including retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and also other closely related retinal&#xD;
      degenerations such as Usher syndrome (USH) and Bietti crystalline dystrophy (BCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: These patients and their families will undergo detailed ophthalmological examinations&#xD;
      and, where indicated, additional non-investigational examinations to characterize their&#xD;
      retinal degeneration and determine their affectation status. A blood sample will be collected&#xD;
      from each individual for isolation of DNA and in some individuals for lymphoblastoid&#xD;
      transformation to establish a renewable source of DNA. Linkage analysis, association&#xD;
      analysis, physical mapping, and mutational screening will be carried out to identify the&#xD;
      specific gene and the mutations in it that are associated with retinal degenerations in this&#xD;
      family. If necessary, the gene product will be characterized biochemically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Linkage will be determines using the lod score method and mutations in&#xD;
      specific genes will be assessed using a combination of residue conservation, blosum score,&#xD;
      and molecular modeling. Association will be determined using chi-square and Fisher exact&#xD;
      tests. Biochemical, metabolic, and physiological effects will be individualized to the&#xD;
      specific assay.&#xD;
