  <brief_summary>

      To test the feasibility of an intensive behavioral and pharmacologic tobacco cessation&#xD;
      program for radiation oncology patients and their families/companions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is overwhelming evidence to support tobacco use as the number one cause of preventable&#xD;
      cancer and cardiovascular death. Smoking is responsible for at least 30% of all cancer deaths&#xD;
      and nearly 90% of lung cancer deaths. There is robust phase III randomized data to show&#xD;
      improved smoking cessation with both behavioral strategies as well as pharmacologic&#xD;
      interventions such as bupropion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite significant evidence showing survival, toxicity and quality of life detriments in&#xD;
      cancer patients who continue smoking after diagnosis, roughly one third of cancer patients&#xD;
      continue to use tobacco. There is a relative paucity of data regarding smoking cessation&#xD;
      programs in cancer patient populations. Several single institution, as well as cooperative&#xD;
      group (ECOG), efforts have been published with varying results. However, to date, there are&#xD;
      no published reports on the success of pharmacologic smoking cessation interventions in&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing definitive/curative radiotherapy often receive daily treatment over the&#xD;
      course of three to eight weeks. They are often accompanied and supported daily by family&#xD;
      members or companions, many of whom smoke. This represents a huge exposure to the health care&#xD;
      system and a unique opportunity for intensive intervention in both cancer patients and their&#xD;
      families/companions during their &quot;daily routine&quot; of radiotherapy. To date, there is no&#xD;
      published report on intensive tobacco cessation intervention concurrent with radiotherapy in&#xD;
      cancer patients and their families or companions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a feasibility study of an intensive tobacco cessation program to be delivered to&#xD;
      radiation oncology patients and/or their family/companions concurrent with planned&#xD;
      radiotherapy. This program will feature an intensive behavioral intervention as well as the&#xD;
      pharmacologic agent bupropion.&#xD;
