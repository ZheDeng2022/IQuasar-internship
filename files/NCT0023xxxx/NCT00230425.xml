  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure daily mood changes and to find out whether these mood&#xD;
      changes are related to the ability to maintain attention on a task. Problems with mood are&#xD;
      more common among women however, the association between symptoms of alcohol abuse and mood&#xD;
      syndromes is inconsistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First we hypothesize that women with lifetime diagnoses of alcohol abuse will not demonstrate&#xD;
      higher symptoms of anxiety, depression, neuroticism and mood variability than control groups.&#xD;
      Second, that the severity of these symptoms will not correlate with performance on measures&#xD;
      of sustained attention.&#xD;

      Epidemiological and clinical studies show an association between symptoms of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression (mood) and alcohol abuse. However, the association between alcohol abuse and mood&#xD;
      syndromes is inconsistent. One problem is that mood syndromes tend to be poorly defined.&#xD;
      Also, researchers typically have relied on retrospective recall by patients to evaluate mood&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of this evidence is that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Most mood symptoms improve with withdrawal in inpatient alcoholism programs without&#xD;
           specific treatment of the mood disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Family genetic studies have not shown cosegregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Psychiatric treatment of mood syndromes does not decrease alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The self-treatment view has not been supported by controlled drinking studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome this difficulty, we have recently developed a procedure to measure mood&#xD;
      variability while it is occurring. We ask participants to rate their moods twice a day on a&#xD;
      10 cm straight line anchored by the terms &quot;not at all&quot; and &quot;very much so&quot; (a visual analogue&#xD;
      scale) (VAS). There are 3 separate lines for &quot;anxiety/tension&quot;, &quot;sadness/low mood&quot; and &quot;high&#xD;
      mood&quot;. We then compute a quantitative measure of variability the &quot;mean squared successive&#xD;
      difference statistic&quot; (MSSD). Our earlier work found that this method identified greater mood&#xD;
      variability in individuals with anxiety disorders as compared to individuals without anxiety&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our null hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. That women with lifetime diagnoses of alcohol abuse will not demonstrate higher symptoms&#xD;
      of anxiety, depression, neuroticism and mood variability than control groups and;&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. That the severity of these symptoms will not correlate with performance on measures of&#xD;
      sustained attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MINI diagnostic interview will be used to derive DSM-IV diagnoses. This is a brief&#xD;
      semi-structured diagnostic interview that we have used previously. We have not used an&#xD;
      extensive interview schedule such as the SCID because we are not recruiting specific&#xD;
      diagnostic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete 4 scales as validators of the diary visual analogue&#xD;
      scales. These are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). This is the most widely used self- completed&#xD;
           depression questionnaire. It has 21 items, each has 4 choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Spielberger Trait-State Self-Evaluation Questionnaire (STAI-T). This is a 20 item-&#xD;
           questionnaire, with answers on a 4-point scale. It is the most widely used trait anxiety&#xD;
           inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Mood Disorders Questionnaire. This is a recently developed but well researched&#xD;
           questionnaire to measure high mood. Sixteen questions are in a yes/no format.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 12 items from the Neuroticism Scale of the Eysenck Personality Inventory as modified by&#xD;
           Kendler. These items are answered yes/no.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be females, aged 18-50 years with diagnoses of alcohol abuse. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be chronic medical, psychiatric or brain conditions that might affect mood&#xD;
      variability or test performance. Comorbid drug abuse will not be reason for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only females are included in this study because&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The association between mood symptoms and substance abuse appears to be clearer in women&#xD;
           (In men, other characteristics such as impulsivity and antisocial traits are more&#xD;
           prominent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We already have data on mood variability in predominantly female normal control subjects&#xD;
           from studies in the Department of Psychiatry at Royal University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be tested in their 3rd and 4th weeks of the program, i.e. they will have&#xD;
      been free of alcohol and illicit drug consumption for 3 weeks. Use of other medication will&#xD;
      be noted but will not be an exclusion.&#xD;
