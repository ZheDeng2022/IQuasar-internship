      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ramelteon, once daily&#xD;
      (QD), compared to placebo with Zopiclone in adults with chronic insomnia&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A vast majority of people are affected by chronic insomnia in the western world. Several&#xD;
      studies have looked at this and have estimated that 30% to 48% of the general population is&#xD;
      affected at some time in their life with a form of insomnia that goes on for several months,&#xD;
      and about one third of those are described as severely affected. Daytime symptoms of insomnia&#xD;
      include tiredness, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and irritability. Recent&#xD;
      epidemiologic research focusing on the quality of life has identified significant&#xD;
      insomnia-related conditions that relate to work productivity, health care utilization, and&#xD;
      risk of depression. Insomnia is associated with diminished work output, absenteeism, and&#xD;
      greater rates of accidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the effect of ramelteon on balance/postural stability on Night 14 at&#xD;
      peak plasma concentration levels, compared with placebo and using zopiclone as the reference&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
