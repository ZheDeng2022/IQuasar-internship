      The purpose of this survey is to identify any concerns regarding the following efficacy and&#xD;
      safety-related issues in clinical practice with the new drugs &quot;Fabrazyme for intravenous&#xD;
      infusion 5mg&quot; and &quot;Fabrazyme for intravenous infusion 35mg&quot; and to confirm the safety of&#xD;
      these products in long-term use in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. New adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that cannot be predicted from the Precautions (in&#xD;
           particular, clinically significant ADRs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The incidence of ADRs under the actual conditions of use of the drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Causal factors that might potentially affect safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Efficacy evaluation in long-term use&#xD;
&#xD;
      This survey will be conducted in accordance with the approval condition established for&#xD;
      Fabrazyme:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;To conduct a special surveillance of Efficacy and Safety in long term treatment and&#xD;
      Pediatric with the drug.&quot;&#xD;

      Medical institutions or physicians will be asked to periodically complete the survey forms&#xD;
      for all patients registered. Survey forms include baseline information available, and then&#xD;
      data collected every 6 months, as available including: demographic information, concomitant&#xD;
      medications/therapy, treatment record, ECG, Echocardiogram, computed tomography scan /&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI), Fabry symptoms, labs, functional disorder, blood&#xD;
      concentration of GL-3, and anti-agalsidase beta antibody test (IgE testing) to survey whether&#xD;
      the productions of antibodies to agalsidase beta is a causal factor of treatment-related&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey period shall be approximately 7 years from June 1, 2004 during which survey shall&#xD;
      be undertaken as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The observation period for each patient shall range from 1 to about 7 years after&#xD;
           starting treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration period: June 1, 2004 to March 31, 2010&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survey period: June 1, 2004 to March 31, 2011&#xD;
&#xD;
      In institutions for which retrospective surveys are feasible, the survey period will trace&#xD;
      back to the date of approval (January 29, 2004), as far as possible.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in Japan with the indication of &quot;Fabry Disease&quot; and for whom the usual dosage&#xD;
             and administration is 1mg of agalsidase beta (recombinant) per 1 kg body weight each&#xD;
             time, administered by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because the efficacy evaluation of enzyme replacement therapy with Fabrazyme&#xD;
             [agalsidase beta (recombinant form)] will require the comparison of findings before&#xD;
             and after the start of enzyme replacement therapy, the efficacy evaluation set will be&#xD;
             defined as including patients using Fabrazyme [agalsidase beta (recombinant form)] for&#xD;
             the first time in the post-marketing setting and those for whom it is possible to&#xD;
             obtain retrospective data for before the start of enzyme replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients registered in the post-marketing trials during the post-marketing clinical&#xD;
             trial period.&#xD;
