  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Defecation disorders in children are extremely common especially constipation and fecal&#xD;
      incontinence. International studies show that constipation make up approximately 3% of&#xD;
      Pediatric Outpatient Clinic11 (192) and 25% of Pediatric gastroenterology consultations.&#xD;
      Between 1,5-3% of all 4-12 year olds experience fecal incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constipation and fecal incontinence can be extremely physical unpleasant and can have&#xD;
      significant ramifications for a child's emotional and social functioning eg. low self esteem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though most agree that constipation and faecal incontinence are a considerable problem&#xD;
      worldwide there is disagreement when it comes to a definition and diagnostic tools. Several&#xD;
      definitions have been used. This has led to great difficulties when trying to estimate&#xD;
      prevalence, understand and compare in order to improve different treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is possible to diagnose constipation accurately by using a combination of anamnesis,&#xD;
           stool diary, physical examination and transabdominal ultrasonography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transabdominal ultrasonography is a safe and sensitive diagnostic tool and can be used&#xD;
           as an alternative or substitute to rectal examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose To compare different kinds of diagnostic (tools) investigations in order to identify&#xD;
      the most sensitive and least invasive when diagnosing constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods 60 children referred to the paediatric outpatient clinic with fecal&#xD;
      incontinence or suspicion of constipation. The investigations include anamnesis and physical&#xD;
      examination with rectal examination and transabdominal ultrasonography. Home registration of&#xD;
      a stool diary based on the Bristol Scale for 3 weeks thereafter a Colonic transit time is&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is compared to data from 30 healthy children that have gone through the same&#xD;
      investigations except the CTT that is based on x-rays.&#xD;
