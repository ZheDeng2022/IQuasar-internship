      The goal of this clinical research study is to test the safety of defined green tea catechin&#xD;
      extract at different dose levels. Researchers also want to find out what effects, good and&#xD;
      bad, it may have on individual and their risk for esophagus cancer. Esophagus cancer is an&#xD;
      increased risk associated with Barrett's esophagus. Chemoprevention is the use of certain&#xD;
      drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of defined green tea&#xD;
      catechin extract may prevent esophageal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety (i.e., determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD)) of using Polyphenon E (Poly E) over a six-month period in the&#xD;
      management of patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE) with or without low-grade dysplasia&#xD;
      (LGD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the dose-related biologic effects and pharmacodynamic properties of Poly E&#xD;
      (in order of decreasing priority):&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the efficacy of Poly E in inhibiting phosphorylation of EGFR or Her-2 or akt in&#xD;
      esophageal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the pharmacodynamic profile of Poly E constituents (EGCG, EGC, EC) in&#xD;
      esophageal tissue during and after 6 months of therapy using HPLC and GC-MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate the efficacy of Poly E in reducing or stabilizing metaplasia and dysplasia of&#xD;
      esophageal Barrett's mucosa using visual endoscopic measurements and histological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the efficacy of Poly E in modulating surrogate biomarkers in esophageal mucosa -&#xD;
      degrees of tetraploidy and aneuploidy; expression of cyclin D1, COX-2, EGFR, Her-2, akt, and&#xD;
      Ki-67; LOH at 9p (p16) and 17p (p53); apoptotic index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine the efficacy of Poly E in inhibiting methylation of p16. VII. Determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of Poly E in modulating eicosanoid levels (including PGE2) and lipoxygenase profiles&#xD;
      in esophageal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The esophagus is the tube used for swallowing that connects the mouth to the stomach.&#xD;
      Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the tissue lining of the esophagus is abnormal.&#xD;
      It develops in some people who have heartburn, reflux disease (acid in the esophagus), or&#xD;
      esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus). Patients with this condition have a higher risk&#xD;
      of developing a type of cancer of the esophagus called adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyphenon E (Poly E [defined green tea catechin extract]) is a low-caffeinated polyphenol&#xD;
      mixture that is made from green tea. Poly E contains a chemical called Epigallocatechin-3&#xD;
      (EGCG) and other chemicals called &quot;catechins.&quot; Research has shown that green tea, Poly E, and&#xD;
      EGCG may be effective in preventing cancer. Poly E, as used in this study, does not contain&#xD;
      green tea, but is made from products of green tea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening&#xD;
      tests.&quot; These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the&#xD;
      study. These procedures are part of regular care for someone at increased risk of esophagus&#xD;
      cancer. If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will be&#xD;
      up to your study doctor. You will have a complete physical exam, and your medical history&#xD;
      will be reviewed. You will also have routine blood tests (about 2-3 tablespoons), as well as&#xD;
      an electrocardiogram (ECG--a test to measure the electrical activity of the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are eligible to take part in the study, and you choose to take part, you will have to&#xD;
      complete a 1-month &quot;wash-out period.&quot; The &quot;wash-out period&quot; is a period in which you must not&#xD;
      take medications, herbs, vitamins or mineral supplements that contain tea compounds. The&#xD;
      &quot;wash-out&quot; is a 30-day period before the baseline endoscopy. Because caffeine and tea may&#xD;
      affect the results of this trial, you will be asked to not drink any tea-containing products.&#xD;
      You will also be asked to record the amount of caffeine-containing foods and medications that&#xD;
      you consume. You will be given a list of caffeine-containing foods and medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the &quot;wash-out&quot; period, you will need to have a complete endoscopy and biopsy of your&#xD;
      esophagus. This is part of regular care for someone at increased risk for esophagus cancer.&#xD;
      This procedure will be performed in the outpatient setting. An endoscopy is an exam used by&#xD;
      your doctor to look at your esophagus (the tube that connects your mouth and stomach) and&#xD;
      stomach. Your doctor will place a thin scope into your mouth and carefully move the scope&#xD;
      down the esophagus and into the stomach. During the endoscopy, you will have a standard&#xD;
      biopsy, and a small area of abnormal tissue will be &quot;snipped&quot; off. The sample will be sent to&#xD;
      the lab to look at the chemical and structural make-up of the cells of the esophageal lining.&#xD;
      This test will be used to find out the extent of the Barrett's Esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test within 2 weeks&#xD;
      of being assigned to a treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will then be randomly assigned (as in a roll of the dice) by computer into one of 4 study&#xD;
      groups. You have an equal chance of being placed in each group. Neither you nor your doctor&#xD;
      can choose the group you will be in. Neither you, the research staff, nor your doctor will&#xD;
      know if you are taking Poly E or placebo capsules. In this study, you will get either defined&#xD;
      green tea catechin extract (at 1 of 3 different doses) or the placebo (a harmless drug that&#xD;
      looks like the study drug but has no medical benefit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Group 1 (&quot;Arm I&quot;), you will begin taking 1 capsule of defined green&#xD;
      tea catechin extract orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Group 2 (&quot;Arm II&quot;), you will begin taking 2 capsules of defined green&#xD;
      tea catechin extract PO BID for the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Group 3 (&quot;Arm III&quot;), you will begin taking 3 capsules of defined green&#xD;
      tea catechin extract PO BID for the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Group 4 (&quot;Arm IV&quot;), you will begin taking 1-3 capsules of placebo PO&#xD;
      BID for the next 6 months. The numbers you take in this group will depend on the amount of&#xD;
      EGCG you are assigned to receive. Each 200 mg Poly E capsule contains 200 mg of EGCG. The&#xD;
      dosage of Poly E is based on the EGCG content. The study capsules do not contain green tea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to keep a study diary during your entire participation in this study. In&#xD;
      this diary, you will record exactly when you take each dose of study drug, and how much you&#xD;
      took each time. You will also be asked to record the amount of caffeine-containing foods and&#xD;
      medications that you consume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue your histamine antagonist (for example, Zantac or Tagamet) or proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitor (for example, Nexium or Prilosec) for any symptoms you may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain tests and procedures will be performed during the study, to see how the treatment is&#xD;
      affecting your body. These tests will be done every 2 weeks for the first month, then once a&#xD;
      month until the completion of 6 months of treatment. You will have 20-minute follow-up&#xD;
      visits, that will including checking for any side effects and counting and writing down how&#xD;
      much medication you have taken. You will have blood drawn (about 2-3 tablespoons) for routine&#xD;
      tests, and you will also have urine tests (1 sample is less than 1 tablespoon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Barrett's esophagus usually have an endoscopy every 1-3 years. For this study,&#xD;
      it will be performed twice (at the first visit and at the 6-month visit). You will have to&#xD;
      sign a separate consent form for each endoscopy. You cannot take aspirin, aspirin-containing&#xD;
      substances, coumadin (warfarin), heparin, or iron supplements for 5 days before each&#xD;
      endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be taken off study if intolerable side effects occur, if the study doctor believes it&#xD;
      is in your best interest, if you do not follow the study rules, or if the sponsor decides to&#xD;
      stop the study for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you have finished taking 6 months of &quot;treatment&quot; (either the Poly E or the placebo), you&#xD;
      will have a follow-up endoscopy and biopsy. You will have follow-up visits scheduled for 3&#xD;
      months and 6 months after completing treatment. During these visits, you will be checked for&#xD;
      side effects, blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, and you will&#xD;
      also have urine tests (1 sample is less than 1 tablespoon) performed. You will be contacted&#xD;
      by telephone monthly after completing treatment, to check for side effects that you may be&#xD;
      experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Poly E has been authorized for use in research only. Up to&#xD;
      55 participants will take part in this multicenter study. About 12 will be enrolled at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
