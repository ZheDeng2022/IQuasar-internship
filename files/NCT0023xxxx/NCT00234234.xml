  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease which is&#xD;
      characterized by joint inflammation (clinical involvement), by osteo-cartilaginous lesions&#xD;
      (structural damage) and generally by bone involvement. All those features lead to great&#xD;
      disability. Because it represents a major problem of the public health care system, RA has&#xD;
      been selected as one of the main objectives of the government for the next five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RA patients who do not respond to DMARDs require a treatment by TNF-a blocking agents.&#xD;
      However, no information is available to predict the clinical, structural and bone responses&#xD;
      to those new drugs that can be responsible of severe side-effects. Moreover, they are&#xD;
      particularly expensive since their yearly cost is estimated between 75000 and 112500 k euros&#xD;
      for the G4 region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present research project is to determine potential predictive factors of&#xD;
      the response to a new TNF-a blocker ie adalimumab. To address this question, several&#xD;
      investigations will be performed including measurement of different blood markers,&#xD;
      particularly bone markers, well-defined autoantibodies and new autoantibody populations&#xD;
      identified by proteomic analysis, large-scale analysis of gene expression with cDNA arrays&#xD;
      from blood mononuclear cells, and use of different imaging tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria of judgement will be the clinical, structural and bone responses to those new&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study requires the recruitment of about 100 patients receiving adalimumab for a 1-year&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, we hope to identify predictive factors of the response to&#xD;
      adalimumab, which will lead to a better management of this TNF-a blocker. Indeed, they will&#xD;
      be prescribed only for the patients who are likely to respond to those drugs. Thus, this&#xD;
      study should allow to elaborate theranostic algorithms. Such an approach will have great&#xD;
      benefits for the patients: more rapid efficacy, less severe side-reactions and lower costs.&#xD;
