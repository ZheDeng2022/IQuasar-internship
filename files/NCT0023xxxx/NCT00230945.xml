      The purpose of this study is to determine if osteoarthritis patients and their spouses&#xD;
      experience greater health benefits from a couples-oriented psychosocial intervention than a&#xD;
      patient-oriented psychosocial intervention, and to determine if each intervention is more&#xD;
      beneficial than patient usual medical care.&#xD;

      The patient-oriented education and support intervention (PES) is based on the Arthritis&#xD;
      Self-Management Program, a group intervention that consists of 6 weekly 2 hour sessions shown&#xD;
      to successfully reduce pain severity and depressive symptomatology and to enhance a sense of&#xD;
      efficacy in managing arthritis pain and other symptoms. The PES specifically focuses on&#xD;
      self-management of arthritis and no spouses, family members, or friends participate in PES&#xD;
      sessions. Major components of the sessions include information regarding the etiology and&#xD;
      treatment of arthritis, self-management strategies for managing pain and strengthening&#xD;
      joints, the benefits of exercise, communication skills, and ways to effectively cope with&#xD;
      negative emotions. At the end of each weekly session, each participant sets a health-related&#xD;
      goal (e.g., walk for exercise three times over the next week). At the beginning of the next&#xD;
      session each participant reports on his or her success in meeting this goal and receives&#xD;
      feedback from the group. Participants in the PES are encouraged to communicate with, and be a&#xD;
      source of support to, one another both within and outside the sessions. The PES facilitator&#xD;
      is an individual who was trained by staff of the Arthritis Foundation to lead the Arthritis&#xD;
      Self-Management Program and who follows a detailed intervention manual created for this&#xD;
      Program and for the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The couple-oriented education and support intervention (CES) is a group education and support&#xD;
      intervention that consisted of 6 weekly 2 hour sessions attended by individuals with OA and&#xD;
      their spouses. All components of the PES are covered in the CES using the standard format,&#xD;
      and topics are framed as couples' issues whenever possible. An overarching framework&#xD;
      introduced in the first session of the CES is that pain is a complex experience which can be&#xD;
      influenced by thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; spouses can influence and be affected by&#xD;
      these same thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; and spouses' concerns and experiences as&#xD;
      support providers are important to address. Each of the next 5 sessions is supplemented by a&#xD;
      component that was linked to a topic covered in the PES and explicitly extended to couples.&#xD;
      For example, a topic of the third session of the PES deals with managing fatigue and the&#xD;
      supplemental component for this session provides information on the most effective and&#xD;
      ineffective strategies for requesting spousal assistance (e.g., verbal versus nonverbal pain&#xD;
      expression and the need to be clear about help needed) and providing spousal assistance&#xD;
      (e.g., consider timing and amount of assistance desired). The supplemental components for the&#xD;
      4 remaining sessions address spouse encouragement and practice of cognitive or behavioral&#xD;
      pain management strategies (e.g., distraction and progressive muscle relaxation); supportive&#xD;
      and unsupportive spousal communications; reducing negative emotional contagion between&#xD;
      partners; and couples' strategies for managing medications. At the end of each weekly session&#xD;
      of the CES, each individual with OA and his or her spouse sets health-related goals for the&#xD;
      following week and their success in meeting these goals iss reviewed with the group at the&#xD;
      beginning of the next session. Spouses are instructed to set goals that were facilitative of&#xD;
      their partners' goals whenever possible. Couples in the CES are encouraged to communicate&#xD;
      with, and be a source of support to, one another both within and outside the course. The CES&#xD;
      facilitator is trained in the Arthritis Self-Management Program by staff of the Arthritis&#xD;
      Foundation and in the couples materials by study investigators, and follows a detailed&#xD;
      intervention manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The no-treatment control group received usual medical care only.&#xD;
