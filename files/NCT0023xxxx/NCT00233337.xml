        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients were eligible for inclusion if they met all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female aged 18 or older (prior to Amendment 1: more than 2 years old)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-immune patients suffering from acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, or mixed&#xD;
             infection including P. falciparum, with parasitemia of less than or equal to 2%&#xD;
             asexual P.falciparum parasites, confirmed by microscopy using Giemsa-stained thick&#xD;
             film.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-immune patients were regarded as those who had not spent the first five years of&#xD;
             their life, nor the last five years in a malaria endemic area, and did not have acute&#xD;
             P. falciparum malaria diagnosed during those past five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-immune patients who had received prophylaxis with anti-malarials (excluding&#xD;
             halofantrine) were included only if clear progression of acute P. falciparum infection&#xD;
             was documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients were eligible to participate in the study if they were of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential or had a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) at&#xD;
             screening, and using an acceptable contraceptive method&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients, who had been informed of the study procedures and medication, and had given&#xD;
             written informed consent and were willing to comply with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients were to be excluded from participation if they met any of the following&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known hypersensitivity to artemether or lumefantrine&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Signs/symptoms indicative of severe/complicated malaria according to the WHO&#xD;
                  classification (e.g. cerebral malaria, see Post-text supplement 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Treatment with artemisinin derivatives within the previous 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concurrent administration of other treatment / prophylaxis for malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concurrent administration of medications with potential hemolytic effects&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients taking any drug metabolized by cytochrome isoenzymes CYP3A4 or CYP2D6&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Received any other investigational drugs in the last 4 weeks before entry into&#xD;
                  the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Severe cardiac impairment (i.e. evidence of existing cardiac conduction defect or&#xD;
                  overt symptoms of cardiac dysfunction or abnormalities of baseline ECG not&#xD;
                  associated with acute malaria); clinically relevant bradycardia or congestive&#xD;
                  cardiac failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction; pre-existing&#xD;
                  prolongation of the QT interval; history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Having received halofantrine or any other drug known to influence cardiac&#xD;
                  function within 4 weeks prior to Screening visit or taking other drugs that are&#xD;
                  known to prolong the QT interval, including class IA and III antiarrhythmics,&#xD;
                  neuroleptics, antidepressive agents, certain antibiotics (including some&#xD;
                  macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents), certain&#xD;
                  non-sedating antihistaminics (terfenadine, astemizole) and cisapride&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of splenectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically significant abnormal baseline hematology (not associated with acute&#xD;
                  malaria) or clinical chemistry parameters, including evidence of hepatic or renal&#xD;
                  impairment, known disturbances of electrolyte balance e.g. hypokalemia or&#xD;
                  hypomagnesaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serious, uncontrolled disease (including serious psychological disorders) likely&#xD;
                  to interfere with the study, or concomitant disease which could mask the response&#xD;
                  to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unlikely, in the opinion of the investigator, to complete the dosing or follow-up&#xD;
                  periods, or who have evidence of alcohol, drug or solvent abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women who are pregnant, lactating or of childbearing potential and not using an&#xD;
                  acceptable contraceptive method were also excluded.&#xD;
