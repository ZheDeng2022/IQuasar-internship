  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of daily topiramate versus&#xD;
      placebo for the treatment of obese subjects with dyslipidemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topiramate is not approved for the treatment of obesity. Studies have shown that topiramate&#xD;
      reduces weight in obese patients with or without Type 2 diabetes, and may have the adjunctive&#xD;
      benefit of reducing triglyceride and cholesterol levels in these patients. This double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo controlled study evaluates the long-term efficacy of topiramate for reduction of&#xD;
      weight and triglyceride levels in obese patients with borderline to high&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia, and the safety and tolerability of topiramate in this patient&#xD;
      population. The study consists of four phases: 4-week enrollment (screening) phase, 8-week&#xD;
      titration phase (topiramate dose will be increased from 16mg/day to the assigned dose),&#xD;
      52-week maintenance phase, and 6-week follow-up. Effectiveness of topiramate will be&#xD;
      evaluated by multiple measurements such as change in body weight, body mass index, fasting&#xD;
      serum triglyceride levels, cholesterol and other lipid profiles. Safety evaluations will&#xD;
      include incidence/severity of adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory results. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that topiramate as compared to placebo will provide a greater percent reduction&#xD;
      in body weight and in fasting serum triglycerides from Week 0 (baseline) to Week 60. After&#xD;
      the initial 8-weeks titration phase, the patients will be randomized to receive either 96mg&#xD;
      (48mg twice daily) or 192mg (96mg twice daily) topiramate or placebo (twice daily) by mouth&#xD;
      for 52 weeks.&#xD;
