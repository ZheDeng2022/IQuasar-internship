    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to directly compare the bone forming effects of 20 microg/day of&#xD;
      teriparatide with those of 2 g/day strontium ranelate as measured by the histomorphometric&#xD;
      variables and biochemical bone formation markers after 6 months of therapy in postmenopausal&#xD;
      women with osteoporosis.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ambulatory, postmenopausal women aged 45 to 90 years inclusive at the time of entry&#xD;
             into the trial, whose last menstrual period or bilateral oophorectomy occurred at&#xD;
             least 5 years prior to entry into the trial. Women below the age of 55 years in whom a&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy cannot clearly be documented must have their postmenopausal&#xD;
             status confirmed by a serum FSH level greater or equal to 30 IU/L and serum estradiol&#xD;
             level lower or equal to 20 pg/ml or lower or equal to 73 pmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Free of severe or chronically disabling conditions other than osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to use a pen-type injection delivery system satisfactorily in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator and willing to be trained on and use the pen-injector on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Without language barrier, cooperative, expected to return for all follow-up&#xD;
             procedures, and have given informed consent after being informed of the risks,&#xD;
             medications, and procedures to be used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Posterior-anterior lumbar spine (L-1 through L-4) BMD and/or femoral neck BMD and/or&#xD;
             total hip BMD measurement at least 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below the average bone&#xD;
             mass for young women (T-score below or equal to -2.5 standard deviations). The lumbar&#xD;
             spine and hip BMD assessment and the determination of the patient's eligibility for&#xD;
             entry into the screening phase will be made by the individual investigator. Any lumbar&#xD;
             vertebra that cannot be analyzed due to artifacts, severe crush fracture, osteophytes,&#xD;
             or other abnormalities, should be excluded from the analysis. A minimum of two lumbar&#xD;
             vertebrae in the L-1 through L-4 region must be evaluable by DXA if this is the only&#xD;
             anatomical site where the BMD cut-off level less than -2.5 SD is demonstrated. A DXA&#xD;
             assessment performed within three months prior to Visit 1 may be acceptable for&#xD;
             patient's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Normal or clinically insignificant abnormal laboratory values (as defined by the&#xD;
             investigator) including serum calcium, PTH(1 84), alkaline phosphatase.&#xD;
&#xD;
             EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of unresolved skeletal diseases that affect bone metabolism other than&#xD;
             postmenopausal osteoporosis including Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy,&#xD;
             osteomalacia, any secondary causes of osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism (uncorrected),&#xD;
             and intestinal malabsorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. In the opinion of the investigator, have any medical or anatomical condition that&#xD;
             potentially could put the patient at additional risk of an adverse event due to the&#xD;
             biopsy procedure (for example, coagulation abnormality, anticoagulant medication,&#xD;
             extreme obesity, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have undergone two previous iliac bone biopsies (one in each iliac crest). Patients&#xD;
             with one previous iliac bone biopsy are eligible provided that the new sample is&#xD;
             obtained from the contralateral iliac crest.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of malignant neoplasms in the 5 years prior to Visit 1, with the exception of&#xD;
             superficial basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been&#xD;
             definitively treated. Patients with carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix treated&#xD;
             definitively more than 1 year prior to entry into the study may be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Increased baseline risk of osteosarcoma; this includes subjects with Paget's disease&#xD;
             of the bone, previous primary skeletal malignancy, or skeletal exposure to therapeutic&#xD;
             irradiation, i.e. prior external beam or implant radiation therapy. As an elevation of&#xD;
             serum skeletal alkaline phosphatase activity may indicate the presence of Paget's&#xD;
             disease, an unexplained elevation of this enzyme activity will also be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Abnormal thyroid function not corrected by therapy. Normal thyroid function may be&#xD;
             documented by a normal TSH during the screening phase or a combination of clinical and&#xD;
             biochemical parameters which, in the judgment of the investigator and the Lilly&#xD;
             Clinical Research Physician, sufficiently establishes the presence of normal thyroid&#xD;
             function.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Active liver disease or clinical jaundice.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Significantly impaired renal function as defined by either of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine that, in the opinion of the investigator, indicates significant&#xD;
                  renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Measured or calculated endogenous creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min using&#xD;
                  the following Cockcroft Gault formula for creatinine clearance (ClCr) for women:&#xD;
&#xD;
             ClCr (mL/minute) = [[(140-age) x weight (kg)]x0.85] / [72 x serum Cr (mg/dL)]&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Current or past treatment with any bisphosphonate, parathyroid hormone or its analogs,&#xD;
             androgens or other anabolic steroids or therapeutic doses of fluorides at any time&#xD;
             prior to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Past treatment (more than 12 months before Visit 2) with a selective estrogen receptor&#xD;
             modulator (SERM), nasal or injectable calcitonin, oral, transdermal, or injectable&#xD;
             estrogens, progestins, estrogen analogs, estrogen agonists, estrogen antagonists or&#xD;
             tibolone is allowed. Previous or current use of fluoridated water or topical dental&#xD;
             fluoride treatments are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Treatment with Vitamin D greater than 50,000 IU/week, or with any dose of calcitriol&#xD;
             or Vitamin D analogs or agonists in the 6 months prior to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids in the last month prior to Visit 2 or for more&#xD;
             than 14 days in the 1 year prior to Visit 2. Ophthalmic, otic, topical, orally&#xD;
             inhaled, nasally inhaled, or intra-articular corticosteroid therapy may be used&#xD;
             without these restrictions. However, orally inhaled or nasally inhaled corticosteroids&#xD;
             in doses greater than 840 micrograms/day beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent for&#xD;
             more than 14 days in the last year prior to randomization will be disqualifying.&#xD;
