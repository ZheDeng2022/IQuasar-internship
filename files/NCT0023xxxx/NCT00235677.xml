      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a therapeutic procedure, involving endoscopic&#xD;
      suturing, for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) compared to a sham procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses tested in this study were that active treatment would: 1) decrease the use of&#xD;
      antisecretory medication, 2) decrease GERD symptoms, 3) improve quality of life, and 4)&#xD;
      reduce esophageal acid exposure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and the chronic, often lifelong, use of antisecretory&#xD;
      medication have great clinical and economical implications for the patient, practicing&#xD;
      physician and society in general. The currently available medication in GERD is very&#xD;
      effective against heartburn, but less against the symptom of regurgitation. Surgical&#xD;
      antireflux treatment offers a good alternative. The current surgical approach, a laparoscopic&#xD;
      fundoplication, is safe and effective (a 90% reduction in use of antireflux medication), but&#xD;
      in a significant subgroup of patients new symptoms arise (dysphagia, bloating) and&#xD;
      perioperative morbidity, as well as financial costs are relatively high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An endoscopic suturing system has been developed, offering a minimally invasive antireflux&#xD;
      treatment, which can be performed in an outpatient setting. The procedure aims to create an&#xD;
      endoscopic fundoplication, and could possibly serve as an alternative to antireflux&#xD;
      medication and surgery. Recent, uncontrolled studies, have shown that the results of the&#xD;
      endoscopic suturing system are satisfactory and that the procedure is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-center, double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial was conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic gastroplication by the Endocinch suturing system. Sixty&#xD;
      patients with daily symptoms of GERD and abnormal esophageal 24-hr pH monitoring were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to three endoscopic gastroplications (n = 20), to a sham procedure (n = 20)&#xD;
      or to observation (n = 20). Primary endpoints were proton pump inhibitor use and GERD&#xD;
      symptoms. Secondary endpoints were quality of life, 24-hr esophageal acid exposure,&#xD;
      esophageal manometry and the occurrence of adverse events. Follow-up assessments were&#xD;
      performed at 3 months. The research nurse and patients in the active and sham groups were&#xD;
      blinded to the procedure assignment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  typical symptoms of GERD (i.e., heartburn, regurgitation) for &gt; 6 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pathological esophageal acid exposure after discontinuation of medical therapy, proven&#xD;
             by ambulatory 24-hour pH-monitoring with &gt; 5% of time a pH &lt; 4 and a&#xD;
