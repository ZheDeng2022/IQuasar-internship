      We conducted a randomized controlled trial of adjuvant interferon therapy in patients with&#xD;
      predominantly hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to investigate whether the&#xD;
      prognosis after hepatic resection could be improved. Since February 1999, patients with no&#xD;
      residual disease after hepatic resection for HCC were randomly assigned with stratification&#xD;
      by pTNM stage to receive no treatment (control group), interferon alpha-2b 10 MIU/m2 (IFN-I&#xD;
      group) or 30 MIU/m2 (IFN-II group) thrice weekly for 16 weeks. Enrollment to the IFN-II group&#xD;
      was terminated from January 2000 because adverse effects resulted in treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation in the first 6 patients. By June 2002, 40 patients each had been enrolled&#xD;
      into the control group and IFN-I group. The baseline clinical, laboratory and tumor&#xD;
      characteristics of both groups were comparable. The 1- and 5-year survival rates were 85% and&#xD;
      61%, respectively for the control group and 97% and 79%, respectively for the IFN-I group&#xD;
      (P=0.137). After adjusting for the confounding prognostic factors in a Cox model, the&#xD;
      relative risk of death for interferon treatment was 0.42 (95% CI 0.17 - 1.05; P=0.063).&#xD;
      Exploratory subset analysis showed that adjuvant interferon had no survival benefit for pTNM&#xD;
      stage I/II tumor (5-year survival 90% in both groups; P=0.917) but prevented early recurrence&#xD;
      and improved the 5-year survival of patients with stage III/IVA tumor from 24% to 68%&#xD;
      (P=0.038). In conclusion, in a group of patients with predominantly hepatitis B-related HCC,&#xD;
      adjuvant interferon therapy prevented early recurrence and improved survival in those with&#xD;
      pTNM stage III/IVA tumors.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second commonest cause of cancer death in Hong&#xD;
           Kong and the majority are hepatitis B related. Hepatic resection has remained the only&#xD;
           therapeutic option that can offer these patients a chance of long-term survival.&#xD;
           Although the safety of hepatectomy has improved, postoperative recurrences are frequent.&#xD;
           Depending on the size of the primary tumors, recent reports from Japan, France and Hong&#xD;
           Kong1 showed that the postoperative recurrence rate was 20 to 64% at one year and 57 to&#xD;
           81% at 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           While the hepatic remnant is the predominant site of recurrence, involvement of&#xD;
           extrahepatic organs was not infrequent. There are three possible mechanisms for the&#xD;
           development of recurrent disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) residual tumor cells due to an inadequate resection margin ii) subclinical metastasis&#xD;
           that occurs before or during hepatic resection iii) metachronous multicentric&#xD;
           hepatocarcinogenesis which may be related to the underlying necroinflammation of chronic&#xD;
           active hepatitis and oncogenic activities of hepatitis viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The surgeon's attempt to prevent recurrence by more extensive resection is prohibited by&#xD;
           the need to preserve hepatic function. Futhermore, even a major hepatic resection cannot&#xD;
           guarantee freedom from recurrence since metachronous multicentric tumors can develop in&#xD;
           the entire liver. Theorectically, total hepatectomy and liver transplantation removes&#xD;
           both the subclinical metastases in the liver and prevent metachronous lesions.&#xD;
           Unfortunately, with immunosuppressive therapy, recurrences are frequent and tumors grow&#xD;
           more rapidly, thus, illustrating the importance of the host immune surveillance in&#xD;
           preventing the development of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The use of postoperative regional and systemic chemotherapy has been reported. Although&#xD;
           retrospective studies have shown encouraging results, there are only limited number of&#xD;
           prospective trials. The favourable result of the use of oral&#xD;
           1-hexylcarbomyl-5-fluorouracil in a multi-center trial as reported by Yamamoto and&#xD;
           colleagues was questionable since treatment was suspended due to side-effects in 44% of&#xD;
           the patients. Our single-center prospective randomised study performed at Queen Mary&#xD;
           Hospital (QMH) using a combination of transarterial chemoembolisation and systemic&#xD;
           epirubicin showed a higher extrahepatic recurrence rate and worse outcome with the use&#xD;
           of adjuvant chemotherapy. The reasons for the failure of adjuvant chemotherapy include:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) HCC is slow-growing and hence cytotoxic drug resistant. ii) the associated liver&#xD;
           cirrhosis limits the maximum tolerated intensity of chemotherapy iii) the anticancer&#xD;
           agents may adversely affect the host immunity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interferon alpha-2b&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interferon alpha-2b is a recombinant form of human interferon. Interferons are cytokines&#xD;
           possessing anti-viral, anti-proliferative and immunodulatory effects. Interferon may&#xD;
           halt the replication of both hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus, thus, reducing the&#xD;
           severity of the chronic active hepatitis. The histologic activity of chronic active&#xD;
           hepatitis is an important risk factor for recurrence related to metachronous&#xD;
           multicentric hepatocarcinogenesis and the use of interferon has been shown to reduce the&#xD;
           incidence of HCC in patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C and possibly hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interferon has a powerful anti-proliferative effect on hepatoma cell-line PLC/PRF/5 in a&#xD;
           dose-dependent manner both in-vitro and in-vivo. The use of interferon has been applied&#xD;
           to patients with inoperable HCC with a tumour regression rate and survival rate superior&#xD;
           to that of placebo-control or chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with HCC have considerably reduced&#xD;
           cytotoxicity against hepatoma cell lines. Interferon has been shown to normalise the&#xD;
           T-lymphocyte subpopullation and enhance the cytotoxic activity against an&#xD;
           HBsAg-producing hepatoma cell line in-vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Interferon adverse effects&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interferon alpha-2b is registered for treatment of HCC and chronic hepatitis B in Hong&#xD;
           Kong. In patients with unresectable HCC, interferon has a much lower incidence of fatal&#xD;
           side-effects when compared to doxorubicin. Most patients experience flu-like symptoms&#xD;
           including fever, headache, fatigue and myalgia which usually subside spontaneously with&#xD;
           continuation of treatment. Less common but more serious adverse effects include&#xD;
           alopecia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, depression, irritability, and mental&#xD;
           deterioration. The adverse effects are dose-dependent and the majority are reversible&#xD;
           with a reduction in dosage. The use of high-dose interferon has been well-tolerated in&#xD;
           clinical trials involving patients with unresectable HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interferon has anti-viral, anti-proliferative and immunodulatory activities. It has been used&#xD;
      clinically in the treatment of unresectable HCC as well as viral hepatitis B and C. It can&#xD;
      potentially reduce the incidence of recurrence due to residual tumour cells or metachronous&#xD;
      multicentric disease in patients after resection for HCC.&#xD;
