  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether E1 and G1 are safe and effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. The disease is characterised by insulin&#xD;
      resistance and a compensated state of hyperinsulinemia. In most individual, hyperglycemia&#xD;
      results from a failure of pancreatic beta cells insulin secretory capacity to adequately&#xD;
      compensate for insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Treatment for type 2 diabetes is&#xD;
      achieved by dietary control, or a combination of diet and oral hypoglycemic agents or&#xD;
      insulin. As the disease progress, many type 2 diabetic patients eventually require insulin as&#xD;
      primary therapy to achieve glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent diabetic research has increasingly focused on pancreatic islet cell replacement,&#xD;
      either by islet cell transplantation or by endogenous regeneration of islet cells. During&#xD;
      fetal development, islet precursor cells proliferate and differentiate into mature beta cells&#xD;
      capable of producing insulin. This process is known as islet cell neogenesis. Islet cell&#xD;
      neogenesis normally ceases around birth, however, the adult pancreas still retains&#xD;
      significant potential for islet regeneration, as shown by tissue repair following pancreatic&#xD;
      injury. Pre-clinical studies have shown that E1 and G1 can re-establish islet cell neogenesis&#xD;
      and increase insulin production in diabetic animal models. In type 2 diabetic patients,&#xD;
      treatment with E1 and G1 may result in islet cell regeneration. This therapeutic approach may&#xD;
      improve beta cell function, restore the loss of insulin secretory capacity and also benefit&#xD;
      patients on oral hypoglycemic agents by delaying insulin use.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, 30 type 2 diabetic patients requiring oral hypoglycemic therapy with Metformin&#xD;
      and/or Thiazolidinedione will be randomized. Twenty (20) patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive active study medication and 10 patients will be randomized to receive vehicle&#xD;
      control. After undergoing screening procedures, potential patients will enter a 14 day&#xD;
      baseline phase where baseline data will be collected. Pending successful completion of the&#xD;
      baseline phase, patient will enter a 28-day treatment phase where they will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either once daily subcutaneous injections of E1 plus G1, as separate injections or&#xD;
      once daily subcutaneous injections of vehicle control (as 2 separate injections). Patients&#xD;
      will receive once daily doses in the morning after breakfast for a period of 28 days. Upon&#xD;
      completion of treatment, all patients will continue in the follow-up phase for an additional&#xD;
      6 months and will return to the clinic for monthly visits. Throughout the study, patients&#xD;
      will remain on their current oral hypoglycemic therapy with Metformin and/or&#xD;
      Thiazolidinedione and will maintain a diary record of blood glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body's ability to control glucose will be assessed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).&#xD;
      After an overnight fast, patients will be asked to drink a solution containing a known amount&#xD;
      of glucose. Blood samples for glucose and insulin measurements will be obtained before the&#xD;
      patients drink the glucose solution, and again 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 2 hours after the&#xD;
      glucose is consumed. This test will be performed at frequent intervals during the study.&#xD;
