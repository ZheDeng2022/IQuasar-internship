      This is research study for women diagnosed with breast cancer and major depression. Women&#xD;
      with breast cancer who are depressed may report greater pain, poorer quality of life and&#xD;
      worse overall functioning than those without depression. The study will determine whether or&#xD;
      not bupropion extended release (Wellbutrin XLTM) is useful in lessening the symptoms of&#xD;
      depression in women with breast cancer. One reason for conducting this research with&#xD;
      bupropion extended release (Wellbutrin XLTM) instead of another antidepressant is because&#xD;
      bupropion has a lower likelihood of causing the side effects of weight gain, sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction, and fatigue, which may be important for women with breast cancer and may even&#xD;
      have a beneficial effect on these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupropion extended release (Wellbutrin XL™)is approved by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depression.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women aged 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of breast cancer, confirmed by histopathology; Stages 0, I, II, IIIA, or&#xD;
             IIIB&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (DSM-IV-TR)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) depression subscale&#xD;
             score of 11 or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; Montgomery and Asberg, 1979) score&#xD;
             of 25 or greater at Screening and Baseline visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of antidepressants in a previous episode of major depression or in the past for&#xD;
             any other indication does not affect the patient's inclusion in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During the current episode of major depressive disorder, as stated in the Exclusion&#xD;
             criteria, failure to respond to one or more adequate trials of an antidepressant will&#xD;
             exclude the patient from the study since this is not a study of &quot;treatment-resistant&#xD;
             depression&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During the study, the patient may not use any other antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of another current clinically significant Axis I disorder like bipolar&#xD;
             disorder, schizophrenia, or panic disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current (in past 6 months) comorbid active substance abuse or dependence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to respond to one or more adequate trials of an antidepressant in the current&#xD;
             episode of MDD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A reduction in MADRS score of 20% or greater from Screening to Baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the&#xD;
             Investigator would increase risk of adverse effects with bupropion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of an eating disorder, seizures, head injury, or other intracranial pathology&#xD;
             because these conditions are usually contraindications to the use of bupropion XL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous allergy or intolerance to bupropion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients judged to be at significant suicidal risk&#xD;
