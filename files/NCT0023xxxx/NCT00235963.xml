      To determine whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin prevents or ameliorates&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced delayed vasospasm and its ischemic consequences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mortality rate of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) approaches 50% within the 1st&#xD;
      24 hours of ictus. Patients who survive can subsequently develop a progressive vasospasm of&#xD;
      large cerebral arteries, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Vasospasm can be&#xD;
      of varying severity, and only a small portion of patients with vasospasm develop clinical&#xD;
      signs or symptoms. Patients with severe vasospasm are prone to develop ischemic deficits,&#xD;
      which, if untreated, will progress into ischemic infarcts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms of vasospasm have been subject to intense investigation. Nitric oxide&#xD;
      (NO)-cGMP system has attracted particular attention. Under normal physiological conditions,&#xD;
      NO synthesized by endothelia NO synthase (eNOS) stimulates vascular smooth muscle cGMP&#xD;
      production, which in turn causes smooth muscle relaxation. Vasospasm impairs&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent dilations, suggesting that SAH induces a state of NO deficiency within&#xD;
      cerebral arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several potential mechanisms of such an NO deficiency. Hemoglobin is a potent&#xD;
      scavenger of NO, and when applied extraluminal it binds NO and inhibits its action. Presence&#xD;
      of perivascular hemoglobin may contribute to development of vasospasm by reducing the&#xD;
      availability of NO. It has been shown that adventitial applied hemoglobin can inhibit basal&#xD;
      NO activity and that in vivo adventitial exposure to whole blood leads to a reduction in&#xD;
      basal cGMP levels in association with vasospasm of cerebral arteries. Similarly, superoxide&#xD;
      also reacts with NO and acts as an NO scavenger. Superoxide production is increased after&#xD;
      SAH, which may in part be responsible for inhibition of NO-dependent vasodilation. Free&#xD;
      radical scavengers and manipulations to reduce free radical formation reduce vasospasm after&#xD;
      SAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOS is constitutively expressed in endothelium and adventitial perivascular nerve fibers.&#xD;
      SAH-induced vasospasm in monkeys has been associated with diminished constitutive NOS&#xD;
      immunoreactivity in the perivascular nerves around the spastic arteries. Endothelial NOS mRNA&#xD;
      has also been decreased in monkey cerebral arteries 7d after SAH. Therefore, data suggest&#xD;
      that there is a relative reduction in NO synthesis after SAH, in addition to increased&#xD;
      breakdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the reduction in NO tonus around the cerebral arteries induced by decreased&#xD;
      expression of endothelial NOS as well as increased NO scavenger substances in the&#xD;
      subarachnoid space, and a relative resistance to NO-induced vasodilation in SAH appears to be&#xD;
      one of the key events in the development of vasospasm. Therefore, therapeutic interventions&#xD;
      that enhance endothelial NO production may compensate for these changes and reverse or reduce&#xD;
      vasospasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins are FDA approved mainly as antihyperlipidemics, and they effectively reduce the risk&#xD;
      of stroke and myocardial infarction. Simvastatin is also FDA-approved for stroke prevention.&#xD;
      The risk reduction, however, is not correlated with the degree of lipid reduction, and is&#xD;
      seen even in individuals with normal lipid levels. Statins are also cerebroprotective in&#xD;
      stroke. They enhance endothelium-dependent relaxations, augment cerebral blood flow, reduce&#xD;
      cerebral infarct size, and improve neurological outcome of stroke in normocholesterolemic&#xD;
      animals. Their protective effects are independent of lipid reduction. Most importantly,&#xD;
      statins upregulate endothelial NOS expression. This in turn improves cerebral blood flow and&#xD;
      reduces infarct size in experimental models. In addition, statin treatment enhances&#xD;
      endothelial fibrinolytic action, and inhibits platelet aggregation. Therefore, statins are&#xD;
      excellent candidates to test on SAH-induced vasospasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled design. The anticipated&#xD;
      enrollment is 104 patients, 52 in simvastatin, and 52 in placebo group, all recruited and&#xD;
      studied at MGH. Assuming a difference of 27% or more, the power of this study is 88%, and&#xD;
      alpha=0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized below. Once enrolled, patients are randomized&#xD;
      by Research Pharmacy staff to receive either placebo, or simvastatin 80 mg once every day,&#xD;
      the highest clinically used dose of simvastatin. We chose this dose to maximize the effect on&#xD;
      endothelium, which has been dose dependent in experimental studies. The study investigators&#xD;
      are blinded to the treatment group. Patients are followed prospectively and receive standard&#xD;
      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage care. The data collected pertains to development of&#xD;
      vasospasm, and hence involves daily vital signs, neurologic examination, and routine&#xD;
      neuroimaging. The development of vasospasm is determined based on daily transcranial Doppler&#xD;
      studies, conventional angiography (routinely done within 7 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage&#xD;
      as standard of care), and neurologic examination. Liver function tests along with total CPK&#xD;
      are checked on admission and once a week for as long as the drug is continued, to screen for&#xD;
      potential toxicity from the medication. Medication is discontinued if CPK or liver enzymes&#xD;
      are elevated by more than 3 times the upper limit of normal range. CPK elevations due to&#xD;
      surgical or percutaneous/endovascular interventions, or from cardiac sources (i.e.&#xD;
      accompanied by troponin elevation with or without ECG changes), are not considered as&#xD;
      indications for drug discontinuation.&#xD;
