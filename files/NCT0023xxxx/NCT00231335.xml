  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A primary hypothesis to be explored here is that, given its pharmacodynamic profile and&#xD;
      hypothesized mechanisms associated with schizophrenia, escitalopram will, in comparison to&#xD;
      placebo, be effective when added to risperidone or olanzapine treated group in reducing the&#xD;
      severity of resistant symptoms, particularly existing subsyndromal anxiety and depression.&#xD;

      The objective of this trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of augmenting risperidone&#xD;
      or olanzapine with escitalopram for treatment of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients with&#xD;
      incomplete response to adequate trials of either of the two antipsychotic medications. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, this is the first double blind randomized study designed to examine the potential&#xD;
      augmentation benefit of escitalopram combined with a commonly used atypical agent in chronic&#xD;
      schizophrenic patients with incomplete response to risperidone or olanzapine. The current&#xD;
      proposal offers the possibility to test the efficacy of augmentation treatment in a&#xD;
      controlled fashion with clinical and biological variables used as indicators of response and&#xD;
      tolerability. From a broader perspective, it would test the hypothesis of potential validity&#xD;
      of SSRI augmentation strategy in treatment of resistant symptoms of schizophrenia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Meet DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia adn schizoaffective disorder and clinically&#xD;
             stable on fixed dose of risperidone or olanzapine for at least 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Incomplete response to risperidone or olanzapine for at least 6 weeks per subjective&#xD;
             report and minimum score on rating instruments (PANSS total &gt;50 at baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current positive and negative symptoms sufficiently severe to require adjuvant&#xD;
             treatment despite good compliance and adequate doses of antipsychotic before trial&#xD;
             (risperidone 4 to 6mg/day, olanzapine15 to 20mg/day for 4-6 weeks of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Males and females between 18-55 years of age. No restrictions to recruitment based on&#xD;
             race.&#xD;

             be screened for decisional capacity using the MacArthur Competence Assessment&#xD;
             Tool-Research (MacCAT-CR)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Educational level of at least 10th grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Score on at least on PANSS psychosis items (P1,P2,P3,P5,or P6)&gt;4 adn CGI Severity&#xD;
             score &gt;4 at point of maximum severity of illness to date or total PANSS score at&#xD;
             baseline assessed as moderate (PANSS total &gt;50).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Meets full DSM-IV criteria for current Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder,&#xD;
             Anxiety Disorder or any other active disorder on Axis I. Present but not past history&#xD;
             of substance abuse is exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Extrapyramidal symptoms as defined by score of 4 or more on Simpson-Angus rating&#xD;
             scale.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Serious unstable medical illness or any acute medical condition.&#xD;

             infection, electrolyte abnormality, recent physical trauma, malignancy, autoimmune&#xD;
             disorders, endocrine diseases and neurological diseases, history of CNS trauma or&#xD;
             active seizure disorder requiring medication and known history of mental retardation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any other condition, which in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient&#xD;
             unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with participating in or completing the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
