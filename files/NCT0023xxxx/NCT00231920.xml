      This study proposes to enroll 50 young infants, ages 10 to 22 weeks. Each of the fifty&#xD;
      infants will receive two 0.25mL doses of preservative-free Fluzone®, given a minimum of 28&#xD;
      days apart but no more than 42 days apart. Preservative-free Fluzone® will not be&#xD;
      administered at the same time as other routine vaccines. Approximately 2-3mLs of blood sample&#xD;
      will be obtained prior to the first vaccination, approximately 4 weeks after the second&#xD;
      vaccination and 6 months after the second vaccination for the measurement of immune response.&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is twofold: 1.) To determine the safety of administering&#xD;
      two doses of preservative-free Fluzone® to young infants and 2.) To determine the capability&#xD;
      of inducing an immune response of administering two doses of preservative-free Fluzone® to&#xD;
      young infants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Influenza virus is an important global cause of morbidity and mortality. Influenza A or B&#xD;
      viruses cause epidemics of disease almost every winter in the United States with an average&#xD;
      of 36,000 deaths and 114,000 hospitalizations each year during 1990s (superscript 1).&#xD;
      Children have the highest rates of infection while adults greater than 50 years of age have&#xD;
      the highest mortality rates (superscript 2). Influenza, however, is associated with&#xD;
      hospitalizations in young infants. In a survey of the Tennessee Medicaid database over many&#xD;
      years, Neuzil et. al reported hospitalization rates in children less than 6 months of age&#xD;
      that were much higher than in older children, and the rates approached those over 65 years of&#xD;
      age (superscript 3). This is a prospective, phase l, open-label, self-contained, four visits&#xD;
      over a period of 7 months, pilot study of 50 healthy infants, aged 10-22 weeks, with history&#xD;
      of up-to-date routine immunizations, to assess safety and immunogenicity of administering 2&#xD;
      pediatric doses (with a minimum 4 weeks apart) of 0.25 ml of trivalent Influenza vaccine&#xD;
      (Fluzone®). Each of the 50 infants will receive two 0.25mL doses of preservative free&#xD;
      Fluzone®, given a minimum of 28 days apart but no more than 42 days apart. Preservative-free&#xD;
      Fluzone® will not be administered at the same time as other routine vaccines. Approximately&#xD;
      2-3 mLs of venous blood will be obtained prior to the first vaccination, approximately 4&#xD;
      weeks after the second vaccination and 6 months after the second vaccination for the&#xD;
      measurement of neutralization and HAI titers. Infants will be closely monitored during the&#xD;
      influenza season for respiratory symptoms, fever, or other influenza-like illnesses. They&#xD;
      will be seen during these episodes and nasal washes will be collected for a viral screen that&#xD;
      will include culture for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and&#xD;
      parainfluenza virus and rapid test for influenza and RSV. Blood collected at the follow up&#xD;
      visit, 6 months after the second dose of Fluzone®, will be used to measure post season&#xD;
      antibody titers to strains of influenza A and B.&#xD;
