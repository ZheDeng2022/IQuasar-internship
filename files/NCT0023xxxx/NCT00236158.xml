      Hypothesis Treatment with rate adaptive single chamber atrial pacing (AAIR) reduces the risk&#xD;
      of death compared with rate adaptive dual chamber pacing (DDDR) in patients with sick sinus&#xD;
      syndrome (SSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary purpose The primary purpose of this randomised trial is to compare AAIR and DDDR&#xD;
      pacing in patients with SSS and normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction with respect to the&#xD;
      primary end point overall mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background In patients with isolated SSS, who need pacemaker treatment, any pacemaker can be&#xD;
      used to treat the symptomatic bradycardia: a single chamber atrial (AAI) pacemaker, a single&#xD;
      chamber ventricular (VVI) pacemaker, or a dual chamber (DDD) pacemaker. In the USA and in&#xD;
      most European countries, DDD pacing is used in most cases. It is now known from the Danish&#xD;
      AAI/VVI trial, that AAI pacing is superior to VVI pacing, since VVI pacing is associated with&#xD;
      a higher mortality and a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation, thromboembolic&#xD;
      complications and heart failure. This confirms previous findings in observational studies.&#xD;
      Therefore, VVI pacing should no longer be used in patients with SSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main argument for using DDD pacing is the concern, that the patients will develop&#xD;
      symptomatic atrioventricular (AV) block. In the Danish AAI/VVI trial, the risk of AV block&#xD;
      was approximately 0.6% per year, which is equivalent to the risk found in a larger meta&#xD;
      analysis. This is only a little higher that the risk of atrioventricular block in the&#xD;
      age-matched non-paced population. Implantation of a DDD pacemaker in all patients will&#xD;
      effectively prevent development of symptomatic bradycardia in the minority of patients who&#xD;
      develops AV block. However, the most important disadvantage during DDD pacing is the&#xD;
      stimulation (pacing) of the ventricles by the pacemaker a large part of the time, also in&#xD;
      patients without AV block. Pacing the right ventricle causes an asynchronous electrical&#xD;
      activation and mechanical contraction of the ventricles as compared with the normal&#xD;
      physiological contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present time, a randomised comparison of AAI and DDD pacing in patients with SSS has never&#xD;
      been conducted, and to our knowledge, such a trial is not planned anywhere else.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since several of the patients with SSS suffer from chronotropic incompetence, pacemakers with&#xD;
      rate adaptive function are chosen for all patients included in the present trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, that fulfils the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and who&#xD;
      give written informed consent, are included into the study. For all other patients undergoing&#xD;
      primary pacemaker implantation in the study period, an exclusion data sheet is filled in&#xD;
      stating the reason for exclusion. A total of 1,900 patients are included into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the pacemaker implantation patients are randomised by lot (envelope) to either AAIR&#xD;
      or DDDR pacing. The randomisation is performed after written informed consent has been&#xD;
      obtained from the patient. Randomisation will ensure that all centres will randomise an equal&#xD;
      number of patients into each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomised to AAIR pacing will have a bipolar lead implanted in their right atrium&#xD;
      connected to a single chamber pacemaker with rate adaptive function. Patients randomised to&#xD;
      DDDR pacing will have two leads (one bipolar lead in their right atrium and a uni- or bipolar&#xD;
      lead in their right ventricle) connected to a DDDR pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out of hospital follow-up The patients must attend for out of hospital follow-up after 3&#xD;
      months and 12 months and then once every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for closing the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DANPACE study is stopped and results are analysed when all of the following three&#xD;
      criteria are fulfilled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 1,900 patients have been randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The last randomised patient has been followed for at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The mean follow-up for the whole study population is at least 5.5 years.&#xD;
