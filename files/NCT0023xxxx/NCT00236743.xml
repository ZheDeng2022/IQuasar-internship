      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of oral topiramate as&#xD;
      add-on therapy in children with uncontrolled partial onset seizures who are taking one or two&#xD;
      standard anti-epileptic drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is characterized by seizures, which are abnormal electrical discharges in the brain&#xD;
      that temporarily disrupt normal brain function. Seizures are classified as &quot;generalized,&quot;&#xD;
      originating in both sides of the brain simultaneously, or &quot;partial-onset,&quot; starting in one&#xD;
      area of the brain. Antiepilepsy medications, such as topiramate, are selected based on&#xD;
      seizure type. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that includes a baseline phase&#xD;
      and a treatment phase. During the baseline phase (8 weeks duration), patients receive a&#xD;
      stable dose of one or two standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and the parent or guardian&#xD;
      records the occurrences of seizure in a diary. Patients who continue to have seizures during&#xD;
      treatment with standard AEDs proceed into the double-blind treatment phase. Patients then&#xD;
      receive topiramate or placebo once daily at a dosage of 25 milligrams[mg] or 50 mg based on&#xD;
      body weight (to 6mg/kg per day), increasing gradually to twice daily dosing at a maximum of&#xD;
      125-400 mg (based on body weight) for 112 days (16 weeks total duration of the double-blind&#xD;
      phase), while continuing on their standard AED regimen. Assessments of effectiveness include&#xD;
      the percent reduction in the average monthly seizure rate, percent of patients responding to&#xD;
      treatment (having equal to or greater than 50% reduction in seizure rate), and the parent's&#xD;
      or guardian's global assessment of medication at end of study. Safety assessments include the&#xD;
      incidence of adverse events throughout the study, clinical laboratory tests (hematology,&#xD;
      chemistry, urinalysis), neurologic examinations, and vital sign measurements (blood pressure,&#xD;
      pulse, body weight) at specific intervals during the treatment phase. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that topiramate, taken as add-on therapy to treatment with AEDs, will significantly reduce&#xD;
      seizure frequency, compared with placebo, in children with refractory partial epilepsy: that&#xD;
      is, children who continue to have seizures despite treatment with first-line AEDs. In&#xD;
      addition, it is hypothesized that topiramate is well-tolerated. Oral topiramate, daily for&#xD;
      112 days. Starting dose is 25 mg or 50mg, based on body weight. Maximum doses based on&#xD;
      patient weight: 125 mg/day (36-54 pounds[lb]); 175 mg/day (55-74 lb); 225 mg/day (75-94 lb);&#xD;
      and 400 mg/day (95 or more pounds). Matching placebo was used to maintain blinding.&#xD;
