      Concussion is defined as any temporary disturbance in brain function following a blow to the&#xD;
      head. It may not involve a loss of consciousness and usually results in a post concussive&#xD;
      headache (PCH) immediately after the injury. Between 30 and 50 percent of patients with&#xD;
      concussion will develop postconcussive syndrome (PCS) consisting of symptoms such as&#xD;
      headache, and a variety of other debilitating symptoms lasting several weeks to months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine if metoclopramide, a drug commonly used in the&#xD;
      treatment of migraine headache, will be effective in relieving PCH and in preventing PCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will have a history of a concussion resulting in headache within the past&#xD;
      24 hours. Patients will rate their pain on a standard scale before and after being treated&#xD;
      with one or two intravenous doses of either metoclopramide or saltwater placebo. They will be&#xD;
      contacted by telephone 1, 4 and 8 weeks later in order to determine if they have developed&#xD;
      the postconcussive syndrome.&#xD;

      PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study is to prospectively evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of metoclopramide in ED patients with minor head injury. The primary hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the administration of intravenous metoclopramide will be effective in relieving the&#xD;
      symptoms of acute post traumatic headache in ED patients with minor head injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypothesis is that the administration of intravenous metoclopramide will also&#xD;
      be effective in reducing the incidence of chronic post-concussive syndrome in ED patients&#xD;
      with minor head injury. The research question is &quot;Does the administration of intravenous&#xD;
      metoclopramide at a dose of 10 or 20 mg to adult ED patients experiencing headache following&#xD;
      a minor head injury result in a significant decrease in pain severity as measured on a 10cm&#xD;
      visual analogue scale, as compared to placebo?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHODOLOGY This is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients who meet the following inclusion criteria will be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History of blunt head trauma within preceding 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immediate and transient post traumatic impairment of neurological functions such as&#xD;
           alteration of consciousness, amnesia, disorientation, or disturbance of vision or&#xD;
           equilibrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Onset of headache within one hour of trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Significant intra-cranial injury excluded by CT scan or clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will include age less than or equal to 16 years, known or suspected&#xD;
      pregnancy, known hypersensitivity or intolerance to metoclopramide, inability to give&#xD;
      informed consent, known gastrointestinal hemorrhage, perforation or obstruction, known&#xD;
      seizure disorder, known pheochromocytoma, concurrent significant CNS depression due to drugs&#xD;
      or alcohol, or concurrent treatment for psychiatric illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized and asked to grade their headache pain severity on a 10-cm&#xD;
      non-hatched visual analog scale (VAS) before the administration of the study drugs. They will&#xD;
      then receive either 10 mg (2ml) of metoclopramide or 2 ml of saline placebo. After 15 minutes&#xD;
      they will again complete the VAS. If their headache is not satisfactorily relieved they will&#xD;
      be offered a second dose of study drug and the VAS will be completed again 30 minutes later.&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted 1, 4 and 8 weeks later in order to complete a telephone&#xD;
      questionnaire to assess for PCS symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary comparison will be between the proportion of patients achieving significant pain&#xD;
      relief in each of the two study arms and a difference of 20% of greater in these proportions&#xD;
      will be considered clinically significant. A t-test of two proportions will be used and p&#xD;
      less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be evaluated for hypothesis generating purposes using appropriate parametric and&#xD;
      non-parametric statistics with corrections for multiple comparisons as needed.&#xD;
