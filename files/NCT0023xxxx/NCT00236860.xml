      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate as add-on&#xD;
      therapy in epilepsy patients with difficult to treat, partial-onset seizures who are taking&#xD;
      one or two standard anti-epileptic drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is characterized by seizures, which are abnormal electrical discharges in the brain&#xD;
      that temporarily disrupt normal brain function. Seizures are classified as &quot;generalized,&quot;&#xD;
      originating in both sides of the brain simultaneously, or &quot;partial-onset,&quot; starting in one&#xD;
      area of the brain. Antiepilepsy medications, such as topiramate, are selected based on&#xD;
      seizure type. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adult patients with&#xD;
      difficult to treat partial epilepsy that includes a baseline phase and a treatment phase.&#xD;
      During the baseline phase (8 weeks duration), patients receive their one or two standard&#xD;
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, or&#xD;
      valproic acid. Patients who continue to have seizures during treatment with standard AEDs&#xD;
      proceed into the double-blind treatment phase. Patients then receive topiramate or placebo at&#xD;
      a dosage of 100-milligrams (mg) once daily, increasing gradually over 5 weeks to 4 tablets&#xD;
      twice daily (800 mg/day) or maximum tolerated dose, and maintained on that dose for 8 weeks&#xD;
      (13 weeks is the total duration of the double-blind phase), while continuing on their&#xD;
      standard AED regimen. Assessments of effectiveness include the percent reduction in the&#xD;
      average monthly seizure rate, percent of patients responding to treatment (having equal to or&#xD;
      greater than 50% reduction in seizure rate), and the patient's and investigator's global&#xD;
      assessments of medication at end of study. Safety assessments include the incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events throughout the study, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry,&#xD;
      urinalysis), neurologic examinations, and vital sign measurements (blood pressure, pulse,&#xD;
      temperature) weekly during the treatment phase. The study hypothesis is that topiramate,&#xD;
      taken as add-on therapy to treatment with AEDs, will significantly reduce seizure frequency,&#xD;
      compared with placebo, in patients with refractory partial epilepsy: that is, in patients who&#xD;
      continue to have seizures despite treatment with a first-line AEDs. In addition, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that topiramate will be well tolerated. Topiramate, 100 mg oral tablets, or&#xD;
      matching placebo tablets. Dosage begins at 100 mg once daily and increases gradually over 5&#xD;
      weeks to 4 tablets twice daily (800 mg/day, maximum) or maximum tolerated dose for an&#xD;
      additional 8 weeks. Doses may be increased or decreased at investigator's discretion.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of simple or complex partial epilepsy that has been documented or witnessed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  an electroencephalogram (EEG) during the preceding 5 years that has a pattern&#xD;
             consistent with the diagnosis of partial epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  during an 8-week baseline phase, patient must have at least 8 partial seizures while&#xD;
             maintaining therapeutic levels of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and have no more than one&#xD;
             seizure-free interval of up to 3 weeks&#xD;

             epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures or other generalized epilepsies in the&#xD;
             absence of an EEG consistent with partial epilepsy&#xD;
