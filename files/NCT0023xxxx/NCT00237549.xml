      The ADDITION study comprise 2 parts: screening for Type 2 diabetes and intensive treatment&#xD;
      compared to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the screening study, the feasibility and results of country specific models to&#xD;
           identify undiagnosed individuals with Type 2 diabetes will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the treatment study the effects of routine care in general practice according to&#xD;
           local and national guidelines will be compared with an intensive ADDITION protocol,&#xD;
           including structured lifestyle education (dietary modification, increased physical&#xD;
           activity and smoking cessation) and intensive treatment of blood glucose, blood pressure&#xD;
           and lipids, and prophylactic aspirin with or without motivational interviewing, on&#xD;
           mortality, macrovascular and microvascular disease. Furthermore the impact of treatment&#xD;
           on health status, treatment satisfaction and health service costs will also be assessed.&#xD;

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop and evaluate strategies for early detection of type 2 diabetes in different&#xD;
           countries and different populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study whether a multifactorial treatment strategy can reduce CVD-mortality and reduce&#xD;
           the incidence of macro- and microvascular complications. The treatment strategy consists&#xD;
           of motivational interviewing, encouraging behavioural changes (dietary advises, physical&#xD;
           activity, smoking cessation) and intensive pharmacological treatment of blood pressure,&#xD;
           blood glucose, and serum lipids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify genetic markers predicting development of diabetic complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate health economical consequences of screening and early intervention for type&#xD;
           2 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an investigator initiated and designed study, initiated in Denmark by the two&#xD;
      principal investigators, planned and conducted in collaboration between the four centers in&#xD;
      Denmark, UK and the Netherlands. The study has two elements: a screening study and a&#xD;
      subsequent intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the screening study, the feasibility and results of country specific models to identify&#xD;
      undiagnosed individuals with Type 2 diabetes will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment study the effects of routine care in general practice according to local and&#xD;
      national guidelines will be compared with an intensive ADDITION protocol, including&#xD;
      structured lifestyle education (dietary modification, increased physical activity and smoking&#xD;
      cessation) and intensive treatment of blood glucose, blood pressure and lipids, and&#xD;
      prophylactic aspirin with or without motivational interviewing, on mortality, macrovascular&#xD;
      and microvascular disease. Furthermore the impact of treatment on health status, treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction and health service costs will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology - Screening study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark &gt; 300 primary care physicians from 5 different counties (Copenhagen, Aarhus,&#xD;
      Ringkøbing, Ribe and Sønderjylland) participate in the study. Diabetes-related information is&#xD;
      sent to all individuals aged 40-69 years enrolled in their practice. A questionnaire&#xD;
      (diabetes risk score29) including age, gender, family history of type 2 diabetes; obesity;&#xD;
      physical activity and previously diagnosed hypertension was used. Individuals scoring high on&#xD;
      the questionnaire are encouraged to contact their physician for an examination of random&#xD;
      blood glucose (RGB) and HbA1c. A step-wise strategy based on RBG, HbA1c, FPG and OGTT is used&#xD;
      to diagnose diabetes In the Netherlands all people aged 50-69 years and listed with the&#xD;
      participating primary care physicians is invited to fill in a diabetes risk questionnaire&#xD;
      based on the same risk factors as in Denmark. Those at high risk of having type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      are requested to come for a screening visit at a centre set up near the general practice. A&#xD;
      stepwise screening strategy based on RBG, FPG and OGTT is used to diagnose diabetes In UK,&#xD;
      different strategies are used in Cambridgeshire and Leicester. In Cambridgeshire a search of&#xD;
      computerised general practice records is performed, using a simple validated risk score,&#xD;
      based on routine general practice data (age, gender, prescribed medication and body mass&#xD;
      index), to identify people in the age of 40-69 years at high risk of having undiagnosed&#xD;
      diabetes30. Those with a high score undergo a stepwise screening strategy based on RBG, FPG&#xD;
      and OGTT is used to diagnose diabetes In Leicester all white European subjects aged 40-75&#xD;
      years and Asian, black or Chinese subjects aged 25-75 years are invited in a restricted&#xD;
      geographical region within Leicester. All attendant undergo an OGTT as the first screening&#xD;
      step (unless FPG &gt; 7.0 mmol/l)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic procedure includes a stepwise procedure minimizing the work-load on the&#xD;
      general practitioner and includes the questionnaire, random capillary blood glucose and HbA1c&#xD;
      as screening instruments followed by fasting capillary blood glucose (FCBG) and an oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test in everyone with marginally elevated FCBG. The diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      follow the most recent World Health Organization guidelines (31) and are based on two&#xD;
      diagnostic glucose values measured on independent days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are excluded if they already have diabetes, are pregnant or lactating or have a&#xD;
      severe psychotic illness, are house bound or have an illness with a likely survival of less&#xD;
      than one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures from the screening study include measures of the efficacy of the screening&#xD;
      campaign, the objective health status of patients newly identified by the campaign,&#xD;
      feasibility as reported by the primary care physician, and the economic impact or benefit of&#xD;
      the a programme. Furthermore a substudy explores the psycho-social and ethical aspects of the&#xD;
      screening programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology - Intervention study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed as part of the screening programme are invited to enter the&#xD;
      ADDITION-study. The study will include a minimum of 3000 patients with screen detected&#xD;
      diabetes. The general practices are randomised to the routine care group (standard care as&#xD;
      given by the GP) or to the intervention group which features a target driven, intensive&#xD;
      multifactorial approach to treatment. The study is an open, multicentre, parallel group trial&#xD;
      with randomisation of general practices. Patients are screened and recruited during the&#xD;
      period January 1st 2000 and June 30th 2006. The end of follow up is by July 1st 2009.&#xD;
      Participation is based on informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive Treatment strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensive multifactorial treatment includes lifestyle advices (concerning diet, physical&#xD;
      activity, medication adherence and tobacco cessation), prescription of aspirin and stepwise&#xD;
      increases in pharmacological treatment of blood glucose, blood pressure and lipids, according&#xD;
      to strict targets (appendix 1). The treatment targets are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HbA1c &lt; 7.0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total cholesterol &lt; 5.0 mmol/l (4.5 mmol/l if CVD present)but statin to everyone with&#xD;
           total cholesterol &gt; 3.5 mmol/l&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure &lt; 135/85&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aspirin 75- 150 mg/day to everyone on antihypertensive treatment Behavioural advices&#xD;
           include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking cessation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity 30 min./day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy diet (low fat, 600g of fruit and vegetables/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment targets may be intensified during the study according to the results of other&#xD;
      clinical trials published during the study period, as the aim is to strive for treatment&#xD;
      targets based on the most intensive guidelines available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the intensive group a further randomisation allocates 50% of the patients to country&#xD;
      specific interventions concerned with improving adherence to lifestyle changes and&#xD;
      medication. This intervention, including the use of motivational interviewing) is delivered&#xD;
      either by a trained facilitator (UK and The Netherlands) or through training of practitioners&#xD;
      (Denmark), and is based on a client-centred non-directive counseling style to help patients&#xD;
      explore and resolve ambivalence and stimulate lifestyle changes, appropriate diabetes&#xD;
      self-care and adherence to medical treatment 32,33.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision on which pharmaceutical drug to use for the individual patients with is made by&#xD;
      the clinician as the study is target driven and not a trial comparing different specific&#xD;
      drugs. The clinician is provided with recommendations for a treatment strategy (appendix 1),&#xD;
      which should be based on balancing treatment effect, side-effects and cost. The main priority&#xD;
      is achievement of treatment targets with a flexible lifestyle and low rates of side effects&#xD;
      such as hypoglycaemia and weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapies are adjusted at 2 to 4-weekly intervals until targets are reached, thereafter every&#xD;
      3 months. HbA1c is taken every third month, in between antidiabetic drugs are adjusted&#xD;
      according to blood glucose measurements in the interim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: see other section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical power:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on levels of risk in the conservative-treatment arm of the UKPDS, the expected event&#xD;
      rate is 3% per year for the combined endpoint (all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, stroke, revascularisation or amputation). With a sample size of 1350 patients in&#xD;
      each arm (standard versus intensive treatment) the study will allow the detection of a 30%&#xD;
      risk reduction in the intervention group at a significance level of 5% with a mean duration&#xD;
      of follow-up of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timescale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening study began in late 2000 and will end by June 30th 2006. Patients are enrolled&#xD;
      into the treatment study following diagnosis in the screening study: thus the treatment study&#xD;
      proceeds along with the evaluation phase of the screening study. The follow-up will continue&#xD;
      until July 1st 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Scientific Ethics Committee in the involved counties in Denmark and the Multipractice&#xD;
      Study Committee have accepted the project, and the study has been approved by the ethical&#xD;
      committees in UK and the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data safety and monitoring committee will have access to all end point data (unblinded)&#xD;
      after 1, 3 and 5 years, and the study will be terminated if the composite end point&#xD;
      (including: Cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, revascularisation and&#xD;
      amputation) should demonstrate a clear advantage of intensive versus standard treatment&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.001) or a clear advantage of the standard versus intensive treatment (p&lt;0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study will be of immediate national and international relevance to policy&#xD;
      decisions about screening for diabetes, and subsequent intensive treatment. If the study&#xD;
      shows that screening and early intervention markedly reduces the risk of developing premature&#xD;
      CVD, then the study will have potential important impact at the individual patient level as&#xD;
      well as on the societal level. If the study fails to show an effect of screening and early&#xD;
      intensive treatment then this would have direct impact on future recommendations for&#xD;
      screening and treatment regimens, and the study could lead to significant savings if it shows&#xD;
      that strict treatment targets are not essential in the early phase of the disease. The&#xD;
      results of the sub-study will inform approaches to health promotion to the management of&#xD;
      chronic disease and risk, and to strategies to support adherence applicable not only to&#xD;
      diabetes but also to other chronic diseases.&#xD;
