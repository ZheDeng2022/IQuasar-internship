  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Netherlands, which has about 200.000 births per year, maternity care is provided by&#xD;
      midwives or general practitioners unless medical reasons necessitate specialist obstetric&#xD;
      care. Women with low risk pregnancies are free to decide where to give birth, attended by&#xD;
      their midwife or general practitioner, at home or in the hospital, from which they are then&#xD;
      discharged within 24 hours. In the Netherlands these hospital births are referred to as&#xD;
      &quot;poliklinische bevallingen&quot; (i.e. outpatient deliveries) to indicate that they do not involve&#xD;
      formal hospitalisation, or as &quot;verplaatste thuisbevalling&quot; (i.e. relocated home births) to&#xD;
      indicate that they are supervised by the same caregivers as the home births without&#xD;
      involvement of specialist obstetricians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last two decades a marked increase in the referral rate to obstetricians during&#xD;
      childbirth has occurred, especially for nulliparae, both in planned home births and planned&#xD;
      hospital births (outpatient deliveries). 90% from all primigravidae will start their&#xD;
      pregnancy under care of the primary caregiver (midwife of general practitioner). During the&#xD;
      pregnancy 30% will be referred to the secondary caregiver (obstetrician specialist). The&#xD;
      other 60% will start labor guided by the primary caregiver. More than 50% of these women will&#xD;
      be referred to the obstetrician during labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this unique situation of the Dutch maternity care, the differences between home and&#xD;
      hospital birth (outpatient deliveries) with regard to effectivity and efficiency have never&#xD;
      been investigated. It is also unclear if pregnant women are informed about a 50% risk of&#xD;
      being transported to the secondary caregiver/ hospital during labor at home. Neither do we&#xD;
      know what their experiences are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the differences between home and hospital deliveries under&#xD;
      care of the primary caregiver with regard to effectivity (costs) and efficiency (patient&#xD;
      satisfaction) of care.&#xD;
