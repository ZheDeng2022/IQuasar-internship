  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus, also known as lupus or SLE, is a chronic, multisystem,&#xD;
      autoimmune disease in which the body's internal system of defense attacks its own normal&#xD;
      tissues. This abnormal autoimmune response can result in damage to many parts of the body,&#xD;
      especially the skin, joints, lungs, heart, brain, intestines, and kidneys. Both genetic and&#xD;
      environmental risk factors are involved in the development of lupus, but these are poorly&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SLE has an overall 10-year survival between 80 and 90%. However, we estimate that severe&#xD;
      lupus not responding to the usual available treatments has a 50% mortality rate in 10 years.&#xD;
      Kidney problems occur in 30% to 50% of lupus patients and may progress to kidney failure.&#xD;
      Kidney disease due to lupus occurs more frequently in African-Americans and Hispanics. Lupus&#xD;
      can affect many parts of the body and cause damage, but the severe form can result in death&#xD;
      from kidney disease; cardiovascular disease, specifically atherosclerosis; central nervous&#xD;
      system disease; and infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no single standard therapy for treatment of severe SLE exists. Usually physicians&#xD;
      prescribe an aggressive regimen of one or a combination of immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory&#xD;
      treatments. This approach to therapy for all forms of severe SLE derives largely from studies&#xD;
      of lupus nephritis. Current treatment, although effective in many people, are not effective&#xD;
      in all patients and are associated with drug-induced morbidity. The design of the control arm&#xD;
      for this study reflects the current status of treatment of SLE in the academic setting.&#xD;
      Investigators may choose from a list of commonly used and currently available&#xD;
      immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatments to optimize the treatment of their patients,&#xD;
      based on their past treatment history and response to those treatments. Study treatments may&#xD;
      consist of corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide (CTX), azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine,&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab,&#xD;
      and leflunomide. Treatment may be changed as frequently and as necessary within the first&#xD;
      year of the study to control the manifestations of SLE in each patient. New therapies that&#xD;
      become available during the course of this trial may be added to the list of approved&#xD;
      medications for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to the absence of a uniformly effective treatment for severe lupus, autologous&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been proposed as a potential therapy.&#xD;
      Hematopoietic stem cells are immature blood cells that can develop into all of the different&#xD;
      blood and immune cells the body uses. Researchers believe that resetting the immune system&#xD;
      may stop or slow down the progression of the disease. The main purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      compare two ways of treating SLE: 1) high-dose immunosuppressive therapy (HDIT) followed by&#xD;
      HSCT and 2) currently available immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      SLE is a chronic, multisystem, inflammatory autoimmune disease in which the body's immune&#xD;
      cells wrongly attack its own tissues. It is defined by the presence of circulating&#xD;
      antinuclear antibodies that are directed against nucleosomal DNA-histone complexes, native&#xD;
      double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (Sm and RNP), single-stranded&#xD;
      DNA, and phospholipids moieties on platelets and other tissues, indicating a failure of the&#xD;
      regulatory systems involved in maintenance of immunologic tolerance to self-antigens. Despite&#xD;
      use of currently available therapies, patients experience relapses of their lupus. Over time,&#xD;
      patients develop significant morbidity from the disease as well as from medications,&#xD;
      including glucocorticoids, used for treatment. The main purpose of this study is to compare&#xD;
      two ways of treating SLE: 1) high-dose immunosuppressive therapy (HDIT) followed by HSCT and&#xD;
      2) currently available immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One group of study participants will undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
           transplantation. With this treatment, they will first undergo mobilization, a process&#xD;
           that removes hematopoietic stem cells from their blood. Then they will receive high&#xD;
           doses of chemotherapy to suppress their abnormal immune systems, followed by the&#xD;
           reintroduction of the purified stem cells to re-establish their immune systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medications are used to mobilize (i.e., encourage) blood cell precursors to multiply and&#xD;
           move from the bone marrow to the bloodstream. These precursors (or autologous stem&#xD;
           cells) can be harvested (collected) from the bloodstream during a process called&#xD;
           apheresis and then transplanted (infused) back into the patient's body after&#xD;
           chemotherapy has been given. HDIT can suppress the immune system, reducing the&#xD;
           effectiveness or perhaps eliminating most of the immune cells that cause the progression&#xD;
           of SLE. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following HDIT hastens&#xD;
           the return of the body's ability to produce blood cells. HDIT with HSCT has been&#xD;
           identified as a potential treatment alternative to standard chemotherapy treatments.&#xD;

           identified as a potential treatment alternative to standard chemotherapy treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants assigned to the first treatment group will undergo mobilization with CTX&#xD;
           and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) beginning 2 weeks after randomization.&#xD;
           In preparation for the transplant process. a central venous line (plastic tube) will be&#xD;
           inserted into the neck or chest vein; this tube will be used to administer stem cells&#xD;
           and medications and for drawing blood. IV CTX, followed by G-CSF, will be given injected&#xD;
           under the skin beginning 3 days after CTX. G-CSF will be given for about 4 to 7 days, to&#xD;
           boost the body's production of blood precursor cells. These precursor cells will be&#xD;
           collected through the central venous line through apheresis. In this process, whole&#xD;
           blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and directed to a cell-separating&#xD;
           machine, where the white cells are separated and saved. The rest of the blood is&#xD;
           returned to the patient through the same needle. Several apheresis procedures will be&#xD;
           required to collect enough cells for the autologous transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within 3 weeks of the apheresis stem cell collection, the first group's participants&#xD;
           will be admitted to the hospital and will undergo a five-day conditioning regimen&#xD;
           consisting of IV CTX and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG). This regimen will&#xD;
           suppress the malfunctioning immune system and prepare the patient's body to receive the&#xD;
           precursor cells previously collected during apheresis. The stem cells will be infused&#xD;
           after the five-day conditioning regimen. The return of the precursor cells is called&#xD;
           autologous stem cell transplantation. During the hospitalization a specialized team of&#xD;
           transplant physicians and nurses will closely monitor the participants until their bone&#xD;
           marrow recovers and the participants are well enough to be discharged. The hospital stay&#xD;
           will be approximately 21 days after the autologous stem cell transplant. Upon discharge,&#xD;
           the patient will return home and will follow-up at the treatment center at Weeks 1 and 3&#xD;
           post-transplantation for close monitoring by the transplant team. Participants will also&#xD;
           be followed by the study rheumatologist monthly at the treatment center for 30 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The other group of study participants will receive immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory&#xD;
           therapy as prescribed by the study rheumatologist, based on the organ systems affected&#xD;
           and prior treatment history. Therapy may include one or a combination of the following&#xD;
           treatments: corticosteroids, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, MMF,&#xD;
           plasmapheresis, IVIG, rituximab, and leflunomide. As new drugs become available and a&#xD;
           part of the usual medications for the treatment of SLE, they may be approved for use in&#xD;
           this study. Treatment may be changed as frequently as necessary within the first year of&#xD;
           the study to control the manifestations of SLE in each patient. Treatment for the second&#xD;
           group will begin 1 week after randomization; patients will be seen monthly at the&#xD;
           treatment center for 30 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroid dosage tapering will be monitored closely; the schedule for tapering will be&#xD;
      the same in both groups. To reduce the possibility of disease flare. a slow tapering of 10%&#xD;
      per month will occur for the first six months. Tapering will continue in a prescribed manner&#xD;
      to achieve a dose equivalent of 10 mg/day of prednisone or less by one year post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have monthly follow-up visits for 30 months after treatment has been&#xD;
      initiated. Study visits will include a physical exam, clinical assessments, rheumatology&#xD;
      evaluations, and blood and urine collections. Participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires assessing their lupus disease. Neuropsychiatric assessments, echocardiogram,&#xD;
      CT scan of brain, renal biopsy, pulmonary function test, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
      scan (DEXA scan), magnetic resonance imagery scan, electromyograph scan (EMG), bone marrow&#xD;
      biopsy and aspiration and lumbar puncture may occur at selected visits, based on each&#xD;
      individual's manifestations of lupus and clinical indication. Participants will also receive&#xD;
      certain vaccinations at selected visits. Participants will be contacted by phone each and&#xD;
      every week throughout the study. There will be an extension period for those patients that&#xD;
      have completed their treatment and follow-up visits during the study's 5-year duration.&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted via telephone, e-mail, or visit every 3 months to assess their&#xD;
      use of concomitant medications and immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy and&#xD;
      corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five treatment centers across the United States, all leaders in the fields of transplantation&#xD;
      and rheumatology, are participating in this research study.&#xD;
