      Expression of COX-II has been identified in many types of human cancers. Uterine cancer is&#xD;
      the most common gynecologic cancer in the US and there has been an increase in uterine cancer&#xD;
      deaths over the past decade mainly due to the difficulty in treating recurrences in the more&#xD;
      aggressive histologic types. The study co-investigators have also identified COX-II&#xD;
      expression in grade 2 and 3 endometrioid-type, clear cell, and papillary serous types of&#xD;
      uterine cancers. Upregulation of COX-II may control the cell cycle by regulating the&#xD;
      proliferative capacity of neoplastic endometrial cells. This is a Phase II pre-post&#xD;
      intervention comparison study in eligible patients looking at the effects of a COX-II&#xD;
      inhibitor on uterine cancer. The patients whose endometrial biopsy shows grade 2 or 3&#xD;
      endometrioid-type, clear cell, and papillary serous types of uterine cancers will be put on a&#xD;
      selective COX-II inhibitor, Celebrex (Celecoxib) until the day of their surgery. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that Celecoxib will downregulate the expression of COX-II in these tumor types as&#xD;
      it does in other similar tumors. We also hypothesize that apoptosis, as measured with the&#xD;
      TUNEL assay, will be increased in areas with less COX-II expression and should be inversely&#xD;
      proportional to cellular p21 expression. We hypothesize COX-related gene expression will be&#xD;
      altered thus suggesting an up- or down-regulation of these genes in the end-organ tissue.&#xD;
      Documenting downregulation of COX-II enzyme and altered gene expression in endometrial&#xD;
      carcinoma after treatment with Celecoxib may result in further prospective studies using&#xD;
      selective COX-II inhibitors as effective, well-tolerated chemotherapeutic agents in these&#xD;
      uterine cancers that are resistant to many current therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in the United States. The number of&#xD;
      deaths from endometrial cancer has risen 128% since 1987. In 2001, an estimated 38,300 women&#xD;
      will develop endometrial cancer (ACS Facts and Figures) and an estimated 6,600 women will die&#xD;
      from endometrial cancer. Preinvasive and well-differentiated endometrial cancers are&#xD;
      hormonally driven and often cured with surgery alone. Higher-grade tumors are usually not&#xD;
      hormonally driven and proliferate via unknown mechanisms. These tumors are largely&#xD;
      responsible for the rising death rate. Responses to toxic treatment protocols for recurrent&#xD;
      endometrial cancer are dismal. Unfortunately, these post-menopausal women also often have&#xD;
      comorbidities, which limit their eligibility for current chemotherapy and radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expression of COX-II has been identified in many human cancers including: colon cancer,&#xD;
      gastric cancer, esophogeal cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer,&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer. COX-II expression is also strongly&#xD;
      expressed in the primary tumor and metastasic site in human cervical cancer. COX-II may&#xD;
      influence cell cycle control by upregulating the proliferative capacity of neoplastic&#xD;
      endometrial cells. Furthermore, COX-II inhibitors inhibit tumor proliferation even in cells&#xD;
      that do not express COX. This suggests an alternative mechanism of action not yet defined&#xD;
      that may play a role in inhibiting the growth of cancer tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enhanced expression of COX-II has led investigators to use COX-II inhibitors in the&#xD;
      prevention and/or treatment of colon and prostate cancers both in vivo and in vitro.&#xD;
      Celecoxib is now FDA approved for chemoprevention of colon cancer in familial adenomatous&#xD;
      polyposis patients. If it can be shown that COX-II is downregulated by COX-II inhibitors in&#xD;
      endometrial cancer, they may offer similar chemopreventative or chemotherapeutic potentials&#xD;
      that have already been proven in colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COX-II enzyme activity may not always correlate with end organ gene expression. Multiple&#xD;
      genes have been implicated in apoptotic pathways and are affected by COX-II inhibitors.&#xD;
      NS-398, a selective COX-II inhibitor causes elevations in APC expression and downregulation&#xD;
      of c-myc. Prostate apoptosis response 4 (Par-4) levels are increased in cells treated with&#xD;
      COX inhibitors. PTEN and hMLH1 are genes which are implicated in malignant transformation of&#xD;
      endometrial tissue. 5-Lipooxygenase (5-LOX) is often correlated with COX-I and COX-II. Thus,&#xD;
      in addition to COX-I and COX-II, these are good candidate genes to study the effects of&#xD;
      COX-II inhibitors on uterine cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Data Since COX-II expression is seen in the endometrium and in other&#xD;
      hormonally-dependent tumors, we have investigated the expression of COX-II in endometrial&#xD;
      cancer. Our preliminary studies on 41 fixed samples of benign and neoplastic endometrium&#xD;
      revealed that COX-II was not expressed in benign endometrial tissue, stains minimally (~1% of&#xD;
      tumor cells) in well-differentiated endometrial carcinomas, and stains most strongly in&#xD;
      poorly-differentiated carcinomas (~12% of tumor cells, most staining strongly). COX-II is&#xD;
      expressed in all poorly differentiated uterine cancers. Our study also demonstrated that&#xD;
      COX-II was also strongly expressed in uterine papillary serous carcinomas (UPSC) as well as&#xD;
      clear cell carcinomas of the uterus. These findings were confirmed by Ferrandina, et al. A&#xD;
      small percent of our patients as well as the patients in the Ferrandina study have only 1+ or&#xD;
      1-5% staining. These 'low-expressers' only made up 1/13 (7.7%) of our patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COX-II expression in endometrial carcinoma has a slight inverse correlation with apoptosis&#xD;
      (r=-0.534). However, COX-II expression in endometrial carcinoma correlated with&#xD;
      lymphovascular invasion (r=0.69) and depth of invasion (r=0.68). There was no correlation&#xD;
      between COX-II expression and ER (r=0.03) or PR (r=-0.02). The presence of a&#xD;
      poorly-differentiated tumor may imply a hormonally-independent pathway resulting in&#xD;
      de-differentiation. In summary, our preliminary data reveals that COX-II expression is high&#xD;
      in grade 2 and 3 endometrioid-type endometrial cancers, as well as UPSC and clear cell&#xD;
      subtypes and is correlated with known clinical prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expression of COX-II has been identified in many types of human cancers. Uterine cancer is&#xD;
      the most common gynecologic cancer in the US and there has been an increase in uterine cancer&#xD;
      deaths over the past decade mainly due to the difficulty in treating recurrences in the more&#xD;
      aggressive histologic types. The study co-investigators have also identified COX-II&#xD;
      expression in grade 2 and 3 endometrioid-type, clear cell, and papillary serous types of&#xD;
      uterine cancers. Upregulation of COX-II may control the cell cycle by regulating the&#xD;
      proliferative capacity of neoplastic endometrial cells. This is a Phase II pre-post&#xD;
      intervention comparison study in eligible patients looking at the effects of a COX-II&#xD;
      inhibitor on uterine cancer. The patients whose endometrial biopsy shows grade 2 or 3&#xD;
      endometrioid-type, clear cell, and papillary serous types of uterine cancers will be put on a&#xD;
      selective COX-II inhibitor, Celebrex (Celecoxib) until the day of their surgery. The&#xD;
      expression of COX-II and p21 will be quantified after treatment with Celecoxib in eligible&#xD;
      patients. This expression will be evaluated by performing immunohistochemical staining on the&#xD;
      endometrial biopsy (pre-intervention) and the hysterectomy specimen (post-intervention).&#xD;
      Apoptosis, evaluated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-&#xD;
      digoxigenin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay, will also be evaluated and compared to COX-II&#xD;
      expression in endometrial cancer in the two specimens, endometrial biopsy (pre-intervention)&#xD;
      and uterus (post-intervention). In addition to IHC analysis and apoptosis, gene expression of&#xD;
      COX-related genes in the post-intervention uterine specimens will. This gene expression will&#xD;
      be compared to matched controls who were not treated with a COX-II inhibitor. COX-II&#xD;
      expression will be correlated with established clinical prognostic factors including&#xD;
      lymphovascular invasion, depth of myometrial invasion and lymph node involvement. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that Celecoxib will downregulate the expression of COX-II in these tumor types as&#xD;
      it does in other similar tumors. We also hypothesize that apoptosis, as measured with the&#xD;
      TUNEL assay, will be increased in areas with less COX-II expression and should be inversely&#xD;
      proportional to cellular p21 expression. Additionally, COX-II inhibitors affect apoptotic&#xD;
      pathways even in cells that do not express COX-II. For low expressing cells, COX-II inhibitor&#xD;
      activity may be better documented with apoptosis. We hypothesize COX-related gene expression&#xD;
      will be altered thus suggesting an up- or down-regulation of these genes in the end-organ&#xD;
      tissue. Documenting downregulation of COX-II enzyme and altered gene expression in&#xD;
      endometrial carcinoma after treatment with Celecoxib may result in further prospective&#xD;
      studies using selective COX-II inhibitors as effective, well-tolerated chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents in these uterine cancers that are resistant to many current therapies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed uterine cancer of the following histologic types: grade 2 or&#xD;
             grade 3 endometrioid-type, clear cell, or papillary serous types. The pre-therapy&#xD;
             samples come from either an endometrial sampling (e.g. pipelle) or dilation and&#xD;
             curettage of the uterus with or without hysteroscopy. Unstained slides of the primary&#xD;
             tumor, a primary tumor block, or cytologic preparation must be available for review.&#xD;
             COX-II expression is seen in the majority of patients with these tumor types. Effects&#xD;
             of COX-II inhibitors occur even in the absence of COX-II expression and will be&#xD;
             measured with other IHC staining, apoptosis studies and gene expression. Therefore,&#xD;
             patients will not be tested for COX-II expression preoperatively in order to include&#xD;
             them in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease status: Only patients with clinical stage I or stage II disease will be&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;

             Celecoxib should not be given to patients who have demonstrated allergic-type&#xD;
             reactions to sulfonamides. Celecoxib should not be given to patients who have&#xD;
             experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or&#xD;
             other NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent therapy: Patients who have had daily usage of any form of NSAID or aspirin&#xD;
             prior to endometrial biopsy will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Selective COX-II inhibitors have some activity on the gastrointestinal mucosa.&#xD;
             Although Celecoxib is not contraindicated in patients with peptic ulcer disease, these&#xD;
