      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of topiramate compared with&#xD;
      placebo in obese, Type 2 diabetic patients on a controlled diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topiramate is not approved for the treatment of obesity. This is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate in obese,&#xD;
      diet-controlled, type 2 diabetic patients. Patients are randomized to receive either&#xD;
      topiramate or placebo. After a 5 week pre-enrollment phase followed by a 6 week run-in phase,&#xD;
      patients in the topiramate group start an 8-week titration phase to reach the assigned dose&#xD;
      of topiramate, either 96 or 192 mg daily. Treatment continues for 1 year. Assessments of&#xD;
      effectiveness include percent change in body weight, hemoglobin type A1c [HbA1c] levels, Body&#xD;
      Mass Index [BMI], the numbers and proportion of 5% and 10% weight loss responders, glucose&#xD;
      tolerance, waist and hip circumferences, changes in the mass of left ventricle of the heart,&#xD;
      blood pressures, and fasting lipid profiles. Safety evaluations, including incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory values, and electrocardiograms [ECGs], are&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that topiramate, combined with&#xD;
      controlled diet, will be effective in weight reduction and controlling blood sugar level and&#xD;
      is well tolerated. During the initial 8 weeks, the oral doses of either a matching placebo or&#xD;
      topiramate will be gradually increased to the target doses (96 milligrams[mg] or 192mg&#xD;
      daily); the dose will be maintained for 1 year.&#xD;
