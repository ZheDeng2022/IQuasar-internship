  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on the hypothesis that terazosin, a blocker of alpha-1 receptors, will be&#xD;
      effective in reducing excessive sweating caused by antidepressant treatment, and will have&#xD;
      minimal adverse effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sweating is a common and bothersome side effect of treatment with antidepressants. Most or&#xD;
      all antidepressants have been clearly shown to cause excessive sweating. It is unclear to&#xD;
      what extent excessive sweating caused by antidepressants becomes less or goes away with time.&#xD;
      In many instances, it continues to be a problem even after 6 or more months on the&#xD;
      antidepressant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no generally accepted treatment for excessive sweating. This study has been designed&#xD;
      to study whether terazosin is effective in reducing antidepressant-induced sweating, and&#xD;
      whether it is well-tolerated and acceptable to patients. In addition, secondary objectives of&#xD;
      this study are to determine the time taken for patients to respond to terazosin, the usual&#xD;
      doses needed for improvement, and the extent of reduction in sweating. This information will&#xD;
      not only help doctors in using terazosin for this purpose in their patients, but will help in&#xD;
      designing further studies of this treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of a Depressive disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
             Mental Disorders - IV-TR)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of excessive sweating by self-report&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The excessive sweating started after initiation of an antidepressant and, if treatment&#xD;
             with the antidepressant was interrupted, did not persist for more than 4 weeks during&#xD;
             that interruption&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with the antidepressant is deemed to be clinically necessary due to&#xD;
             substantial benefit from this antidepressant, and failure to respond to or tolerate an&#xD;
             alternative&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Excessive sweating has persisted for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The excessive sweating is rated by the patient as at least moderately bothersome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Episodes of excessive sweating occur at least twice a week for last 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of another known disease that could potentially cause excessive sweating&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to respond to antiadrenergic (reducing activity of the sympathetic nervous&#xD;
             system) treatment in the past&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood pressure less than 110 mm Hg systolic at the screening or baseline visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Orthostatic hypotension by history or on assessment at the screening or baseline&#xD;
             visits (defined as a decrease of 10 mm Hg or greater after standing for 2 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current antihypertensive treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of significant cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors: sildenafil (Viagra™), tadalafil&#xD;
             (CialisTM), or vardenafil (LevitraTM)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of priapism (persistent and painful erection)&#xD;
