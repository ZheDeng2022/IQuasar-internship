  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the pain-relieving effects and safety of two&#xD;
      analgesic treatment regimens as compared to placebo in patients experiencing pain after oral&#xD;
      surgery. Tramadol hydrochloride/acetaminophen is approved to treat acute pain. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tramadol hydrochloride/acetaminophen compared&#xD;
      with tramadol hydrochloride alone compared with placebo as a pain medication in the treatment&#xD;
      of pain following oral surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While other studies have shown the effectiveness and safety of tramadol/acetaminophen and of&#xD;
      tramadol alone in treating pain following oral surgery, a direct comparison of the two&#xD;
      treatments within the same study at these dose levels has not be performed. This is a&#xD;
      single-center, randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, single-dose,&#xD;
      parallel-group study of adult patients who undergo oral surgery for removal of two or more&#xD;
      impacted third molars. Patients who have at least moderate pain within 5 hours after surgery&#xD;
      will be given a single oral dose of 2 capsules of study medication. Patients will be equally&#xD;
      assigned to receive a total dose of either tramadol HCl 75 mg/acetaminophen 650 mg or&#xD;
      tramadol HCl 100 mg or placebo. Patients will be asked about the intensity of the current&#xD;
      pain and pain relief from the starting pain at 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours&#xD;
      after taking the study medication. Patients will also be given two stopwatches that will be&#xD;
      started once medication has been taken. Patients will stop the first stopwatch when they&#xD;
      first notice any pain decrease; they will stop the second stopwatch when they notice&#xD;
      meaningful pain relief. The primary efficacy endpoints are summary measures of hourly patient&#xD;
      reported pain relief (PAR) and pain intensity scores: total PAR (TOTPAR), sum of hourly pain&#xD;
      intensity differences (PIDs) from baseline (SPID), and sum of hourly PAR plus hourly PIDs&#xD;
      from baseline (SPRID). The study hypothesis is that pain relief with tramadol&#xD;
      HCl/acetaminophen (ULTRACET®) is superior to pain relief from tramadol HCl (ULTRAM®) alone&#xD;
      after oral surgery and the combination is well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 capsules, total dose either tramadol HCl 75 milligrams/acetaminophen 650 milligrams,&#xD;
      tramadol HCl 100 milligrams, or matching placebo taken one time orally; all study medication&#xD;
      is over-capsulated to match.&#xD;
