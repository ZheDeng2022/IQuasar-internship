      The Uterine Fibroid Pregnancy Registry is a USA and European-based registry designed to&#xD;
      monitor pregnancies in women with uterine fibroids in order to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. estimate the risk ratio of birth defects in women with uterine fibroids who were treated&#xD;
           or untreated during pregnancy and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. detect any pattern of birth defects among pregnancies in specific treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those pregnant women exposed to various therapies used to treat uterine fibroids will be&#xD;
      compared with those not exposed to treatment in order to detect any potential increase in the&#xD;
      risk of major birth defects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, registration and follow-up study of patients with&#xD;
      uterine fibroids who become pregnant and their offspring. Those who are exposed to treatment&#xD;
      at any time during pregnancy or within one month of conception will be compared with those&#xD;
      not exposed to treatment. Enrollment of patients into the Registry may be initiated by health&#xD;
      care providers and/or pregnant patients. Health care providers provide all information&#xD;
      related to the pregnancy and the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, data will be collected on uterine fibroids, exposure to treatment for&#xD;
      uterine fibroids, potential confounding factors, and pregnancy outcome. Reported cases will&#xD;
      be reviewed and classified according to type of birth defects. Registry enrollment is&#xD;
      voluntary and should occur as early in pregnancy as possible, preferably before any prenatal&#xD;
      testing. Midway between enrollment and the expected date of delivery, the Registry conducts a&#xD;
      short interim follow-up with the health care provider to supplement registration data. Near&#xD;
      the estimated date of delivery, the Registry prompts the health care provider to provide&#xD;
      pregnancy outcome data. The data elements requested include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health care provider contact information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uterine fibroid treatment (30 days prior to conception and during pregnancy and includes&#xD;
           non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral contraceptive pills, progestational agents,&#xD;
           gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, and other oral agents)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy/Birth outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prenatal tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uterine fibroid classification&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a live birth is reported, the Registry conducts the follow-up with the infant's health&#xD;
      care provider within 2 months of birth, and at 12 months of age. If a birth defect is&#xD;
      indicated, the Registry will request additional targeted follow-up information from the&#xD;
      health care provider. Data on any adverse event will be forwarded to the Sponsors.&#xD;
