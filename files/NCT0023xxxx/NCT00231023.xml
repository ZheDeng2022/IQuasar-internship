      This study will evaluate which of the three following treatment options is better for&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema: laser alone, steroid injection alone, or steroid injection followed&#xD;
      by laser. Macular edema is a swelling in the small central part of the retina - the part of&#xD;
      the retina that is used for sharp, straight-ahead vision. Laser treatment is the only&#xD;
      treatment that has been proven to be beneficial for diabetic macular edema. It reduces the&#xD;
      swelling and lessens the chance of further vision loss, but it does not improve vision.&#xD;
      Triamcinolone is a steroid drug that decreases inflammation and scarring. Injections of the&#xD;
      drug have decreased macular edema in some patients and improved vision. Swelling may return,&#xD;
      requiring repeat injections, and it is not known if the vision improvement is permanent. This&#xD;
      3-year study will examine and compare the benefits and side effects of both treatments, alone&#xD;
      and in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with diabetic macular edema may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure HbA1C (measure of diabetes control).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and eye pressure, and to&#xD;
           examine pupils, lens, retina and eye movements. The pupils are dilated with drops for&#xD;
           this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure retinal thickness. This test shines a&#xD;
           light into the eye and produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina. These&#xD;
           measurements are repeated during the study to determine if retinal thickening is getting&#xD;
           better or worse, or staying the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographs of the retina and lens. A special camera with bright flashes is used to take&#xD;
      these photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients will have one eye treated and some patients will have both eyes treated. The&#xD;
      treatment for a given individual is determined by chance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triamcinolone acetonide injection alone. The steroid is injected in the tissue around&#xD;
           the eye. Two injection procedures are used in the study, differing in their location and&#xD;
           dose. Numbing drops are placed over the area to be injected and the steroid is injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laser treatment alone. The surface of the eye is numbed with drops and a contact lens is&#xD;
           placed on the eye during the laser beam application. Before the treatment, patients may&#xD;
           have fluorescein angiography, in which pictures of the retina are taken using a yellow&#xD;
           dye. The dye is injected into a vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eye. The&#xD;
           camera flashes a blue light in the eye and takes pictures that show the amount of dye&#xD;
           leakage into the retina. Treatments may be repeated at several visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triamcinolone acetonide plus laser treatment. Patients who receive both the steroid&#xD;
           injection and laser have the steroid injection first and the laser treatment 1 month&#xD;
           later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients return to the clinic for follow-up visits at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36 months, or&#xD;
      more often if needed, after the initial treatment for an eye exam, measurement of visual&#xD;
      acuity, and OTC. Photographs of the retina are taken at the 4- and 8-month visits and at the&#xD;
      1-, 2- and 3-year visits. Fluorescein angiography may be done at 4 months. Blood pressure is&#xD;
      measured at the 1-, 2- and 3-year visits, and an HbA1c blood test is done at 4 and 8 months&#xD;
      and at the yearly visits. Participants may be asked to complete a questionnaire once a year&#xD;
      about their vision and medical condition. Treatment options are discussed at the 4- and&#xD;
      8-month visits.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of visual impairment in the United States. Diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema (DME) is a manifestation of diabetic retinopathy that produces loss of central&#xD;
      vision. Data from the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) estimate&#xD;
      that after 15 years of known diabetes, the prevalence of diabetic macular edema is&#xD;
      approximately 20% in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), 25% in patients with type 2&#xD;
      DM who are taking insulin, and 14% in patients with type 2 DM who do not take insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a review of three early studies concerning the natural history of diabetic macular edema,&#xD;
      Ferris and Patz found that 53% of 135 eyes with diabetic macular edema, presumably all&#xD;
      involving the center of the macula, lost two or more lines of visual acuity over a two year&#xD;
      period. In the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), 33% of 221 untreated eyes&#xD;
      available for follow-up at the 3-year visit, all with edema involving the center of the&#xD;
      macula at baseline, had experienced a 15 or more letter decrease in visual acuity score&#xD;
      (equivalent to a doubling of the visual angle, e.g., 20/25 to 20/50, and termed &quot;moderate&#xD;
      visual loss&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ETDRS, focal/grid photocoagulation of eyes with clinically significant macular edema&#xD;
      (CSME) reduced the risk of moderate visual loss by approximately 50% (from 24% to 12%, three&#xD;
      years after initiation of treatment). Therefore, 12% of treated eyes developed moderate&#xD;
      visual loss in spite of treatment. Furthermore, approximately 40% of treated eyes that had&#xD;
      retinal thickening involving the center of the macula at baseline still had thickening&#xD;
      involving the center at 12 months, as did 25% of treated eyes at 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several treatment modalities are currently under investigation, the only&#xD;
      demonstrated means to reduce the risk of vision loss from diabetic macular edema are laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation, as demonstrated by the ETDRS, and intensive glycemic control, as&#xD;
      demonstrated by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom&#xD;
      Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). In the DCCT, intensive glucose control reduced the risk&#xD;
      of onset of diabetic macular edema by 23% compared with conventional treatment. Long-term&#xD;
      follow-up of patients in the DCCT show a sustained effect of intensive glucose control, with&#xD;
      a 58% risk reduction in the development of diabetic macular edema for the DCCT patients&#xD;
      followed in the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of an unsatisfactory outcome following laser photocoagulation in some eyes with&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema has prompted interest in other treatment modalities. One such&#xD;
      treatment is pars plana vitrectomy. These studies suggest that vitreomacular traction, or the&#xD;
      vitreous itself, may play a role in increased retinal vascular permeability. Removal of the&#xD;
      vitreous or relief of mechanical traction with vitrectomy and membrane stripping may be&#xD;
      followed by substantial resolution of macular edema and corresponding improvement in visual&#xD;
      acuity. However, this treatment may be applicable only to a specific subset of eyes with&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema. It also requires a complex surgical intervention with its inherent&#xD;
      risks, recovery time, and expense. Other treatment modalities such as pharmacologic therapy&#xD;
      with oral protein kinase C inhibitors and antibodies targeted at vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) are under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of intravitreal corticosteroids is another treatment modality that has generated&#xD;
      recent interest. However, use of intravitreal corticosteroids generally has been reserved for&#xD;
      cases of DME in which there is at least moderate loss of visual acuity (e.g., worse than&#xD;
      20/40). This treatment generally has not been widely used for mild cases of DME due to&#xD;
      concerns about its potential risks, particularly glaucoma and cataract, relative to the&#xD;
      potential benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection of corticosteroids around the eye (anterior subtenon's, posterior subtenon's,&#xD;
      retrobulbar) has been used as an alternative to intravitreal injection. Although data are&#xD;
      limited, it is presumed that the adverse effects on the eye are lower with an injection&#xD;
      around the eye compared with in the eye. There are also little data on the efficacy of this&#xD;
      treatment. This study is being conducted to collect pilot data on the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      peribulbar corticosteroids to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of efficacy to&#xD;
      merit conducting a phase 3 randomized trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
             EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - An eye should not be considered eligible: (1) if the macular edema is considered to&#xD;
             be related to intraocular surgery such as cataract surgery or (2) clinical exam and/or&#xD;
             OCT suggests that vitreoretinal interface abnormality (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid&#xD;
             or epiretinal membrane) is judged to be a cause of the macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual&#xD;
             acuity would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,&#xD;
             pigmentary changes, dense subfoveal hard exudates, nonretinal condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of&#xD;
             the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,&#xD;
             neovascular glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of prior treatment with intravitreal, peribulbar, or retrobulbar&#xD;
             corticosteroids for DME.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of focal/grid macular photocoagulation within 15 weeks (3.5 months) prior to&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Note: Patients are not required to have had prior macular photocoagulation to be&#xD;
             enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within 4 months prior to&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Anticipated need for PRP in the 4 months following randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of prior vitrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any&#xD;
             intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 6 months or anticipated within the next 6&#xD;
             months following randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of YAG capsulotomy performed within 2 months prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Intraocular pressure greater than or equal to 25 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. History of open-angle glaucoma (either primary open-angle glaucoma or other cause of&#xD;
             open-angle glaucoma; note: angle-closure glaucoma is not an exclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A history of ocular hypertension is not an exclusion as long as (1) intraocular&#xD;
                  pressure is less than 25 mm Hg, (2) the patient is using no more than one topical&#xD;
                  glaucoma medication, (3) the most recent visual field, performed within the last&#xD;
                  12 months, is normal (if abnormalities are present on the visual field they must&#xD;
                  be attributable to the patient's diabetic retinopathy), and (4) the optic disc&#xD;
                  does not appear glaucomatous.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: if the intraocular pressure is 22 to less than 25 mm Hg, then the above&#xD;
                  criteria for ocular hypertension eligibility must be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. History of prior herpetic ocular infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Exam evidence of ocular toxoplasmosis.&#xD;
