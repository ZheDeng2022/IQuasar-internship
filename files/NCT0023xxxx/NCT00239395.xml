  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of 7.5 mg meloxicam i.m.&#xD;
      once daily compared with 7.5 mg meloxicam tablets once daily p.o. in patients with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis over a time period of 7 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized (1:1), open-label, multi-center, active-control, parallel-group study&#xD;
      to compare the efficacy of 7.5 mg meloxicam i.m. once daily compared with 7.5 mg meloxicam&#xD;
      tablets once daily p.o. in patients with osteoarthritis over a time period of 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint: Pain on active movement,&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain at rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient status with regard to change of arthritic condition assessed by the&#xD;
           patient/investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's assessment of arthritic condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onset of action&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to maximum pain relief&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paracetamol consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawals due to inadequate efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final global assessment of efficacy by the patient/investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local tolerability assessment of the injections by the patient/investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's /Investigator's assessment of overall tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number, nature and severity of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawals due to safety reasons&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for the trial who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria and who gave&#xD;
      their informed consent were randomized to one of two treatment groups (i.e. meloxicam ampoule&#xD;
      or meloxicam tablet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period totaled 8-14 days included screening, randomisation, study drug&#xD;
      administration, and 7-day follow-up. The relevant assessment were performed on the day of&#xD;
      randomisation and 7-day follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis of interest is that the primary endpoint for meloxicam ampoule is&#xD;
      inferior to oral meloxicam. The alternative is that meloxicam ampoule is noninferior to the&#xD;
      oral meloxicam .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study was to assess pain on active movement by VAS prior and&#xD;
      after the treatment.&#xD;
