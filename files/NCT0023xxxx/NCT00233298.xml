  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the hormones in the taste buds are affected&#xD;
      by tasting and eating food, and also whether these hormone levels are affected by an increase&#xD;
      in body weight or type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

      Cephalic phase of insulin secretion is regulated by autonomic and endocrine responses to&#xD;
      food-related sensory stimulation such as sight, smell, and taste. Human taste perception&#xD;
      comprises of at least five distinct qualities: bitterness, saltiness, sourness, sweetness,&#xD;
      and umami, the sensation elicited by glutamate, commonly found in protein (meat, fish, and&#xD;
      legumes) and flavor enhancer such as monosodium glutamate (MSG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the sweet and umami taste stimuli had been shown to illicit cephalic-phase insulin&#xD;
      release in rats. Oral sensory stimulation in human with modified sham feeding (MSF where food&#xD;
      is smelled, chewed, but not swallowed) had been shown to enhance insulin release during the&#xD;
      cephalic phase, lower postprandial glucose level, and improve glucose tolerance in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. The loss of pre-absorptive insulin response has been shown to impair glucose&#xD;
      tolerance. Furthermore, patients with type 2 diabetes and their first degree relatives had&#xD;
      been shown to have impairment of sweet taste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) have been found in the taste&#xD;
      cells located in the taste buds of mice (unpublished data). These new findings raise several&#xD;
      interesting questions of whether strict tasting of food without ingestion may stimulate&#xD;
      secretion of GLP-1 and PYY from the taste cells, whether their secretion is involved in the&#xD;
      afferent input of the cranial nerves, and whether this secretion is impaired in obesity and&#xD;
      in patients with pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes. We also want to investigate whether&#xD;
      different tastants, such as sweet versus umami, and different food contents such as percent&#xD;
      fat versus carbohydrate compositions, would elicit different hormonal responses.&#xD;
