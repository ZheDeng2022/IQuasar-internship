  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria have become more prevalent at many tertiary&#xD;
      care and academic centers. These infections are associated with increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. The initial empiric antibiotic choice may not be adequate and delay in initiating&#xD;
      appropriate therapy is a reason for poorer outcomes. Furthermore, not uncommonly the only&#xD;
      therapeutic options available are associated with significant toxicity. This is a particular&#xD;
      challenge for solid organ transplant recipients, who are immunosuppressed and have a higher&#xD;
      risk of acquiring infections. Exposure to different classes of antibiotics has been linked to&#xD;
      development of antibiotic resistance. Determining the risk factors for acquisition of&#xD;
      drug-resistant bacteria and the molecular mechanisms by which resistance occurs would allow&#xD;
      the development and implementation of strategies to minimize these infections and therefore&#xD;
      improve outcomes. We, the researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, aim to collect&#xD;
      surveillance cultures on patients undergoing liver, intestinal and multivisceral&#xD;
      transplantation in order to determine the prevalence and risk factors for Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases (ESBL)-Klebsiella and&#xD;
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as well as determine the molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms associated with the development of resistance in P. aeruginosa.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 is when patients are admitted to the Transplant intensive care unit (ICU) following&#xD;
      liver, intestinal or multivisceral transplantation. Stool samples (in the case of patients&#xD;
      with rectal bags and/or diarrhea) for cefotaxime-resistant Gram negative rods would be&#xD;
      obtained within 24 hours of admission to the ICU and weekly thereafter until discharge from&#xD;
      the hospital or isolation of MDR P. aeruginosa and ESBL- K. pneumoniae, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first. While patients are intubated, endotracheal aspirates would also be obtained on a&#xD;
      weekly basis. Nasal swabs for MRSA would be obtained within 24 hours of admission to the ICU&#xD;
      and weekly thereafter until discharge from the hospital or isolation of MRSA, whichever comes&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are no bowel movements on the days that stool is to be collected, a rectal swab will&#xD;
      be obtained. In addition, if the endotracheal tube is pulled, no further endotracheal&#xD;
      aspirates will be obtained. Samples will only be obtained if available. If the swab obtained&#xD;
      on day 1 is positive for the organisms being studied, no further samples will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No pregnancy testing will occur since all potential patients undergoing transplant must not&#xD;
      be pregnant. Pregnant women, or women who are currently breast-feeding an infant, will not be&#xD;
      allowed to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a drug-resistant organism (MDR P. aeruginosa, ESBL K. pneumoniae and/or MRSA) is&#xD;
      isolated, skin swabs from the groin and subclavian areas will be obtained once. No further&#xD;
      swabs will be obtained from the patient but he/she will be followed clinically to determine&#xD;
      the impact of the organism on the patient's clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cultures obtained at the discretion of the treating physician will be reviewed and if P.&#xD;
      aeruginosa, ESBL-K. pneumoniae or MRSA are isolated, they will be collected from the&#xD;
      diagnostic microbiology laboratory and stored in Dr. Paterson's laboratory for further&#xD;
      analysis of molecular mechanisms of resistance. These samples would have been discarded once&#xD;
      identification and susceptibility testing is completed by the diagnostic lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will also be collected: demographic data (address, date of birth,&#xD;
      etc.) which includes age, sex, height, weight, and state of birth, previous reports&#xD;
      associated with the participant's condition, laboratory results, current medication use, and&#xD;
      any other prior medical problems/history, history of prior admission, reason for&#xD;
      transplantation, history of prior transplantation, immunosuppression used, antimicrobials&#xD;
      received, other surgeries performed, duration of mechanical ventilation, requirement for&#xD;
      dialysis, microbiological studies available, simplified acute physiologic score (SAPS) on&#xD;
      admission, duration of ICU stay. This information will be obtained from the medical records&#xD;
      and/or the subject and become part of the research record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be seen as an inpatient at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and&#xD;
      each visit will take approximately 30 minutes. The patient will be seen by a member of the&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample storage of the organism&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biologic samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research&#xD;
      project. To protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security&#xD;
      number, and birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code&#xD;
      number. The information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities&#xD;
      will be kept in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the&#xD;
      samples indefinitely. All samples will be provided de-identified. If a subject withdraws and&#xD;
      provides the request in writing, samples collected and not already processed will be&#xD;
      destroyed. All samples will be kept in Dr Paterson's laboratory in Scaife Hall, Room 812,&#xD;
      3550 Terrace Street, Pittsburgh, PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient has completed the study once the patient is discharged from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swabs for P. aeruginosa and ESBL-K. pneumoniae will be planted on cetrimide agar and nutrient&#xD;
      agar supplemented with cefotaxime, vancomycin and amphotericin B. Antimicrobial&#xD;
      susceptibility testing will be performed using disk diffusion test and E-test. ESBL screening&#xD;
      will be performed using double disk diffusion test and E-test with&#xD;
      cefotaxime-cefotaxime/clavulanic acid and ceftazidime-ceftazidime/clavulanic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swabs for MRSA will be planted in a chromogenic media selective for MRSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of antimicrobial&#xD;
      resistance among the P. aeruginosa isolates, quantitative real-time PCR on genes encoding&#xD;
      common efflux pumps, PCR for mutations in quinolone resistance determining regions gyrA, gyrB&#xD;
      and parC genes and PCR for beta-lactamases will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) will be performed on the isolates of each single&#xD;
      patient, to determine if the isolates are genotypically similar. PFGE will also be done in&#xD;
      all MDR P. aeruginosa isolates in order to determine if they belong to a single or multiple&#xD;
      clones within the ICU.&#xD;
