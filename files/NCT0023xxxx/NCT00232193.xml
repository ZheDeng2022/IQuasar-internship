  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether giving intravenous dexamethasone every 4&#xD;
      weeks during the first 12 months of weekly Avonex dosing will reduce the progression of&#xD;
      functional impairment, brain atrophy, relapse rate and frequency, and new and enlarging brain&#xD;
      lesions over the first 24 months of Avonex therapy in patients with relapsing-remitting or&#xD;
      mono-symptomatic multiple sclerosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beta Interferon-1a (Avonex)was approved by the FDA in 1996 to treat relapsing-remitting&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis. Clinical trials have shown evidence in the reduction of relapses and&#xD;
      progression of neurological and cognitive disability with the use of Avonex, as well as&#xD;
      reduction in brain atrophy and new MS lesions on MRI were observed. Despite this, Avonex does&#xD;
      not abolish disease activity, therefore, there is frequent need for adjunctive therapy, such&#xD;
      as short courses of corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will research the value of adding monthly pulsed corticosteroids as adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy during the first year of Avonex use to determine: a)safety and tolerability b)if this&#xD;
      therapy will reduce the progression of functional impairment, and c)if this therapy will&#xD;
      reduce the progression of whole brain atrophy over a 13 month observation period.&#xD;
