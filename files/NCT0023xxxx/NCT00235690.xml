  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 80 patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center have been infected with&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, lacking susceptibility to all commercially available antibiotics&#xD;
      except &quot;colistin&quot;. This antibiotic was developed in the 1960s and preliminary pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      studies were performed at that time. Dosing recommendations, on the basis of these&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic studies, are listed in the drug's product information. However, there are no&#xD;
      dosing recommendations for patients requiring renal replacement therapy (either intermittent&#xD;
      hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration). Furthermore, the science of antibiotic&#xD;
      dosing (&quot;pharmacodynamics&quot;) has changed significantly since the 1960s and it is quite&#xD;
      possible that the dosing recommendations listed in the product information are not optimal.&#xD;
      Furthermore, even though physicians refer to &quot;colistin&quot; administration, the only intravenous&#xD;
      form of the drug is colistin methanesulfonate (CMS). CMS is converted in the body to&#xD;
      colistin. Both CMS and colistin have different pharmacokinetic and antimicrobial activities.&#xD;
      For this reason, we, the investigators at the University of Pittsburgh, are performing a&#xD;
      pilot study of the pharmacokinetics of intravenous CMS/colistin in patients requiring this&#xD;
      antibiotic for clinical purposes. Plasma concentrations will be determined around a&#xD;
      CMS/colistin dose once the drug has reached steady state. Concentrations in pulmonary&#xD;
      epithelial lining fluid will also be determined in patients with pneumonia. Microbiologic and&#xD;
      clinical endpoints will be determined and will be correlated with these concentrations. The&#xD;
      measurement of CMS and colistin levels will be determined by a laboratory in Australia which&#xD;
      developed these assays. A submission is being made to the National Institutes of Health (NIH)&#xD;
      for funding of a multicenter study which will address this research question with a greater&#xD;
      sample size. The study proposed here is a pilot study in order to prove the feasibility of&#xD;
      the research approach and to provide preliminary data for the NIH proposal.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At baseline (upon signing informed consent), the following information will be collected:&#xD;
      Demographic data - age, sex, height, weight, state of birth, underlying illnesses, underlying&#xD;
      infection, immunosuppression, antibiotic use, laboratory results, current medication use, any&#xD;
      other prior medical problems/history and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research coordinator will contact the patient on days 14, 28 and 90 days after the&#xD;
      infection to determine clinical outcome. If the patient is still an inpatient the research&#xD;
      coordinator will visit the patient in their hospital room to evaluate the patient's health&#xD;
      status. This visit will take about 10 minutes. If the patient has been discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital, the patient will be contacted by telephone by the research coordinator to determine&#xD;
      the health status, if no recent electronic medical record exists. This telephone contact will&#xD;
      take about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood work and microbiologic samples to be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of six samples of 3 mL blood on the third or fourth day of colistin therapy will&#xD;
      occur. These samples will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  immediately pre-dose,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the end of the colistin infusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 minutes after the end of the colistin infusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  60 minutes after the end of the colistin infusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 hours after the end of the colistin infusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 hours after the end of the colistin infusion (or immediately prior to the next dose&#xD;
           if the drug is being given every 12 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indwelling venous and arterial access lines, if already in place, will be utilized for the&#xD;
      pharmacological study's blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: The samples will be utilized for quantification of plasma levels of colistin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of microbiologic samples within 48-96 hours of the initiation of colistin therapy.&#xD;
      These samples are two sets of blood cultures if the patient had bacteremia, a mini-BAL for&#xD;
      quantitative bacterial culture if the patient had pneumonia and a cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      collection if the patient had Gram negative meningitis and has a cerebrospinal fluid drain in&#xD;
      situ. Additionally, these samples will be used to determine the concentrations of colistin&#xD;
      and CMS at the site of infection. A 3mL blood sample will be taken at the same time as these&#xD;
      specimen collections to determine concomitant serum concentrations of colistin and CMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: These samples will be used to determine if there has been rapid bacteriologic&#xD;
      clearance of infection and to determine the concentrations of drug at the site of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples will be processed and stored in a -80Â° C freezer in a secured laboratory&#xD;
      under the supervision of the principal investigator. These samples will then be sent to the&#xD;
      laboratory of Drs Jian Li and Roger Nation in Melbourne, Australia, to determine the amount&#xD;
      of colistin and CMS that reached the participant's blood following dose administration. All&#xD;
      samples will be sent de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples will be analyzed to obtain the amount of colistin and CMS found in the blood. The&#xD;
      biologic samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research&#xD;
      project. To protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security&#xD;
      number, and birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code&#xD;
      number. The information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities&#xD;
      will be kept in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the&#xD;
      samples indefinitely. All samples sent outside of the UPMC facility will be de-identified. If&#xD;
      a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected and not already&#xD;
      processed will be destroyed. All samples at UPMC will be kept in the investigator's&#xD;
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street. All patients will be seen&#xD;
      at the UPMC facility while they are inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other items to be collected for study purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiology - the organism that caused the infection will be sub-cultured in the clinical&#xD;
      microbiology laboratory (after the diagnosis has been obtained since the microbiology lab&#xD;
      would otherwise destroy the culture) and provided to the investigators. All subsequent Gram&#xD;
      negative bacterial isolates will be sub-cultured and stored for similar purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An unopened vial of colistin from the same batch as used for the patient will be collected&#xD;
      for analysis, so the actual dose of colistin can be calculated.&#xD;
