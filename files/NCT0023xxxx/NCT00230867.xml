  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently approved drugs for the treatment of herpes labialis (cold sores) exhibit low levels&#xD;
      of efficacy due to the limited ability of the drugs to penetrate the skin to the site where&#xD;
      the herpes virus is replicating. Iontophoresis uses electric current to enhance the delivery&#xD;
      of drugs through the skin. This trial is testing a new iontophoretic device for the delivery&#xD;
      of acyclovir cream to treat cold sores.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of iontophoretically-applied acyclovir 5% cream for the treatment of&#xD;
      herpes simplex labialis lesions including an open label arm using Zovirax (acyclovir) Cream&#xD;
      5% as per standard of care in the same patient population. Subjects who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      requirements at the screening/randomization visit will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one&#xD;
      of the three treatment groups. After being enrolled and randomized into the study, subjects&#xD;
      will be sent home with a locked kit containing the iontophoretic device with either active or&#xD;
      placebo cream or a locked kit containing Zovirax Cream 5%. At first signs and/or symptoms of&#xD;
      a recurrent herpetic episode (Stage 0 or 1, prodromal or erythema), the lesion will be&#xD;
      confirmed by telephone interview with the subject, and upon confirmation of the lesion, the&#xD;
      subject will be given the combination to the locked kit and instructed to begin treatment&#xD;
      immediately, thereby initiating the Treatment Phase of the study. Subjects will be followed&#xD;
      for at least 5 consecutive days post-treatment up until a maximum of 10 consecutive days&#xD;
      post-treatment, until the herpes lesion is healed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subject 18-75 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female subject must be using a medically acceptable form of birth control during the&#xD;
             study. Acceptable birth control measures are abstinence, oral contraceptive pills or&#xD;
             patch, injectable contraception, barrier contraceptives (condom, diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicide), IUD, surgical (hysterectomy, tubal ligation), vasectomized partner, or&#xD;
             natural post menopausal inability to conceive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must have a history of recurrent herpes labialis and report at least 3&#xD;
             recurrences during the preceding 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject must provide voluntary written informed consent to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with a pacemaker, or a history of cardiac arrhythmias or conduction&#xD;
             abnormalities. Any subject with a medically confirmed history of cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
             including sinus arrhythmia, premature beat, heart block, atrial fibrillation, atrial&#xD;
             flutter and pulsus alternans is to be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any evidence of active malignancy, immunodeficient disease, or use of immunomodifying&#xD;
             drugs (e.g., systemic steroids) within 30 days prior to enrollment. Subjects who have&#xD;
             completed therapy and are considered unlikely to relapse or who have had surgery and&#xD;
             do not have any evidence of disease, are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects using topical steroids on or near the face or systemic (oral, intravenous)&#xD;
             steroids within 30 days of enrollment; use of inhaled steroids does not exclude a&#xD;
             subject from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of allergic or adverse response to acyclovir, or any related anti-viral drug,&#xD;
             or the cream base.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In females of childbearing potential, a positive urine pregnancy test at time of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject is considered unreliable or unable to understand or follow the protocol&#xD;
             directions or is unable to comprehend or satisfactorily use the measurement scales as&#xD;
             determined by investigator or designee at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has abnormal skin conditions that occur in the area ordinarily affected by&#xD;
             cold sores which might affect the normal course of cold sores (e.g., eczema,&#xD;
             psoriasis, albinism, or chronic vesiculobullous disorders).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject is currently enrolled in another clinical trial or has used an investigational&#xD;
             drug/device within 30 days of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject has previously participated in the current study (TPI-203).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has used an anti-viral medication in the preceding 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject requires chronic use of analgesics, pain medication or non-steroidal&#xD;
             anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). If a subject is unlikely to get through the&#xD;
             treatment phase of the protocol without requiring the use of analgesia for a chronic&#xD;
             condition, e.g. back pain, recurrent daily headaches, the subject should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has a recent history of renal dysfunction or serious hepatic disease. Renal&#xD;
             dysfunction encompasses both acute and chronic renal failure, the former resulting&#xD;
             from the sudden loss of the ability of the kidneys to excrete wastes, concentrate&#xD;
             urine, and conserve electrolytes and the latter the gradual and progressive loss of&#xD;
             these capabilities. Examples of serious hepatic disease would include alcoholic liver&#xD;
             disease, chronic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and a variety of inherited diseases.&#xD;
             The underlying cause of a documented recent mild increase in liver enzymes should be&#xD;
             considered when deciding whether or not to exclude such a subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject has a history of alcoholism or drug abuse within the preceding 12 months. A&#xD;
             subject with a history of a pathological pattern of alcohol use that causes a serious&#xD;
             impairment of social or occupational functioning should be excluded. Such subjects may&#xD;
             exhibit symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal along with other behavioral symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject is institutionalized.&#xD;
