  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with gastrointestinal graft-vs.-host disease are randomized to oral beclomethasone&#xD;
      dipropionate (BDP) 8 mg/day or identical placebo tablets for 50 days, along with a 10-day&#xD;
      induction course of prednisone. At study day 10, patients whose symptoms of GVHD are under&#xD;
      control undergo a rapid prednisone taper over 7 days, while study drug is continued to study&#xD;
      day 50. After discontinuation of study drug at study day 50, patients are followed for 30&#xD;
      additional days, to study day 80. The primary endpoint is treatment failure by day 50, that&#xD;
      is, a flare of the symptoms of GVHD that requires immunosuppressive therapy. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are treatment failure by day 80, treatment-emergent adverse events, and survival at&#xD;
      transplant day 200. The hypothesis to be tested is that a topically-active corticosteroid&#xD;
      (beclomethasone dipropionate, BDP), taken orally, would allow rapid tapering of prednisone&#xD;
      while maintaining control of intestinal GVHD.&#xD;

      Patient selection. Patients who develop symptoms of GVHD are evaluated with endoscopy and&#xD;
      mucosal biopsy. If biopsy specimens demonstrate histologic findings of GVHD and stool and&#xD;
      mucosal biopsy cultures are negative for pathogens, patients are invited to participate.&#xD;
      Patients are excluded if diarrhea exceeds one liter per day, or if skin or liver GVHD are&#xD;
      present. All patients receive medications for GVHD prophylaxis; patients receiving&#xD;
      corticosteroids within 30 days of study entry are excluded. Patients signed informed consent&#xD;
      documents approved by Institutional Review Boards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formulation of BDP. Immediate release tablets and enteric-coated tablets, each contained 1 mg&#xD;
      of BDP (orBec, DOR BioPharma, Miami FL). The dosing regimen was one immediate release and one&#xD;
      enteric-coated tablet, taken orally four times daily (total daily dose, 8 mg BDP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification and randomization. A stratified allocation scheme is used to balance the&#xD;
      treatment groups within study centers. Stratifying variables are HLA-matched sibling and use&#xD;
      of cutaneous corticosteroids at baseline. Patients receive either BDP or identical placebo&#xD;
      tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plan. Therapy consists of study drugs plus 10 days of prednisone at an initial&#xD;
      prednisone dose of 1 mg/kg/day. In patients with control of GVHD symptoms at Study Day 10,&#xD;
      prednisone is tapered over 7 days, after which patients were maintained on physiologic&#xD;
      replacement doses of prednisone. Patients who do not demonstrate adequate control of GVHD by&#xD;
      Study Day 10 are considered treatment failures. Patients receive study drug for 50 days, or&#xD;
      until they meet the treatment failure endpoint, or are withdrawn from the study. Patients who&#xD;
      are declared treatment failures have study drug discontinued; subsequent treatment for GVHD&#xD;
      is dictated by their physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions of treatment failure and efficacy end-points. Treatment failure is a worsening or&#xD;
      recurrence of GVHD that requires additional immunosuppressive therapy. The primary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint is the time to treatment failure through Study Day 50. Secondary efficacy endpoints&#xD;
      included time to treatment failure through Study Day 80 (30 days after discontinuation of&#xD;
      study drug); the proportion who experience treatment failure by Study Days 10, 30, 50, and&#xD;
      80; and the overall survival rate at day-200 days post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of drug safety and adverse events. Safety assessment is based on cumulative&#xD;
      prednisone exposure, the incidence and degree of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis&#xD;
      suppression, and rates of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods. Analysis of time-to-treatment-failure endpoints and overall survival&#xD;
      rate at day-200 post-transplant includes all randomized patients, based on the Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      method and log-rank test, stratified by source of allograft. For each endpoint, the hazard&#xD;
      ratio for treatment is estimated based on a Cox proportional hazards model that includes a&#xD;
      term for treatment group. Time-to-treatment-failure is right-censored for patients who&#xD;
      discontinue study drug during the first 50 days without meeting the criteria for treatment&#xD;
      failure, provided the reason for discontinuation was not related to uncontrolled GVHD or&#xD;
      study drug-related toxicity. The cumulative probability of treatment failure by Study Days&#xD;
      10, 30, 50, 60, and 80 is estimated by the complement of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The&#xD;
      Z-test is used to compare the rates of treatment failure between groups at each of these time&#xD;
      points. Sensitivity analyses are performed using the cumulative incidence method to assess&#xD;
      the impact of competing risks. The overall survival rate at day-200 days post-transplant is&#xD;
      analyzed in the same manner as described for the treatment failure rates. Because of the&#xD;
      variable length of time among patients between transplant and randomization, treatment is&#xD;
      defined in the proportional hazards model as a time-dependent covariate. A counting process&#xD;
      approach is used to construct the risk set for this analysis. Multivariate models are used to&#xD;
      determine if the risk reduction attributed to BDP in the univariate model was still present&#xD;
      after accounting for subject-, disease-, and transplant-related factors thought to modify&#xD;
      patients' risk of mortality during the 200-day period after transplant. Hypothesis tests of&#xD;
      the primary and secondary endpoints are performed using a two-sided significance level of&#xD;
      0.05. No adjustments are made to the significance level for inferential tests of the&#xD;
      secondary endpoints. All patients who receive at least one dose of BDP or placebo are&#xD;
      included in the assessment of safety. Analyses are done using SAS® (version 8.2) and R&#xD;
      (version 2.0.1) software.&#xD;
