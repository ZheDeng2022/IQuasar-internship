      ovulation while women are taking clomiphene citrate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At any given time, there are 10-15% of American couples with infertility. A problem with&#xD;
      ovulation (releasing an egg) is one of the most common causes of female infertility. The&#xD;
      frequency and timing of intercourse is important because the best chance of pregnancy occurs&#xD;
      around the time of ovulation. The days that pregnancy is most likely to occur with&#xD;
      intercourse is referred to as the &quot;fertile window&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fertile window lasts for 6 days. It starts 4 days before ovulation and continues through&#xD;
      the day after ovulation. Intercourse on the day of ovulation gives the highest chance of&#xD;
      getting pregnant. However, intercourse up to 4 days before ovulation can still result in&#xD;
      pregnancy because sperm can survive for up to 6 days in the reproductive tract of a woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary testing for the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge is the most common method for&#xD;
      predicting ovulation. The LH surge precedes ovulation by about 36 hours. When LH is detected,&#xD;
      this gives a couple only 2 days to have intercourse that may result in fertilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OV-Watch is an FDA approved device that has been shown to predict ovulation 5 days in&#xD;
      advance for women who ovulate regularly. This wristwatch-like device is worn daily to detects&#xD;
      changes in sweat ions. The device allows for earlier detection of the fertile window, giving&#xD;
      the couple more opportunities to conceive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women who do not ovulate on their own or ovulate irregularly, medication can be taken to&#xD;
      help make eggs and ovulate. Clomiphene citrate is the most commonly used medication for this.&#xD;
      We plan to study the effectiveness of the OV-Watch in women who are undergoing ovulation&#xD;
      induction with clomiphene citrate and will compare the results to standard urinary LH&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients eligible to participate must be between the age of 21 and 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must demonstrate ability to follow standard clomiphene citrate ovulation&#xD;
             induction protocol and wear the OV-Watch™ correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intact uterus and at least one ovary must be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be diagnosed with anovulation (lack of ovulation) that is not caused by&#xD;
             hypothalamic amenorrhea or premature ovarian failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A hysterosalpingogram must be performed to demonstrate at least one patent fallopian&#xD;
             tube. The uterine cavity must also appear normal on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The male partner or sperm donor must demonstrate an acceptable concentration and&#xD;
             motility of sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  12 or more previous treatment cycles using clomiphene citrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition where the use of clomiphene is contraindicated, such as breast cancer or&#xD;
             liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other hormonal disease that may be secondarily causing anovulation, such as&#xD;
             thyroid disorder or hyperprolactinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Amenorrhea caused by premature ovarian failure or hypothalamic amenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active genital tract infection will need to be treated with antibiotics before&#xD;
             undergoing ovulation induction.&#xD;
