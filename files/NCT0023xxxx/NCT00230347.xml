  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to establish the practicality of treating cancer in the liver with&#xD;
      precisely administered single fractions of high-energy radiation using a radiosurgical&#xD;
      (cross-firing) technique. A second purpose is to establish a safe dose for such therapy.&#xD;
      Finally, the efficacy of radiosurgical ablation of liver tumors, in terms of radiographic&#xD;
      response, will be measured.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:All the following criteria must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver tumors not to exceed 5 cm in diameter. If this size can be increased at all,&#xD;
             that would be beneficial as many liver lesions present at a larger size given the lack&#xD;
             of symptoms until they are larger and adequate hepatic function with albumin &gt;3.0,&#xD;
             total bilirubin &lt;3, INR 1.8. In the case of patients with known or 7 Dose Escalation&#xD;
             Study Evaluating Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Liver Malignancies suspected cirrhosis,&#xD;
             patients must have creatinine &lt;1.5 and cannot have uncontrolled ascites,&#xD;
             encephalopathy, active or recent gastrointestinal bleed (GIB).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic&#xD;
             cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC), or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast/colon.&#xD;
             Metastatic tumors of other histologic types or sites of origin may be included if the&#xD;
             patients have a life expectancy of 6 months or greater. In the case of suspected HCC&#xD;
             in patients with known cirrhosis, noninvasive criteria recommended by the European&#xD;
             Association for the Study of Liver Diseases may be used. Hypervascular lesions &gt; 2cm&#xD;
             with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) &gt; 400ng/mL or hypervascular lesions &gt;2cm on at least 2&#xD;
             imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unresectable disease as determined by a surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Clinical Oncology Group performance status 0,1 or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No chemotherapy within 1 month of registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior radiotherapy to the liver or upper abdominal area&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with IHCC or HCC with distant metastasis are not eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For colon cancer patients with metastatic tumor of the liver who are not amenable to&#xD;
             surgical resection due to the efficacy of removal of simultaneous lung and liver&#xD;
             metastasis. Exclusion Criteria:- Children are excluded because HCC, IHCC, and hepatic&#xD;
             metastases rarely occur in this age group. Furthermore, treatment requires a great&#xD;
             deal of patient cooperation including the ability to lie still for several hours in an&#xD;
             isolated room.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No laboratory personnel will be included.&#xD;
