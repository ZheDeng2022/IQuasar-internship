      Abnormal blood cholesterol levels increase the risk of developing, or dying from heart&#xD;
      disease. It is well recognised that if &quot;harmful&quot; LDL cholesterol is high, and &quot;protective&quot;&#xD;
      HDL cholesterol is low, this risk is increased. Drugs called statins are routinely used in&#xD;
      patients with heart disease, are well tolerated, and decrease the harmful LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      levels. However, statins only increase protective HDL cholesterol to a small extent. Some&#xD;
      patients may thus benefit from additional medication to increase protective HDL-cholesterol&#xD;
      further. One of the most effective drugs which can do this is nicotinic acid. This drug is&#xD;
      well established having been available for over 30 years. Previous use has been limited by&#xD;
      facial flushing in a large percentage of patients receiving the drug. However a new&#xD;
      formulation called Niaspan is now available which is associated with much less flushing.&#xD;
      Although many patients will have transient flushing, it is estimated that only 1 patient out&#xD;
      of every 20 receiving the drug will have to discontinue treatment. We therefore propose, in&#xD;
      patients with coronary artery disease and low HDL cholesterol despite being on a statin, to&#xD;
      study the effect of Niaspan on HDL cholesterol and other lipid parameters, and to assess its&#xD;
      tolerability.&#xD;

      Objective: To assess, in patients with coronary heart disease and low HDL-cholesterol, the&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability of Niaspan as an adjunct to statin therapy in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Despite the clear reduction in mortality and cardiovascular morbidity associated&#xD;
      with reduction of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) by statin therapy, a sizeable proportion of&#xD;
      patients remain at risk of subsequent adverse cardiac events [1-3]. It is clear that in some&#xD;
      patients, further risk reduction may be obtained by addressing other elements of the lipid&#xD;
      profile. In particular, sub-analysis of the Framingham study has shown that for any given&#xD;
      level of LDL-C, the risk of coronary heart disease events decreased with increasing HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol (HDL-C) levels [4]. In addition, the adverse cardiac risk associated with&#xD;
      elevated triglycerides is predominantly seen in patients with low HDL-C levels [5]. The&#xD;
      protective effect of HDL-C appears predominantly mediated via reverse cholesterol transport.&#xD;
      In this process, excess cholesterol in cell membranes is transferred to HDL-C in the&#xD;
      peripheral tissues, cholesterol is converted to cholesteryl ester in HDL-C by&#xD;
      lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), the newly synthesized cholesteryl ester is&#xD;
      transported from HDL-C to lower density lipoproteins by the action of cholesteryl ester&#xD;
      transfer protein (CETP) and finally, the cholesterol is removed from plasma by hepatic&#xD;
      clearance of plasma lipoproteins. Of the available licensed lipid lowering agents, nicotinic&#xD;
      acid has the greatest potential for raising HDL-C, in addition to giving favourable&#xD;
      reductions in LDL-C, triglycerides, lipoprotein (a), apolipoprotein B-100 and elevation of&#xD;
      Apolipoprotein A-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early studies with nicotinic acid confirmed its efficacy in improving cardiac outcomes. The&#xD;
      Coronary Drug Project [6], studied 8341 men with previous MI. A 26% reduction in non fatal MI&#xD;
      and 24% reduction in cerebrovascular events was reported after 6 years follow up [6] and an&#xD;
      11% reduction in mortality after 15 years follow up [7]. The Stockholm Ischemic Heart Disease&#xD;
      Secondary Prevention Study [8] compared niacin plus clofibrate vs. placebo in 555 post MI&#xD;
      survivors and after 5 years reported a 26% reduction in overall mortality (p&lt;0.05) and 36%&#xD;
      reduction in CHD mortality (p&lt;0.01). In the current era, statin therapy is considered&#xD;
      mandatory for patients with confirmed coronary artery disease [3]. However, nicotinic acid&#xD;
      appeared safe and efficacious in combination with statin therapy as demonstrated in the more&#xD;
      recent HDL Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (HATS) [9], where the frequency of the composite&#xD;
      end point (death, MI, stroke, or revascularization) was reduced from 24% with placebo to 3%&#xD;
      with simvastatin-niacin therapy. While flushing was previously a use limiting factor with the&#xD;
      immediate release nicotinic acid (niacin), a new extended release preparation (Niaspan) has&#xD;
      reduced the incidence of use limiting flushing to &lt;6%. Several studies demonstrate the&#xD;
      ability of Niaspan to improve HDL levels, either as monotherapy [10,11], or in addition to&#xD;
      statin therapy [12]. To date the safety and efficacy of Niaspan has not been studied in a&#xD;
      placebo controlled manner, in a group of patients with coronary artery disease already on&#xD;
      statin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients will be recruited primarily from the cardiology wards of Craigavon&#xD;
      Cardiac Centre, Craigavon Area Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Persisting low HDL-C (&lt;0.9mmol/l) on a full lipid profile result (which for inpatients&#xD;
           should have been taken &lt;24 hours after admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective diagnosis of coronary heart disease (previous biomarker proven MI, positive&#xD;
           stress test, angiogram with at least one &gt;50% diameter stenosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Established for at least 6 weeks on a &quot;maintenance&quot; dose of statin therapy (defined as&#xD;
           Pravastatin 40mg, Simvastatin 40mg or Atorvastatin â‰¥10mg). The dose and type of statin&#xD;
           should not be altered during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Absence of concurrent major systemic illness (particularly liver or renal failure, or&#xD;
           hypo or hyperthyroidism)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Previous use of Niaspan or other non-statin lipid lowering agent within the previous 12&#xD;
           weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Contraindications to Niaspan therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participation in another medical trial within the previous 30days&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Failure to obtain informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: To be considered as a pilot study. Patients will be prospectively randomized,&#xD;
      in a double blind fashion with 1:1 ratio, to receive Niaspan or to an otherwise identical&#xD;
      placebo, with doses titrated according to the clinical response. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      will be the number of patients achieving target HDL-C levels (defined as HDL-C &gt;1.0mmol/l in&#xD;
      males or &gt;1.29mmol/l in females) after completion of the study protocol while taking Niaspan&#xD;
      compared with placebo. The final HDL-C blood sample for comparative analysis between groups&#xD;
      will be taken at week 11, or at week 15, if the HDL-C target had not been reached by week 11.&#xD;
      Given the HDL-C inclusion criteria of &lt;0.9mmol/l, assuming a least difference to detect of&#xD;
      0.09mmol, and allowing for study drop outs, 30 patients per group will have &gt;90% power to&#xD;
      detect this difference as statistically significant. Analysis by intention to treat will be&#xD;
      made by an independent samples T test.&#xD;
