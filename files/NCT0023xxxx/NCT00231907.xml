    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare the safety and ability to stimulate antibodies&#xD;
      (part of the bodies proteins that fight infections) of two influenza (flu) vaccines given to&#xD;
      children 12 to 35 months old. The two flu vaccines being compared are: trivalent inactivated&#xD;
      influenza virus vaccine (TIV), a killed virus vaccine given as a shot licensed for use in&#xD;
      children 6 months of age or older and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), a live (but&#xD;
      weakened) virus vaccine licensed for children 5 years old and older given as a nose spray.&#xD;
      The strains of the viruses have been weakened so that they do not cause typical influenza&#xD;
      illness, but may allow the body to develop protection against the flu. LAIV vaccine is not&#xD;
      licensed for children less than five years of age, therefore its use in this study is&#xD;
      investigational. Participation is approximately 7 months in duration.&#xD;

      This multi-site study is a phase I, open-label, 4-arm trial to evaluate 2 doses of influenza&#xD;
      vaccine separated by 30 days. The vaccine will either be two doses of a single vaccine or a&#xD;
      combination of vaccine products. FluMist®, a cold-adapted live attenuated influenza vaccine&#xD;
      (LAIV), will be administered intranasally via spray applicator. Administration of FluMist in&#xD;
      children less than 5 years of age is investigational. FluZone®, a trivalent inactivated&#xD;
      influenza vaccine (TIV) licensed for use in children 6 months of age or older, will be&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly (IM) to the anterolateral thigh muscle or deltoid muscle.&#xD;
      Healthy children, ages 12 to 35 months old, who are representative of the population base of&#xD;
      the vaccinating recruitment area, will be enrolled in this study at 3 sites. The primary&#xD;
      study objective is to compare the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of licensed TIV or&#xD;
      two doses of licensed LAIV with the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of LAIV that&#xD;
      is boosted with a dose of TIV versus children who receive an initial dose of TIV followed by&#xD;
      a booster dose of LAIV among children 12 to 35 months of age. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      develop preliminary safety data on these combined vaccine regimes, and to evaluate the&#xD;
      possibility that a single dose of TIV will either reduce the potential common side effects of&#xD;
      LAIV or reduce the viral shedding associated with LAIV in children and to evaluate LAIV as a&#xD;
      &quot;primary&quot; dose vaccine and TIV as a &quot;booster vaccine&quot; for inducing serum Hemagglutination&#xD;
      Inhibition (HAI) antibodies. Vaccinees will be followed post-vaccination for safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Patterns of viral shedding will be assessed 4 days after&#xD;
      vaccination with LAIV. A final 6-month post-dose two vaccination contact will be made for&#xD;
      serious adverse event data collection. Specifically, the investigators will assess the&#xD;
      ability of LAIV to prime for a secondary immune response when TIV is given as a booster&#xD;
      vaccine, and the investigators will evaluate TIV as a priming event for LAIV booster vaccine.&#xD;
      Control groups will include TIV/TIV and LAIV/LAIV groups. The primary outcome measures for&#xD;
      the study will be: assessment of post-dose 2 hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies to&#xD;
      each of the 3 strains of influenza contained in the vaccine, safety assessment of each of the&#xD;
      vaccines in combination vaccine. The secondary outcome measures include post-dose 1 HAI&#xD;
      antibody titers and viral shedding after intranasal vaccination with live attenuated&#xD;
      influenza vaccine. An additional secondary outcome will be assessment of secretory&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin (Ig) A in nasal wash samples manifested after 1 or 2 doses of vaccine. An&#xD;
      additional outcome will be Cell Mediated Immunity after 1 or 2 doses of vaccine. Blood will&#xD;
      be collected on days 0, 30 and 60 for antibody detection. Nasal washes will be collected on&#xD;
      day 0, 30 and 60 for secretory antibody measurements. A throat and nose swab sample will be&#xD;
      collected on day 3 to 5 post LAIV vaccination to assess viral shedding and as dictated by&#xD;
      presence of illness symptoms for viral culturing for two weeks after each dose of either LAIV&#xD;
      or TIV vaccine. Up to 20 eligible participants will be enrolled in each of the 4 vaccination&#xD;
      groups. As a four-arm trial with only active vaccine being administered by two different&#xD;
      dosing routes, there will be no blinding to study assignment. Study duration is up to 3 years&#xD;
      and individual participant duration is approximately 7 months.&#xD;
