      The purpose of the study is to learn about a new treatment for pancreatic cystic lesions. The&#xD;
      injection of alcohol into cysts is a common way of treating cysts of the liver, kidney, and&#xD;
      thyroid. We would like to find out if injection of alcohol would be useful for the treatment&#xD;
      of pancreatic cystic lesions. The treatment with alcohol will use endoscopy and endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound (procedures that use a scope that is placed through your mouth and into your&#xD;
      stomach). We hypothesize that more than half of the cysts which are injected with ethanol&#xD;
      will resolve.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cystic lesions of the kidney, thyroid, and liver are commonly treated with ethanol injections&#xD;
      into the cyst cavity. The contact with ethanol results in rapid elimination of epithelial&#xD;
      cells lining cyst cavities with few complications or pain. The majority of cysts become&#xD;
      smaller and some are completely eliminated Depending on the type of cyst and tissue, some&#xD;
      cysts can be completely ablated with ethanol. Although malignant masses arising from the&#xD;
      pancreas have been safely injected with ethanol, there are no reports of injection of&#xD;
      pancreatic cystadenomas. The ability to ablate cystadenomas of the pancreas would provide the&#xD;
      first non-surgical treatment for these pre-malignant lesions of the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past two years we have conducted a pilot study of EUS-guided ethanol lavage of&#xD;
      pancreatic cysts (2001-P-000358/5). 18 patients have undergone the procedure without evidence&#xD;
      of pancreatitis, pain, or infection following the procedure. Initially, low concentrations of&#xD;
      ethanol were used (5%) and over the course of the study, the concentration of the ethanol&#xD;
      used for lavage has been increased to 60%. Although the patients have not undergone careful&#xD;
      follow-up evaluations, it appears that at least 4 of the patients have had resolution of the&#xD;
      cyst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled trial of ethanol ablation in 50&#xD;
      patients with a pancreatic cystadenoma. Patients with a pancreatic cyst (1-5cm in diameter)&#xD;
      capable of safely undergoing endoscopy with conscious sedation will be candidates. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria include: coagulopathy (INR&gt;1.5, PTT&gt;100, platelets of&lt; 50k), active infection of the&#xD;
      cyst or unstable cardio-pulmonary disease (active angina, home O2, or pulmonary edema) will&#xD;
      be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of diagnostic cyst aspiration, the patient will be randomized to either saline&#xD;
      lavage or ethanol (70%) lavage. During the exam, the cyst will be imaged with ultrasound,&#xD;
      measured and aspirated. The cyst contents will be evaluated with cytologic evaluation, CEA,&#xD;
      and amylase. After cyst aspiration, the cyst will be lavaged with either saline or ethanol&#xD;
      for 5 minutes. At completion of the lavage, the cyst contents will be evacuated. The patient&#xD;
      will be provided the results of the cyst fluid analysis and may elect to undergo surgical&#xD;
      resection or additional lavage treatments. At the time of resection, the cyst and surrounding&#xD;
      pancreas will be resected for histologic analysis. The degree of epithelial ablation will be&#xD;
      determined with histologic sectioning and the cysts lavaged with ethanol will be compared to&#xD;
      those cysts lavaged with saline. If the patient chooses not to have a surgical resection, the&#xD;
      patient may return for a follow-up EUS exam at two additional monthly intervals with cyst&#xD;
      aspiration and additional ethanol lavage. Those patients receiving saline during the initial&#xD;
      treatment session will be crossed-over to ethanol.&#xD;
