  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In some participants with cystic fibrosis (CF), the disease is caused by a nonsense mutation&#xD;
      (premature stop codon) in the gene that makes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator&#xD;
      (CFTR) protein. Ataluren has been shown to partially restore CFTR production in animals with&#xD;
      CF due to a nonsense mutation. The main purpose of this study is to understand whether&#xD;
      ataluren can safely increase functional CFTR protein in the cells of participants with CF due&#xD;
      to a nonsense mutation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with CF due to a nonsense mutation will be treated with a new&#xD;
      investigational drug called ataluren. Evaluation procedures to determine if a participant&#xD;
      qualifies for the study will be performed within 21 days prior to the start of treatment.&#xD;
      Eligible participants who elect to enroll in the study will then participate in two 28-day&#xD;
      treatment and follow-up periods (56 days total). There will be a 2-night stay at the clinical&#xD;
      research center at the beginning and at the end of each 14 days of ataluren treatment, which&#xD;
      means that there will be four 2-night stays at the clinical research center during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the measurements for the study is transepithelial potential difference (TEPD), which&#xD;
      is also known as nasal potential difference and provides a sensitive evaluation of sodium and&#xD;
      chloride transport directly in secretory epithelial cells. TEPD assessments are made on the&#xD;
      nasal epithelium cells lining the inferior turbinate because these cells are easier to access&#xD;
      than the respiratory epithelial cells lining the lower airways and have been shown to have&#xD;
      the same ion transport characteristics. As an endpoint, TEPD has the advantage that it can&#xD;
      detect chloride transport changes that are a quantitative integration of the presence,&#xD;
      functional activity, and apical location of the CFTR in airway cells. Furthermore, it is a&#xD;
      direct measure of CFTR activity that is not likely to be affected by supportive or palliative&#xD;
      treatments for CF (with the possible exception of systemically administered aminoglycoside&#xD;
      antibiotics).&#xD;
