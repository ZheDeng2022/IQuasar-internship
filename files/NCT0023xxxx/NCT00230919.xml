  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity is increasing in most countries, including Norway, and the optimal&#xD;
      diet for reducing weight is under discussion. The present study in overweight and moderate&#xD;
      obese individuals compares a low glycemic load diet with a standard low-fat diet (as&#xD;
      recommended from the National Nutrition Council) in an open, randomized trial over 12 months,&#xD;
      with changes in weight loss and changes in cardiovascular risk markers as endpoints.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity is rapidly increasing in most countries, including Norway, and at&#xD;
      present there is controversy regarding what diet should be recommended for reducing weight&#xD;
      and the complications of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is performed in in 200 overweight and moderate obese individuals, that is&#xD;
      in men with body mass index (BMI) from 28 to 40, and women with BMI 28-35. To be included,&#xD;
      the participants should also have at least one component of the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a medical examination and check for inclusion and exclusion criteria, the participants&#xD;
      are randomized to one the two following diets: 1) A low-glycemic load diet aiming at a&#xD;
      macronutrient composition with 25-30% of energy from protein, 35-40% from fat and 30-35% from&#xD;
      carbohydrate or 2) A low-fat diet aiming at a macronutrient composition with 15% of energy&#xD;
      from protein, 25-30% from fat and 55-60% from carbohydrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will have 9 dietary counselling sessions in the course of the study; baseline,&#xD;
      week 2, month 1,3,4,5,6 and 9. Recommended total energy intake will be individualized based&#xD;
      on the metabolic rate at rest for each subject, and using a physical activity level of 1,4. A&#xD;
      500 kcal/day deficit relative to the daily energy requirements will be recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be to compare the effects of the two different diet&#xD;
      recommendations with respect to the one-year change in body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objectives the study will compare the consequences of the two strategies with&#xD;
      respect to 3, 6, and 12 months development of the variables glucose/insulin, insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity index, number of metabolic syndrome factors, high sensitive C-reactive protein,&#xD;
      lipids, lipoprotein B and anthropometric indices (waist /hip ratio). Serum will be frozen for&#xD;
      additional parameters as leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin and ICAM. Also to be studied is an&#xD;
      additional weight at 18 months follow-up, when no more advice is given past the 9-month&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
