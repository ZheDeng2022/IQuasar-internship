      The purpose of this study is to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If vacuum assisted closure (VAC®) therapy results in altered proteomic expression of&#xD;
           angiogenic markers compared to moist wound therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If VAC® therapy results in increased angiogenesis compared to moist wound therapy.&#xD;
