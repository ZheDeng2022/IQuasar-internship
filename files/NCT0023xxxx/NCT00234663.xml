  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In some patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the disease is caused by a nonsense mutation&#xD;
      (premature stop codon) in the gene that makes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator&#xD;
      (CFTR) protein. PTC124 has been shown to partially restore CFTR production in animals with CF&#xD;
      due to a nonsense mutation. The main purpose of this study is to understand whether PTC124&#xD;
      can safely increase functional CFTR protein in the cells of patients with CF due to a&#xD;
      nonsense mutation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with CF due to a nonsense mutation will be treated with a new&#xD;
      investigational drug called PTC124. Evaluation procedures (history, physical examination,&#xD;
      blood and urine tests to assess organ function, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, and&#xD;
      CF-specific tests) to determine if a patient qualifies for the study will be performed within&#xD;
      21 days prior to the start of treatment. Eligible patients who elect to enroll in the study&#xD;
      will then participate in two 28-day treatment and follow-up periods (56 days total). Within&#xD;
      the first 28-day period, PTC124 treatment will be taken 3 times per day with meals for 14&#xD;
      days at doses of 4 mg/kg (breakfast), 4 mg/kg (lunch) and 8 mg/kg (dinner); there will then&#xD;
      be an interval of 14 days without treatment. Within the second 28-day period, PTC124&#xD;
      treatment will be taken 3 times per day with meals for 14 days at doses of 10 mg/kg&#xD;
      (breakfast), 10 mg/kg (lunch) and 20 mg/kg (dinner); there will then be an interval of 14&#xD;
      days without treatment. There will be a 2-night stay at the clinical research center at the&#xD;
      beginning and at the end of each 14 days of PTC124 treatment, which means that there will be&#xD;
      four 2-night stays at the clinical research center during the study. During the study, PTC124&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated periodically with measurement of&#xD;
      transepithelial potential difference (TEPD), nasal mucosal brushing to assess for cellular&#xD;
      CFTR mRNA and protein, medical history, physical examinations, blood tests, urinalysis, ECGs,&#xD;
      chest x-ray, and pulmonary function tests.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of CF based on documented evidence of a conclusively abnormal sweat test&#xD;
             (sweat chloride &gt;60 mEq/liter).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal chloride secretion as measured by TEPD (a less than -5 mV TEPD assessment of&#xD;
             chloride secretion with chloride-free amiloride and isoproterenol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a nonsense mutation in one of the alleles of the CFTR gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight ≥40 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Willingness of male and female patients, if not surgically sterile, to abstain from&#xD;
             sexual intercourse or employ a barrier or medical method of contraception during the&#xD;
