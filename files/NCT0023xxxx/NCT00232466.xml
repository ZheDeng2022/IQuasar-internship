  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a new procedure for treating painful osteoporotic compression&#xD;
      fractures of the spine. Five-thousand out of 12.000 patients (16.000 vertebral fractures/year&#xD;
      in the Netherlands) present with sudden, severe back pain in the region of the fracture.Until&#xD;
      recently, bed rest, analgesia and physical support were the only treatment options. After&#xD;
      decades of performing PV, no large RCT with mid-term follow-up has been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicenter (6 centers), prospective, randomised, intervention study. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be randomised for percutaneous vertebroplasty or conservative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age: 50 and older, vertebral fracture, level: thoracic vertebral body 5 (Th 5) or lower,&#xD;
      osteopenia (T-score &amp;lt; -1 SD), back pain for no more than 6 weeks and edema in the&#xD;
      vertebrae on MR imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses All analyses will be performed on an 'intention to treat' principle. The&#xD;
      planned number of subjects will be 200 in total, 100 in each intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness will be assessed. The costs of the procedure and the medical treatment,&#xD;
      and of visits to medical specialists, GP's and physical therapists will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study will take 36 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of patients (200) has been completed. In May 2009 the 1 year follow-up will be&#xD;
      finished.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicenter (6 centers), prospective, randomized, intervention study. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be randomized for percutaneous vertebroplasty or analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:Two hundred patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be referred from the GP to the radiology department for acute back pain. The GP&#xD;
      will order an X-ray of the thoracic and lumbar spine to establish an osteoporotic vertebral&#xD;
      fracture(s). Subsequently, the hospital radiologist will pick out the cases with vertebral&#xD;
      fracture(s). Subsequently, the general physician/ geriatrician will confirm the diagnosis of&#xD;
      'osteoporotic' vertebral fracture, and exclude other causes of vertebral fracture (e.g.&#xD;
      tumour, major trauma). Finally, the patient and their GP will be asked to participate in our&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized for percutaneous vertebroplasty (and pain medication if&#xD;
      necessary) or only analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment consists of a transpedicular injection of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement&#xD;
      into the collapsed vertebral body (maximal 2 vertebrae in 1 treatment session) using&#xD;
      fluoroscopic guidance. The procedure is performed under the use of local anesthetics and the&#xD;
      patient can be discharged the same day or after 1 night of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional treatment (analgesics):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The internist optimizes the use of analgesics in ascending order: (1) Paracetamol, (2)&#xD;
      Tramadol, (3) Tramadol and Paracetamol, (4) Morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive osteoporosis medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for the clinical study as well as the economic evaluation will be&#xD;
      adequate relief of pain. Pain intensity will be measured by means of a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS). Relief of up to 3,0 to 4,4 scale points (scale 0-10) is associated with a clinically&#xD;
      relevant pain reduction (Beurskens et al 1995). The main goal of the economic evaluation is&#xD;
      to assess the balance between costs and effects of percutaneous vertebroplasty and pain&#xD;
      medication as compared to usual care (analgesics, physiotherapy, visits to general&#xD;
      practitioner) after 4 weeks and after 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical research objectives are to compare the effects (1 day,1 week, 1 month, 3 months,&#xD;
      6 months,12 months and 24 months) of vertebroplasty with conventional therapy on a) back&#xD;
      pain, b) activities of daily living (ADL), c) mood, d) general health and e) quality of life&#xD;
      in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Other objectives are to study the&#xD;
      1 and 2-year incidence of recurrent fractures, especially adjacent to treated levels of&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a), b), c), d) and e) are measured by using the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain&#xD;
      intensity, the Roland Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) for functional status, while, the EQ6D&#xD;
      and the Qualeffo-41 focus on quality of life, mood and general health. Data will be collected&#xD;
      about units of resource utilization with an explicit clause asking whether it can be related&#xD;
      to the vertebral fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (New) osteoporotic vertebral fractures are assessed at baseline by conventional radiography&#xD;
      and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The incidence of recurrent fractures will be determined&#xD;
      by conventional X-rays at 1,3,12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the economic evaluation is to assess the balance between costs and effects of&#xD;
      vertebroplasty as compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will initially perform a cost-effectiveness analysis with a one month time horizon. Given&#xD;
      immediate pain relief in a majority after vertebroplasty, already a cost-effectiveness ratio&#xD;
      can be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimates of other relevant outcomes such as costs and quality of life will also be entered&#xD;
      in the model to allow a full economic evaluation. We will estimate incremental costs per&#xD;
      additional year freed of pain of immediate vertebroplasty as compared to vertebroplasty after&#xD;
      one month and (synthetic scenario of) care as usual. As the latter does involve extrapolation&#xD;
      using estimates not actually observed in the trial we can not use bootstrap simulation to&#xD;
      assess uncertainty. Accordingly, multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis (Monte carlo&#xD;
      simulations) will be used to evaluate uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness ratios. As we&#xD;
      will take into account a time horizon up till one year costs nor effects will be discounted.&#xD;
      Finally, a cost-utility analysis is foreseen based on utility scores obtained over the first&#xD;
      month of observation after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The direct medical costs will be estimated from a societal perspective. This implies that&#xD;
      resource use such as GP visits, analgesics, physiotherapy and consultation of orthopedic&#xD;
      surgeons or general physicians will be recorded in the CRF and in patient diaries. In&#xD;
      parallel, actual costs of the resources, i.e., unit costs, will be estimated. The majority&#xD;
      will be based on the estimates gathered in the Dutch guidelines for economic evaluation&#xD;
      published by CVZ. Subsequently, multiplication of units costs with resource use will yield&#xD;
      cost estimates on an individual patient level. With regard to costs due to losses in&#xD;
      productivity we pose that the majority of patients does not have a paid job. Time spent by&#xD;
      spouses, family and friends taking over certain household activities or other unpaid&#xD;
      activities will be accounted for using shadow prices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for the economic evaluation will be adequate relief of pain. Pain will be&#xD;
      measured by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS). Relief of up to 3,0 to 4,4 scale points&#xD;
      is considered adequate. Time until this outcome is attained will explicitly be accounted for&#xD;
      in the economic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to pain, health related quality of life will be measured. Subsequent summation&#xD;
      over the period of follow up will yield overall QALYs up to a year for each arm of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cost effectiveness analysis we will take care of the differences in the Belgium and&#xD;
      Dutch healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyzes All analyzes will be performed on an intention to treat principle. In&#xD;
      addition, analyzes will on the different outcomes will be compared between the two groups&#xD;
      with the Student's t-test for continuous normally distributed variables, with the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test for variables that are not normally distributed and with the chi² test for&#xD;
      categorical variables. In addition, subgroups (e.g. long/shot duration of complaints) will be&#xD;
      examined in which vertebroplasty has a more (or less) pronounced effect by introducing&#xD;
      interaction terms in linear regression models with change in pain and quality of life as&#xD;
      outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The one-year cumulative incidence of new fractures adjacent to the treated/old fracture&#xD;
      levels will be compared between patients who were treated with vertebroplasty and those who&#xD;
      were not with Cox-proportional hazards analyzes, adjusting for confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned number of subjects will be 200 in total, 100 in each intervention arm. This&#xD;
      number is based on conventional assumptions of alfa=0.05 and ß=0.20, withdrawal from&#xD;
      intervention of 20%. Based on pilot data and literature we expect a difference of 25% in&#xD;
      significant pain relief. If we assume that 20% withdraws from intervention we need&#xD;
      approximately 100 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study will take 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of patients (200) has been completed. In May 2009 the 1 year follow-up will be&#xD;
      finished.&#xD;
