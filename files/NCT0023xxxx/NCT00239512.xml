  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is one of the most common complications in premature infants.&#xD;
      Successful pharmacological closure of PDA with indomethacin was first reported in 1976. Since&#xD;
      then indomethacin treatment has become the standard or prophylactic treatment for clinically&#xD;
      significant PDA in premature infants. Clinically there is a high incidence of complications&#xD;
      associated with indomethacin treatment, including hypoglycemia, necrotizing enterocolitis, GI&#xD;
      bleeding, extension of IVH. More recently, ibuprofen has been shown to be effective for the&#xD;
      closure of patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants without reducing mesenteric, renal,&#xD;
      or cerebral blood flow.Ibuprofen has been shown to close the ductus in animals without&#xD;
      reducing cerebral,intestinal or renal blood flow. Furthermore, ibuprofen enhanced cerebral&#xD;
      blood-flow autoregulation and had some neuroprotective effect. In recent years, our strategy&#xD;
      of PDA treatment for ELBW infants was essentially early targeted indomethacine treatment&#xD;
      depending on echocardiographic shunt flow pattern of PDA. (Arch Dis Child 1997;77:F36-F40.&#xD;
      Acta Paediatr Tw 1998;39:33-7. and Arch Dis Child 1999;79: F197-F200.) By this regimen,&#xD;
      infants will be eligible for the study if their birth weight less than 1000 gm and if they&#xD;
      had PDA without other structured cardiac anomaly confirmed by echocardiography shortly after&#xD;
      birth (as close as possible to12 hours). After parental informed consent is obtained, infants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to two groups based on a double-blined design. INDO group will&#xD;
      receive echocardiographic assessment at interval of 12-24 hours or clinically necessary, and&#xD;
      if the PDA had pulsatile or growing flow pattern, indomethacin is given; if the PDA had flow&#xD;
      patterns other than growing or pulsatile pattern, no treatment is given. The subsequent dose&#xD;
      of indomethacin is according to the echocardiographic flow patterns at interval of 24 hours&#xD;
      from the last dose. When indomethacin was fail to close after the first course, the second&#xD;
      course of another 3 doses of indomethacin or ibuprofen will be given. In spite of infants of&#xD;
      INDO group or IBUO group, if PDA fail to close after 2 courses of treatment, surgical&#xD;
      ligation of PDA would be considered according to the infant's clinical condition. Our&#xD;
      historical data showed that the incidence of complication was about 30%. Permitting 5% chance&#xD;
      of type I error and 20% of type II error and an absolute reduction of the incidence by 20%,&#xD;
      30 infants in each group is needed to detect a difference. Primary outcome of the assessment&#xD;
      is the closure rate of PDA and the incidence of death or pulmonary hemorrhage. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome is IVH or PVL, NEC, oliguria and CLD. We expect that, by using this treatment&#xD;
      regimen, a high PDA closure rate can be achieved and the survival of very premature infants&#xD;
      may be increased.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) continues to be one of the most common problems in premature&#xD;
      infants. Delayed closure of PDA can impaired renal function with oligouria.The complications&#xD;
      are correlated with the serum concentration of indomethacin, because the safe therapeutic&#xD;
      range of serum concentration of indomethacin is very narrow. Therefore, if we could try&#xD;
      another way such as Ibuprofen to close the PDA, then we can prevent more complications from&#xD;
      indomethacin. We expect that, by using this treatment regimen according to the&#xD;
      echocardiographic flow patterns, a high PDA closure rate can be achieved and the survival of&#xD;
      premature infants may be increased.&#xD;
