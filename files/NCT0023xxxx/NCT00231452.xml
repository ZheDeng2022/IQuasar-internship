  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to evaluate the effect of exposure to Plasmodium (P.) falciparum&#xD;
      erythrocytic stage antigens during different periods of infancy on the development of&#xD;
      naturally acquired immunity (NAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Exposure to P. falciparum prior to 5 months of age does not result in the&#xD;
      development of NAI, while exposure to P. falciparum after 5 months of age leads to the&#xD;
      development of NAI. The risks of clinical malaria and anaemia during the second year of life&#xD;
      will be compared between cohorts, as well as their correlations with the type and quality of&#xD;
      immune responses (antibodies to several P. falciparum antigens, cytokines), oxidative stress&#xD;
      markers and host genetic factors. These results should shed light on the determinants of the&#xD;
      development of anti-P. falciparum responses early in life and the potential constraints to&#xD;
      early life immunisation.&#xD;
