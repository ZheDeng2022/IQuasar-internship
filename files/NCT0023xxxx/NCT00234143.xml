  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are acquired clonal disorders of the bone marrow. The&#xD;
      clinical consequences of MDS are bone marrow failure and a predisposition to develop acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukaemia (AML). Patients with 'low risk MDS' have less than 10% myeloblasts in the&#xD;
      marrow and include the World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes refractory anaemia (RA),&#xD;
      refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and refractory anaemia with excess blasts-I&#xD;
      (RAEB-I). This group of patients has a relatively low risk of leukaemic transformation and&#xD;
      the major clinical problem is the manifestation of bone marrow failure. Up to 80% of these&#xD;
      patients become red cell transfusion dependent. To date, the only curative therapy is&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Unfortunately, a median age at diagnosis of &gt; 65 years&#xD;
      excludes this type of therapy for most patients with MDS. The aim of treatment is, therefore,&#xD;
      supportive therapy. Long term red cell transfusion therapy carries the problems of acute&#xD;
      transfusion reactions: iron overload, alloantibody formation, poor venous access and the risk&#xD;
      of transfusion transmitted infection. With time, such patients require increasing frequency&#xD;
      of transfusion and obtain decreased length of benefit from transfusion. The quality of life&#xD;
      of such patients is significantly reduced. Alternative therapies, therefore, aimed at&#xD;
      promoting more effective haemopoiesis and reducing the need for red cell transfusion may&#xD;
      improve quality of life, reduce the use of expensive resources such as red cells and iron&#xD;
      chelation, and perhaps enhance survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp) plus G-CSF (Neupogen; filgrastim) in low risk MDS is&#xD;
      better than best supportive care, with respect to haemoglobin and quality of life. The study&#xD;
      will assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the costs of this approach&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  long-term outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical/laboratory parameters allowing early cessation of therapy in patients destined&#xD;
           not to respond&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the Quality of Life of Low-risk MDS patients randomised to receive prolonged&#xD;
           treatment with EPO alone, EPO with G-CSF or best supportive care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the haemoglobin response and transfusion requirements of patients in each of&#xD;
           these arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the economics costs of treating patients in each arm, in order to derive a&#xD;
           cost:benefit analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the utility of prognostic factor and predictive factor assessment, in&#xD;
           particular against the predictive model proposed by Hellstrom-Lindberg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a multi-centre, randomised, triple arm, open-label trial of EPO alone (with&#xD;
      best supportive care), EPO plus G-CSF (with best supportive care) and best supportive care&#xD;
      only in patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome with symptomatic anaemia and/or red&#xD;
      cell transfusion dependence. Screening procedures will take place within 42 days of&#xD;
      randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to EPO and best supportive care, EPO with G-CSF&#xD;
      and best supportive care, or best supportive care only. Patients randomised to drug therapy&#xD;
      arms will receive EPO subcutaneously every fortnight ± G-CSF at least weekly, together with&#xD;
      red cell transfusions and other supportive care if required. Patients randomised to &quot;best&#xD;
      supportive care&quot; only will receive red cell transfusions and supportive care as required.&#xD;
      Study visits and selected study investigations will occur every 4 weeks for the first 24&#xD;
      weeks, then at 36 and 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life (FACT-An and EQ-5D) measures will be used for all arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis &amp; Reporting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed and reported for all endpoints after the final patient has completed&#xD;
      the 52 week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring Committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will ensure the safety of patients enrolled in&#xD;
      the trial. This group will be the MRC Leukaemia LDMEC (Chair: Prof. Gordon Murray). The DMC&#xD;
      will meet at the commencement of recruitment and will formulate its guidelines for safety and&#xD;
      efficacy monitoring. The DMC will provide a report of their meetings to the TSC. The DMC will&#xD;
      meet at least annually and more frequently if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central Morphology Review:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow biopsies/aspirates for all patients will be sent for central morphology review to&#xD;
      determine eligibility for the study. All screening aspirates and biopsies will be reviewed&#xD;
      centrally to confirm the diagnosis of MDS and the categorisation of the WHO/FAB subtype.&#xD;
      On-study and end of study bone marrows will also be reviewed. In addition, centralised&#xD;
      testing of specialist investigations will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ENDPOINTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life at 24 weeks (FACT-An &amp; EQ-5D - the latter for use in health economic&#xD;
           analyses)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life at 12, 36 and 52 weeks (FACT-An &amp; EQ-5D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall erythroid response (major and minor) at 24 weeks (main analysis point) and also&#xD;
           at 12 and 52 weeks, as defined by the International Working Group (IWG) criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of disease progression (i.e. to RAEB or AML)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Economic costs of managing anaemia in each arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for all study endpoints up to 52 weeks. Patients responding to EPO&#xD;
      ± G-CSF will remain on therapy for 52 weeks. Beyond 52 weeks, patients will be followed up&#xD;
      indefinitely in order to assess duration of response, incidence of disease progression and&#xD;
      overall survival (through the Office of National Statistics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOTAL SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three hundred &amp; sixty(360) patients, one hundred &amp; twenty (120) in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSING REGIMEN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment schedule uses the concept of 'frontloading' to give patients the highest doses&#xD;
      of EPO at the start of therapy in order to induce a response as quickly as possible. The&#xD;
      long-acting nature of darbepoetin alpha avoids excessive frequency of injections, but allows&#xD;
      delivery of high doses of EPO. At week 24, if no response is achieved, the study treatment is&#xD;
      deemed to have failed and is stopped and patients will receive 'best supportive care' only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Darbepoetin (120 patients):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EPO (Aranesp®) 500 mcg s.c. once every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If a rapid response is obtained (Hb increase &gt; or = 2 g/dl in any 4 week period),&#xD;
                titrate down the dose frequency of EPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If major response, titrate EPO to lowest dose frequency that maintains the&#xD;
                response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 24 weeks :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If no response, stop EPO and give supportive therapy only.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If minor response, continue EPO 500 mcg once every 2 weeks s.c.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. If major response, titrate EPO to lowest dose frequency that maintains the&#xD;
                response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Darbepoetine with Filgrastim (120 patients):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G-CSF (Neupogen®) 300 mcg s.c. twice a week, 3-4 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EPO (Aranesp®) 500 mcg s.c. once every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If a rapid response is obtained (Hb increase &gt; or = 2 g/dl in any 4 week period),&#xD;
                titrate down the dose frequency of EPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If major response, titrate EPO and G-CSF to lowest dose frequency that maintains&#xD;
                the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 24 weeks :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If no response, stop EPO and G-CSF and give supportive therapy only.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If minor response, continue EPO 500 mcg every 2 weeks s.c. and G-CSF 300 mcg s.c.&#xD;
                twice a week, 3-4 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. If major response, titrate EPO and G-CSF to lowest dose frequency that maintains&#xD;
                the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Best Supportive Care (120 patients):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomised to no growth factor treatment will receive best supportive care, defined&#xD;
      as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Red cell transfusion support to achieve a predicted post-transfusion haemoglobin of 11.0&#xD;
           to 12.0 g/dl at a quantity &amp; frequency such that the trough haemoglobin is never &lt; 8.0&#xD;
           g/dl OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  such that the patient is never excessively symptomatic, according to local&#xD;
                transfusion guidelines/policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DRUG SUPPLIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Darbepoetin (Aranesp®) pre-filled syringes 500 mcg and filgrastim (Neupogen®) pre-filled&#xD;
      syringes 300 mcg will be supplied by Amgen (UK)and provided free of charge.&#xD;
