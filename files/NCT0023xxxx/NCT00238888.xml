    <textblock>
      The objectives of this trials are to demonstrate, in children with poorly controlled asthma,&#xD;
      that an intervention to increase the awareness and the impact of poor asthma control among&#xD;
      parents and physicians of affected children and adolescents can reduce the rate of asthma&#xD;
      emergency visits in the 12 months following the initiation of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the philosophy of the &quot;Programs to integrate information service and manage&#xD;
      education(PRIISME)&quot;, the proposed randomised controlled trial will examine a novel approach&#xD;
      based on education to trigger practice changes in community physicians and pharmacists as&#xD;
      well as behavioural changes in parents of poorly controlled asthmatic children and in&#xD;
      adolescents. Poorly controlled asthmatic children will be identified among those who present&#xD;
      to the emergency department of the Montreal Children's Hospital for an acute asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation. The novel approach hinges on alerting parents, physicians, pharmacists, and,&#xD;
      for adolescents, the patients themselves, of the actual degree of asthma control and its&#xD;
      impact on usual activities. The instrument used, the Asthma Quiz for Kidz, is a brief 5-item&#xD;
      questionnaire based on the Canadian Asthma Consensus statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tested intervention is comprised of (1) notifying by mail the treating physician of: the&#xD;
      index emergency department or hospital admission, the results on the Asthma Quiz for Kidz in&#xD;
      the month preceding the index exacerbation, the orientation of the patient to his/her local&#xD;
      Asthma Education Centre (AEC), and the treatment protocol of the Canadian Asthma Consensus&#xD;
      statement and providing a prescription pad containing the Asthma Impact Checklist; (2)&#xD;
      referring the parents and child or adolescent to a personalised educational session with a&#xD;
      highly trained asthma educator approved by the AEC, at a site identified closest to home or&#xD;
      work; giving them a refrigerator magnet of the Asthma Quiz for Kidz; trimestrial mailing the&#xD;
      5-item Asthma Quiz for Kidz with a simple guide to interpret the degree of control,&#xD;
      re-enforcing the message that control can be improved, and reminding them to consult their&#xD;
      physician; (3) providing the identified AEC educator with a standard form, to be mailed to&#xD;
      the treating physician and the co-ordinating centre, on which to record the results on the&#xD;
      Asthma Quiz for Kidz, the interventions and recommendations made to the parents pertaining to&#xD;
      environment, drug use, need to consult MD for an action plan; (4) providing pharmacists with&#xD;
      a pad of the Asthma Quiz for Kidz to administer to identified patients at each request to&#xD;
      refill asthma drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control intervention is the current usual care with referral of all hospitalised patients&#xD;
      to the Montreal Children's Hospital (MCH) asthma educator (current attendance rate of 30%)&#xD;
      and referral of non-hospitalised children to the MCH Asthma Centre, at the discretion of the&#xD;
      emergency physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the rate of emergency department visits in the 12 months&#xD;
      post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes include others measures of health care resources&#xD;
      utilisation (hospital admission, physician's visits), measures of appropriateness of asthma&#xD;
      drug use (refill rate of reliever drugs, ratio of inhaled preventer/reliever drugs, rate of&#xD;
      rescue systemic steroids), and quality of life measures (for the school-aged child and the&#xD;
      caregiver).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If proven effective in reducing asthma morbidity, the current strategy may be implemented at&#xD;
      relatively low cost, relative to the savings in health care expenditures for poorly&#xD;
      controlled asthmatic children. This intervention could then be tested in other populations&#xD;
      and settings.&#xD;
