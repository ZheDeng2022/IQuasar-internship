      ST. GEORGE'S HEADED NOTEPAPER&#xD;
&#xD;
      CADISS FEASIBILITY STUDY (Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study) PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the feasibility of a clinical trial comparing antiplatelet therapy with&#xD;
      anticoagulation in the acute treatment of patients with cervical artery dissection.&#xD;
      Specifically to address whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There are sufficient clinical endpoints to provide the power to determine treatment&#xD;
           effect;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adequate numbers of patients can be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries is a major cause of stroke in persons &lt; 50&#xD;
      years of age, mainly due to embolism from clot sealing the tear. At present physicians treat&#xD;
      these patients with anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs to prevent further stroke, but&#xD;
      neither therapy is evidence-based. Anticoagulants may be powerful anti-embolic agents but are&#xD;
      also more dangerous than aspirin, and potentially could encourage further dissection. Most&#xD;
      published studies are flawed by retrospective data, with no reference to the number of&#xD;
      patients in the original study cohort and do not include the critical principles of&#xD;
      randomisation and 'blinding'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposal of present 'feasibility'study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only prospective data available (1) suggest that anticoagulants are more effective than&#xD;
      antiplatelet agents in reducing further TIA and stroke after dissection, but the numbers were&#xD;
      small and lack reliable statistical confirmation. This study was not a randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial and therefore may be open to bias in selection of treatment. As well, it found that&#xD;
      most recurrent events occur within the first month and thereafter the number tails off. A&#xD;
      total of about 1800 patients for a two armed therapeutical trial was necessary to be&#xD;
      calculated on these data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authors of a previous Cochrane review (2) reviewing available published literature calculated&#xD;
      that a total of about 2000 patients (1000 in each treatment arm) is needed for a blinded&#xD;
      randomised trial of anticoagulants versus antiplatelet agents. This would need a major,&#xD;
      probably international, study involving over 50 centres, and would be an expensive&#xD;
      undertaking. Prior to starting such a study it is important to determine whether this would&#xD;
      be feasible. This is particularly important for carotid and vertebral dissection which is a&#xD;
      frequently missed diagnosis, at least during the acute phase. Limited natural history outcome&#xD;
      data suggest the risk of recurrent stroke and TIA following carotid and vertebral dissection&#xD;
      is only markedly raised during the first week to month (1, 3) and therefore early&#xD;
      identification and recruitment of patients are essential if any treatment effect is to be&#xD;
      demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, a feasibility study is essential before any large scale clinical trial.&#xD;
      Specifically, two things need to be determined. Firstly, whether a sufficient number of&#xD;
      patients can be recruited sufficiently early from participating centres. Secondly, in view of&#xD;
      the limited data on the rate of recurrent TIA and stroke in patients with recent dissection,&#xD;
      we need more data to obtain a robust estimate of early risk to inform power calculations for&#xD;
      a large scale study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preliminary informal survey conducted by Clinical Neurosciences, St. George's University of&#xD;
      London, in association with the Association of British Neurologists, has indicated that at&#xD;
      least 27 neurologists/stroke physicians throughout the UK would be interested in&#xD;
      collaborating and enrolling consecutive consenting patients into such a study comparing&#xD;
      anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomised multicentre single blind study comparing antiplatelet therapy with&#xD;
      anticoagulation for patients with carotid and vertebral dissection. Recruitment must be&#xD;
      within seven days of onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Extracranial carotid or vertebral artery dissection with symptom onset within the last 7&#xD;
           days. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Ipsilateral TIA or stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome or neck pain with known date of onset&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Imaging evidence of definite or probable dissection on magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
           (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA) or&#xD;
           ultrasound (patients can be initially randomised on ultrasound alone but subsequent MR&#xD;
           or CTA confirmation is needed)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intracranial cerebral artery dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Symptom onset after 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Contraindications to either antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient refusal to consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients who are undergoing angioplasty and stenting or surgery for treatment of their&#xD;
           dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to either antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy allocated on a&#xD;
      single blind basis and continued for six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Antiplatelet therapy: Aspirin 75-300 mg daily, aspirin and dipyridamole or clopidogrel&#xD;
           alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anticoagulation with heparin (either unfractionated heparin or a therapeutic dose of low&#xD;
           molecular weight heparin) followed by warfarin aiming for an INR in the range 2.5-4.&#xD;
           Local protocols for heparin therapy can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipsilateral stroke, transient ischaemic attack or vascular death within 6 months from&#xD;
      randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TIA and stroke in other cerebral vascular territories&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recanalisation on repeat imaging at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of dissection is based on different modalities in different centres. Centres&#xD;
      should use their usual imaging protocol to diagnose dissection. Diagnosis on the basis of MRI&#xD;
      with cross-sectional imaging through the artery wall, MRA, CT angiography, intra-arterial&#xD;
      angiography, and ultrasound (later confirmed by MR or CTA) are all acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can be randomised if the HQ radiologist (Dr. Clifton) agrees that the diagnosis is&#xD;
      probable or definite. Hard copies of imaging must be recorded for central reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will include only those patients judged to have probable or definite&#xD;
      dissection on central reading of the hard copies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be via 24 hour randomisation service provided by the University of&#xD;
      Aberdeen Health Services Research Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local investigator will personally contact this service at 0800 387 4444 and the Centre&#xD;
      will give the investigator a code number, known only to the randomisation centre and local&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be coordinated from Clinical Neuroscience at St. George's, University of&#xD;
      London. The principal co-investigators are Professor John Norris and Professor Hugh Markus.&#xD;
      The principal neuroradiological investigator, responsible for assessment of hard copies of&#xD;
      imaging, is Dr Andrew Clifton. The trial will be coordinated by a clinical fellow funded by a&#xD;
      project grant from The Stroke Association.&#xD;
