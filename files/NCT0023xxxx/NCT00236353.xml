    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of long-acting&#xD;
      risperidone given as a once monthly injection to adult patients with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Risperidone, taken by mouth on a daily basis, has been an effective treatment for&#xD;
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Risperidone is also available in a long-acting&#xD;
      injectable form so that patients can take their medicine by bi-weekly injections. This study&#xD;
      will assess the effectiveness and safety of long-acting risperidone injection given once a&#xD;
      month instead of every two weeks (based on previous studies with dosing every 2 weeks).&#xD;
      During the four-week lead-in phase, patients will receive one 50-milligram injection every&#xD;
      two weeks for two doses. Patients continue to take their prescribed dose of risperidone&#xD;
      tablets (from 2 to 6 milligrams per day) for the first 14 days. After the first month,&#xD;
      patients will receive one 50-milligram injection once a month for 48 weeks. This dose can be&#xD;
      increased to 75 milligrams if patient meets relapse criteria, and is willing to stay in the&#xD;
      trial. Patients will be asked questions to help determine how well the monthly injections are&#xD;
      working. Laboratory tests (including drug levels), physical examinations and adverse event&#xD;
      reporting will be performed to determine the safety of the monthly injections. Risperidone&#xD;
      oral tablets, 2 to 6 milligrams per day, for first 2 weeks; long-acting risperidone&#xD;
      intramuscular injections, 50 mg in 2 milliliters of liquid, every 2 weeks for 1 month, then&#xD;
      injections once a month for 48 weeks. Monthly injection dose may be increased to 75 mg in&#xD;
      2-mL if needed.&#xD;
