      High-dose chemotherapy (HD-CT) is able to circumvent platinum-resistance of&#xD;
      resistant/refractory germ-cell tumors (GCTs), but expectancy of cure remains low. New&#xD;
      strategies are needed with new drugs and a sequential approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with relapsed (but not absolutely refractory to Cisplatinum-based chemotherapy)&#xD;
      poor-prognosis GCTs are scheduled to receive 2 cycles combining epirubicin and paclitaxel&#xD;
      followed by 3 consecutive HD-CT supported by stem cell transplantation. One course will&#xD;
      combine Taxol, 360 mg/m² + thiotepa, 720 mg/m², followed by two ICE regimens (Ifosfamide, 12&#xD;
      g/m², carboplatin, AUC 20, etoposide, 1500 mg/m²).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase II study is designed as a Gehan method. The main objective of the study is the&#xD;
      complete response rate. With this aim in view, it is planned to enroll in its first step 14&#xD;
      patients to insure that if no complete response (CR) is noticed, study would be stopped for&#xD;
      inefficacy (i.e., a CR rate lower than 20%). If one or more CR are noticed, protocol&#xD;
      specified that up to 45 patients will be included in order to reduce the confidence interval&#xD;
      (CI) of the CR rate. Secondary objectives are the overall response rate (RR), the overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) and the progression-free survival (PFS) rates, toxicity and toxic death rate.&#xD;
      The statistical analysis is done in terms of intent-to-treat.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment is designed for relapsed poor prognosis patients with testicular or&#xD;
      extra-gonadal GCTs previously treated with cisplatin-containing regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor prognosis patients are defined as either relapsed/refractory patients more than one&#xD;
      month after cisplatin administration, whether in the course of first-line CT or in that of&#xD;
      salvage treatment, or patients who showed evidence of progression after at least 2 lines of&#xD;
      cisplatin-containing CT (i.e., BEP and VeIP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility requirements includes the following criteria: age &gt;18 years and &lt; 65, performance&#xD;
      status &lt; 3, histologically or biologically documented GCTs, testicular, abdominal or&#xD;
      mediastinal tumors, measurable or evaluable disease, life expectancy &gt; 3 months, normal&#xD;
      cardiac, liver, and renal function tests, absence of infection, HIV negative test, and signed&#xD;
      informed consent. All patients had to have been previously treated with at least one line of&#xD;
      a cisplatin-containing regimen and were included if they were refractory after one or two&#xD;
      line(s) of cisplatin-based CT, or had relapsed after two lines of a cisplatin-based CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inclusion criteria are: patients with 'BEYER' score &gt; 3, growing teratoma syndrome,&#xD;
      possibility of being treated with a conventional cisplatin-based CT, and previous HD-CT&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial evaluation: each patient must have a clinical evaluation that includes&#xD;
      measurements of tumor marker levels, and an imaging work up. The tumor marker levels are&#xD;
      determined every week during all the sequence of treatment (normal level &lt; 10 ng/ml for&#xD;
      alpha-foetoprotein and &lt; 2 mU/mL for HCG). The tumor mass is measured after the first two&#xD;
      cycles of induction/mobilization therapy and at the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy, patients are scheduled to receive 2 courses of front-line mobilization CT&#xD;
      followed by 3 HD-CT supported by PBSCT. The front-line treatment consists in a combination of&#xD;
      epirubicin, (100 mg/m² in a 30-minute infusion), and paclitaxel (Taxol, 250 mg/m² given in a&#xD;
      3-hour infusion), administered both on days 1 and 14. These 2 cycles are supported by&#xD;
      filgrastim (Neupogen), 5 µg/kg, twice a day from days 2 and 15, respectively, until apheresis&#xD;
      performed on days 10-13 and 24-27. Apheresis is stopped when at least 9 x 106 CD34+ cells/Kg&#xD;
      of BW are obtained for the 3 grafts. A third cycle is permitted if the number of CD34+ cells&#xD;
      is not achieved after the first 2 cycles, provided the patient was responsive to CT, or for&#xD;
      any reason decided upon by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first HD-CT regimen consists in an association of thiotepa, 720 mg/m² and taxol, 360&#xD;
      mg/m², both administered in a continuous infusion over 3 days (D34 to D36). The first pack of&#xD;
      CD34+ cells is infused on day 39. The second and the third courses (ICE) scheduled on days&#xD;
      62-66 and 90-94 respectively, consist in a combination of etoposide (150 mg/m² twice a day,&#xD;
      in a 2-hour infusion, for 5 days), ifosfamide (2 400 mg/m²/d in a 3-hour infusion, for 5&#xD;
      days) supported by sodium mercaptoethanesulfonate (mesna, in a 30-minute infusion every 3&#xD;
      hours, during a 12-hour period, initiated at the same time as the ifosfamide infusion), and&#xD;
      carboplatin (AUC 4/d, in a 6-hour infusion, for 5 days). Infusion of PBSCs is planned on days&#xD;
      71 and 99. During the 3 high-dose therapies, G-CSF is administered at a daily dose of 5µg/kg,&#xD;
      from the day of PBSC infusion until PMN recovery (i.e., PMN &gt; 1.5 x 109/L). Each of these ICE&#xD;
      regimens is delayed if the PMN level is less than 1.5 x 109/L and/or the platelet level less&#xD;
      than 100 x 109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity and response to therapy are evaluated according to the ECOG and WHO criteria. The&#xD;
      duration of response is calculated from the date of documented response to the date of&#xD;
      progression. The duration of PFS and OS are calculated from the date of inclusion to the date&#xD;
      of progression, or death if no progression (PFS), and the date of death (OS), according to&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier's method. Survival curves are established according to the classification&#xD;
      proposed by BEYER et al. Progression, death from treatment and withdrawal from protocol for&#xD;
      whatever reason are considered as treatment failures. Whenever possible, patients in clinical&#xD;
      partial response (PR) with normal tumor markers (PRm-) will be proposed for surgery of&#xD;
      residual masses at the end of the whole procedure. Sequential procedures are proposed in the&#xD;
      case of multiple metastatic sites. If surgery is complete and the pathological examination&#xD;
      does not show any viable tumor, patients will be considered as complete responders. If&#xD;
      surgery is complete and the pathological examination showed persistent viable tumor, they&#xD;
      will be considered as surgical complete response.&#xD;
