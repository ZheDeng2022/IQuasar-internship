  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the long-term use of highly (&gt;98%)&#xD;
      purified EPA, in addition to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), would be more effective&#xD;
      than statin alone in preventing cardiovascular events in Japanese patients with&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies from many countries including Finland, Italy, Japan, and The&#xD;
      Netherlands have suggested that an increased intake of dietary fish or fish oil rich in the&#xD;
      long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and&#xD;
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is inversely related to the risk of atherothrombotic diseases, in&#xD;
      particular coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of many prospective observational cohort studies have found that diets rich in marine&#xD;
      PUFAs may be protective against major cardiovascular events, including mortality from CAD,&#xD;
      total cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, and nonfatal myocardial infarction. To date,&#xD;
      only a few studies have examined the effects of purified n-3 PUFA preparations in human&#xD;
      subjects for short observation periods. The principle aim of the current study is to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the long-term use of highly purified EPA(eicosapentaenoic acid: 1800mg/day),&#xD;
      in addition to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is effective in preventing cardiovascular events&#xD;
      in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible participants had a total cholesterol level of â‰§250mg/dL(6.5m mol/L) at&#xD;
             baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperlipidemic patients with serum total cholesterol of 250mg/dL or more. (Measurement&#xD;
             of serum total cholesterol)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum total cholesterol should be measured twice at interval of 2-4weeks. A single&#xD;
             measurement is acceptable if the cholesterol is measured by blood collection at&#xD;
             fasting under strict compliance with dietary advice after withdrawal of the&#xD;
             antihyperlipemic drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (Wash Out) The wash out period of 4weeks (8 weeks for probucol) is necessary in&#xD;
             patients under treatment with antihyperlipemic drug. However, if treatment with the&#xD;
             antihyperlipemic drug was started within 6 months of the initiation of the study, the&#xD;
             patient can participate in the study without the washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute myocardial infarction occurring within last 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable angina pectoris&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history or complication of serious heart disease(severe arrhythmia, heart failure,&#xD;
             cardiac myopathy, valvular disease, congenital disease, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving cardiovascular reconstruction within last 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cerebrovascular disorders occurring within last 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complication of serious hepatic disease or renal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignant tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrollable diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperlipidemia arising from the following disease: Nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism,&#xD;
             Cushing's syndrome, secondary hyperlipidemia due to other disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperlipidemia due to some drugs such as steroid hormone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemorrhage(hemophilia, capillary fragility, gastrointestinal ulcer, urinary tract&#xD;
             hemorrhage, hemoptysis, vitreous hemorrhage, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemorrhagic diathesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to the study drug formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients intending to undergo surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients judged to be inappropriate by the physician in charge&#xD;
