      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine and arsenic trioxide, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of azacitidine when&#xD;
      given together with arsenic trioxide and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of azacitidine when given in combination with&#xD;
           arsenic trioxide in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the major hematologic response (erythroid response) rate in patients with&#xD;
           transfusion-dependent lower-risk MDS treated with this regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine complete and partial remission rates in patients with higher-risk MDS treated&#xD;
           with this regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase I&#xD;
           and II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this&#xD;
           regimen. (Phase I and II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an multicenter, open-label, phase I, dose escalation study of azacitidine&#xD;
      followed by a phase II study. Patients enrolled in the phase II portion are stratified&#xD;
      according to baseline International Scoring System score (lower-risk myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndromes [MDS] vs higher-risk MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously once daily on days 1-5 and arsenic&#xD;
           trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25. Courses repeat every&#xD;
           28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with&#xD;
           stable disease may receive up to 8 courses of therapy. Patients with responding disease&#xD;
           may continue to receive study therapy until a major response or a complete remission is&#xD;
           achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of azacitidine until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients receive arsenic trioxide as in phase I and azacitidine as in phase I&#xD;
           at one dose level below the MTD determined in phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3-12&#xD;
      months for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-18 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of&#xD;
      this study. A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for the phase II portion&#xD;
      of this study.&#xD;
