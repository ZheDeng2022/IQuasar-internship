    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      topiramate in infants aged 1-24 months with refractory partial-onset seizures. Topiramate is&#xD;
      an antiepileptic drug approved for use in adult and pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years)&#xD;
      with refractory partial onset seizures (POS) with or without secondarily generalized&#xD;
      seizures, primary generalized tonic clonic seizures, or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS).&#xD;

      This is a open-label, randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on&#xD;
      chance), dose comparison, multicenter study of topiramate in infants of age 1-24 months with&#xD;
      refractory partial-onset seizures (POS). The trial will evaluate the pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of topiramate used as additional treatment in infants with&#xD;
      refractory POS. Topiramate is administered as liquid and sprinkles as adjunct (additional&#xD;
      treatment) to concurrent anticonvulsant therapy. The study will consist of 4 phases: a&#xD;
      pretreatment phase that includes screening (up to 7 days) and baseline (1 day), an open-label&#xD;
      treatment phase (up to 6 weeks), an open-label extension phase (54 weeks), and a&#xD;
      posttreatment phase (up to 4 weeks). Seizure diaries will be maintained throughout the study&#xD;
      by the patients' parents, legally acceptable representatives, or caregivers. In the&#xD;
      open-label treatment phase, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments:&#xD;
      topiramate 3, 5, 15, or 25 mg/kg per day. Venous blood samples (four 1 milliliter [mL]&#xD;
      samples) will be collected on 2 days during the study to determine plasma concentration of&#xD;
      topiramate. Safety will be evaluated throughout the study by monitoring adverse events and by&#xD;
      results from clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, venous ammonia, hematology, and&#xD;
      urinalysis), electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital sign measurements (pulse and blood pressure),&#xD;
      physical examination, neurologic examination, Vineland Scales of Adaptive Behavior, renal&#xD;
      ultrasound, assessments for adequate food and liquid intake, hyperthermia, oligohydrosis, and&#xD;
      rash, and take-home records. Liquid or sprinkles form of topiramate, 3,5,15,or 25mg/kg per&#xD;
      day for 54 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular enteral feeding (solid food&#xD;

          -  bottle- or cup-fed) with or without breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  weigh &gt;/=3.5 kilograms (kg) and &lt;15.5 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Length using an infant measuring table (heel to crown) must be = 49 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  clinical or electroencephalographic (EEG) evidence of POS (simple or complex) with or&#xD;
             without secondary generalization of at least 1 month in duration in infants &gt;6 months&#xD;
             of age, or at least 2 weeks in duration in infants &lt;6 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multiple seizure types allowed as long as POS is present&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking 1 or 2 concurrent marketed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for &gt;1 month for infants&#xD;
             &gt;6 months of age and for &gt;2 weeks for infants &lt;6 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the regimen of AEDs at entry must be considered inadequate in controlling seizures,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have had a computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan to confirm the&#xD;
             absence of a progressive lesion such as a tumor, with the exception of lesions of&#xD;
             tuberous sclerosis and Sturge-Weber syndrome, which are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
