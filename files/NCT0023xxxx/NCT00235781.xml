      The aim of this trial is to compare the safety and efficacy of a single dose of&#xD;
      Thymoglobulin, rabbit derived antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin, SangStat, Fremont, CA)&#xD;
      to our standard four dose, four day Thymoglobulin induction regimen from the time of&#xD;
      transplantation through a six month follow-up period. The primary endpoint will be the&#xD;
      incidence of acute rejection. Secondary endpoints will include serious adverse events,&#xD;
      evaluation of renal function, patient and graft survival, incidence of infectious&#xD;
      complications, incidence of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD),&#xD;
      duration and extent of lymphocyte depletion and immunoassays for evidence of recipient immune&#xD;
      response to the allograft as well as duration of hospital stay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction therapy, using polyclonal or monoclonal antibody preparations as an adjunct&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agent during the initial transplant period, has helped to decrease the&#xD;
      incidence of acute rejection significantly. In the 1980's acute rejection occurred in&#xD;
      approximately 50% of renal transplant recipients. In the current era of transplantation, the&#xD;
      combination of potent induction agents and newly available maintenance immunosuppressive&#xD;
      agents has reduced the acute rejection rate to less than 20% at most transplant centers. Our&#xD;
      center has routinely achieved acute rejection rates of approximately 5% using a standard&#xD;
      induction protocol with the polyclonal antibody agent Thymoglobulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventing acute rejection significantly decreases the requirement for re-hospitalization,&#xD;
      the need for diagnostic renal allograft biopsy and subsequent exposure to high dose&#xD;
      corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. The threat of early allograft loss&#xD;
      secondary to rejection refractory to treatment or permanent injury and shortened graft&#xD;
      survival following treatment of a severe rejection is also circumvented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyclonal antibody preparations are produced by immunizing animals with human lymphocytes or&#xD;
      thymocytes. Polyclonal antibody preparations are approved for treatment of acute renal&#xD;
      allograft rejection, but are routinely used as induction agents and for prevention of&#xD;
      rejection in all solid organ allografts. Commercially available preparations in the United&#xD;
      States are equine/thymocyte derived (Atgam, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) and&#xD;
      rabbit/thymocyte derived (Thymoglobulin, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rabbit derived preparations are thought to be potentially more efficacious than equine&#xD;
      derived products. Studies performed at this renal transplant center demonstrated that&#xD;
      Thymoglobulin has superior efficacy compared to Atgam in the prevention of rejection (1). Not&#xD;
      only was the acute rejection rate lower, but graft survival was also better at 1 and 5-years&#xD;
      (1). [Hardinger, 2004 #18]. This result has been attributed in part to a more pronounced and&#xD;
      prolonged lymphopenia induced by Thymoglobulin (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad specificity of polyclonal agents to multiple cell signaling and adhesion molecules&#xD;
      provides a theoretic advantage compared to monoclonal antibodies. In addition to inducing a&#xD;
      profound and prolonged lymphopenia through complement-dependent lysis or by opsonization and&#xD;
      phagocytosis, the broad specificity of polyclonal antibody agents affects multiple&#xD;
      costimulatory and adhesion molecules involved in cellular and antibody mediated immune&#xD;
      processes. The effects on adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines and platelets may be&#xD;
      critical to the noted decrease in the incidence of delayed renal allograft function&#xD;
      associated with initiation of Thymoglobulin therapy intraoperatively (3). Prevention of&#xD;
      delayed graft function may also subsequently decrease the incidence of acute rejection and&#xD;
      prolong allograft survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a potent induction agent such as Thymoglobulin also allows for a delayed&#xD;
      introduction of maintenance immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors in the immediate&#xD;
      post-transplant setting. The ability to delay the introduction of therapeutic doses of&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibitors, when necessary, can also assist in decreasing the incidence of&#xD;
      delayed graft function and simplifies patient management in this time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thymoglobulin has now become the preferred polyclonal agent used for induction in renal&#xD;
      transplantation. The most recent complete yearly data from the Scientific Registry of&#xD;
      Transplant Recipients in 2003 indicated that 70% of all renal transplant recipients in that&#xD;
      calendar year received some form of induction therapy. Thymoglobulin (34% of patients) was&#xD;
      the most commonly administered agent, while one of two available monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      preparations directed against the interleukin-2 receptor (IL2-R) was administered to&#xD;
      approximately 35% of renal transplant recipients (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When Thymoglobulin is used in the treatment of acute rejection, a total dose of 10-12mg/kg is&#xD;
      often administered over the course of several days (5). The optimal dose of Thymoglobulin&#xD;
      that should be administered for induction is unclear, although a primate model suggests a&#xD;
      total human equivalent dose of approximately 6mg/kg may be appropriate (6). Most transplant&#xD;
      centers using Thymoglobulin for induction have administered a total dose of 6-10mg/kg, given&#xD;
      at varying intervals (usually daily or every other day) with each individual dose usually&#xD;
      given as 1 to 1.5mg/kg/day over approximately six hours. Our standard induction protocol has&#xD;
      been 1.5mg/kg/day for a total of four doses (total dose 6mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to administer Thymoglobulin as a single, large dose has several potential&#xD;
      pharmacoeconomic benefits. This administration protocol would simplify post-transplant care&#xD;
      in the hospital and allow for earlier patient discharge. Cost savings would result from both&#xD;
      a shorter hospital stay and decreased administration costs associated with fewer intravenous&#xD;
      administrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of a single, large dose infusion of Thymoglobulin has been used in an&#xD;
      attempt to induce &quot;prope´&quot; (Latin for almost) allograft tolerance (7). In this study, that&#xD;
      included 50 renal allograft recipients, a single dose infusion of Thymoglobulin (5mg/kg) was&#xD;
      used in conjunction with a marked minimization of maintenance immunosuppression. The&#xD;
      induction protocol was well tolerated, and maintenance immunosuppression consisted of&#xD;
      monotherapy with tacrolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study described the administration of Thymoglobulin 5mg/kg/day given as two separate&#xD;
      doses (10mg/kg total) in 39 renal allograft recipients (8). One dose was administered on the&#xD;
      day of transplantation and the subsequent dose on post-transplant day number one. No patients&#xD;
      in this study were withdrawn secondary to adverse events and the acute rejection rate was 6%&#xD;
      with a patient and graft survival of 95% at a mean follow-up of 14.5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously performed a short course Thymoglobulin induction study using an initial&#xD;
      dose of 3mg/kg with subsequent doses of 1.5mg/kg on post-transplant days one and two (9).&#xD;
      This regimen was well tolerated and resulted in a low acute rejection rate of 5%, a one year&#xD;
      graft survival of 95% and earlier hospital discharge compared to a previously standard seven&#xD;
      day Thymoglobulin induction protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we hypothesize that a single dose of Thymoglobulin (6mg/kg), initiated intraoperatively&#xD;
      and administered over the course of 24 hours, will have comparable safety and efficacy as&#xD;
      compared to our current standard induction protocol of four separate doses of Thymoglobulin&#xD;
      1.5mg/kg (total dose 6mg/kg). Single dose administration of Thymoglobulin should provide a&#xD;
      low rate of acute rejection, a low rate of delayed graft function, allow for delayed&#xD;
      introduction of calcineurin inhibitors if indicated, and potentially allow for earlier&#xD;
      patient discharge while consuming fewer resources. If this single dose induction protocol&#xD;
      demonstrates similar safety and efficacy to our current standard four dose induction&#xD;
      protocol, it may become our standard of care. This study may also be a bridge to subsequent&#xD;
      dose finding studies for single dose Thymoglobulin administration and subsequent comparative&#xD;
      studies of single-dose Thymoglobulin to other induction agents.&#xD;
