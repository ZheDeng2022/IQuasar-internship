  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the response rate of treatment with two&#xD;
      cycles of cisplatin and docetaxel chemotherapy prior to surgery (neoadjuvant) for early stage&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Secondary objectives of this study include assessment of&#xD;
      radiographic response rate by computed tomography (CT) scanning, overall survival, time to&#xD;
      progression, rate of complete surgical removal, and adverse reactions. In addition, this&#xD;
      study will test whether positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can predict a tumor&#xD;
      response. Patients who have a response to chemotherapy may receive 2 additional cycles after&#xD;
      recovering from surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80% of new lung cancer diagnoses in the US.&#xD;
      Surgery is the primary most successful treatment for early stage patients. However, even lung&#xD;
      cancers caught at an early stage (stage IB through selected IIIA) have 5 year survivals after&#xD;
      surgery at a rate of only 10-60%. Postoperative platinum based chemotherapy offers a 4-15%&#xD;
      survival benefit, depending on stage in fit patients after complete surgical removal of early&#xD;
      stage disease. Preoperative platinum based chemotherapy has been shown in small randomized&#xD;
      trials to benefit patients with stage IIIA, N2 positive disease, but is not standard of care&#xD;
      in earlier stage disease, such as the population in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of cisplatin and docetaxel is approved in the US for front line therapy of&#xD;
      stage IV NSCLC based on randomized clinical data showing efficacy and manageable toxicity.&#xD;
      Given the efficacy and tolerance of this combination in the metastatic setting, this regimen&#xD;
      is an obvious choice for study in the neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET imaging is approved in the US for determining size, site and spread of lung cancer&#xD;
      (staging) and has been shown to reduce unnecessary surgery when used as part of preoperative&#xD;
      evaluation. Because NSCLC is not 100% responsive to chemotherapy and CT scans may not show a&#xD;
      change in tumor size until after several cycles of chemotherapy, PET imaging might be an&#xD;
      effective way to provide an earlier and more reliable estimate of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative chemotherapy will be given for a total of two cycles 21 days apart if any&#xD;
      adverse events have resolved and there is no evidence of disease progression. Patients will&#xD;
      undergo CT chest through liver and PET scans for restaging following the second cycle and&#xD;
      will then be scheduled for surgery 3-6 weeks after the second cycle of chemotherapy. Patients&#xD;
      who have responded according to CT and/or PET imaging, or surgical pathology will go on to&#xD;
      receive an additional two cycles of chemotherapy with docetaxel and cisplatin once the&#xD;
      patient has recovered from surgery.&#xD;
