      This study aims at testing the efficacy of a physical activity (PA)intervention in an&#xD;
      outpatient oncology setting. We plan to compare Brief Advice for PA (MD advice plus contact&#xD;
      control) vs. Extended Advice (MD advice plus telephone-based PA counseling by research staff)&#xD;
      over 3 months among 300 women who have completed treatment for breast cancer in the past 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The primary aim is to examine the effects of oncologists' advice on PA plus&#xD;
      telephone counseling (Extended Advice) vs. oncologists' advice (Brief Advice) alone on&#xD;
      minutes of moderate-intensity PA at 3 months among 300 sedentary women who have completed&#xD;
      treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims include examining a) the effects of the two interventions on participants'&#xD;
      moderate-intensity PA at 6 and 12 months, b) the effects of the interventions on&#xD;
      participants' physical functioning, fatigue, vigor and quality of life (QOL) at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months, and c) the acceptability of the interventions to the oncologists and the usefulness&#xD;
      of the interventions to patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: With improved survival rates, there are growing numbers of cancer survivors.&#xD;
      These individuals report impaired physical functioning, anxiety and depressed mood, fatigue,&#xD;
      and reduced quality of life after treatment. In addition, they may be at increased risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, obesity, osteoporosis and future cancers. Prior research has&#xD;
      demonstrated that moderate-intensity physical activity (PA) can improve enhance physical&#xD;
      functioning, reduce fatigue and improve vigor among cancer patients and those who have&#xD;
      completed medical treatments. These efforts have not been integrated with the healthcare&#xD;
      system. Data support the role of primary care providers in promoting PA among their sedentary&#xD;
      patients; the role of oncologists in encouraging patients to become physically active has not&#xD;
      been examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This study aims at testing the efficacy of a PA intervention in an outpatient&#xD;
      oncology setting. We plan to compare Brief Advice for PA (MD advice plus contact control) vs.&#xD;
      Extended Advice (MD advice plus telephone-based PA counseling by research staff) over 3&#xD;
      months among 300 women who have completed treatment for breast cancer in the past 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The primary aim is to examine the effects of oncologists' advice on PA plus&#xD;
      telephone counseling (Extended Advice) vs. oncologists' advice (Brief Advice) alone on&#xD;
      minutes of moderate-intensity PA at 3 months among 300 sedentary women who have completed&#xD;
      treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims include examining a) the effects of the two interventions on participants'&#xD;
      moderate-intensity PA at 6 and 12 months, b) the effects of the interventions on&#xD;
      participants' physical functioning, fatigue, vigor and quality of life (QOL) at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months, and c) the acceptability of the interventions to the oncologists and the usefulness&#xD;
      of the interventions to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A randomized, controlled trial will be conducted in outpatient oncology&#xD;
      practices in Rhode Island. Within this setting, the oncologists and research staff will offer&#xD;
      a 3 month, theoretically-based intervention to increase moderate-intensity PA among 300&#xD;
      sedentary women aged 18 and older who attend cancer follow-up visits. The unit of&#xD;
      randomization will be at the patient level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer Relevance: If the data are promising, the study lays the groundwork for improving&#xD;
      cancer recovery by integrating a brief PA intervention into follow-up care for cancer&#xD;
      survivors. This study offers the potential to improve the follow-up care for cancer survivors&#xD;
      by encouraging them to becoming physically active, to help reduce the emotional and physical&#xD;
      side-effects of cancer and its treatment, as well as possibly reduce their risk for other&#xD;
      chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.&#xD;
