  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess physical functionality changes over a minimum of 9&#xD;
      weeks in patients with non-malignant chronic low back pain who are taking short-acting&#xD;
      opioids (narcotic pain medications) for 4 or more weeks, and who start taking the long-acting&#xD;
      opioid fentanyl in the form of a transdermal (skin) patch.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain (pain that lasts for more than 3 months) can limit physical functioning and&#xD;
      negatively affect a person socially and emotionally. Chronic low back pain (that is not&#xD;
      caused by cancer) is a very common condition that affects up to a third of people in the US&#xD;
      at any time. The primary objective of the trial is to assess functionality changes over a&#xD;
      minimum period of 9 weeks using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) - a questionnaire to&#xD;
      measure disability - in patients with non-malignant chronic low back pain who are taking&#xD;
      short-acting opioids chronically, and who initiate treatment with Duragesic速 (transdermal&#xD;
      fentanyl). The patch delivers fentanyl in doses of 25, 50, 75, or 100 micrograms per hour.&#xD;
      The ODI is comprised of 10 sections; each section consists of 6 response alternatives. The 10&#xD;
      scales assessed by the ODI are Pain Intensity, Personal Care (washing, dressing, etc.),&#xD;
      Lifting, Walking, Sitting, Standing, Sleeping, Sex Life, Social Life, and Traveling. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to assess changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) over the&#xD;
      treatment period using the Total Pain Experience (TPE) subscale of the Treatment Outcomes in&#xD;
      Pain Survey (TOPS), a questionnaire designed to measure HRQoL changes in patients with&#xD;
      chronic pain. The TOPS contains 112 items that are scored into 16 scales. These scales&#xD;
      include: Pain Symptoms, Lower Body Functional Limitations, Upper Body Functional Limitations,&#xD;
      Perceived Family/Social Disability, Objective Family/Social Disability, Objective Work&#xD;
      Disability, TPE (a combination of 5 other scales), Life Control, Passive Coping, Solicitous&#xD;
      Responses, Work Limitations, Fear Avoidance, Patient Satisfaction with Outcomes, Health Care&#xD;
      Satisfaction, Vitality, and Mental Health (the last two from a questionnaire known as the&#xD;
      Short Form-36, or SF-36. Fentanyl transdermal system (skin patch) in a dosage prescribed by&#xD;
      the clinical investigator according to the usual standard of care.&#xD;
