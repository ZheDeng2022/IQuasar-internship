  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether the immune responses induced by Fluviral, the&#xD;
      investigational vaccine, are comparable to those induced by Fluzone, which is an influenza&#xD;
      vaccine currently licensed in the U.S. The study focuses on persons 50 years old and over. In&#xD;
      addition, the study will compare the rate of reactions to the two vaccines, and the general&#xD;
      health of persons who receive them over the 42 days after immunization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yearly influenza epidemics are responsible for excess hospitalizations and deaths in the&#xD;
      elderly population, and also cause lost work and productivity among the healthy, working&#xD;
      elderly. Fluviral, a product now licensed in Canada, is being tested to determine whether it&#xD;
      is as active in causing immune responses, and as safe as a currently licensed U.S. vaccine in&#xD;
      persons 50 y.o. and over.&#xD;
