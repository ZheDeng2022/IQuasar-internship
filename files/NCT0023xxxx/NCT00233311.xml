      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether eating a fast food meal (high in&#xD;
      saturated fat) will result in greater increases in inflammatory markers than eating a meal&#xD;
      with low levels of saturated fat and higher levels of mono-unsaturated fat. This study is a&#xD;
      first step in learning about how dietary fat intake can directly impact risk factors for&#xD;
      heart disease, diabetes and obesity.&#xD;

      At the first visit, each potential participant will undergo the screening examination,&#xD;
      including laboratory tests. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed at baseline to exclude&#xD;
      participants with evidence of myocardial infarction. Each participant will complete a Food&#xD;
      Intake Record to assess typical dietary patterns. Cognitive status will be assessed with the&#xD;
      Mini-Mental Status Exam. The potential participant must acknowledge his or her willingness to&#xD;
      consume the two test meals designed for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During visits 2 and 3, the participant will undergo the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test. The Fast&#xD;
      Food and Healthy Meals will be administered during Visits 4,5,6 &amp; 7. After fasting for at&#xD;
      least 8 hours, the participant will have an intravenous (IV) line placed in an arm vein.&#xD;
      Twenty minutes will be allotted for participants to complete each experimental meal (either&#xD;
      the fast food or healthy meal). At the end of the 20 minutes, blood will be collected through&#xD;
      an intravenous port over an eight-hour time period. Baseline blood samples will also be&#xD;
      collected prior to each meal. The two mixed meals will be: 1) a fast-food meal equivalent to&#xD;
      the Big Mac Meal with French fries and milkshake; 2) a meal with the same fat distribution as&#xD;
      the fast-food meal with fats derived from mono-unsaturated fat sources. A registered&#xD;
      dietitian will prepare both of the meals. To prevent any carry-over effects from previous&#xD;
      meals, participants will be asked to fast overnight with their last meal being a light dinner&#xD;
      no later 12 hours before scheduled testing. In addition, participants will be asked to avoid&#xD;
      high fat, high calorie meals during the course of the study. Participants will be given&#xD;
      specific dietary guidelines to follow during the course of the study and in the four days&#xD;
      preceding the OGTT at visit 2. They will be asked to complete a diet diary so that their&#xD;
      adherence to the dietary recommendations can be monitored. All participants will be asked to&#xD;
      continue with their normal exercise routine with the exception that no exercise is to be done&#xD;
      in the 24 hours prior to each testing session. During the OGTT and the testing sessions for&#xD;
      the two meals, an ECG will be continuously recorded using a Holter monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of the different meals (different nutrient compositions) will cause&#xD;
           differential increases in the circulating levels of inflammatory markers. Specifically,&#xD;
           the fast-food meal (high in saturated fat) will cause a greater increase in circulating&#xD;
           inflammatory markers, specifically C-reactive protein (CRP), than the oral glucose or&#xD;
           the mono-unsaturated fat meal. Also, this difference in inflammatory response will not&#xD;
           be explained by parallel changes in circulating lipid levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inflammatory response within an individual to the standard oral glucose tolerance&#xD;
           test (OGTT) and to each meal is reproducible over a 48-hour period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypothesis is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the serum level of glucose and insulin following a standard oral glucose&#xD;
           tolerance test will predict changes in circulating levels of inflammatory markers after&#xD;
           both meals&#xD;
