      Combination chemo/radiotherapy trials in advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer are ongoing.&#xD;
      The optimal radiation modality, chemotherapeutic agents, and sequence of these regimens for&#xD;
      the treatment of UPSC are yet to be established. A retrospective review of 16 patients&#xD;
      treated at our institution with the sequential use of radiation &quot;sandwiched&quot; between&#xD;
      paclitaxel/platinum chemotherapy found only one patient to have recurred at 16 months with a&#xD;
      median follow-up of 15 months (range 6-33 months). The regimen was well tolerated. Eight of&#xD;
      the sixteen patients (50%) developed grade 3 neutropenia following cycle 4 of chemotherapy,&#xD;
      two of which required a 1 week treatment delay. There were no cases of grade 3 or 4&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia noted. There was no febrile neutropenia and no hospital admissions for&#xD;
      toxicity. There were no observed grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicities. With the median&#xD;
      follow up of 15 months, we have not observed late toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these favorable preliminary findings, supported by recently published data documenting&#xD;
      efficacy of the &quot;sandwich&quot; multimodality technique in other difficult uterine malignancies&#xD;
      (malignant mixed mullerian tumors), we propose to study this combination of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation prospectively. Our aim is to better evaluate patterns of recurrence and possible&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) is an uncommon, but aggressive variant of&#xD;
      endometrial carcinoma that has a high recurrence rate and poor response to therapy. It has a&#xD;
      propensity to metastasize throughout the abdomen, similar to serous carcinoma of the ovary.&#xD;
      In fact, many patients with disease apparently confined to the uterus have microscopic&#xD;
      intra-abdominal spread at the time of diagnosis. Recurrences are common both in the pelvis as&#xD;
      well as in the upper abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After staging and debulking of gross disease, adjuvant radiation therapy is recommended to&#xD;
      treat patients with endometrial carcinoma at high risk for recurrent disease. High-risk&#xD;
      features include histologic cell type, grade, depth of myometrial invasion, cervical&#xD;
      extension, lymph-vascular invasion, adnexal involvement, intraperitoneal spread, positive&#xD;
      peritoneal cytology, and positive lymph nodes. Pelvic radiation can limit local recurrences&#xD;
      to less than 6.5%. However, approximately 25-30% of patients with high-risk features who&#xD;
      receive radiation recur with distant metastases. Even patients treated with whole abdominal&#xD;
      irradiation are at risk for extra-abdominal recurrences with progression-free intervals of 7&#xD;
      to 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens have been studied in high-risk endometrial cancers, but&#xD;
      none have demonstrated a survival advantage. Doxorubicin, in combination with platinum, has a&#xD;
      reported 42% response rate, but a high toxicity profile. Paclitaxel has an overall response&#xD;
      rate of 36% in patients with advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer. Platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapies have a 28-42% response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective studies in patients with UPSC have demonstrated response rates of up to 35% in&#xD;
      patients with multiagent chemotherapy. In one study, a median progression-free interval of 30&#xD;
      months was observed in patients treated with paclitaxel and platinum in the adjuvant and&#xD;
      recurrent settings. Based on these findings and the similarities and clinical success of&#xD;
      paclitaxel/platinum therapy in patients with ovarian serous carcinoma, this combination&#xD;
      warrants further investigation in a prospective manner in patients with UPSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination chemo/radiotherapy trials in advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer are ongoing.&#xD;
      The optimal radiation modality, chemotherapeutic agents, and sequence of these regimens for&#xD;
      the treatment of UPSC are yet to be established. A retrospective review of 16 patients&#xD;
      treated at our institution with the sequential use of radiation &quot;sandwiched&quot; between&#xD;
      paclitaxel/platinum chemotherapy found only one patient to have recurred at 16 months with a&#xD;
      median follow-up of 15 months (range 6-33 months). The regimen was well tolerated. Eight of&#xD;
      the sixteen patients (50%) developed grade 3 neutropenia following cycle 4 of chemotherapy,&#xD;
      two of which required a 1 week treatment delay. There were no cases of grade 3 or 4&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia noted. There was no febrile neutropenia and no hospital admissions for&#xD;
      toxicity. There were no observed grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicities. With the median&#xD;
      follow up of 15 months, we have not observed late toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;

      efficacy of the &quot;sandwich&quot; multimodality technique in other difficult uterine malignancies&#xD;
      (malignant mixed mullerian tumors), we propose to study this combination of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation prospectively. Our aim is to better evaluate patterns of recurrence and possible&#xD;
      benefits in progression-free and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surrogate endpoint biomarkers such as ER/PR, HER2/Neu and p53 will be correlated with&#xD;
      prognosis. In addition, fresh frozen tissue will be banked for future cDNA microarray&#xD;
      analyses of UPSC tumors.&#xD;

Note: The original PI has left the institution, therefore Dr. Kuo inherited the study. Efforts were made to contact the PI/study team members to locate the raw data, but were unsuccessful. No AE data are available at this time.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>There are minor differences in the carboplatin doses between the current trial and our pilot study.&#xD;
This is a single institution trial. A limited number of advanced stage patients was accrued.</limitations_and_caveats>
