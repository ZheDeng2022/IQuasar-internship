  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of bladder rehabilitation in a&#xD;
      non-selected group of children with idiopathic overactive bladder and to clarify whether the&#xD;
      effect of the treatment can be increased by addition of a programmable timer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Daytime urinary incontinence is common in children. At the age of 7 a prevalence of 2-9 % has&#xD;
      been reported. Daytime urinary incontinence is a heterogenic multifactorial illness where the&#xD;
      the symptoms has several degrees of severity and can be caused by different mechanisms.&#xD;
      Daytime urinary incontinence can be etiologically classified in the rare neurogenic and&#xD;
      structural forms and the common functional or idiopathic form (where no neurological or&#xD;
      structural cause of the bladder dysfunction can be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptom based diagnosis OAB (overactive bladder) is most often used to describe daytime&#xD;
      urinary incontinence in children. OAB is defined as a symptom syndrome including urgency with&#xD;
      or without urge incontinence in combination with frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When urinary tract infection and neurogenic and structural causes has been excluded the&#xD;
      nonpharmacological bladder rehabilitation is first line treatment in children with OAB. It is&#xD;
      expected that approximately 50 % of the children can be relieved of symptoms by this&#xD;
      treatment. The treatment consist of instruction in good micturition habits including toilet&#xD;
      position, sufficient fluid intake and voidings at predefined intervals. The treatment effect&#xD;
      is to a large degree dependent upon the ability of the children to void at fixed intervals.&#xD;
      Children at the age of 5-10 yrs generally find this difficult and a programmable timer seems&#xD;
      be an useful instrument in order to remind the child of voiding at fixed times. However there&#xD;
      has not been published studies of the effect of programmable timer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daytime urinary incontinence in children aged 5-15 with idiophatic OAB can in 50 % of&#xD;
           cases be cured by bladder rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The compliance of the bladder rehabilitation treatment can for each individual be&#xD;
           increased by adding a programmable timer to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 children with idiopathic OAB will be recruited from the Center of Child Incontinence,&#xD;
      Skejby University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a run-in period of at least 4 weeks the children will be randomized to 12 weeks of&#xD;
      bladder rehabilitation with or without programmable timer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the treatment will be estimated based on home recordings.&#xD;
