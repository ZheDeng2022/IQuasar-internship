      FMF is a rare disease, which permanently affects daily life of the patients with severe pain&#xD;
      and the risk of developing a life threatening amyloidosis. Today there are only very limited&#xD;
      treatment options and an ongoing highly unmet medical need for improved treatment strategies.&#xD;
      This study will be the first randomized, controlled trial to assess the benefit as well as&#xD;
      the safety profile of IL6 receptor inhibition wirth TCZ in patients with FMF. Elevated tissue&#xD;
      and serum levels of IL-6 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of FMF. FMF attacks are&#xD;
      painfull during the period of the attack but are not life- or organthreatening and usually&#xD;
      can be handeled by nonsteroidal and antipyretic treatment. Amyloidos is a longtime&#xD;
      complication that appears after several years of uncontrolled disease. Placebo control&#xD;
      trials' data are characterized as having greater ability to distinguish between effective and&#xD;
      ineffective treatments (that is, greater assay sensitivity). The concerns about placebo use&#xD;
      should revolve around the issue of risk to participants, rather than around denial of&#xD;
      treatment, and that in the absence of a significant risk of harm, placebo treatment is&#xD;
      acceptable. In general, it is easier to achieve statistical significance in&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trials, where effects tend to be larger, such that smaller numbers of&#xD;
      participants need to be exposed to the investigational medication (and research costs are&#xD;
      lower.) This is especially important in rare diseases like FMF. If an active control was&#xD;
      itself never evaluated in a placebo-controlled trial, using it in an equivalency study, begs&#xD;
      the question of its efficacy. This is the case for Canakinumab as a potential active&#xD;
      comparator in FMF. No randomized controlled trial is published for this indication by now.&#xD;
      Therefore, a placebo controlled study over a period of 16 weeks seems to be justifiable&#xD;
      without exposing our patients to risk of serious or irreversible harm. NSAR and antipyretic&#xD;
      treatment, as a rescue therapy for attacks, is possible throughout the study. In addition,&#xD;
      all patients with uncontrolled active disease despite NSAR or paracetamol will drop out and&#xD;
      will be treated with escape therapy, especially Canakinumab. Based on the available safety&#xD;
      data in the RA program, the adverse effects of TCZ have been shown to be manageable (e.g.&#xD;
      cytopenia, liver encyme elevation), reversible and usually not treatment limiting . The&#xD;
      safety profile and tolerability of TCZ are expected to be similar or even better in patients&#xD;
      with FMF than in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or giant cell arteritis, as the cohort of&#xD;
      FMF patients is, in general, younger and shows less concomitant diaseases. Overall, the&#xD;
      benefit-risk ratio of FMF patients to be treated with TCZ is judged positive.&#xD;
