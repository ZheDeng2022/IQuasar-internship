  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a public health problem in Kenya, with 26% of children under-five years of&#xD;
      age stunted, and 26% of pre-school children, 26% of women of reproductive age and 42% of&#xD;
      pregnant women being anaemic, respectively. Agriculture is the main source of income, food&#xD;
      and nutrients for the majority of rural families in Sub-Saharan Africa including Kenya. Most&#xD;
      farmers are smallholders and are vulnerable to poor nutrition. Thus far, programmes have&#xD;
      mostly focused on increasing yields and household income, but not on improving nutritional&#xD;
      status. One Acre Fund (1AF) has over the past 10 years successfully introduced an agriculture&#xD;
      programme to smallholder farmers in Western Kenya focusing on improving harvest. 1AF is&#xD;
      therefore well placed to transform an existing and successful agriculture programme into the&#xD;
      world's largest 'nutrition network' for farmers, and it is the hope that a partnership&#xD;
      between Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) and 1AF will create a strong voice for&#xD;
      nutrition within the agriculture sector. The project aims to use an integrated programme by&#xD;
      introducing nutrition-sensitive (improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH): e.g. soap for&#xD;
      hand washing) and nutrition-specific (e.g. micronutrient supplements) components to 1AF's&#xD;
      agricultural programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of such an integrated programme will be assessed in a cluster-randomized&#xD;
      intervention study in children 6-35 months at recruitment comparing one group receiving the&#xD;
      integrated intervention to another group receiving the agricultural intervention (already in&#xD;
      place).&#xD;

      Background/introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition, and particularly malnutrition in children under 5 years of age, remains a&#xD;
      public health problem in many areas of the world [1]. A diet low in diversity and&#xD;
      micronutrient density is one contributing factor while a second factor is poor water,&#xD;
      sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices often leading to diseases such as persistent&#xD;
      diarrhoea and resulting in morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years of age.&#xD;
      According to the WHO World Health Statistics 2017 that are monitoring health in order to&#xD;
      reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [2] including data from between 2006 and 2015,&#xD;
      the global under 5 mortality rate per 1000 live birth is 42.5 and is clearly highest in the&#xD;
      African Region with 81.3 while in Kenya it is lower than the African average with 49.4. The&#xD;
      picture is similar for maternal mortality with 216 per 100,000 live births globally but with&#xD;
      the highest in the African region with 542 and 510 in Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistics also look at several WASH indicators. The mortality rate attributed to&#xD;
      exposure to unsafe WASH services per 100,000 populations is clearly highest in the African&#xD;
      region with a burden of 43.1, while the global burden is at 12.4, and with Kenya slightly&#xD;
      below the African burden with 32.5. In line with this, two additional WASH indicators&#xD;
      demonstrate the poor status in the African region. The use of improved drinking water source&#xD;
      is lowest in the African region with 68%, while globally 91% use an improved source and in&#xD;
      all the other WHO regions it is over 90%. Kenya is slightly below the African average with&#xD;
      63% using an improved drinking water source. Looking at sanitation the use of improved&#xD;
      sanitation is lowest in the African region with only 32% and is similar at the Kenyan level&#xD;
      with 30% while globally 68% use improved sanitation. The most recent Kenya Demographic and&#xD;
      Health Survey in 2014 estimates that only about a third of households in Kenya have washing&#xD;
      places at their homes [3]. Also, nationally, three out of four households share toilets with&#xD;
      other households or have unimproved toilets (open defecation, open latrines, etc.).&#xD;
      Malnutrition is specifically covered in SDG Target 2.2 (By end 2030, end all forms of&#xD;
      malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting&#xD;
      and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent&#xD;
      girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons). The WHO statistics indicate a&#xD;
      worldwide problem with 22.9% of children under 5 years of age stunted and 7.7% wasted. While&#xD;
      the Africa Region (33.5% and 7.4%)) together with the South-East-Asia Region (33.8% and&#xD;
      15.3)) have the highest stunting and wasting prevalence, respectively, the prevalence in&#xD;
      Kenya is below the Africa average with 26.0% stunted and only 4% wasted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agriculture is the main source of income, food and nutrients for the majority of rural&#xD;
      families in Sub-Saharan Africa including Kenya. Most rural families in Sub-Saharan Africa are&#xD;
      smallholder farmers, and rely on agricultural produce for income and direct consumption.&#xD;
      Despite the fact that these households are food producers, research has shown that rural&#xD;
      farming households are typically net food consumers and are more vulnerable to malnutrition&#xD;
      [4]. Decades of investments in the agriculture sector have focused on improving yields and&#xD;
      income but have notably failed to improve the nutrition status of farming families and their&#xD;
      children [5]. Since 2006, One Acre Fund (1AF) has been providing a bundle of services and&#xD;
      agricultural inputs to smallholder farmers using a model where farmers take loans to pay for&#xD;
      inputs and services received. The core service bundle includes environmentally appropriate&#xD;
      seed and fertilizer, physical delivery of inputs, training, and small loans. 1AF currently&#xD;
      reaches 445,000 farming households in Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi, and Uganda.&#xD;
      Kenya was 1AF's first country of operation and their activities will soon cover all of&#xD;
      Western and Nyanza Provinces, which are the primary food-producing regions and hold one third&#xD;
      of Kenya's population. The most recent 1AF report impressively shows the increasing number of&#xD;
      farm families served, the Dollar gain in farmer impact and the close to 100% farmer repayment&#xD;
      rate of credits for seeds and fertilizers [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In partnership with the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), 1AF aims to introduce&#xD;
      nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific components into the services offered to&#xD;
      smallholder farmer households. The nutrition-specific interventions consist of providing MNPs&#xD;
      (Micronutrient Powders) to children 6-59 months of age. These nutritional supplements are&#xD;
      recommended by WHO in areas where micronutrient deficiencies and malnutrition are prevalent&#xD;
      [7,8]. In order to increase protein consumption, chicken birds will be provided to&#xD;
      households. Households will also be provided with seeds for red onion and indigenous greens.&#xD;
      Further, children will be provided with oral rehydration salts (ORS) and zinc supplements as&#xD;
      recommended by WHO and UNICEF for the treatment of acute diarrhoea [9]. Lastly, some WASH&#xD;
      related interventions will also be provided, such as training sessions, soap for hand washing&#xD;
      and chlorine for drinking water treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the incorporation of nutrition services in 1AF's agricultural programme, pilot&#xD;
      projects in western Kenya will be conducted between 2017 and 2020. The dietary diversity,&#xD;
      food frequency and subsequently, a minimum acceptably dietary quality for young children are&#xD;
      lower in the Western Province than for the national average. Further, the number of&#xD;
      households with washing places is lower and diarrhoea prevalence is slightly higher compared&#xD;
      to the national average [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to monitor and evaluate 1AF's programmes, a cluster-randomized, parallel-group,&#xD;
      prospective, follow-up effectiveness study in children 6-35 months of age at recruitment that&#xD;
      spans over 2 years will be conducted in the Western Province of Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clusters will be randomly assigned to either have the regular 1AF agricultural intervention&#xD;
      package (already in place in all clusters participating in the study and therefore called&#xD;
      control) or the integrated intervention package that on top of the agricultural package&#xD;
      consists of nutrition-specific (such as providing additional micronutrients) and&#xD;
      nutrition-sensitive (such as providing soap for hand washing) interventions. The impact on&#xD;
      malnutrition and programmatic 'success' will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the primary purpose is to longitudinally compare the changes of growth between the&#xD;
      intervention and control group, the programmatic aspects such as adherence to and coverage of&#xD;
      the intervention package and possible links to changes in dietary patterns and ultimately&#xD;
      linear growth will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, the research hypothesis is as follows: Linear growth in children between 6-59 months&#xD;
      of age will improve after the provision of agricultural services, nutritionally enhanced and&#xD;
      WASH products and diversified crops as well as nutrition and WASH training over the period of&#xD;
      2 years when compared to the control group provided only with agricultural services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general study design is a cluster-randomized, parallel-group, prospective, follow-up&#xD;
      effectiveness study over a period of 2 years comparing 2 groups of children 6-35 months of&#xD;
      age at recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention group: All selected households with children 6-35 months of age at&#xD;
           recruitment will receive MNP (1 sachet every three days per child) and ORS along with&#xD;
           zinc (20 mg/day) for treatment of acute diarrhoea. The households will also be provided&#xD;
           with soap, chlorine solution, poultry (8 chickens at start of intervention), and seeds&#xD;
           for red onion and indigenous greens (March 2018 and March 2019). The products will be&#xD;
           accompanied by monthly nutrition and WASH trainings. The products and trainings will be&#xD;
           provided free of charge. Additionally, all households will receive the agricultural&#xD;
           package as in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group: All households will be provided with agricultural training (every 2 weeks&#xD;
           on average) for free. In addition, households can also enrol for the following products&#xD;
           on credit: compost booster, cook stoves, seeds (onions, maize, indigenous greens,&#xD;
           beans), maize storage bags, drying tarps, trees, solar lights, fertilizer, actellic dust&#xD;
           (insecticide), re-usable sanitary pads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate recruiting 2,000 (1,000 in each group) children 6-35 months of age into the&#xD;
      study. Children will be recruited from 100 clusters (randomly assigned to intervention or&#xD;
      control) that will be drawn from Lugari district in Kakamega County located in the Western&#xD;
      Province of Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire based and anthropometric data will be collected in 3 rounds at a central place&#xD;
      in walking distance from participant's homes one year apart from each other (Table 4). The&#xD;
      following information will be collected in round 1 (baseline assessment prior to the actual&#xD;
      start of intervention distribution):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Household demographics/characteristics and caregiver's education&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary diversity, breastfeeding and infant and young children feeding (IYCF) practices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WASH practices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Child morbidity In rounds 2 and 3, information on dietary diversity, breastfeeding and&#xD;
           IYCF practices, WASH practices and child morbidity will be collected again.&#xD;
           Additionally, changes in adherence and coverage of the intervention package as well as&#xD;
           unintended outcomes (e.g. reduction of exclusive breastfeeding due to premature&#xD;
           introduction of complementary foods) will be assessed.&#xD;
