  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family dynamics and caregiver responses to a child with traumatic brain injury are implicated&#xD;
      both as precipitating events as well as factors influencing outcomes of abusive head trauma&#xD;
      (AHT). However, no family behavioral health intervention exists to meet the unique needs of&#xD;
      families with infants and very young children with AHT. The study was initially designed as a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the efficacy of an evidence-based behavioral&#xD;
      intervention to improve outcomes for families and children with AHT. However, rates of&#xD;
      recruitment were so low that the investigators and funder amended the study to be&#xD;
      intervention only (with IRB approval). At that time, there were five participants and only&#xD;
      one had been assigned to the intervention arm. Only one additional family was recruited, and&#xD;
      that family did not complete study measures prior to the time at which the intervention would&#xD;
      start and did not receive the intervention. The investigators did examine outcomes in&#xD;
      multiple dimensions, including clinical, cognitive, family, caregiver, child behavior, and&#xD;
      service usage over time but connot compare to patients not receiving the intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators were not able to examine characteristics of patients and families best suited&#xD;
      for this behavioral health intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      27 children (ages 3 months to 2 years) and their caregiver referred to the Non-Accidental&#xD;
      Brain Injury Care Clinic at the Children's Hospital Colorado (CHCO) were recruited for&#xD;
      participation in the study, 7 families consented. One family received the Attachment and&#xD;
      Biobehavioral (ABC) intervention. One family discontinued participation. The data collection&#xD;
      schedule was 1 month post-injury, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. Outcomes in&#xD;
      multiple dimensions, were assessed including clinical recovery, cognitive, language, and&#xD;
      motor functioning, family functioning, caregiver mental health including anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      competency, and stress. The investigators also examined service use over time. Analyses will&#xD;
      assess trajectories of recovery for both groups using data for all time points.&#xD;

    <description>Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) is an in-home, 10-session, manualized parent-training program for children ages 6 months through 2 years who have experienced early adversity. ABC utilizes parent-child interactions to enhance positive interactions with the child through live coaching with particular focus on nurturing behaviors, following the child's lead, non-frightening behaviors. These behaviors include appropriate soothing and comforting when a child is distressed, responding to or imitating a child in a contingent way, and displaying warmth.</description>
