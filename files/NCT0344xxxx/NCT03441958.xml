  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a morbid disease associated with a poor outcome and while current&#xD;
      therapies with new drugs have improved survival, MM still remains incurable in most patients.&#xD;
      The only potential curative treatment remains allogeneic Hematopoietic stem cell transplant&#xD;
      (HSCT), as shown by our cohort of 92 newly diagnosed patients who received a sibling tandem&#xD;
      auto-allo (HSCT) with an estimated 10-year progression free survival (PFS) of 43%. However,&#xD;
      the high incidences of toxicities including chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) (up to&#xD;
      79%) and disease progression (up to 49%) impair improvement in cure rate. Using umbilical&#xD;
      cord blood (CB) as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) could be superior&#xD;
      biologically because of their increased proliferative capacity, greater number of progeny&#xD;
      with longer telomeres and better anti-tumor efficacy in presence of positive residual&#xD;
      disease. Moreover, using CB has been shown to decrease incidence of chronic GVHD. However,&#xD;
      CBs have the disadvantage of having a limited HSC dose leading to prolonged cytopenia and&#xD;
      higher risk of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a first in-human trial using CB expanded with the ECT-001 (UM171) molecule&#xD;
      (clinicaltrial.gov # NCT02668315), the median net expansion of HSC was 36 fold, which allows&#xD;
      for the selection of better HLA matched CB regardless of their lower HSC dose. Moreover, the&#xD;
      ECT-001 expanded CBs have a different cell composition than regular CBs, with more than 25%&#xD;
      of dendritic cell precursors. This, combined to better HLA matched CBs, may reduce chronic&#xD;
      GVHD incidence and improve immune reconstitution. To date, 22 patients received an ECT-001&#xD;
      expanded CB and the procedure proved to be safe and feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this new trial, the goal is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ECT-001 expanded CB&#xD;
      transplant in high risk MM patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, prospective, phase I/II open-label study in a maximum of 20&#xD;
      patients evaluating a novel treatment strategy in NDMM patients with high-risk disease who do&#xD;
      not have a 6/6 compatible sibling donor. Participating patients will be from Hôpital&#xD;
      Maisonneuve-Rosemont (HMR) or referred to HMR for this protocol. Newly diagnosed multiple&#xD;
      myeloma patients will be evaluated for eligibility before or during the autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (ASCT) period. After a Bortezomib-based induction treatment (VTD, CyBorD, RVD or&#xD;
      PAD [in patients with plasma cell leukemia]) for a minimum of 4 cycles, followed by Melphalan&#xD;
      ≥ 140 mg/m2 and ASCT, eligible patients who accept to participate will undergo screening&#xD;
      evaluation to receive a Reduced Intensity (RIC) allogeneic HSCT with ECT-001 expanded CB. It&#xD;
      is estimated that 18 months will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility has been confirmed, study treatment will begin. After an ASCT, eligible&#xD;
      patients will receive a conditioning regimen before receiving a RIC allogeneic HSCT with an&#xD;
      ECT-001 expanded CB on day 0. Patients will be followed at least every week for the first 3&#xD;
      months, then every month, in the absence of GVHD, for disease evaluation and adverse events.&#xD;
      Occurrence and severity of acute GVHD will be evaluated using the modified Glucksberg176 and&#xD;
      IBMTR177 criteria, while chronic GVHD will be evaluated using the NIH178 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be terminated when all patients have been followed for 5 years after&#xD;
      allogeneic HSCT.&#xD;
