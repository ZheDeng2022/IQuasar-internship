  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the quantitative effects of sodium-free chloride&#xD;
      supplementation on electrolyte balance, volume status, and sodium avidity in stable heart&#xD;
      failure patients in a highly controlled environment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the biology&#xD;
      and therapeutic potential of sodium-free chloride supplementation. While sodium homeostasis&#xD;
      has been the focus of substantial investigation, very little research has been devoted to&#xD;
      understanding chloride homeostasis. Thus, this proposal is designed to obtain the full&#xD;
      spectrum of information pertaining to chloride, such as novel areas with great interest by&#xD;
      the scientific community (i.e. modulation of the WNK-kinase system and the use of exosomes),&#xD;
      to more practical/basic questions (i.e. what happens to sodium chloride balance when a&#xD;
      patient is challenged with chloride).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a highly controlled inpatient &quot;GCRC&quot; arm to be compared to a real&#xD;
      world efficacy study that has been proposed as a separate study. With extensive biobanking&#xD;
      and analysis of samples in the inpatient setting, we will be able to deliver a great wealth&#xD;
      of information on the biology and therapeutic potential of manipulating chloride homeostasis&#xD;
      in heart failure.&#xD;
