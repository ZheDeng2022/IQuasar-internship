  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a complication affecting 10-15% of monochorionic,&#xD;
      diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies. Unevenly distributed blood flow across a shared placental&#xD;
      circulation results in a volume-restricted donor twin and a volume-overloaded recipient twin,&#xD;
      and TTTS has high perinatal morbidity and mortality without treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differential donor and recipient findings in TTTS can be observed upon ultrasound evaluation.&#xD;
      TTTS is classified according to the Quintero staging system, which evaluates amniotic fluid&#xD;
      volumes, fetal bladders, Doppler study of the umbilical artery and ductus venosus, and for&#xD;
      the presence of hydrops or death. However, due to seemingly complex and variable disease&#xD;
      pathophysiology, the Quintero system cannot predict outcomes on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have associated fetal renal artery Doppler ultrasound measurements with&#xD;
      amniotic fluid volume in singleton pregnancies. In fetuses with placental insufficiency,&#xD;
      adaptive circulatory changes maintain adequate oxygen delivery to vital organs such as the&#xD;
      heart, brain, and adrenals, with a consequent deprivation to splanchnic organs. In the fetal&#xD;
      kidney, as vascular resistance increases during hypoxia, renal perfusion decreases&#xD;
      proportionately. These changes are reflected in renal artery Doppler findings. As these same&#xD;
      adaptations are believed to occur in donor twins, renal artery Doppler studies may also be of&#xD;
      value in the TTTS evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to perform renal artery Doppler assessments in MCDA twins complicated by&#xD;
      TTTS, and compare them to measurements in gestational-age equivalent MCDA twins without TTTS.&#xD;
      If findings differ significantly, it would support further investigation into the use of&#xD;
      renal artery Doppler studies for the evaluation of complicated MCDA twins.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TTTS, which complicates 10-15% of MCDA twin pregnancies, is characterized by a net imbalance&#xD;
      of volume between twins, mediated through abnormal placental blood vessel anastomoses that&#xD;
      connect the two placental circulations. Clinically, the &quot;donor&quot; twin develops features of&#xD;
      anemia and hypovolemia, while the &quot;recipient&quot; twin shows signs of hypervolemia and&#xD;
      hypertensive fluid overload. If untreated, the syndrome has a perinatal mortality rate as&#xD;
      high as 80-100%. Although modern intrauterine therapies have improved the rates of fetal&#xD;
      death, significant risks of morbidity and mortality remain even after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twin-twin transfusion syndrome is most commonly classified according to a staging system&#xD;
      developed by Quintero et al in 1999, which is based on discrete, categorical ultrasound&#xD;
      findings (amniotic fluid volume, presence/absence of a fetal bladder, umbilical artery&#xD;
      Doppler studies, fetal hydrops, and death). The system includes 5 stages ranging from mild&#xD;
      disease with isolated discordant amniotic fluid volumes, to severe disease with demise of one&#xD;
      or both twins. Although this system has some prognostic value, it also has significant&#xD;
      limitations due to the highly complex physiologic conditions that are involved in the&#xD;
      disease. For example, some criteria in the staging system are not consistently representative&#xD;
      of fetal physiology. Additionally, the stages do not correlate well with overall perinatal&#xD;
      survival or with outcomes following intrauterine therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent work has demonstrated that the complex pathophysiology of twin-twin transfusion&#xD;
      syndrome involves a discordant activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS). RAS is&#xD;
      normally important in fluid and salt regulation in both the adult and the fetus, and TTTS in&#xD;
      marked hypovolemia and hypervolemia in monozygous fetuses within the same maternal&#xD;
      environment. The renal RAS in the donor is up-regulated, presumably as a consequence of&#xD;
      hypovolemia. The recipient is also exposed to high levels or RAS components, either due to&#xD;
      the transfusion of these components from the donor via anastomoses, or via discordant&#xD;
      placental RAS activation, resulting in a hypertensive, hypervolemic state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have identified a correlation between Doppler assessment of the fetal renal&#xD;
      artery and the development of oligohydramnios, a hypovolemic state, in singleton pregnancies.&#xD;
      However, the use of renal artery Doppler studies has not yet been fully evaluated in twin&#xD;
      gestations. In particular, it has not been evaluated in MCDA twin gestations complicated by&#xD;
      TTTS, the pathophysiology of which involves significant alterations in fetal volume and fluid&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is intended to serve as a single-center study to determine if there is indeed a&#xD;
      difference in renal artery Doppler parameters in sets of MCDA twins with TTTS compared to&#xD;
      sets of MCDA twins without TTTS. The identification of a significant difference would&#xD;
      potentially provide support for further investigation into this measurement as a screening&#xD;
      tool or prognostic indicator when applied to MCDA twin pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals of this study include: comparing donor to recipient renal artery Doppler&#xD;
      findings among pregnancies with TTTS, evaluating serial renal artery Doppler findings over&#xD;
      time per pregnancy, and evaluating pre- and post-therapy renal artery Doppler findings in&#xD;
      those pregnancies undergoing therapy for TTTS.&#xD;
