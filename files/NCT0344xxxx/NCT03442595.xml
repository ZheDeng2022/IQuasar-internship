  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MedStar Diabetes Pathway (MDP) is transitioning into a clinical program offered at&#xD;
      various MedStar sites. The MDP clinical team is reviewing the data collected during the pilot&#xD;
      to improve the program and adapt it to various clinical settings in order to better serve the&#xD;
      target patient population. It is imperative to continue reviewing patient clinical outcomes&#xD;
      as the program expands in order to insure continuous quality improvement of the program. This&#xD;
      will be achieved through chart reviews of patients receiving diabetes care via the MDP and&#xD;
      comparison with patients received diabetes standard of care through their primary care&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MedStar Diabetes Pathway (MDP) early pilot program has generated evidence that an&#xD;
      innovative technology-enabled &quot;Boot Camp&quot; approach to the delivery of diabetes survival&#xD;
      skills education and medication management has a significant impact on glycemic control and&#xD;
      healthcare utilization measures. The MDP is a 12 week Diabetes &quot;Boot Camp&quot; technology-enabled&#xD;
      intervention which will offer learner-centered survival skills self-management education&#xD;
      (DSSE) and algorithm-driven diabetes medications (DM) titration by Endocrinologist-supervised&#xD;
      Certified Diabetes Educators (CDE), NPs and PharmDs. The program has been offered at 5&#xD;
      MedStar Medical Group (MMG) Primary Care Practices from November 2014 to February 2016 to&#xD;
      high risk adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes who have a hemoglobin A1C (A1C) level -a&#xD;
      marker of average blood glucose (BG) levels in the 2-3 months prior to the time the test is&#xD;
      done- which is at or above 9% - considered to be poor control, and 1 or more additional risk&#xD;
      factors for poor health outcomes. The program has been well received by MedStar Primary Care&#xD;
      Providers and their diabetes patients. Patients that participated in the MDP achieved&#xD;
      significantly higher A1C reduction and decreased risk risk for acute care utilization then&#xD;
      matched controls that received standard of care. The pilot evidence demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant impact on glycemic control and healthcare utilization measures as the result of a&#xD;
      concise, focused DM education and medication management intervention. Building on the success&#xD;
      of the MDP Phase 1.0 pilot, the next steps in expanding the program will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transition of the Pathway from early feasibility pilot to the next phase as an expanded&#xD;
           pilot program integrated within the MedStar Health System care delivery network and&#xD;
           built upon a sustainable infrastructure across early adopter MMG practice sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expand recruitment to include high risk patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
           including those with a new diagnosis and A1C &gt;9%, who have MedStar Emergency Department&#xD;
           and/or Inpatient encounters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spread to additional targeted MedStar Primary Care Practices and/or to MedStar Managed&#xD;
           Care Plan participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chart reviews and data collection during the expansion phase will be essential to guide the&#xD;
      process and allow rapid cycle adjustments to maximize the impact of the program and&#xD;
      utilization of resources for the benefit of our patients.&#xD;
