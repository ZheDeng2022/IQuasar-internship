  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, open label, non-randomized, interventional study enrolling 53&#xD;
      patients.The objectives and purposes of the clinical study described herein are to determine&#xD;
      if concomitant Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and ECT treatments are safe and able to improve local&#xD;
      and systemic response rates.ECT will be performed with the CLINIPORATOR and a single IV dose&#xD;
      of Bleomycin&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ECT induces immunogenic cell death of cancer cells with a more efficient antigen presentation&#xD;
      of tumor-derived antigens by APCs to T-cells, particularly CD8+ antigen-specific T cells.&#xD;
      Anti-PD-1 mAb reverts T-cell exhaustion induced by PD-1/PD-L1 and PD-L2 engagement on CD8+ T&#xD;
      cells. Moreover, it may also be beneficial in the priming phase of the antitumor immune&#xD;
      responses, inducing long-lived tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell effectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is to establish if concomitant treatment of Pembrolizumab and ECT is able&#xD;
      to lead to a 20% increase of the ORR using as a reference the proportion of success available&#xD;
      in the literature for Pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a proteomic analysis of sera of treated patients, collected&#xD;
      before and after treatments, with particular emphasis on cytokines and chemokines, to&#xD;
      evaluate possible markers associated with a better clinical outcome.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a histologically confirmed advanced melanoma stages III b/c or IV, with at least&#xD;
             the following superficial lesions: 5 lesions if diameter &lt; 1 cm or 3 lesions if&#xD;
             diameter &gt; 1 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Could have received previous therapy included CT, antiCTLA4 or antiBRAF/antiMEK&#xD;
             treatment or be treatment naïve.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be &gt;= 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a&#xD;
             tumor lesion. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days)&#xD;
             prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples&#xD;
             cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an&#xD;
             archived specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have a performance status ≤ 2 on the ECOG Performance Scale. (Ambulatory and capable&#xD;
             of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than&#xD;
             50% of waking hours.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have a baseline total body CT scan (brain MRI if brain metastasis are suspected)&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients with brain metastasis are allowed to participate if previously treated&#xD;
                  and brain lesion stability or inactivity is demonstrated. Patients with a history&#xD;
                  of brain metastasis are required to have a pre-baseline brain MRI at least 60&#xD;
                  days (2 months) before the Screening/Baseline visit (Visit 1) for comparison to&#xD;
                  the Screening (Visit 1) MRI. Patients for whom MRI is contraindicated will&#xD;
                  undergo head CT. Stable/inactive disease is determined by comparing the pre-&#xD;
                  baseline and screening/baseline MRI/CT results.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients presenting with brain metastasis at Screening/Baseline who had no known&#xD;
                  previous brain involvement and who had no brain MRI/CT tests at least 60 days (2&#xD;
                  months) before Screening/Baseline are considered screening failures and will be&#xD;
                  excluded from study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have cutaneous or subcutaneous metastases from melanoma that are accessible for the&#xD;
             application of electric pulses using the single use, sterile CLINIPORATOR™ electrodes&#xD;
             (5 lesions if diameter &lt;1 cm or 3 lesions if diameter &gt;1 cm). For patients presenting&#xD;
             with more than 7 lesions, the lesions with the largest diameters that fall within the&#xD;
             &lt;10 to 30 mm size requirements will be considered &quot;target&quot; lesions for RECIST criteria&#xD;
             and study purposes. The others will be recorded and monitored but will not considered&#xD;
             as Target.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Have lesions clearly requiring palliative treatment [e.g., symptomatic (bleeding,&#xD;
             draining, painful), disfiguring or causing distress to the patient].&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. A treatment-free period of three (3) weeks before enrolling in the study. NOTE:&#xD;
             Patients receiving concomitant treatments for unrelated existing pathologies are&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If&#xD;
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Female subjects of childbearing potential (Section 5.7.2) must be willing to use an&#xD;
             adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.7.2 - Contraception, for the&#xD;
             course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Note:&#xD;
             Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception&#xD;
             for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Male subjects of childbearing potential (Section 5.7.1) must agree to use an adequate&#xD;
             method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.7.1- Contraception, starting with the&#xD;
             first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred&#xD;
             contraception for the subject.&#xD;

                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has a history of a malignancy (other than the disease under treatment in the&#xD;
             study) within 5 years prior to first study drug administration. This should exclude&#xD;

             carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, or other in situ cancers. Shorter intervals&#xD;
             can be considered after discussion with Merck.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided&#xD;

             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned&#xD;
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using&#xD;
             steroids for at least 14 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
