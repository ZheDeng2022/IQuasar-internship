  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings&#xD;
      applied to the sacrum, heels and greater trochanter in addition to standard prevention reduce&#xD;
      pressure ulcer incidence category II, III, IV, Unstageable and Deep Tissue Injury (DTI)&#xD;
      compared to standard pressure ulcer prevention alone, in at risk hospitalised patients. In&#xD;
      particular, this trial extends previous trial results obtained in ICU setting. Therefore,&#xD;
      only a maximum of 25% of patients will be recruited from ICU settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is: 'The use of silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings as adjuvant&#xD;
      prophylactic therapy for pressure ulcer prevention is more effective in reducing pressure&#xD;
      ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue Injury (DTI) incidence rate on&#xD;
      sacrum, heels and greater trochanter, compared to standard pressure ulcer prevention alone.'&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is: 'The use of silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings as adjuvant&#xD;
      prophylactic therapy for pressure ulcer prevention is not more effective in reducing pressure&#xD;
      ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue Injury (DTI) incidence rate on&#xD;
      sacrum, heels and greater trochanter, compared to standard pressure ulcer prevention alone.&#xD;

      A multicentre randomised controlled open label parallel group medical device trial in&#xD;
      approximately 8 hospitals in Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated to three study arms based on a 1:1:1 allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arm 1 (on top of standard of care):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients at risk for pressure ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue&#xD;
           Injury (DTI) development will receive standard pressure ulcer prevention strategies (as&#xD;
           described in the hospital protocol) which include ongoing risk assessment, regular&#xD;
           repositioning and skin care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin sites (restricted to sacrum, heel right/left and greater trochanter right/left)&#xD;
           will be treated with silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings by Smith &amp; Nephew&#xD;
           (Allevyn® brand).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arm 2 (on top of standard of care):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients at risk for pressure ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue&#xD;
           Injury (DTI) development will receive standard pressure ulcer prevention strategies (as&#xD;
           described in the hospital protocol) which include ongoing risk assessment, regular&#xD;
           repositioning and skin care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin sites (restricted to sacrum, heel right/left and greater trochanter right/left)&#xD;
           will be treated with silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings by Mölnlycke Health&#xD;
           care (Mepilex® brand).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arm 3 (standard of care):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients at risk for pressure ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue&#xD;
           Injury (DTI) development will receive standard pressure ulcer prevention strategies (as&#xD;
           described in the hospital protocol) which include ongoing risk assessment, regular&#xD;
           repositioning and skin care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings will be applied on the skin sites of&#xD;
           interest for this trial (sacrum, heel right/left, greater trochanter right/left).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin sites (restricted to sacrum, heel right/left, greater trochanter right/left) of patients&#xD;
      at risk for pressure ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue Injury (DTI)&#xD;
      development will be assessed daily for a maximum period of 14 days.&#xD;

Note: The International NPUAP/EPUAP Pressure Ulcer Classification System (National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (2014)) distinguishes four categories of pressure ulcers: non-blanchable erythema of the intact skin (category I), partial thickness loss of dermis (category II), full thickness tissue loss (category III) and full thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle (category IV). Also unstageable pressure ulcers and deep tissue injuries can be recognised. https://npiap.com/</description>

          <title>Total Braden score (at Baseline)</title>
          <description>The Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sore Risk (Bergstrom, Braden, Laguzza &amp; Holman, 1987) is composed of six sub-scales that reflect sensory perception, skin moisture, activity, mobility, friction and shear, and nutritional status. Each sub-scale is scored from 1-3 or 4, for total scores that range from 6-23. A lower Braden Scale Score indicates a lower level of functioning and, therefore, a higher level of risk for pressure ulcer development. In this study a cut-off of &lt;= 17 was used for being at risk of pressure ulcer development.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Performance and detection bias may have occurred because patients, caregivers and study personnel could not be blinded to the study procedures/devices. All study nurses were trained, and for most hospitals wound care teams were involved when a PU occurred, further strengthening the correct identification of skin injuries.</limitations_and_caveats>
