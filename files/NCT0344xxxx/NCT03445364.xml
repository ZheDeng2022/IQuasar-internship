  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous coronary intervention for myocardial infarction with ST elevation could be&#xD;
      complicated with thrombus embolisation to the more distal segments of the culprit artery.&#xD;
      Hypothesis - lower injection pressure could reduce the incidence of this complication. In&#xD;
      this study the investigators compare two different protocols for dye injection - first one&#xD;
      with higher and the second one with lower injection pressure.The impact of different pressure&#xD;
      will be evaluated using the estimation of completeness of resolution of ST elevation as well&#xD;
      as Myocardial Blush Grade on the end of the procedure. Patents will be followed for&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality and MACE.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Distal embolization of plaque and thrombotic debris in the infarct-related artery may lead to&#xD;
      microvascular obstruction resulting in impaired myocardial reperfusion. The aim of the study&#xD;
      was to assess the impact of contrast injection pressure in coronary arteries, during primary&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), on myocardial reperfusion in patients with acute&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, prospective, open label, pilot study. In the period of 6 months, consecutive&#xD;
      patients with acute STEMI were included in the study. The acute STEMI was confirmed according&#xD;
      to the clinical, ECG and cardioselective enzymes criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with the following features were eligible for inclusion: who underwent primary PCI&#xD;
      within 12 hours from the onset of symptoms, with typical chest pain lasting &gt;30 minutes, with&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation of ≥1 mm in ≥2 contiguous leads in ECG and with ECGs recorded at&#xD;
      admission, 60 minutes and 24h after primary PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were: patients who had cardiogenic shock and/or underwent cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation before or during primary PCI, with symptoms lasting more than 12 hours, with&#xD;
      left bundle branch block in ECG at admission, with diameter stenosis &lt; 50% of the culprit&#xD;
      lesion or normal coronary blood flow, with severe left main coronary artery or multivessel&#xD;
      disease who required emergency cardiac-surgery revascularization, with permanent cardiac&#xD;
      pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, with anemia (haemoglobin &lt;100 g/L) at&#xD;
      admission, who underwent cardiothoracic surgery or had a history of moderate or high degree&#xD;
      valvular pathology, who had life-expectancy of less than 1 year and who did not sign informed&#xD;
      consent. Patients were admitted through the Emergency Department, where they were evaluated&#xD;
      for onset and duration of pain, co-morbidities and risk factors. Vital signs and complete&#xD;
      physical status were recorded. All patients underwent 12-lead ECG and patients with acute&#xD;
      STEMI were taken immediately to the catheterization laboratory for primary PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomized into two groups by means of&#xD;
      sealed envelopes.&#xD;
