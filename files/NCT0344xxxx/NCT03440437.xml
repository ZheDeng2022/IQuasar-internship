  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in adult participants diagnosed with advanced tumors to&#xD;
      characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and activity of FS118. This is&#xD;
      a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label, multiple-dose, first-in-human study, designed to&#xD;
      systematically assess safety and tolerability, to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for FS118 in participants with advanced tumors and to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of FS118 in participants with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and&#xD;
      neck (SCCHN). Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and response will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
