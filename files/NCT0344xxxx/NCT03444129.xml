  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Broad, diverse, and innovative efforts are needed to address the growing dual public health&#xD;
      challenges of obesity and diabetes, especially for those at increased risk like minority&#xD;
      older adults. The emerging field of health games offers an innovative opportunity to reach&#xD;
      populations to provide healthy eating and physical activity messages. Little research has&#xD;
      focused on the use of health games specifically tailored for older adults. This study builds&#xD;
      upon a health game designed to provide knowledge, facilitate movement, enhance motivation,&#xD;
      and encourage healthy eating (HE) and physical activity (PA) behaviors in youth. This study&#xD;
      will adapt, implement, and evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and&#xD;
      preliminary outcomes of the game among overweight/obese African American older adults.&#xD;
