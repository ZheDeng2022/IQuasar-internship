  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of older cancer patients is challenging, due to a lack of good quality evidence to&#xD;
      guide treatment decisions, as well as the wide variability in the level of fitness for&#xD;
      treatment of elderly patients. Oncologists are faced with the challenge of determining the&#xD;
      most suitable treatment for an individual taking into account their comorbidities, competing&#xD;
      causes of death, quality of life and functional reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the western&#xD;
      world and ranks second among the most frequent malignancies in Europe in both men and women.&#xD;
      The incidence and mortality of CRC strongly increases with age. Approximately 60% of new&#xD;
      cases of CRC and 70% of CRC-related deaths occur in patients aged 65 years and older, with&#xD;
      about 40% of patients aged 75 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oncologists' therapeutic decision-making for elderly patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (mCRC) has been largely debated in the last few years, mainly because of the lack of&#xD;
      trial-based recommendations, due to the underrepresentation of patients more than 65 years&#xD;
      old in clinical trials. As a consequence, therapeutic choices in this setting are frequently&#xD;
      driven by data from retrospective, pooled and meta-analyses. These results do not necessarily&#xD;
      reflect the general population affected with mCRC and are often limited by potential&#xD;
      confounding factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well recognized that chronological age is not an effective criterion on which to base&#xD;
      therapeutic decisions. Rather, treatment tolerability in an older cancer patient is primarily&#xD;
      related to physiological or biological age, that is the level of fitness, which takes into&#xD;
      account factors such as functional status and comorbidities. Physiological age is better&#xD;
      assessed with a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), a multidisciplinary evaluation&#xD;
      covering domains such as cognitive and mood status, functionality, comorbidities, and&#xD;
      nutrition. These deficits are prevalent in older patients but which may be missed with&#xD;
      routine evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is now strong evidence that use of a CGA assessment in a general geriatric patient&#xD;
      population can improve health outcomes. While some form of geriatric assessment have been&#xD;
      recommended by specialist advisory panels for all elderly patients in whom chemotherapy is&#xD;
      considered, evidence of CGA leading to improved outcomes in a geriatric population with&#xD;
      cancer is very limited. CGA for older patients with cancer does appear to provide information&#xD;
      relating to prognosis, likelihood of toxicity from chemotherapy, and has been shown to&#xD;
      influence treatment decisions. However, this approach is time-consuming, leading cancer&#xD;
      specialists to seek an easier screening tool that can separate fit older patients with&#xD;
      cancer, who are able to receive standard cancer treatment, from vulnerable patients that&#xD;
      should subsequently receive a full assessment to guide tailoring of their treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The G8 is a simple 8-items screening tool, developed specifically for older patients with&#xD;
      cancer. This tool, addressed by the clinician, covers multiple domains, focusing on&#xD;
      nutritional status, mobility, neuropsychological problems, medication use, self-rated health&#xD;
      status and age. The G8 demonstrated a good sensitivity in identifying patients with&#xD;
      impairments across multiple domains when a cut-off of 14 points is adopted. Patients with a&#xD;
      score &lt; 14 would be candidate to a CGA. Nevertheless, this cut-off showed poor specificity&#xD;
      and negative predictive value. Furthermore, some evidences suggested that the G8 might be&#xD;
      able to predict survival, while its predictive value for treatment-related toxicities has not&#xD;
      been extensively explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While literature data support a promising role for G8 as a simple cost-effective screening&#xD;
      tool in elderly patients, to date its use in clinical practice is not widespread, and only&#xD;
      selected centers with a focus in geriatric oncology routinely perform this assessment to&#xD;
      enhance the baseline evaluation of patients before treatment choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of ''real life population'' data makes it difficult to evaluate the role of G8 in&#xD;
      the setting of common practice in an unselected population and to prove its efficacy and&#xD;
      reliability outside selected cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, recent data suggest how a physical performance test, such as Timed Up and Go, could&#xD;
      be a useful indicators of prognosis, functional decline and treatment-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to promote a comprehensive evaluation of elderly patients before&#xD;
      treatment decisions and to prospectively evaluate the association of G8 assessment with&#xD;
      clinical outcome and treatment-related severe toxicity in the real life population of elderly&#xD;
      patients with colorectal cancer in Veneto. Additionally, preliminary data on feasibility and&#xD;
      reliability of Timed Up and Go measurement as prognostic determinant and dynamic marker, will&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;
