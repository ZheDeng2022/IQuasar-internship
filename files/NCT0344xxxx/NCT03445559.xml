    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether a multi-modal, physician-focused&#xD;
      behavioral intervention can improve facility-level guideline-concordant utilization of&#xD;
      prostate cancer staging imaging. Other aims of this study include to use mixed methods to&#xD;
      explore physician influence on guideline-concordant imaging and to determine the cost and&#xD;
      cost impact of a physician-focused behavioral intervention to improve guideline-concordant&#xD;
      prostate cancer imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost half of Veterans with localized prostate cancer (the most common non-cutaneous&#xD;
      malignancy among US men) receive inappropriate, wasteful imaging. The VHA Blueprint for&#xD;
      Excellence prioritizes increasing operational effectiveness. Prior studies seeking to limit&#xD;
      inappropriate imaging did not assess barriers and achieved mixed results. The investigators'&#xD;
      team has explored the causes of guideline-discordant prostate cancer imaging and found that&#xD;
      1) patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer have little concern for radiographic staging&#xD;
      but rather focus on treatment, 2) physician trust imaging guidelines but are apt to follow&#xD;
      their own intuition, fear medico-legal consequences, and succumb to influence from colleagues&#xD;
      who image frequently. In spite of such discrepant views, most VHA physicians suggested or&#xD;
      supported a large-scale effort to improve imaging use across VHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a multi-site, stepped wedge, cluster-randomized trial to determine&#xD;
      the effect of a physician-focused behavioral intervention on VHA prostate cancer imaging use.&#xD;
      The multi-level intervention, developed according to the Theoretical Determinants Framework,&#xD;
      combines traditional physician behavior change methods with novel methods of communication&#xD;
      and data collection. The intervention consists of three components: 1) a system of audit and&#xD;
      feedback to clinicians informing individual clinicians and their sites about how their&#xD;
      behavior compares to their peers' and to published guidelines 2) a program of academic&#xD;
      detailing with the goal to educate providers about prostate cancer imaging, and 3) a CPRS&#xD;
      Clinical Order Check for potentially inappropriate imaging. The intervention will be&#xD;
      introduced to 10 participating geographically-distributed study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess imaging rates 6 months prior to the intervention and 3 months&#xD;
      following the intervention. The study's specific aims seek to understand the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on 1) facility-level prostate cancer imaging rates, 2) physician experience with&#xD;
      and perceptions of the intervention and its implementation, and 3) the costs of both&#xD;
      implementing the intervention and affecting change in imaging use. These aims will support a&#xD;
      subsequent intervention to improve guideline-concordant imaging across VHA. Experience gained&#xD;
      through this project will be leveraged to improve guideline-concordant care and increase&#xD;
      operational effectiveness in other domains.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed behavioral intervention will be implemented according to a stepped wedge cluster-randomized design. This is a single direction cross-over randomized trial where every site serves, at some point, as both a control and an intervention site. The first time point will be a baseline measurement, where none of the study sites have yet received the intervention. At subsequent time points, study sites initiate the intervention. The time at which each site initiates implementation of the intervention is randomized.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A Clinical Order Check is an evidence-based, systems-level method to affect significant behavior change. It addresses the intervention functions of education, enablement and incentivization which are effective methods to change behaviors driven by beliefs about capabilities, knowledge, social influences, beliefs about consequences, and environmental context and resources. All VA facilities currently use locally adapted clinical reminders. This strategy is technologically simple, straightforward, and is considered to be a best practice within the VA IT community. The reminder will be self-explanatory and non-intrusive to workflow.</description>

    <description>Academic detailing is an individual and facility-level intervention consistently shown to improve provider behavior. This strategy addresses the intervention functions of persuasion, coercion, modeling, and education which are effective methods for affecting behaviors driven by beliefs about capabilities, knowledge, social influences, beliefs about consequences, and environmental context and resources. During the meeting, the detailer will follow a script explaining that the visit is part of an experimental program to provide physicians with up-to-date, unbiased information about imaging to stage prostate cancer.</description>
