  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trials studies the side effects of daratumumab and ibrutinib and how well they&#xD;
      work in treating patients with symptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as daratumumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Giving daratumumab and ibrutinib may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety of treatment with daratumumab and ibrutinib for previously&#xD;
      untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the complete response rate (CR) at the post cycle 12 response assessment&#xD;
      following treatment with daratumumab and ibrutinib for previously untreated chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the activity of daratumumab and ibrutinib as measured by overall response&#xD;
      rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival&#xD;
      (OS), and time-to-next treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure pharmacodynamic parameters in B cells including drug occupancy of BTK and B&#xD;
      cell receptor signaling during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the influence of this combination on T cell and natural killer (NK) cell&#xD;
      number and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess for development of mutations that may confer resistance to this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the ability of daratumumab to clear CLL in the peripheral blood and association&#xD;
      of CD38 expression on CLL cells with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of courses 1-2, days&#xD;
      1 and 15 of courses 3-6, and day 1 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for&#xD;
      up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning&#xD;
      course 2, patients also receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
