    <textblock>
      A monocentric cluster-crossover design has been used in this study to test the effectiveness&#xD;
      of a 3-in-1 perineal care washcloth versus standard of care (e.g., water and pH neutral soap)&#xD;
      to prevent and treat pressure ulcers in ICUs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study had a cluster-crossover design, where each of the two involved ICUs was the&#xD;
      cluster. The genaral aim was to test the effectiveness of a 3-in-1 perineal care washcloth&#xD;
      versus standard of care (e.g., water and pH neutral soap) to prevent and treat pressure&#xD;
      ulcers in ICUs. The study has been articulated in two phases, lasted three months each. In&#xD;
      the first phase, from the 1st of February to the 2nd of May, the 3-in-1 perineal care&#xD;
      washcloth procedure has been adopted by the ICU of San Donato Hospital (Milan, Italy), while&#xD;
      the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU) continued to adopt the standard procedure&#xD;
      (water and pH neutral soap). In the second phase, from the 2nd of May to 31st of July, the&#xD;
      two procedures have been switched between the two wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients (aged over 18 years old) requiring personal hygiene care (total or perineal)&#xD;
      in ICU and CVICU of San Donato Hospital have been enrolled. Patients who present allergic&#xD;
      reactions or sensitivity to the experimental procedure have been excluded. All the&#xD;
      longitudinal data related to the presence/grading of pressure ulcer (PU) at every hygiene&#xD;
      care (total or perineal) performed on the patients in ICU and CVICU have been collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is represented by PU during the hospitalization in ICUs,&#xD;
      whis is expected to be reduced from 10% in the experimental clusters. A sample size composed&#xD;
      by 240 patients (120 patients/group) has been calculated, following methodological approach&#xD;
      for difference between proportions. The sample size was calculated to be representative in&#xD;
      observing a 10% decrease in the onset of PU, with a 80% power and an alpha error equal to&#xD;
      0.05. This approach led to the detection of a clinical relevant difference to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness between the two different procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected for the study were recorded on data-collection sheets in hard copy format.&#xD;
      Data were also collected after every hygiene procedure on patient-related characteristics,&#xD;
      skin condition and general clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison between the two clusters (i.e. ICU and CVICU) will be performed using&#xD;
      Student's t-test for the continuous variables and the χ2 for the categorical ones. Treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness will be evaluated through the difference between proportions of IAD and PU in&#xD;
      Period 1 and Period 2. A decrease in the onset of IAD and PU is expected as the main&#xD;
      endpoint, considering a 95% confidence interval. The data will be compared using generalized&#xD;
      estimating equation (GEE). The variables that might have an influence on the&#xD;
      prevalence/incidence measures (i.e., patient's characteristics and ICUs management/staffing)&#xD;
      will be monitored. The Period will be considered a &quot;within&quot; factor and the procedure/cluster&#xD;
      a &quot;between&quot; factor. The α significance level will be preventively set at 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data have been stored to a master file on the San Donato Hospital server. This is&#xD;
      password-protected and only available to the Principal Investigator user. On completion of&#xD;
      the project, identifying data have been removed from all the record.&#xD;
