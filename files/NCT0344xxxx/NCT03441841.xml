  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial evaluated the pharmacokinetic interaction between fixed doses of lidocaine (2.5%),&#xD;
      prilocaine (2.5%) or the association of both (Nanorap®) in healthy volunteers. The drug&#xD;
      safety and tolerability was also evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was performed as a monocentric, open, randomized, double-blind, with 3 treatment&#xD;
      regimen (lidocaine, prilocaine, or Nanorap®) in 3 periods design. Volunteers were submitted&#xD;
      to clinical and laboratory examination before enrollment. Treatments were carried out on 3&#xD;
      different days with a washout period of 7 days between each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a fasting period (8 h), volunteers received topically 2g of the formulation in a&#xD;
      delimited area of 16 cm2 in the volar surface of the forearm. The product was applied to the&#xD;
      left arm and venous blood was collected from the right arm. The remaining product was removed&#xD;
      with a cotton swab 10 minutes after application. Blood samples (3.5 mL) were collected into&#xD;
      heparinized tubes before (0:00) and at 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5,&#xD;
      8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0, 10.5, 11.0, 12.0, 14.0, 16.0 and 24.0 h after the hydrogel&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were centrifuged at 2000 g (4 ⁰C) for 10 minutes and the obtained plasma&#xD;
      samples were stored at -20 °C until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following dosing, volunteers were monitored for 36 h in a clinical setting safety and&#xD;
      tolerability (signs, symptoms, adverse events, and laboratory parameters). The vital signs&#xD;
      (blood pressure and pulse rate) were evaluated. ECGs were obtained before (30 min) and at&#xD;
      drug Cmax (6 h) for each product application. QT interval corrected by heart rate (QTc) data&#xD;
      were obtained from a Bionet Cardiocare 2000 and BMS-Plus software program, using Bazett's&#xD;
      formula: QTc = QT/(sqrt RR Interval).&#xD;
