  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physically healthy adult smokers may be eligible for this study. Volunteers may participate&#xD;
      in this study if they are 18 - 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in two separate 7-hour PET/CT Scan Sessions (each with 2 hours of&#xD;
      actual PET/CT scanning): one following an overnight abstinence and one following two&#xD;
      overnights of abstinence. To achieve and confirm two overnights of abstinence, participants&#xD;
      will present to the inpatient CHPS the day prior to the scheduled scan and stay overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2-[18F]-FA PET/CT brain scans will consist of an injection followed by an 7-hour infusion&#xD;
      of 2-[18F]-FA. The scan session will begin at approximately 4 hours after the bolus&#xD;
      injection. The PET/CT scan will occur in two segments. Starting at approximately 4 hours post&#xD;
      bolus and infusion start, we will scan for approximately 90 minutes with a bolus injection of&#xD;
      IV nicotine that will occur approximately 15 minutes into the scanning procedure. There will&#xD;
      be a break in scanning of approximately 60 minutes, during which subjects will be allowed to&#xD;
      get off the scanner and use the restroom, if necessary. The second scan segment will start at&#xD;
      approximately 6.5 hours post bolus injection, t. This segment will last approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes. The pre and post nicotine images will be analyzed to evaluate for differences in&#xD;
      receptor uptake after the nicotine &quot;challenge&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a structural Brain MRI performed within 1 year prior to study enrollment&#xD;
      or subjects who have not had a Brain MRI that is deemed acceptable for use for this study&#xD;
      will undergo a research Brain MRI after consent.&#xD;
