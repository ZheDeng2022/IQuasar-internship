    <textblock>
      MSI (Microsatellite Instability) colorectal cancer (CRC) show improved survival, are less&#xD;
      prone to metastasis and show poor response to chemotherapy (compared to MSS tumors). The&#xD;
      underlying reasons for these characteristics are still not understood and no specific&#xD;
      therapeutic approach for MSI colon tumours (15% of CRC overall) has yet been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MSI process is oncogenic when it affects DNA repeat sequences that have a functional&#xD;
      role, e.g. Small Coding Repeats (SCR). MSI also frequently affects Long Non-Coding Repeats&#xD;
      (LNCR) in tumour DNA. In contrast to SCR, only a few LNCR are endowed with biological&#xD;
      activity. Consequently, this area has received very little attention. Our group recently&#xD;
      identified HSP110 mutant chaperone protein in MSI CRC that was generated by somatic deletion&#xD;
      of a LNCR. Of interest, HSP110 mutant (due to exon skipping) have anti-oncogenic properties&#xD;
      and the survival of MSI CRC patients receiving chemotherapy is positively associated with&#xD;
      HSP110 mutations in tumour DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current project is to identify additional clinically relevant MSI-associated&#xD;
      splicing aberrations due to mutations in LNCR located in splice acceptor sites. The four main&#xD;
      steps are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify exon/intron sites affected by aberrant splicing events due to MSI in CRC .&#xD;
           All RNASeq data will be exploited to identify recurrent splicing aberrations (mostly&#xD;
           exon skipping) that occur specifically in MSI colon tumours;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate for possible functional links between MSI and any detected aberrant&#xD;
           splicing events . All specific aberrant splicing events detected by RNAseq in MSI CRC&#xD;
           samples will be first confirmed (quantitative RT-PCR) in order to eliminate false&#xD;
           positive cases. For validated exon candidates, the allelic profiles of adjacent intronic&#xD;
           LNCR will be analysed (PCR and fluorescence genotyping) in CRC cell lines and primary&#xD;
           tumours (MSI and MSS), as well as in matching normal mucosa samples in order to assess&#xD;
           their polymorphic status;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify splicing events and LNCR mutations with clinical relevance in MSI CRC&#xD;
           patients . All LNCR with a confirmed role in gene splicing in MSI CRC will be analysed.&#xD;
           The clinical relevance of candidate genes will be assessed using multivariate survival&#xD;
           regression models for Relapse- Free Survival, with interaction terms (response to&#xD;
           chemotherapy);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To initiate functional studies on a limited number of clinically relevant,&#xD;
           cancer-related genes whose splicing is perturbed in MSI cancer cells, and to develop&#xD;
           biological tools to simplify screening in future clinical assays Similar to HSP110, we&#xD;
           will focus on 4 or 5 mutant proteins that are promising drug therapeutic targets.&#xD;
           Functional assays will be developed to further elucidate their role in the&#xD;
           pathophysiology of MSI tumours. We also aim to develop biological tools for these&#xD;
           candidate genes, such as the detection of wild-type or mutant proteins by&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry.&#xD;

      WP1 - To identify exon/intron junctions that are specifically affected by aberrant splicing&#xD;
      events in MSI CRC. Sequences will first be evaluated at CNG using Illumina's Pipeline CASAVA&#xD;
      (Consensus Assessment of Sequence And Variation) software. This program converts intensity&#xD;
      scores into base calls, quality scored alignments and additional formats for downstream&#xD;
      analysis, thus rapidly transforming data into biologically relevant information. The filtered&#xD;
      data will then be transferred to the CIT platform (Carte d'Identité des Tumeurs;&#xD;
      http://cit.ligue-cancer.net, dir: A. de Reynies) to be analysed by our bio-informatics&#xD;
      expert. The Cufflinks workflow will be used to quantify transcript expression levels in MSI&#xD;
      tumours. This allows transcript assembly, discovery and differential expression measures at&#xD;
      transcript-level resolution. Because the standard Cufflinks workflow does not support gene&#xD;
      fusion discovery or quantification, several new features will be incorporated into it.&#xD;
      Firstly, SoapFuse will be used to detect fusion break points and to predict fusion junction&#xD;
      sequences. These will be integrated into the human reference genome and gene annotation from&#xD;
      the Gencode project to provide a comprehensive, integrated annotation of gene features for&#xD;
      mapping of splicing reads. The integration INCa - PRTK 2014 17/51 process will abide by&#xD;
      several rules to minimise the potential to disturb the quantification of expression level in&#xD;
      forthcoming analyses. With the help of our customised reference genome and annotation,&#xD;
      TopHat, an aligner that supports splice junction and gene fusion mapping will be used for&#xD;
      RNASeq mapping. Cufflinks will then be used to find new splice variants, including new exon&#xD;
      skipping isoforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will be integrated into the annotation using Cuffmerge. Depending on the alignment&#xD;
      results obtained with TopHat, several filters will be applied to remove low quality&#xD;
      candidates for splice variation and gene fusion, as well as candidates that are incompatible&#xD;
      with existing annotated transcripts. Where necessary, reads will be assembled by AbySS and&#xD;
      then aligned onto the reference genome by BLAT to provide more information for refining the&#xD;
      annotation. This will produce a transcriptome assembly containing high confidence gene fusion&#xD;
      and exon skipping events. Identification of these events will then be performed in individual&#xD;
      samples. Cuffdiff will be used to analyse the mapping result, also based on this&#xD;
      transcriptome assembly, for calling differentially expressed genes and transcripts and for&#xD;
      detecting differential splicing changes. Finally, CummeRbund will be used to interpret and&#xD;
      visualise the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reliability of RNA-seq analysis will be verified by searching for aberrantly spliced&#xD;
      transcripts already reported in MSI cancers (eg. MRE11 and HSP110) and for point mutations in&#xD;
      the coding sequences of target genes for MSI (eg.TGFBR2, IGF2R, TCF7L2, AXIN2, PTEN, RIZ) and&#xD;
      in other cancer-related genes that serve as internal positive controls (eg. KRAS, BRAF, TP53,&#xD;
      PIK3CA). It is worth noting this project is part of several others developed jointly with&#xD;
      CIT-Ligue and that are aimed at characterizing MSI CRC using Omics technologies. Importantly,&#xD;
      this data is already available for a significant number of samples and could therefore be&#xD;
      exploited if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the RNASeq cohort of patients will be comprehensively analysed to identify&#xD;
      recurrent splicing aberrations (expected to be mostly exon skipping) that occur specifically&#xD;
      in MSI colon tumours compared to MSS CRCs and matching normal colonic mucosa. Amongst these,&#xD;
      the study will focus on splicing aberrations that are due to MSI and that affect exons with a&#xD;
      flanking upstream intron containing a ≥ 15 bp LNCR that is located ≤ 6 bp from the&#xD;
      intron-exon junction (splice acceptor site) (RNASeqMSI-exon pre-list). As stated above, about&#xD;
      2,000 human genes contain at least one intron with a LNCR very close to the AG splice&#xD;
      acceptor site at the intron-exon junction. Approximately 100 human genes could be affected by&#xD;
      recurrent and specific aberrant splicing events due to MSI in CRC (mostly exon skipping;&#xD;
      deduced from experiments performed in a limited series of CRC cell lines and primary tumours&#xD;
      using exon arrays; preliminary and unpublished results).&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP2 - To investigate for functional links between MSI and aberrant splicing events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the RNASeq analysis, confirmation of the aberrant splicing events due to MSI will&#xD;
      be required using another methodological approach in order to eliminate false positive&#xD;
      events. This will be achieved with real-time quantitative INCa - PRTK 2014 18/51 RT-PCR using&#xD;
      internal, specific probes (Applied biosystems). For each skipped exon in the RNASeqMSI-exon&#xD;
      pre-list, a common pair of forward and reverse primers located in the flanking exons will be&#xD;
      designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two internal probes will be designed, located either within the skipped exons or spanning the&#xD;
      flanking exons at their junction in order to detect normal or aberrantly spliced mRNA in a&#xD;
      competitive manner, respectively. It is highly sensitive and also avoids false positive&#xD;
      signals due to contamination with genomic DNA. Candidate exons that will be retained are&#xD;
      those that display aberrant and recurrent skipping in MSI CRC cell lines and primary tumors&#xD;
      as compared to MSS CRC controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with our working hypothesis, the study will then determine whether each confirmed&#xD;
      splicing aberration is MSI-driven. This will be achieved as described earlier for T17&#xD;
      deletions in intron 8 of HSP110 that were identified specifically in MSI CRC and lead to exon&#xD;
      9 skipping. Briefly, allelic profiles of adjacent intronic LNCR (see above) will be analyzed&#xD;
      using fluorescence-based genotyping in the panel of MSI and MSS CRC cell lines, as well as in&#xD;
      the complete series of MSI primary tumors from the RNASeq patient cohort and paired normal&#xD;
      mucosa (in order to assess polymorphic status). This will be performed using the same method&#xD;
      developed earlier in our laboratory for analysis of the HSP110 T17 DNA repeat. Following&#xD;
      migration of PCR products on an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer with GS400HD ROX size standards and&#xD;
      POP-7 polymer (Applied Biosystems), GeneMapper V4.0 software (Applied Biosystems) will be&#xD;
      used to analyze LNCR traces, with application of an AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length&#xD;
      Polymorphism) method. Traces will be considered acceptable when the peak amplitudes are&#xD;
      between 100 and 6,000 fluorescence units. An MSI Perl script has been developed to&#xD;
      automatically compare LNCR traces in normal and tumour samples, thus allowing detection of&#xD;
      aberrant LNCR peaks that fall outside of the polymorphic zone observed in the normal&#xD;
      population. As with HSP110, it is expected (i) to detect somatic deletions/insertions in some&#xD;
      of the candidate LNCRs using this approach, and (ii) to identify those whose somatic&#xD;
      alterations due to MSI are significantly associated with exon skipping-related events at the&#xD;
      RNA level (MSI exon final list).&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP3 - To identify splicing events and/or LNCR mutations with clinical relevance in MSI CRC&#xD;
      patients. The clinical relevance of candidate genes (MSI exon final list) will be assessed&#xD;
      using multivariate survival regression models for RFS (Relapse-Free Survival). The number of&#xD;
      candidate splicing events and/or LNCR mutations is approximately 100 (see WP1 and WP2 above)&#xD;
      and INCa - PRTK 2014 19/51 other known clinical determinants such as stage, treatment and age&#xD;
      at diagnosis will be considered in the multivariate models. False positives are one of the&#xD;
      major pitfalls in identifying potentially relevant markers amongst dozens of candidates. As&#xD;
      the number (p) of covariates to be considered will be of the same order as the number of&#xD;
      individuals, the &quot;high-dimensional setting&quot; will be reached. Consequently, the usual&#xD;
      algorithms for survival regression models (e.g. coxph in R) will fail to estimate the&#xD;
      parameters and to identify events with clinical relevance. In our analysis, three main&#xD;
      methodological issues require special attention, particularly at the algorithmic level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP3 will be divided into two main steps, the first of which concerns comparisons and the&#xD;
      development of statistical algorithms. Once tuned, the algorithms will be run to identify a&#xD;
      prognostic biomarker(s) that involves splicing events and/or LNCR mutations with clinical&#xD;
      relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-dimensional regression models and lasso algorithms. In the first step only splicing&#xD;
      mutations and clinical determinants in the survival regression models will be considered. In&#xD;
      this case, variable selection and parameter estimation will be conducted with a lasso (or&#xD;
      elastic net) algorithm (see Simon et al. for the Cox model, and Gaiffas et al. for Aalen&#xD;
      model, both implemented in R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous publications it was demonstrated that cut-point values resulted in maximal&#xD;
      survival differences between patient groups with large or small deletions in the HSP110 T17&#xD;
      LNCR, and with high or low expression of mutant HSP110 mRNA due to exon 9 skipping at the&#xD;
      INCa - PRTK 2014 20/51 mRNA level. Since other splicing events could present with the same&#xD;
      threshold effect, the cut-points for up to 100 candidate splicing events will be carefully&#xD;
      determined. Even in classical statistics, cut-point determination is a known difficulty&#xD;
      because of overdetection. As recently proposed in a related context, the &quot;lasso with&#xD;
      pre-screening algorithm&quot; could be adapted to incorporate the cut-point determination into the&#xD;
      main algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other points. Missing data will be handled by multiple imputations from nearest-neighbour or&#xD;
      regression methods. The study will consider possible interactions with the use of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. As a final step, estimations will be run on the training cohort (Saint-Antoine)&#xD;
      to derive a prognostic biomarker that will include splicing events and/or LNCR mutations with&#xD;
      clinical relevance. This biomarker will be validated on the test cohort (multi-centre).&#xD;
      Bootstrap analysis will be conducted to ascertain the biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP4 - To initiate functional studies on a limited number of clinically relevant, cancer&#xD;
      related genes whose splicing is highly perturbed in MSI cancer cells, and to develop&#xD;
      biological tools to simplify screening in future clinical assays. As stated earlier, A&#xD;
      preliminary study has been performed using exon arrays in a small series of MSI CRC cell&#xD;
      lines and primary tumours (unpublished). This was conducted to evaluate feasibility, time,&#xD;
      cost, adverse factors, effect size (statistical variability) and to improve upon the study&#xD;
      design prior to performing the present full scale research project. The functions of the 100&#xD;
      detected candidate genes (some of which may overlap with those identified from RNAseq&#xD;
      screening) were frequently related to a cancer-related processes such as macromolecular&#xD;
      synthesis (30%), cell proliferative capacity or cell death (20%), drug resistance (10%) and&#xD;
      others (WNT pathway, metastatic process, changes in chromosome structure). The present&#xD;
      project expect to identify several robust MSI-driven splice mutants that are clinically&#xD;
      relevant (see WP2 and WP3 above). These mutants could have either oncogenic or antioncogenic&#xD;
      functions, given that some (such as HSP110) may be produced at high levels even though they&#xD;
      have negative impacts on the tumour cell (see our functional hypothesis above concerning the&#xD;
      expected detrimental influence of MSI at LNCR in CRC). In this context, in vitro functional&#xD;
      studies will be designed to characterize the oncogenic impact of a small number (n=5) of&#xD;
      putative clinically relevant mutants. These experiments will be based on transient silencing&#xD;
      or overexpression using siRNA or plasmids and ad hoc biological read-out in CRC cellular&#xD;
      models already available in our laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the results obtained, further investigations could then be planned using stably&#xD;
      transfected CRC models xenografted into nude mice. In addition, the study plan to validate&#xD;
      biological tools (e.g. Antibodies) to optimize the future screening of patients using routine&#xD;
      assays, similar to our work with HSP110 and the HSP110DE9 mutant. Tissue Microarrays (TMAs)&#xD;
      will be constructed from routinely prepared, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded blocks&#xD;
      collected INCa - PRTK 2014 21/51 retrospectively from the Pathology Department of&#xD;
      Saint-Antoine hospital. Neoplastic tissue will be sampled, including the tumour invasive&#xD;
      front (3 to 6 samples of 0.6 mm diameter tissue cores). When available, paired lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis will also be sampled. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies generated specifically&#xD;
      (subcontracting) to recognize wild-type or mutant candidate proteins will be performed on&#xD;
      TMAs. Exon skipping events are frameshift in 2/3 of cases and thus generate truncated&#xD;
      proteins that have immunogenic, aberrant C-terminal tails. Correlations between protein&#xD;
      expression and clinico-pathological features will be evaluated, as well as their prognostic&#xD;
      and predictive values. TMA slide images will be captured as high-resolution digital files and&#xD;
      evaluation of each staining will be done by two pathologists.&#xD;
