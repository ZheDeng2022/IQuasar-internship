  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common childhood behavioural&#xD;
      disorder, causing significant impediment to a child's development. The exact aetiology of&#xD;
      ADHD is still unknown. It is a complex disorder with numerous contributing (epi)genetic and&#xD;
      environmental factors. Currently, treatment predominantly consists of behavioural and&#xD;
      pharmacological therapy. However, medication use is associated with several side effects and&#xD;
      concerns about long-term effects and efficacy exist. Therefore, there is considerable&#xD;
      interest in the development of alternative treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind research investigating the effect of a few-foods diet (FFD) has demonstrated&#xD;
      large improvements in ADHD symptoms. However, following an FFD requires great effort of both&#xD;
      the child and parents. To make this treatment easier or potentially obsolete, it is important&#xD;
      to understand how and in which children an FFD affects ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that an FFD affects brain function and behaviour, including&#xD;
      ADHD symptoms, via the complex network of communication between the microbiota, gut and&#xD;
      brain, i.e. the MGB axis. The aim of this study is to identify potential mechanism(s)&#xD;
      underlying the impact of an FFD on ADHD symptoms and to identify biomarkers that predict the&#xD;
      response to the FFD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 boys with ADHD will follow the FFD for 5 weeks. After inclusion, all participants will&#xD;
      start with a baseline period, during which they will maintain their regular diet. The&#xD;
      baseline period ends at the end of week 2. Thereafter, participants will follow a 5-week FFD,&#xD;
      preceded by a 1-week transition period. The FFD period ends at the end of week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the baseline period (i.e. at the end of week 2) and at the end of the FFD (i.e.&#xD;
      at the end of week 8), fMRI scans will be made, blood and buccal saliva will be collected,&#xD;
      and stool and urine will be handed in. Children will do computer tasks and parents will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires to monitor ADHD and physical complaints. All samples will be analysed&#xD;
      by researchers blinded to behavioural responses to the FFD. To assess the impact of the FFD&#xD;
      on brain function and the MGB axis, associations between ADHD behavioural changes and changes&#xD;
      in other primary and secondary study outcomes will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may lead to the identification of biomarkers that can predict the response to an&#xD;
      FFD. Understanding which changes - induced by an FFD - lead to improvements in ADHD symptoms&#xD;
      may provide new avenues for developing treatments. Ultimately, the findings may enable&#xD;
      personalised intervention strategies based on an individuals' configuration of the MGB axis.&#xD;

    <description>The few-foods diet (FFD) is followed for 5-weeks preceded by a 1-week transition period during which the child's eating pattern will be gradually adjusted. The diet consists of rice, meat (turkey and lamb), a range of vegetables, pear, rice milk with added calcium and water, and is complemented with foods such as potatoes, fruits, corn, some sweets and wheat, which are allowed in small quantities only. Normal quantities of vegetables, rice and meat are allowed every day. If necessary the diet will be adjusted to avoid foods that the child dislikes or has cravings for. If the child does not respond to the initial FFD, i.e. no change in behaviour after the first two weeks, interim adjustments to the FFD will be made in consultation with the parents.</description>
