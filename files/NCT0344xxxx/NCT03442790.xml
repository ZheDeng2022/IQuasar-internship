    <textblock>
      Central venous lines insertion are common procedures these days. CVL placed under USG&#xD;
      guidance have high success rates and low complications even in developing country settings.&#xD;
      However, the investigators still have to rely on chest x-ray (CXR) to confirm the correct&#xD;
      placement of central venous lines as a gold standard method. This might be time consuming and&#xD;
      may cause delay in initiation of treatment. In some cases, as in operating room, the&#xD;
      treatment is started even before confirmation by CXR. Ultrasound has ability to localize the&#xD;
      tip of the catheter at the superior venacava- right atrium junction using agitated saline and&#xD;
      the appearance of contrast within 2 seconds in right atrium. However, this technique is&#xD;
      rarely used. The investigators, therefore, designed the trial to study whether confirmation&#xD;
      of tip of CVL by ultrasound is non-inferior to the CXR confirmation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central venous lines (CVL) are placed in various in-hospital settings like operation&#xD;
      theaters, emergency departments, oncology departments, and intensive care units for various&#xD;
      purposes. Like any invasive procedures, placement of central lines is invariably associated&#xD;
      with certain risks of inadvertent complications which are often life-threatening which occur&#xD;
      because of the intricacy of the structures around the vascular access site like pleura,&#xD;
      arteries, nerves, heart, etc. Measures such as landmark guidance, electrocardiographic&#xD;
      guidance, fluoroscopy/C-arm-guided, and recently ultrasound image guidance have been in place&#xD;
      to prevent and/or minimize the occurrence of such complications. Although the incidence of&#xD;
      such complications have decreased considerably4, the rates have not reached the nadir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of confirmation of the correct placement of a CVL can have serious consequences. The&#xD;
      consequences of an inadvertently misplaced catheter are grave for the patient be it the&#xD;
      failure to elicit the vasopressor effect, unnecessary delay in starting of caustic substances&#xD;
      like hypertonic fluids, parenteral nutrition, concentrated agents, etc., these will&#xD;
      ultimately increase the morbidity and mortality. Thus, it becomes imperative that we confirm&#xD;
      the accurate placement of CVL before infusing anything through these lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The confirmation of accurate placement of CVL is usually done by performing a post-procedure&#xD;
      chest x-ray (CXR) which is done at the point of care if possible like in ICU or after&#xD;
      shifting of patient to a post-operative ward in an operation theater setup. The most&#xD;
      important constraint in obtaining CXR after CVL placement is the considerable amount of time&#xD;
      it takes before a film is obtained even in center where there is a dedicated portable CXR for&#xD;
      that purpose. For CVL placed in the operating theater, it is not always possible to do a&#xD;
      portable CXR immediately after the procedure and at many times we have to immediately start&#xD;
      infusion/medications through it even before confirmation of their proper placement. Secondly&#xD;
      the very well-known problem of radiation hazard is a potential deterrent to the use of CXR&#xD;
      each time a CVL is placed. When a large volume ICU is compared, the risk of radiation is&#xD;
      inadvertently extended to all of the patients even though lines are placed in some. The&#xD;
      hazard of the radiation to the ICU and ED staffs is always a concern considering the&#xD;
      difficulty they face in escaping the hazard when they are taking care of sick patients.&#xD;
      Thirdly, it is difficult to obtain an accurate CXR film in critical care unit setups where&#xD;
      the patient are sometimes unable to hold breaths at inspiration (for the proper x-ray film)&#xD;
      and the film so obtained may not be reliable enough to read. Fourthly, the overall costs in&#xD;
      obtaining CXR for each and every single central lines placed will add to the overall&#xD;
      healthcare costs at a time when the investigators are looking for reasons to cut down on&#xD;
      health expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the fact that these lines are placed under ultrasound guidance, the rate of&#xD;
      inadvertent complications are very few. But subjecting every single individual to an x-ray&#xD;
      cannot always be justified. Nevertheless, this is not to say that central lines should not be&#xD;
      confirmed for their proper placement, but certainly there is an imminent need of a simple,&#xD;
      reliable, and more cost effective alternative to CXR. The very same ultrasound machine at&#xD;
      point of care can be utilized for this purpose addressing most of the limitations of the CXR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With simple, directed teaching it is possible for anyone with basic knowledge in ultrasound&#xD;
      to do a focused point of care ultrasound to evaluate the accurate placement of CVL. This&#xD;
      simple approach has several potential benefits. The first one being the saving of precious&#xD;
      post-procedure time that is lost in obtaining a chest x-ray. The potential radiation hazard&#xD;
      due to CXR is virtually eliminated. The same ultrasound can also be utilized for scanning the&#xD;
      thorax to exclude pneumothorax and hemothorax and avoid potential delay in their management.&#xD;
      If the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound in accurately delineating the position of&#xD;
      CVL is comparable to the chest x-ray, then obtaining of chest x-ray for confirmation can&#xD;
      virtually be eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, it is possible to see the intravascularly placed CVL by scanning the respective&#xD;
      vessel and visualizing the acoustic shadow in transverse axis and following the same in&#xD;
      longitudinal axis, there is a limitation to the extent these lines can be followed to. The&#xD;
      user who is usually positioned just above the head has access to scan the neck veins and&#xD;
      follow the vessels until the bony structures like clavicle and ribs limit further&#xD;
      interpretation unless we are using a transesophageal echocardiography. Thus, experts have&#xD;
      devised a noble technique of using agitated saline as contrast agent to check the accurate&#xD;
      location of central line. When performed properly, the contrast agent which is injected&#xD;
      through the distal most port of central line will create a wave of microbubbles appearing to&#xD;
      enter the right atrium from superior venacava and the relative time it takes for these&#xD;
      bubbles to appear help interpret the position of CVL with a relatively high degree of&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity. This simple yet effective method is not expected to take a long&#xD;
      time to perform. However, not all the studies thus performed so far have been consistent in&#xD;
      obtaining a conclusive evidence of its effectivity and sensitivity. Most of the studies done&#xD;
      till date have been relatively underpowered by a small sample size to draw a major conclusion&#xD;
      as to justify the use of ultrasound in detection of CVL placement. This very finding dictates&#xD;
      the necessity of conducting even more studies in diverse groups of population before a&#xD;
      concrete conclusion is drawn. Unlike previous studies where the ultrasound was compared as an&#xD;
      absolute method to completely replace the CXR in confirmation of CVL which still seems to be&#xD;
      far-fetched idea, the investigators seek to see that ultrasound guided agitated saline method&#xD;
      of confirmation is not inferior to chest x-ray in confirming or refuting the accurate&#xD;
      placement of CVL. By this study, the investigators do not at all seek to completely eliminate&#xD;
      chest x-ray in confirmation of CVL but at least make an interpretation by using appropriate&#xD;
      tests that ultrasound has the potential to be effective in decreasing the necessity of CXR in&#xD;
      post-CVL insertion confirmation. The investigators believe that rather than subjecting every&#xD;
      single person to radiation hazard after CVL, it is justifiable to obtain CXR only in those&#xD;
      cases where there is confirmatory dilemma with agitated saline. Till date, there are also no&#xD;
      specific guides to accurately predict the length at which the CVL should be fixed at skin&#xD;
      before any form of confirmation can be done. The investigators assume that with this study,&#xD;
      they will be able to better able to tell what is the most appropriate length of CVL fixing&#xD;
      which can be extended to other patients of similar population group. Also, the investigators&#xD;
      presume that it is possible to virtually eliminate a large numbers of unnecessary x-rays&#xD;
      including all of their hazards and also cut down the healthcare costs. The investigators also&#xD;
      believe that in the due course of time, with this and other similar and sufficiently powered&#xD;
      studies, it will be possible to draw a firm conclusion and use ultrasound as an effective&#xD;
      tool for its varied purposes in intensive care and emergency settings.&#xD;
