  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that dietary weight loss (WL) through&#xD;
      alternate day fasting (ADF) will enhance appetite control, health markers and wellbeing&#xD;
      following WL compared to standard daily calorie restriction (CR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept randomized controlled trial in which overweight/obese females will&#xD;
      be randomised to a dietary weight loss intervention (ADF or CR) to achieve ≥5% WL.&#xD;
      Behavioural measures of appetite control including ad libitum intake after a fixed meal, body&#xD;
      composition, resting metabolic rate, measured physical activity and daily energy expenditure,&#xD;
      sleep quality, hedonic food reward and eating behaviour traits will be assessed before,&#xD;
      during and after the WL intervention in those who reach the target weight loss within 12&#xD;
      weeks. After weight loss phase, participants will be given standard healthy eating and&#xD;
      physical activity advice for weight maintenance and body weight will be followed up after&#xD;
      weight loss at 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>Change in ratings of hunger, satiety, fullness and prospective food consumption before, after and between meals. Scale range is minimum 0 to maximum 100mm.
