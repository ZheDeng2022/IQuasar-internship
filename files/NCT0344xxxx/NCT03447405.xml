      Dino EGG mother's voice exposure and multisensory processing in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 2 phase prospective comparative effectiveness trial of our parents' voice&#xD;
      intervention with 290 hospitalized preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a part of a previous project, an early technology development award from the Nationwide&#xD;
      Children's Hospital (NCH) Technology Office allowed us to develop 10 functioning prototypes&#xD;
      of the DINO EGG speakers, a NICU-safe and developmentally appropriate music player that&#xD;
      delivers parent's voice to the bedside of NICU infants. The device passed NCH NICU-safe&#xD;
      products committee and has been used in the clinical setting delivering clinical music&#xD;
      therapy services (available at bedside to play parents' voice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of the current study is to test an updated prototype version of the device&#xD;
      that replicates a previously FDA (and NCH NICU-safe products) proved device called Pacifier&#xD;
      Activated Lullaby (PAL), used and described in IRB15-01035, but being discontinued by the&#xD;
      company. The discontinuation is not due to safety or health benefits concerns. Therefore, no&#xD;
      device available on the market currently exists to accomplish NICU parents' voice delivery in&#xD;
      a consistent and safe manner, the investigators modified a 510K-approved feeding device that&#xD;
      is no longer available and whose intellectual property rights have expired. The device's air&#xD;
      displacement sensor, which fits into a standard NICU pacifier, allowed the investigators to&#xD;
      deliver processed and developmentally appropriate recordings of parent's voice, contingent&#xD;
      upon the infant producing effort to receive it. Intellectual property rights were filed for&#xD;
      the modifications and use process through the technology transfer and legal office at NCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, phase I will test the usability of the device (safety for the NICU was confirmed),&#xD;
      not the effectiveness of the parents' voice delivery for the infant. Parent and nursing&#xD;
      questionnaires about the importance of the device availability and its usability will be&#xD;
      collected from parents and Registered Nurse (RN) staff that choose to provide the feedback.&#xD;

    <description>We will confirm a larger scale that for preterm infants, standardized exposure to mother's voice with a contingent stimulus of non-nutritive sucking can improve the development of speech sound discrimination in the NICU. Phase I will test the usability of the device (safety for the NICU was confirmed), not the effectiveness of the parents' voice delivery for the infant.
