      This is a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, single dose study in a single cohort of&#xD;
      6 healthy male subjects, including up to 2 cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 poor metabolizer&#xD;
      subjects. Each subject will receive a single oral administration of 14C-NW-3509 capsule in&#xD;
      the fasted state.The screening period and study admission to completion is estimated to be up&#xD;
      to 43 days. The following data will be analyzed urine and feces data for total radioactivity,&#xD;
      plasma and whole blood data for total radioactivity and plasma concentration data for&#xD;
      NW-3509.&#xD;
