  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-cell leukemias and lymphomas are cancers that are often difficult to treat. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine the ability to take a patient's own cells (T&#xD;
      lymphocytes) and grow them in the laboratory with the CD19/CD22-CAR receptor gene through a&#xD;
      process called 'lentiviral transduction (also considered gene therapy) and growing them to&#xD;
      large numbers to use as a treatment for hematologic cancers in children and young adults..&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if giving modified CD19/CD22-CAR T cells to people with these cancers&#xD;
      can attack cancer cells. In addition, the safety of giving these gene modified cells to&#xD;
      humans will be tested at different cell doses. Additional objectives are to determine if this&#xD;
      therapy can cause regression of B cell cancers and to measure if the gene modified cells&#xD;
      survive in patients blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the safety and effects of giving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells to children and young adults&#xD;
      with B-cell cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 3-39 with certain cancers that have not been cured by standard therapy. Their&#xD;
      cancer tissue must express the CD19 protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of participants blood or bone marrow will be sent to NIH and tested for leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine and blood tests (including for HIV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart and eye tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurologic assessment and symptom checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans, bone marrow biopsy, and/or spinal tap&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have lung tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat these tests throughout the study and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be drawn from a plastic tube (IV) or needle&#xD;
      in one arm then go through a machine that removes lymphocytes. The remaining blood will be&#xD;
      returned to the participant s other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the hospital about 2 weeks. There they will get:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two chemotherapy drugs by IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their changed cells by IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard drugs for side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have frequent follow-up visits for 1 year, then 5 visits for the next 4&#xD;
      years. Then they will answer questions and have blood tests every year for 15 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for approximately 25% of childhood cancer.&#xD;
           Survival rates have improved, but outcomes for some subgroups, including infants and&#xD;
           young adults remain poor, and survival for patients who relapse is &lt; 50%, despite&#xD;
           allogeneic stem cell transplant following second remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD19 immune escape has been observed by several groups following CD19-CAR therapy for&#xD;
           B-ALL. Investigation of this phenomenon reveals a complex biology responsible for loss&#xD;
           or downregulation of CD19 expression observed in these cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequential therapy using CD22-CARs to treat CD19 dim/lo escape is associated with rapid&#xD;
           development of resistance due to CD22 downregulation. This trial will test whether&#xD;
           simultaneous targeting of CD19 and CD22 using a novel bivalent CD19/22-CAR is safe and&#xD;
           feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Assess the safety of administering escalating doses of autologous CD19/CD22-CAR engineered T&#xD;
      cells that meet established release specifications in children and young adults with&#xD;
      CD19+CD22+ B cell ALL, isolated CNS ALL, or lymphoma following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine&#xD;
      conditioning regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients between &gt;= 3 years and &lt;= 39 years of age, with CD19+/CD22+ B cell ALL, isolated&#xD;
      CNS ALL, or lymphoma who have relapsed or have refractory disease after at least one standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen and one salvage regimen, with no alternative curative options who meet&#xD;
      standard Phase I eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I, 3 + 3 dose escalation design using the following dose levels: -1: 1 x 10^5&#xD;
           transduced T cells/kg (+/- 20%); 1: 3 x 10^5 transduced T cells/kg (+/- 20%); 2: 1 x&#xD;
           10^6 transduced T cells/kg; and 3: 3 x 10^6 transduced T cells/kg (+/- 20%); 4: 1 x 10^7&#xD;
           transduced T cells/kg (+/- 20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a lymphodepleting preparative regimen of fludarabine (25 mg/m^2/d&#xD;
           x 3 on Days -4, -3, -2) and cyclophosphamide (900 mg/m^2/d x 1 on Day -2) followed by&#xD;
           infusion of CD19/CD22-CAR T-cells on D0. Patients who are CAR pre-treated (with&#xD;
           exception for those with an interval HSCT) will receive increased lymphodepleting&#xD;
           preparative regimen of fludarabine (30 mg/m^2/d x 4 on Days -5, -4, -3, -2) and&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m^2/d x 2 on Days -3, -2) followed by infusion of CD19/CD22-CAR&#xD;
           T-cells on D0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be evaluated sequentially for toxicity, antitumor effects, CAR expansion&#xD;
           and persistence, as well as research correlatives.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient must have a B cell ALL (inclusive of CML with ALL transformation) or&#xD;
                  lymphoma and must have relapsed or refractory disease after at least one standard&#xD;
                  chemotherapy regimen and one salvage regimen. In view of the PI and the primary&#xD;
                  oncologist, there must be no available alternative curative therapies and&#xD;
                  subjects must be either ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT),&#xD;
                  have refused SCT, recurred after SCT, or have disease activity that prohibits SCT&#xD;
                  at the time of enrollment. Patients who have undergone autologous SCT will be&#xD;
                  eligible, and patients that have undergone allogeneic SCT will be eligible if, in&#xD;
                  addition to meeting other eligibility criteria, they have no evidence of GVHD and&#xD;
                  have been without immunosuppressive agents for at least 30 days. Patients with&#xD;
                  Philadelphia chromosome + ALL must have failed prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease at the time of enrollment,&#xD;
                  which may include any evidence of disease including minimal residual disease&#xD;
                  detected by flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#xD;
                  analysis. For those being considered for reinfusions, measurable or evaluable&#xD;
                  disease is not required at the time of reinfusion..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD22/CD19 Expression&#xD;
&#xD;
             --CD19 expression must be detected on greater than 15% of the malignant cells by&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry or greater than 90% by flow cytometry. The choice of whether to&#xD;
             use flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry will be determined by what is the most&#xD;
             easily available tissue sample in each patient. In general, immunohistochemistry will&#xD;
             be used for lymph node biopsies, flow cytometry will be used for peripheral blood and&#xD;
             bone marrow samples. CD22+ B cell malignancy is required and CD22 expression levels&#xD;
             will be documented when available, but a specific level of expression is not an&#xD;
             eligibility requirement; it may be documented as positive or negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age:&#xD;
&#xD;

             than or equal to 39 years). NOTE: The first patient in each dose cohort must be&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
