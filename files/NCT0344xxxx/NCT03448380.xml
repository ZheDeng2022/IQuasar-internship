      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm, post-approval study of the&#xD;
      FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System intended to characterize the safety of the&#xD;
      Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System when used in people with diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 920 adult subjects, aged 18 years and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who require&#xD;
      daily blood glucose monitoring to manage their diabetes, will be enrolled to obtain at least&#xD;
      736 subjects who complete the final visit. Subjects will utilize capillary SMBG for managing&#xD;
      diabetes for 6 months (control phase) followed by diabetes management using FreeStyle Libre&#xD;
      for 6 months (intervention phase). Subjects will maintain a diary/log book of Adverse Events&#xD;
      during each phase. Assessment of Adverse Events will occur via self reporting at each monthly&#xD;
      visit and/or phone call.&#xD;
