  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 4200 new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) are diagnosed each year in Denmark, and&#xD;
      30.000 patients live with the diagnosis. Up to 40% of CRC patients will have synchronous&#xD;
      liver metastases (LM) at the time of the diagnosis or will develop metachronous LM during the&#xD;
      course of their disease. CRC-LM are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and liver&#xD;
      surgery, but less than 25% of the referred patients with CRC-LM may be treated with curative&#xD;
      intend. If looking at population-based data this figure drops to less than 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During pre-operative chemotherapy the treatment response is monitored by CT and MR scans, and&#xD;
      the patients are then discussed on multidisciplinary team (MDT) conferences. However,&#xD;
      monitoring is inaccurate since the simple measurement of size of the liver lesions cannot&#xD;
      provide reliable evidence of the treatment response. The cancer cells may actually have been&#xD;
      replaced by scar tissue but without any shrinkage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question is how may we improve the evaluation of treatment response? With the goal of&#xD;
      improving the assessment of the response to chemotherapy, and thereby only treat the patients&#xD;
      that will benefit from chemotherapy?&#xD;

      Clinical study Evaluation of oncological treatment response in patients with non-resectable&#xD;
      colorectal liver metastases based on microscopic tissue analyses obtained by a minimal&#xD;
      invasive technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Denmark is 4.200 cases and the&#xD;
      prevalence is approximately 30.000. One in five patients will have synchronous liver&#xD;
      metastases (CRC-LM) and a similar number will develop metachronous CRC-LM during the course&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is the cornerstone in treatment of CRC-LM with a curative intent, most often in a&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy. There are no randomized studies comparing surgery to&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone, but data indicate that there is an early advantage in progression free&#xD;
      survival when surgery is combined with chemotherapy in comparison to surgery alone, although&#xD;
      this might not translate into an overall survival benefit. The 5 year survival rate for&#xD;
      patients treated with liver resection is approximately 40 % and even higher in selected&#xD;
      series. Clinical series suggest that one in four patients with CRC-LM may be resected,&#xD;
      whereas the few population based studies report of resection rates as low as 4%. In order to&#xD;
      improve the overall treatment of cancer patients in Denmark, the Danish Health and Medicines&#xD;
      Authority has launched a series of National Integrated Cancer Pathways (&quot;Kr√¶ftpakker&quot;). A&#xD;
      pathway for CRC-LM was issued by the end of 2008 in order to reduce processing time (e.g.&#xD;
      faster diagnosis and quicker onset of treatment), and the compulsory use of a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team conference (MDT) evaluation in all patients with CRC-LM was stated in&#xD;
      this document. Thus, all patients in Denmark with CRC-LM must be evaluated at an MDT in one&#xD;
      of the four regional centers treating these patients (Aalborg, Aarhus, Odense or Copenhagen).&#xD;
      However, epidemiological studies from the Region of Southern Denmark on gastro-esophageal and&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer clearly indicate that a substantial number of patients are not getting any&#xD;
      active treatment and/or are not even presented and evaluated on the regional MDT. This could&#xD;
      also apply to patients with CRC-LM, and this may explain some of the differences in the&#xD;
      reported treatment rates between population based and clinical based studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patients with CRC-LM are evaluated on the regional MDT, they will be divided into&#xD;
      five groups based on MR/CT scans and an assessment of co-morbidity and performance status:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with resectable liver metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with potentially resectable liver metastases. These patients will need&#xD;
           &quot;downstaging&quot; in order to undergo resection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with non-resectable liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients with disseminated extra-hepatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients unfit for surgery and chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group 1-4 will be offered chemotherapy in different settings. The re-evaluation&#xD;
      after chemotherapy of the patients in group 2, 3 and 4 is crucial to the next treatment step&#xD;
      in these patients: Should chemotherapy be continued, stopped or should another chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen be used? Unfortunately, this re-evaluation is uncertain or even wrong, and this may&#xD;
      have a significant negative impact on the patient's situation. In general, the major problem&#xD;
      in studies on chemotherapy in CRC-LM (as in many other cancer diseases) is the objective&#xD;
      evaluation of the treatment response, and thus the effect of different treatment strategies.&#xD;
      Worldwide, this evaluation is based on non-invasive imaging and surrogate markers like the&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 criteria (e.g. measurement of tumor diameter. Complete radiological response (e.g.&#xD;
      no visual evidence of disease) is observed in 4-6% of patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic CRC treated by modern chemotherapy regimens, whereas 5-38% of the patients present&#xD;
      with one or more disappearing lesions in the liver after receiving chemotherapy. However, a&#xD;
      complete pathological response as low as in 20% in these disappearing lesions underlines the&#xD;
      imaging problem. The presence of complete calcifications on CT scans may indicate response,&#xD;
      but it does not imply sterilization of the malignancy. Thus, resection of calcified lesions&#xD;
      and the areas of the disappearing lesions are recommended, but this strategy may prove&#xD;
      difficult when based on therapeutic imaging. At the other end of the response scale, it is&#xD;
      estimated, that up to 15% of the patients will progress during systemic therapy, and this&#xD;
      problem must also be addressed during re-evaluation scans. Thus, a long list of problems&#xD;
      relates to the objective evaluation of treatment response in patients with CRC-LM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment, the best way to evaluate this response would be a detailed intra-operative&#xD;
      ultrasonographic (IOUS) mapping with histological comparison of the metastases before and&#xD;
      after treatment. Obviously, this method would face both ethical and practical problems, but&#xD;
      using a setup with minimal invasive, pre-therapeutic fiducial marking followed by&#xD;
      laparoscopic biopsy of the marked lesions before and after treatment may be the first step&#xD;
      towards a reliable (e.g. histologically controlled) re-evaluation of these patients. In&#xD;
      addition, this approach would enable an estimate of the potentially damaging effect of&#xD;
      chemotherapy on normal liver tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the clinical study part is that we will be able to devise a minimal&#xD;
      invasive, safe and histologically controlled setup for the evaluation of the treatment effect&#xD;
      following chemotherapy in patients with initially non-resectable CRC-LM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the clinical study To devise and test a new minimal invasive setup for the evaluation&#xD;
      of treatment effect following chemotherapy in patients with initially non-resectable CRC-LM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specific, the clinical study will address the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is it technically feasible to perform laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) guided marking of&#xD;
           CRC-LM?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is it safe to perform LUS guided marking of CRC-LM?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is it possible to locate the markings on conventional non-invasive imaging and during&#xD;
           LUS following chemotherapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is it possible to obtain a representative laparoscopic (LAP) specimen/biopsy of the&#xD;
           marked tissue after chemotherapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Is it possible to monitor treatment response by LAP inspection and LUS evaluation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Is it possible to monitor histological response based on the obtained&#xD;
           biopsies/specimens?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. How well does imaging response (e.g. RECIST) correlate with histological response?&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Which side-effects on the non-neoplastic liver does the chemotherapeutic regimens have,&#xD;
           when comparing the pre-chemotherapy non-neoplastic liver biopsy with a post-chemotherapy&#xD;
           non-neoplastic liver biopsy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and design for the clinical study The clinical study will include patients with CRC-LM&#xD;
      in group 3, only (see Ethics and above). The main study will be preceded by a pilot study&#xD;
      with the main focus on aim a) through d). These endpoints are merely observations of the&#xD;
      technical feasibility and safety of the LUS guided marking technique and an evaluation of the&#xD;
      obtained biopsies (+/- sufficient for pathological analysis). The pilot study includes 8&#xD;
      patients. Successful marking, repeated biopsies and a complete primary and secondary&#xD;
      evaluation, including histological evaluation, in six patients without complications are&#xD;
      considered necessary before proceeding to the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study will include 30 patients completing both histological evaluations (including&#xD;
      the 8 patients from the pilot study). There are no available data to support the calculation&#xD;
      of the number of patients necessary to answer the questions e) - h). Thus, the number of&#xD;
      included patients is based on an estimate of the number needed to establish a reliable&#xD;
      minimal invasive technique balanced against an estimated minimal number of liver biopsies&#xD;
      necessary to evaluate treatment response as well as the impact of chemotherapy on&#xD;
      non-neoplastic liver tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient inclusion All patients diagnosed with CRC-LM are evaluated on the regional MDT which&#xD;
      is held twice a week. Patients in group 3 with non-resectable CRC-LM (based on&#xD;
      pre-therapeutic imaging) are approached for inclusion in the study. The incidence of CRC in&#xD;
      The Region of Southern Denmark is approximately 1100. Approximately 400 patients will present&#xD;
      with CRC-LM each year, and at least 200 patients will belong to group 3-5. A high proportion&#xD;
      of these patients will be candidates for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopy, LUS, mapping and marking Before palliative chemotherapy is initiated, these&#xD;
      patients will undergo laparoscopy (LAP) and laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) in general&#xD;
      anesthesia with a detailed mapping of all metastatic lesions (size/lesions/segment, +/-&#xD;
      superficial). During this procedure, two metastases (preferably in the left liver lobe,&#xD;
      segment 2 or 3) are biopted followed by a LUS guided fiducial marking. Moreover, to be able&#xD;
      to evaluate the appearance of the non-metastatic liver prior to chemotherapy, another liver&#xD;
      biopsy from non-metastatic liver will be obtained. This biopsy will aid as &quot;baseline&quot;, to&#xD;
      which the post-treatment non-neoplastic biopsy will be compared. All patients will be treated&#xD;
      and monitored (blood samples, CT/MR scans) according to the normal standards for palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with non-resectable CRC-LM during the study. Thus, apart from the&#xD;
      perioperative admission, the patients are monitored and treated by the Department of&#xD;
      Oncology, Odense University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After two months of standard palliative chemotherapy and standard CT/MR follow up (RECIST and&#xD;
      morphology evaluation(16), a second LAP/LUS is performed, and the two marked lesions are&#xD;
      laparoscopically biopsied along with another biopsy from non-neoplastic liver. In order to&#xD;
      further optimize a future minimal invasive setup, an attempt will be made to perform&#xD;
      percutane ultrasound guided biopsy of the marked metastases. The LAP/LUS will be carried out&#xD;
      right after as described above in order to ensure safety and adequate specimen retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of biopsies and resected specimens When possible the patients are also subdivided&#xD;
      according to chemotherapy regimens during the pilot study. This subdivision includes KRAS&#xD;
      mutant (KRASm) and KRAS wild type (KRASwt) patients in order to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      bevacizumab-/cetuximab-based treatment regimens. There are several methods to evaluate the&#xD;
      histological response of liver metastases to chemotherapy (see point A below). Moreover, the&#xD;
      evaluation of the potential negative side effects of chemotherapy in the non-neoplastic liver&#xD;
      tissue (e.g. sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) and Chemotherapy-Associated&#xD;
      SteatoHepatitis (CASH,) is clinically relevant (see point B below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Analysis of the pre- and post-therapeutic biopsies from liver metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tumor Regression Grading (TRG). This scoring system will be applied to evaluate the&#xD;
           histological effect of chemotherapy on the biopsy from the liver metastases. The type of&#xD;
           necrosis will also be recorded. If the necrosis is of the &quot;infarct-like&quot; or &quot;mucin-like&quot;&#xD;
           type (ILN), then also a modified TRG (mTRG) grade will be assigned for these cases. In&#xD;
           brief, usual necrosis (UN) will be regarded as indicative of a lack of response, whereas&#xD;
           infarct-like necrosis (ILN) will be regarded as fibrosis, i.e. as indicative of response&#xD;
           to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tumor thickness measured at the Tumor-Normal liver tissue Interface (TNI) will be used,&#xD;
           if the TNI is clearly present in the biopsy. This method has been validated as a&#xD;
           prognostic factor for therapy response and survival outcome in patients with resected&#xD;
           CRC-LM when applied upon resected metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: Analyses of pre- and post-therapeutic biopsies from the non-neoplastic liver parenchyma&#xD;
      These biopsies will be evaluated for the presence/absence of CASH and SOS.&#xD;
