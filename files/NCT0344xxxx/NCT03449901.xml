  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently demonstrated that argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1)&#xD;
      expression is silenced in 88% of all sarcomas (n=708), and that this loss is associated with&#xD;
      a decreased overall survival. Using the extracellular arginine depleting enzyme PEGylated&#xD;
      arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20), an extracellular arginine depleting enzyme, the investigators&#xD;
      demonstrated ADI-PEG20 induces a prosurvival metabolic reprogramming in ASS1-deficient&#xD;
      sarcomas that redirects glucose into the serine/folate pathway directing the carbons from&#xD;
      glucose into pyrimidine biosynthesis, thus sensitizing cells to death by the pyrimidine&#xD;
      antimetabolite gemcitabine by using metabolomics. The synthetic lethality was increased by&#xD;
      the addition of docetaxel. Therefore a phase II clinical trial of ADI with gemcitabine and&#xD;
      docetaxel, a standard second line therapy for soft tissue sarcoma will be conducted to&#xD;
      determine if the clinical benefit rate of gemcitabine and docetaxel is improved by the&#xD;
      metabolic changes induced by ADI-PEG20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently published data shows that priming ASS1-deficient tumors with ADI-PEG 20 and&#xD;
      docetaxel improves the effect of gemcitabine. Therefore, a cohort of patients consisting of&#xD;
      ten patients diagnosed with either osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma (ideally five of each),&#xD;
      and five patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer will be included as an exploratory&#xD;
      cohort. Enrollment to Cohort 2 will occur concurrently with Cohort 1.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A history of other high grade malignancy ≤ 5 years previous. Exceptions include basal&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known brain metastases. Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial (except for patients with SCLC, see below) because of their poor&#xD;
             prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would&#xD;
             confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Patients with SCLC are&#xD;
             allowed to enroll with brain metastases provided they are stable and they are at least&#xD;
             3 months post-treatment for brain metastases.&#xD;

             used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of seizure disorder not related to underlying cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential&#xD;
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with the study treatment. In addition, these patients&#xD;
             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive&#xD;
             therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
