  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is the most common health problem that affects work performance and quality of&#xD;
      life. Non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) is defined as low back pain not attributable to a&#xD;
      recognizable, known specific pathology. NSLBP is the leading cause of disability among the&#xD;
      major musculoskeletal conditions which leads to Impairments, Activity Limitations and&#xD;
      participation restrictions. Therefore it becomes a psychosocial/economic burden on&#xD;
      individuals, families, communities, industries and government. Existing literature shows&#xD;
      globally 40% to 50% of people have LBP at some point in their lives and there exists a&#xD;
      challenge in Africa on the best rehabilitation methods for low back pain management which&#xD;
      could prevent chronic pain and disability. Therefore, this study aims to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of MET when combined with DSE in the management of chronic NSLBP patients and&#xD;
      to analyze the additional effect the MET procedure will provide relative to DSE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is arguably the most prevalent musculoskeletal condition found among both&#xD;
      developed and developing nations. Broadly defined as pain or discomfort in the lumbar region&#xD;
      of the spine it is the leading cause of activity limitations, resulting in significant losses&#xD;
      in productivity at work and incurs billions of dollars in medical expenditure annually. The&#xD;
      prevalence of LBP worldwide is estimated to be between 30 and 80% among the general&#xD;
      population and has been found to increase with age. In addition, a higher prevalence of LBP&#xD;
      has been associated with lower socioeconomic status and lower education levels. According to&#xD;
      the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study, LBP is currently the 6th highest burden on a&#xD;
      list of 291 conditions and is the cause of more years lived with disability globally than any&#xD;
      other disease. Affecting just about anyone, of any gender, race or socioeconomic background,&#xD;
      LBP has a substantial impact on the overall and financial well-being of an individual and&#xD;
      society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it was postulated that the burden of LBP would be greater in lower and&#xD;
      middle-income countries like those situated in Africa. A recent systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis published in 2018 revealed that the lifetime, annual and point prevalence of&#xD;
      LBP among African nations, was higher than the global LBP prevalence. The majority of the&#xD;
      studies included in this meta-analysis were conducted in Nigeria, which is a&#xD;
      lower-middle-income country. In Nigeria, the annual prevalence rate of LBP has been reported&#xD;
      between 33% and 74%, mostly affecting workers. The prognosis after an acute episode of LBP is&#xD;
      less favourable than once thought, as 60-80% of the patients will experience recurrence or&#xD;
      persistence of this disabling condition.12 Despite the high incidence and prevalence of LBP,&#xD;
      little is known about the precise causes. As a clear pathoanatomic diagnosis cannot be&#xD;
      identified in 85% of the patients,13 LBP in these patients is labelled as non-specific&#xD;
      (NSLBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite extensive research, the issue of spinal pain management still constitutes a challenge&#xD;
      for physicians, physiotherapists, and researchers. There are many therapies claimed to be&#xD;
      useful for the treatment of NSLBP, but most of these treatments have not been well&#xD;
      investigated or have been found to have modest effects in terms of pain relief and improving&#xD;
      disability. Conservative treatment remains the best choice and usually involves&#xD;
      physiotherapy. Exercise therapy is one of the most used treatment strategies as it has shown&#xD;
      to be effective in decreasing pain and disability, and can even induce functional changes of&#xD;
      the back muscles. Although, exercise therapy in highly recommend by experts in treatment&#xD;
      guidelines, the evidenced treatment effects remain low to moderate. It is, therefore, useful&#xD;
      to further explore the effectiveness of treatments that may assist people with NSLBP.&#xD;
      Another, non-invasive, safe and inexpensive treatment technique used by physiotherapists,&#xD;
      osteopaths, chiropractors and manual therapists in the treatment of NSLBP is Muscle Energy&#xD;
      Technique (MET). MET involves alternating periods of resisted muscle contractions and&#xD;
      assisted stretching. Although it has been suggested that MET can be used to lengthen a&#xD;
      shortened muscle, mobilize an articulation with restricted mobility, strengthen a&#xD;
      physiologically weakened muscle and reduce localized oedema and passive congestion, the&#xD;
      physiological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MET are currently unclear.&#xD;
      Mechanisms of altered proprioception, motor programming and control have been proposed, but&#xD;
      research is required to confirm these hypotheses. While MET is often used for the treatment&#xD;
      of NSLBP, a recent Cochrane review concluded that there is lack of empirical evidence on its&#xD;
      effectiveness in the management of chronic NSLBP. These conclusions were made not because of&#xD;
      the lack of treatment effectiveness, but because the currently available studies have been&#xD;
      generally performed in too small study samples and have a high risk of bias, producing&#xD;
      unreliable answers about this therapy. In conclusion, the Cochrane review emphasized the need&#xD;
      for larger, high-quality studies to determine the effectiveness and safety of MET in chronic&#xD;
      NSLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aims of this study are to determine the effectiveness of MET when combined&#xD;
      with DSE in the management of chronic NSLBP patients and to analyze the additional effect the&#xD;
      MET procedure will provide relative to DSE. Thus, the efficacy of the combination of MET plus&#xD;
      DSE will be compared with outcomes of treatment with DSE or standard physiotherapy (SP) in&#xD;
      the management of chronic NSLBP. The study will evaluate the effect of each intervention on&#xD;
      trunk Range of Motion (ROM), muscle functions (limited to muscles strength, endurance, force&#xD;
      and Maximal voluntary contraction [MVC]), Quality of Life (QoL), functional disability,&#xD;
      activity limitations and participation restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of MET in combination with DSE on&#xD;
      quality of life and trunk muscles functions in patients with chronic NSLBP, however, the&#xD;
      study involves the following as general goal that needs to be realized;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a systematic review (scoping) of the literature on the effectiveness of MET&#xD;
           in the management NSLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To cross-culturally adapt and psychometrically validate the Nigerian Hausa Version of&#xD;
           Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To conduct an online survey to determine the knowledge and skills of Nigerian&#xD;
           physiotherapist on the application of MET in the management of NSLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the working mechanism of MET on the trunk muscle function by studying&#xD;
           several muscular properties (recruitment, endurance, fatigability, flexibility) in&#xD;
           chronic NSLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) to determine the short-term (6 weeks, 12&#xD;
           weeks) and long term (3 months) effectiveness of MET in combination with DSE on back&#xD;
           muscles function and on clinical outcomes of functionality (such as disability, quality&#xD;
           of life, and activity and participation restrictions) in patients with chronic NSLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the RCT component of this research has the following objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effectiveness of MET in combination with DSE in the management of&#xD;
           chronic NSLBP patients by assessing their influencing on trunk muscles functions limited&#xD;
           to trunk muscles endurance, Transverses abdominus muscles contraction rate, trunk ROM,&#xD;
           QoL, functional disability, global rating of change scale (GROCS), activity limitations&#xD;
           and participation restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the additional effect of MET relative to DSE on the study outcomes in the&#xD;
           management of chronic NSLBP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the therapeutic effect of MET plus DSE with outcomes of treatment with DSE or&#xD;
           standard physiotherapy (SP) in the management of chronic NSLBP&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess all outcomes at baseline, 6th week and 12th week of the study interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To also conduct a 3 months follow-up evaluation on outcomes to determine if the&#xD;
           intervention effect is retained within the period. The ultimate goal is to provide&#xD;
           recommendations (based on the study findings) for the implementation and use of MET in&#xD;
           the Nigerian Health Care System for the management of chronic NSLBP.&#xD;
