    <textblock>
      Rationale Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) is known to be a moderate painful procedure.&#xD;
      There are many ways to manage postoperative pain following this kind of surgery. One of the&#xD;
      'golden standards' nowadays is epidural analgesia using Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia&#xD;
      (PCEA). Patient Controlled Intravenous Analgesia (PCIA) is also an option, as are several&#xD;
      kinds of regional anesthesia. One of the most recent described regional blocks is the&#xD;
      Serratus Anterior Plane block (SAP), also called Serratus Intercostal Plane (SIP) block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and opioid sparing effect&#xD;
      of a SIP block in postoperative pain relief after VATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses Patients receiving a SIP block prior to surgery need less opioids during and 24h&#xD;
      after VATS compared with patients who didn't receive a SIP block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Single center randomized controlled trial Study population Patients older than&#xD;
      18 years old scheduled for VATS. Main study parameters/endpoints The primary endpoint is the&#xD;
      opioid use during the first 24 hours after start of surgery. Secondary endpoints are the VAS&#xD;
      score on day 0 and day 1 after surgery, and the prevalence of postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting (PONV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness In the intra-operative period, patients will not experience discomfort from&#xD;
      either strategy because of general anesthesia. If the hypothesis proves to be true, patients&#xD;
      with SIP block could benefit from a lower amount of received opioids, which could give less&#xD;
      chance of opioid associated adverse effects. There won't be any additional blood sampling&#xD;
      related to this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized controlled trial aims at comparing the opioid use per- and&#xD;
      postoperatively in patients with versus without SIP block undergoing VATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that use of a SIP block results in less opioid use during and the first 24&#xD;
      hours after VATS as compared with patients without SIP block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single center randomized controlled trial on patients undergoing VATS under general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to recruit patients scheduled for elective VATS in our hospital during a period of&#xD;
      3 months. Surgical patients will be screened twice a week, because there are two days a week&#xD;
      that VATS procedures take place in our hospital. We will randomize 20 patients, based on the&#xD;
      power analysis (cfr infra).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Patients scheduled for VATS under general anesthesia Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &lt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urgent surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy to sufentanil or ropivacain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative need for invasive ventilation within 24hours after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was based on our primary hypothesis and primary study outcome, and&#xD;
      was informed by data collected in patients who underwent VATS procedures in our hospital&#xD;
      during the previous six months. These calculations indicate that 14 patients need to be&#xD;
      included, assuming a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, to detect the expected&#xD;
      difference in per- and postoperative opioid use between the SIP-group and the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameter/endpoint: Opioid use during the first 24 hours after end of surgery&#xD;
      Secondary study parameters/endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS score on day 0 and day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical patients in our hospital will be considered eligible if they fulfill the entry&#xD;
      criteria. Eligible patients will be screened, their demographic data recorded (registry: age,&#xD;
      gender, type of surgery) and those without exclusion criteria will be randomized. In total,&#xD;
      20 patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Consent All patients or legal guardians must provide written informed consent&#xD;
      according to local regulations before inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed using a sealed envelope system. Randomization arms Before&#xD;
      surgery patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to a placebo SIP block or to a real SIP block.&#xD;
      All investigators involved intra- and postoperative are blinded. An independent anesthesia&#xD;
      nurse not involved peri-operatively is asked to prepare the drugs in a different location&#xD;
      according to the info kept in a sealed envelope. This envelope remains sealed in the patient&#xD;
      files to be broken if an adverse event happens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of anesthesia and before surgery, each patient will receive an injection in&#xD;
      between the serratus anterior and the intercostal muscle. The injection will be localized in&#xD;
      the midaxillary line, between the 4th and 5th rib. The intervention group will receive a&#xD;
      total amount of 60cc which consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3mg/kg Ropivacain 1%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1mcg/kg dexmedetomidine (Dexdor速) (ampul with 2 ml contains 100mcg/ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Addition of NaCl 0.9% up to 60ml The control group will receive an injection of 60cc&#xD;
           NaCl 0.9% at the same injection site of the SIP block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive 5-15mcg sufentanil (Sufenta速) before induction of anesthesia,&#xD;
      depending on the personal choice of the anesthesiologist. To induce anesthesia, patients will&#xD;
      receive 2mg/kg propofol 1% (Propofol速), and if not sufficient, a supplemental bolus will be&#xD;
      given. To receive adequate neuromuscular blockage, at least 0.6mg/kg rocuroniumbromide 1%&#xD;
      (Esmeron速) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting from insicion, depending on the personal choice of the performing anesthesiologist&#xD;
      or based on ANI monitoring, a supplemental bolus sufentanil will be given if considered&#xD;
      necessary. Routine intra-operative monitoring should include noninvasive blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements, pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide fraction and electrocardiography.&#xD;
      Every patient should receive at least one peripheral venous line to allow adequate fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation during the study period. Nasogastric tubes, urinary bladder catheters and/or&#xD;
      other intravenous catheters, as well as other, more invasive monitoring may be used according&#xD;
      to local practice and/or guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive a PCIA pump with sufentanyl and the dose requested and given is measured&#xD;
      for the first and the second day. Patients receive paracetamol 1 gram every 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative variables will be collected at the pre-anesthetic visit or before induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative variables will be collected after induction of anesthesia and during surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative variables will be collected with a patient questionnaire and clinical&#xD;
      examination, both on day 0 en 1 after surgery. Following variables will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics will be compared and described by appropriate statistics. The&#xD;
      analysis will be performed with STATA or SPSS.&#xD;
