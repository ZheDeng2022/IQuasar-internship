    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators examine whether emotional and social reward from alcohol&#xD;
      varies depending on the social context of consumption.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: Although the vast majority of alcohol consumption outside the laboratory occurs in&#xD;
      social context, experimental studies of alcohol's emotionally reinforcing effects have&#xD;
      overwhelmingly examined individuals drinking in isolation. The current study examines&#xD;
      motivationally salient elements of everyday social drinking contexts as moderators of&#xD;
      alcohol-related reinforcement. More specifically, the present study examine whether alcohol&#xD;
      is more reinforcing within the context of unfamiliar vs. familiar social interaction and,&#xD;
      further, whether alcohol is more reinforcing within the context of low vs. high quality&#xD;
      social relationships. The current study furthermore examine whether individuals with&#xD;
      characteristics that put them at risk for developing an alcohol use disorder (e.g., male&#xD;
      gender, impulsive/extraverted personality profile, heavy patterns of consumption, family&#xD;
      history of AUD, ...) exhibit heightened emotional reinforcement from alcohol within these&#xD;
      social drinking contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project represents a test of competing theories of alcohol reinforcement. Alcohol&#xD;
      myopia theory-which has heretofore represented the most prominent theory of alcohol's&#xD;
      effects-predicts that alcohol's ability to relieve stress depends on the nature (positive or&#xD;
      negative) of stimuli in the drinker's immediate environment. Alcohol myopia theory might thus&#xD;
      predict that alcohol's rewarding effects will be larger within familiar interactions and&#xD;
      within secure relationships. In contrast, the social attributional theory of alcohol&#xD;
      reinforcement predicts that alcohol-related reinforcement will be most pronounced within the&#xD;
      context of unfamiliar social interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to providing an opportunity to test contextual and individual-level moderators of&#xD;
      alcohol reinforcement, the current study represents an opportunity to directly test the&#xD;
      replicability of research indicating a pronounced reinforcing effect of alcohol specifically&#xD;
      within interactions among unfamiliar individuals (Sayette et al., 2012; Fairbairn et al.,&#xD;
      2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Participants will consist of 600 male and female drinkers, aged 21-30, with&#xD;
      no reported history of severe alcohol use disorder. Participants will be sampled such that at&#xD;
      least 360 of these participants will classify as heavy drinkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: In the laboratory arm of the study, individuals will be randomly assigned to consume&#xD;
      either a moderate dose of alcohol or a control beverage in the company of either familiar or&#xD;
      unfamiliar individuals. Of these individuals, a subset will also participate in an ambulatory&#xD;
      assessment period over the course of several weeks to examine the interaction of alcohol and&#xD;
      social contextual factors in daily life. In the ambulatory study arm, participants will wear&#xD;
      transdermal sensors to assess BAC and will further provide information about their mood and&#xD;
      their social contexts in response to random prompts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measures include self-reports of positive and negative mood&#xD;
      and perceived social reinforcement. The investigators will also examine facial expressions&#xD;
      using the Facial Action Coding System, a comprehensive, anatomically-based system for&#xD;
      categorizing facial muscle movement. One aim of the current study is to examine whether&#xD;
      differential reinforcement from alcohol in unfamiliar social contexts emerges only with&#xD;
      respect to self-reports, or is also observable within facial behaviors.&#xD;
