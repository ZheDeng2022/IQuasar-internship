        The study population will include pregnant women within the US who were immunized with&#xD;
        Afluria as part of routine care at any time during pregnancy. Eligible pregnant women may&#xD;
        self-enroll or voluntarily be enrolled by their HCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women under 18 can be included in the study as long as parental consent can be obtained,&#xD;
        according to IRB requirements and local laws and regulations.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Sufficient information to determine whether it concerns a prospectively enrolled&#xD;
             subject, since retrospective cases are ineligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reporter (e.g. HCP) contact information to allow for follow-up&#xD;
