  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood transfusion is very lengthy procedure and consumes a substantial time from patients and&#xD;
      health care providers. On average, it may take most if not all the working day which leads to&#xD;
      significant constrains on hospital bed utilization. It starts from pre-transfusion testing,&#xD;
      clinical assessment, actual administration of blood and post-transfusion care. The main bulk&#xD;
      of this procedure is usually related to administration of the blood which typically given&#xD;
      over 3 hours (5ml/kg/hour), although there is no strong evidence to support that. Indeed, it&#xD;
      has been accepted as standard of care to transfuse blood over short time as in emergency&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated blood transfusion rate that can be safely delivered in&#xD;
      patient who required blood transfusion i.e. transfusing blood over short time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I, open label, nonrandomized, prospective and rate-finding study. A&#xD;
      well-known dose escalation design called 3+3 design will be used to identify the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated rate. To assure the safety of such procedure, blood transfusion rate will be&#xD;
      escalated very slowly by 1 ml/kg/hour for each cohort until rate-limiting toxicities or&#xD;
      maximum of 10ml/kg/hour.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Blood transfusion is the mainstay of care for patients with different types of chronic severe&#xD;
      anemia like thalassemia major. However, it is associated with serious risks and&#xD;
      complications. In addition, blood transfusion is a lengthy procedure starting from&#xD;
      pre-transfusion testing, clinical assessment, actual administration of blood and&#xD;
      post-transfusion care. The main bulk of this procedure is usually related to administration&#xD;
      of the blood which typically given over 3 hours (5ml/kg/hour) or even longer in certain&#xD;
      cases. On average, such procedure may take most if not all the working day which leads to&#xD;
      significant constrains on hospital bed utilization. Also, it is a significant burden on the&#xD;
      patient and his/her family to comply with chronic transfusion program. As consequences, this&#xD;
      leads to repeated absences from work or school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, it is the standard of care to infuse blood at rate of 5ml/kg/hour, there is no&#xD;
      strong evidence to support that especially in pediatric population. Indeed, it has been&#xD;
      accepted as standard of care to transfuse blood over short time in certain cases. For&#xD;
      instance, in an emergency situation, it is allowable to infuse blood over less than one hour.&#xD;
      Infusion of stem cells is allowed to be given over one hour as well without a major adverse&#xD;
      event. In addition, blood donation is usually done over 30 - 60 minutes. As such, the goal&#xD;
      for conducting this study is to find out if we can transfuse blood over the short time&#xD;
      without causing any harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO) is one of the complications of blood&#xD;
      transfusion and known to occur more in adult patients with specific risk factors. TACO is&#xD;
      very rare phenomenon in pediatric patients with normal underlying cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      functions. In Literature review in pediatrics there was only one case report and that patient&#xD;
      had a significant other co-morbidities and risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, there will be many safety measures taking in our consideration starting by very&#xD;
      selective criteria to roll the patients in the study with clear inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      points. Blood transfusion rate determine during the study and will be escalated by 1ml/kg per&#xD;
      each cohort only and before starting the blood transfusion vital signs will be taken then 15&#xD;
      minutes after blood transfusion running and by the end of the procedure so there will be 3&#xD;
      times documented vital signs and for more safety issue the patients will be attached to&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary monitoring during the whole procedure. Our patients will have ECHO pre-and&#xD;
      post-transfusion to detect right ventricle load. Patients will have Brain natriuretic peptide&#xD;
      (BNP) level will be done before and after finishing of blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then at the end, 24 hours post transfusion evaluation will be done for all patients in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

Rate escalation by 1ml/kg/each cohort until dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) or max of 10ml/kg/hr. If no DLTs new cohort enrolled at the next planned rate. If DLTs seen in 1 patient in the cohort, another 3 patients treated with the same dose level.1ry phase I end point is maximum-tolerated rate (MTR) of blood transfusion that can be infused safely ( max rate at which 1 or fewer of 3 patients experienced DLT) or dose of 10ml/kg/hr. DLT is transfusion related adverse event lead to stop of transfusion. MTR is highest dose at which no more than 1of 6 patients experienced a DLT.15 additional patients enrolled at MTR to confirm safety.</description>
