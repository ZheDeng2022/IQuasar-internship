  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an entity of complex etiology where environmental, genetic and&#xD;
      intestinal microflora-related factors trigger and perpetuate a chronic inflammation of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. It is suspected that an alteration in primary intestinal microbial&#xD;
      colonization (dysbiosis) could trigger, or at least contribute to, said oversized immune&#xD;
      response. The hypothesis is that the administration of a series of fibers, could improve the&#xD;
      bacterial diversity and repair the dysbiosis that has been seen in patients affected by&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis, improving the clinical evolution of it. The primary objective of the&#xD;
      present study is to know the impact on the microbiota of patients with UC in remission&#xD;
      derived from the administration of dietary fibers. The RETOS study is a pilot project in&#xD;
      which a population of patients with UC is tested for the effect on the composition of the&#xD;
      microbiota that would have the administration of various combinations of fibers, in addition&#xD;
      to the tolerability and acceptance by the patient. The clinical applicability derived from&#xD;
      this intervention would be to improve the diversity of intestinal flora of patients with&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis.&#xD;

      The Phase 1 study is a pilot project in which a population of patients with UC is tested for&#xD;
      the effect on the composition of the microbiota that would have the administration of various&#xD;
      combinations of fibers, in addition to the tolerability and acceptance by the patient. The&#xD;
      study will include two groups of 20 patients each. One of the groups will receive 6 grams of&#xD;
      fiber a day in a single shot with the main meal (group 1) and the other group will receive 12&#xD;
      grams of fiber a day divided into two meals with the main meals (group 2). Two different&#xD;
      combinations of fibers (formula A and B) will be tested with the following administration&#xD;
      pattern for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the administration pattern Week 1: Formula A Week 2: Formula A Week 3: Formula&#xD;
      B Week 4: Formula B&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second sequential cycle similar to the first one (4 weeks with the same administration&#xD;
      pattern) will be repeated in order to confirm the reproducibility of the findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two formulas contain fibers known and commonly used in human nutrition, which were&#xD;
      previously tested in in vitro models with human faeces and their ability to promote the&#xD;
      growth of butyrate-producing bacterial species that are deficient in patients with colitis&#xD;
      was proven ulcerative (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia hominis). The fibers are&#xD;
      presented in aluminum envelopes to dissolve in a glass of water, juice, infusion or cold&#xD;
      cream (max 37 ° C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, formulas A and B for group 1 (a single intake per day) include the mixture of&#xD;
      probiotics i3.1 in quantity per envelope of 3e + 9 colony-forming units, which contains:&#xD;
      Pediococcus acidilactici CECT 7483, Lactobacillus plantarum CECT 7484 and Lactobacillus&#xD;
      plantarum CECT 7485 in a 1: 1: 1 ratio. Formulas A and B for group 2 (two intakes per day)&#xD;
      include the probiotic i3.1 in quantity per envelope of 1.5e + 09 colony-forming units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the two groups, the first week the patients will receive half of the dose with the aim of&#xD;
      facilitating the adaptation in those people who usually do not consume fiber. The usual diet,&#xD;
      tolerability and patient satisfaction will be controlled through biweekly predefined&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
