      Prospective multi-center surveillance study on the prevalence of azole-resistant Aspergillus&#xD;
      spp. in clinical isolates of patients with pulmonary colonization or invasive infections in&#xD;
      Switzerland&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Azole-resistance in Aspergillus (A.) fumigatus has emerged as a global health problem. Even&#xD;
      more, it has been associated with high mortality rates in patients with invasive&#xD;
      aspergillosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, two routes of resistance development are distinguished either in patients with&#xD;
      chronic pulmonary aspergillosis under long-term azole therapy or in agriculture by the use of&#xD;
      azoles as fungicides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary mechanisms of resistance that have been described in clinical strains include&#xD;
      different point mutations in the cyp51A gene, which encodes the enzyme responsible for&#xD;
      converting lanosterol to ergosterol via demethylation. Some resistant isolates also contain a&#xD;
      tandem repeat in the promoter region of this gene that causes increased expression. These&#xD;
      mutations, including TR34/L98H and TR46/Y121F/T289A have been identified in the environment&#xD;
      and have been demonstrated to cause resistance to azole fungicides used in agriculture. These&#xD;
      mutations were also recently identified in haematological patients suffering from invasive&#xD;
      aspergillosis and were associated with a mortality rate of 88%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on the frequency of azole resistance in Aspergillus culture collections report the&#xD;
      first resistant isolates up to 20 years earlier than clinical and environmental studies.&#xD;
      Since then, microbiological resistance to azoles and clinical failures associated with this&#xD;
      resistance have been reported in several countries in Europe and elsewhere. The United&#xD;
      Kingdom and the Netherlands have reported increases in azole-resistant A. fumigatus. In the&#xD;
      United Kingdom, a statistically significant increase in azole resistance was noted between&#xD;
      2004 and 2009, with rates of 5 to 7% in 2004 to 2006 increasing to up to 20% in 2009. These&#xD;
      isolates were collected primarily in patients who received long-term azole therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. The observation has increased the awareness of&#xD;
      azole resistance in this patient population. Surveillance studies and case series over the&#xD;
      last years suggest the global presence of azole resistance in A. fumigatus, including in&#xD;
      Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Australia and, most recently, North and South America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, some cryptic species of Aspergillus section Fumigati (e.g. A. lentulus, A.&#xD;
      udagawae), which cannot be reliably distinguished from A. fumigatus by standard diagnostic&#xD;
      methods, account for 3-5% of all A. fumigatus sensu lato clinical isolates and exhibit some&#xD;
      level of intrinsic azole resistance. The proportion of these cryptic species in other&#xD;
      Aspergillus sections (e.g. Flavi, Nigri, Terrei) is relatively unexplored. In addition, some&#xD;
      rare Aspergillus species with intrinsic azole resistance, such as Aspergillus calidoustus&#xD;
      (section Usti) are emerging as opportunistic pathogens in patients receiving azole&#xD;
      prophylaxis. These cryptic or rare Aspergillus spp. are often misidentified because of the&#xD;
      lack of discrimination by standard microbiological methods. Thus, their actual clinical&#xD;
      relevance is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Switzerland, comprehensive data on azole resistance in A. fumigatus are lacking. The major&#xD;
      reason for this is the lack of routine testing of in vitro susceptibility of A. fumigatus&#xD;
      isolates in most microbiology laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fungal Infections Network of Switzerland (FUNGINOS) offers an optimal platform to&#xD;
      comprehensively assess the epidemiology of azole-resistance in A. fumigates and other&#xD;
      Aspergillus spp. Only recently invasive Candida infections (candidemia) have been&#xD;
      prospectively monitored by FUNGINOS over ten years from 2004 to 2013 in all Swiss University&#xD;
      clinics and 20 University-affiliated hospitals.&#xD;
