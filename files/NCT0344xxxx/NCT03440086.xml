  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence has shown that the onset and intensity of post-operative pain are&#xD;
      significantly related to the amount of residual pneumoperitoneum at the end of the surgical&#xD;
      procedure. In addition, the use of low pressures of carbon dioxide (CO2) for induction of the&#xD;
      pnemoperitoneum has been associated with a reduction in post-operative pain, probably due to&#xD;
      a lower abdominal distension and a consequent reduced compression of the pelvic, abdominal&#xD;
      and sub-diaphragmatic pain nerve fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reduction of the residual pnemoperitoneum at the end of the surgical procedure could&#xD;
      therefore play a key role in the reduction of post-operative pain, with consequent greater&#xD;
      comfort for the patient and reduction of the use of analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the available evidence, the aim of the present study is to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      application of Jackson-Pratt drain, for one hour from the end of the surgical procedure, can&#xD;
      significantly reduce post-operative pain and the need of analgesics in patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic gynecological surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopy in gynecological surgery offers numerous advantages, such as the reduction of&#xD;
      operative time, intra-operative blood loss, post-operative pain and the possibility of early&#xD;
      hospital discharge and return to normal daily activities in a short time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these points arewidely validated in the literature, sometimes patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopy complain of abdominal pains (although slight in intensity and temporary) in the&#xD;
      post-operative period. In some cases, the pain is characteristically irradiated at the&#xD;
      shoulders, due to a probable irritation/compression of the phrenic nerve that runs on the&#xD;
      lower surface of the diaphragm.&#xD;
