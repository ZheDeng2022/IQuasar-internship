  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective response</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants achieving a best objective response of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, by up to 24 weeks after all participants have completed response assessment. Response assessment will be as determined by investigator. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in the short axis to &lt;10 millimeters (mm). PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the first dose date to the date of disease progression (PD) or date of death (whichever occurs first). PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with any treatment-emergent (TE) serious adverse event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life threatening (ie, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a participant who was exposed to the study drug). A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (Baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with any TE non-serious adverse event</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (Baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in scores on the Lansky Play-Performance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Lansky Play-Performance Scale can be used to rate a child's activity level. Parents will be asked to rate their child's activity level over the past week. Scores on the Lansky Play-Performance Scale range from 0 (unresponsive) to 100 (fully active, normal).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Karnofsky Performance Status Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Karnofsky Performance scale allows physicians to classify participants based on functional impairment. Physicians will assign a performance score for participants, ranging from 0 (dead) to 100 (normal, no complaints).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From day of first documentation of PR or CR to the day of disease progression or death (up to 36 months)</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from the first date of documented PR or CR to the date of disease progression or date of death (whichever occurs first). CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in the short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

&#xD;
               -  Participants with congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias, or QTc &gt;480&#xD;
                  millisecond (msec) on at least 2 separate electrocardiograms (ECGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has CNS Disease: Participants with brain or subdural metastases are not eligible&#xD;
                  unless the metastases are asymptomatic and do not require treatment or have been&#xD;
                  adequately treated by local therapy (eg, surgery or radiotherapy) and have&#xD;
                  discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to study drug administration. Confirmation of radiographic stability must&#xD;
                  be done by comparing the brain scan (CT or MRI) performed during the Screening&#xD;
                  Period, using the same imaging modality, to a brain scan performed earlier (and&#xD;
                  following local therapy where applicable). Participants must be clinically&#xD;
                  stable. It is not the intention of this protocol to treat participants with&#xD;
                  active brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: CNS imaging is required to confirm eligibility for participants with a known history&#xD;
        of CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had or are planning to have the following invasive procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to&#xD;
                  study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Laparoscopic procedure or open biopsy within 7 days prior to study drug&#xD;
                  administration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Central line placement or subcutaneous port placement is not considered major&#xD;
                  surgery but must be placed at least 2 days prior to study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Core biopsy, including bone marrow biopsy, within 2 days prior to study drug&#xD;
                  administration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fine needle aspirate within 3 days prior to study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has any serious concomitant illness that in the opinion of the investigator(s) could&#xD;
             affect the participant's safety or interfere with the study assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); due to lack of available&#xD;
             safety data for eribulin therapy in HIV-infected participants&#xD;
