  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, non-randomized study of RiMO-301 with&#xD;
      radiation in patients with advanced tumors. A single escalation dose of RiMO-301 is&#xD;
      intratumorally injected in a 3 + 3 study design to identify the recommended dose and dosing&#xD;
      volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition or Disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with advanced tumor which is clinically accessible for intratumoral injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention/Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug - RiMO-301&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation - Radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RiMO-301 as&#xD;
      determined by toxicity observed in patients treated with palliative radiation doses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine clinical response after RiMO-301 and radiotherapy as assessed by clinical&#xD;
           response rate using clinical evaluation, imaging and/or symptom relief&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize adverse events of RiMO-301 in patients with advanced cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of RiMO-301 with radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population is patients with clinically accessible lesions for intratumoral&#xD;
      injection. Up to 3 dose levels (5%, 10%, and 15% of the total baseline tumor volume,&#xD;
      respectively) will be tested in a 3 + 3 dose escalation study design. MTD will be defined as&#xD;
      the dose associated with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in less than or equal to 33% of&#xD;
      patients at the dose level tested. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the&#xD;
      following events occurring from the intratumor injection of RiMO-301 to 30 days after the&#xD;
      completion of radiation treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 4 or greater treatment related hematologic or dermatologic toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade 3 or greater treatment related non-hematologic, non-dermatologic toxicity&#xD;
           (excluding nausea, vomiting or diarrhea without maximal medical intervention)&#xD;
