  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of epithelium-on corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) in&#xD;
      impeding the progression of, and/or reducing corneal curvature (Kmax) in eyes with&#xD;
      progressive keratoconus. Epithelium-on CXL uses a formulation that allows the riboflavin to&#xD;
      penetrate the cornea without the need to remove the epithelium, the outer most layer of the&#xD;
      cornea.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 275 study eyes with progressive keratoconus will be enrolled. Study eyes will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive CXL treatment or sham/control treatment.The primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint is a difference of ≥ 1 diopter between treatment groups in the mean change&#xD;
      in Kmax from baseline to Month 6.&#xD;

                  manifest refraction or as evaluated by comparing eyeglass or contact lens&#xD;
                  prescriptions to current subjective manifest refraction [NOTE: subjects with a&#xD;
                  clear history of progression but without prior documentation may be screened and&#xD;
                  followed for a period of time to confirm and document progression]&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Eyes classified as either normal, atypical normal, or keratoconus suspect on the&#xD;
             severity grading scheme;&#xD;

          6. Eyes which are aphakic, or eyes which are pseudophakic and do not have a UV blocking&#xD;
             lens implanted;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous ocular condition (other than refractive error) in the eye to be treated that&#xD;
             may predispose the eye for future complications. For example:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of corneal disease (e.g., herpes simplex, herpes zoster keratitis,&#xD;
                  corneal melt, corneal dystrophy, etc.);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically significant corneal scarring in the cross-linking treatment zone that&#xD;
                  is not related to keratoconus or, in the Investigator's opinion, will interfere&#xD;
                  with the cross-linking procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A history of delayed epithelial healing in the eye to be treated or a current&#xD;
             condition that may interfere with or prolong epithelial healing;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with nystagmus or any other condition that would prevent a steady gaze during&#xD;
             the treatment or other diagnostic tests;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A history of previous corneal cross-linking treatment in the eye to be treated;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Have used an investigational drug or device within 30 days of screening or be&#xD;
             concurrently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial within 30 days&#xD;
             of the study.&#xD;
