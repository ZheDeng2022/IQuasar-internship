  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Case management (CM) has been recommended as a way of inspiring measurable changes in&#xD;
      individual behaviors and improving clinical outcomes for patients with chronic diseases.&#xD;
      However, data on its effectiveness for Taiwanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are&#xD;
      limited. This study aimed to determine the long-term effectiveness of CM that focused on&#xD;
      nurses' role among Taiwanese RA patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and&#xD;
      progressive damage of the joints that affects 0.5-1.0% of the population worldwide. It&#xD;
      usually occurs in individuals who are 30 to 50 years-old, and about 20-30% of affected&#xD;
      individuals exhibited some arthritis-attributable work limitations, thereby posing major&#xD;
      burdens to patients, families and social care systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the increasing threat of RA, optimal management of RA may improve clinical&#xD;
      outcome and decrease mortality, thus resulting in reduced hospitalization and medical cost.&#xD;
      Recently, case management (CM) has drawn more attention in medical practice as an approach to&#xD;
      such a high-cost and high-risk chronic disease. European league against rheumatism (EULAR)&#xD;
      further launched that the involvement of CM, which was delivered by the trained nurse, in the&#xD;
      management of chronic inflammatory arthritis to achieve favorable prognosis. Consequently,&#xD;
      there has been increased attention to the influence of CM among arthritis patients.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the corresponding effects still remained conflicting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the studies conducted thus far, the investigators found that the majority of these studies&#xD;
      were conducted in Western populations. Information on whether the CM delivered by the nurses&#xD;
      could influence the clinical outcomes for RA patients in Taiwan was still limited. To narrow&#xD;
      this gap in the literature, the present study aimed to clarify the long-term effectiveness of&#xD;
      CM through NLC for RA patients by using generalized estimating equations (GEEs), with the&#xD;
      intent that the findings could serve as a reference for providing empirically robust grounds&#xD;
      for healthcare providers to formulate some care programs that are culturally appropriate for&#xD;
      Asian RA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design and subjects A quasi-experimental pre-posttest control group design,&#xD;
      with purposive sampling, will be used to recruit participants from the Rheumatologic&#xD;
      department of a hospital in southern Taiwan from July of 2016 to June of 2017. The inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were (i) being at least 20 years old at the time of recruitment (ii) having no&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and severe complications, (iii) being able to express opinions in either&#xD;
      Mandarin or Taiwanese, and (iv) having a diagnosis of RA. To ensure participants' anonymity,&#xD;
      all questionnaires were marked with an encryption code to facilitate data analysis, but with&#xD;
      no personal identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Sample size calculation for this analysis of repeated measures to&#xD;
      detect an effect size of 0.2 at 80% power and a 0.05 significance level indicated that a&#xD;
      sample size of 68 patients is needed (according to G- POWER 3.1 analytical software, Franz&#xD;
      Faul, Universitat Kiel, Germany). A sample of at least 90 participants for both groups&#xD;
      combined was required on the basis of these parameters, allowing for a 30% attrition rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Because continued participation was essential for this study, the participants&#xD;
      were divided into the experiment or control group in accordance with the personal&#xD;
      willingness. The control group received usual health education lasting for about 15 minutes&#xD;
      per medical visit from ward nurses, which consisted of consultation in terms of disease&#xD;
      symptoms, related treatments or the doctor's order. They would receive health education&#xD;
      instruction leaflets for reference purposes if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures A packet of measures was used for data collection, which included the&#xD;
      Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire (TDQ), and Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES), as well&#xD;
      as a questionnaire that requested information on demographic variables and disease&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedure The investigators had obtained the agreement by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of Dalin Tzuchi Hospital prior to the recruitment of participants. Researchers&#xD;
      explained the purpose of study and its procedure to all participants. Signed informed consent&#xD;
      was obtained after the patients understood and agreed to participate in this study.&#xD;
      Thereafter, the investigators applied an observer-blind approach for data collection. A&#xD;
      trained interviewer, who was blind with the study design and participants, was assigned to&#xD;
      collect the participants' information on demographic and disease characteristics. All data&#xD;
      were obtained at three time points: before NLC program (T0), three days after NLC program&#xD;
      (T1), and three months after NLC program (T2). To reduce the dropout rate, the interviewer&#xD;
      helped ask participants to return the hospital for the completion of assessments via phone&#xD;
      reminders. However, participants were still given the option to withdraw from the study at&#xD;
      any time without any penalty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with the study aims and the nature of the variables. Descriptive parameters,&#xD;
      including mean, standard deviation (SD), and percentage, were used to describe the&#xD;
      distributions of demographic and disease data. Differences between the two groups were&#xD;
      compared initially using t-test and Ï‡2 test as appropriate. For inferential analysis,&#xD;
      generalized estimating equation (GEE) procedure with identity link function with normal&#xD;
      distribution was used to assess the long-term effects of NLC, while taking into account&#xD;
      within-subject correlations between measurements over time and the influence of potential&#xD;
      confounding covariates. All analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software.&#xD;
