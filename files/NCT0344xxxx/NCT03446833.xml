        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Preoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has the ability to understand and provide written informed consent for&#xD;
             participation in the study prior to the study-related procedures being conducted&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject with levodopa-responsive PD of at least 4 years' duration, with symptoms not&#xD;
             adequately controlled with medication, including individuals with motor complications&#xD;
             of recent onset (from 4 months to 3 years) or with motor complications of&#xD;
             longer-standing duration, and who are eligible for bilateral STN DBS surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is ≥ 22 years of age at time of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is a male or non-pregnant female. If female of child-bearing potential, and if&#xD;
             sexually active, must be using, or agree to use, a medically-acceptable method of&#xD;
             birth control as confirmed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has documented improvement in motor signs ON versus OFF dopaminergic&#xD;
             medication, with a change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III&#xD;
             score of &gt; 30% OFF to ON medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Based on the opinion of the Neurosurgeon, the subject is an acceptable candidate for&#xD;
             implant of a DBS System that includes: bilateral DBS leads targeted to the STN,&#xD;
             extensions, and neurostimulator&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject can read and understand English&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject is willing and able to attend all study-required visits and complete the study&#xD;
             procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject is willing and able to be awake during left and right DBS lead implant surgery&#xD;
             and for intraoperative LFP recordings&#xD;
&#xD;
             Intraoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has tremor dominant PD ≥ 2 at rest in head, upper, or lower extremities as&#xD;
             measured on the UPDRS Part III Question 20&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Based on the opinion of the Neurosurgeon, the subject has a clinically significant&#xD;
             structural abnormality(ies) of the brain that would jeopardize subject safety during&#xD;
             the DBS lead implant, conduct of the study, or confound the subject's assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has a metallic implant in the head, (eg, aneurysm clip, cochlear implant)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has a major comorbidity increasing the risk of surgery (eg, prior stroke,&#xD;
             severe diabetes, severe hypertension, immunocompromised, seizure disorder, active&#xD;
             infection, need for chronic anticoagulation other than aspirin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has a neurocognitive impairment which exceeds the criteria for PD mild&#xD;
             cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) as determined from the center's clinical&#xD;
             neuropsychological evaluation prior to DBS for PD&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject has, or plans to obtain, an implanted electrical stimulation medical device&#xD;
             anywhere in the body (eg, cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, spinal cord stimulator)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has, or plans to obtain, an implanted medication pump (eg, DUOPATM infusion&#xD;
             pump) and/or portable infusion pump&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Based on the opinion of the investigator, the subject has an abnormal neurological&#xD;
             examination that would preclude them from study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject is breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject has Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 (DRS-2) score ≤ 130&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject has Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) &gt; 25&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject is currently participating, or plans to participate, in another&#xD;
             investigational study unless written approval is provided by the Medtronic study team&#xD;
