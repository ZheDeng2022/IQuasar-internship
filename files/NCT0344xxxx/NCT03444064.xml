    <textblock>
      Islet transplantation is a relatively new procedure used in people with difficult to control&#xD;
      Type 1 diabetes. Patients who receive an islet transplant take medication that suppresses&#xD;
      their immune system and prevent rejection of the islet tissue. In spite of the strengths of&#xD;
      the current immunosuppression regimen, it has failed to enhance single-donor success rates,&#xD;
      and the majority of patients require 2 or more islet transplants to achieve insulin&#xD;
      independence. The need for life-long, high-dose immunosuppression is also associated with&#xD;
      substantial side effects, and continues to limit application of islet transplantation earlier&#xD;
      in the course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have learned that Regulatory T cells (Tregs), a small subset of cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 4+ (CD4+) T cells, have emerged as the major contributor to self-tolerance&#xD;
      through suppression of activation and effector function of other immune cells. Tregs function&#xD;
      by preventing the initiation of unwanted immune activation and by suppressing ongoing immune&#xD;
      response to limit bystander tissue destruction. It has been suggested that infusion of Tregs&#xD;
      before extensive graft damage may improve long-term graft outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open label, controlled, dose finding pilot study. Up to 18 participants will&#xD;
      be recruited including 12 participants receiving the investigational treatment and 6&#xD;
      participants being assigned to control group. All participants will undergo the routine&#xD;
      Standard of Care islet transplant procedure, and will be maintained on lower dose tacrolimus&#xD;
      and sirolimus immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal is to assess the safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of ex&#xD;
      vivo-selected and ex vivo-expanded autologous PolyTregs in islet transplant patients. The&#xD;
      other goal is to assess the effect of Tregs on beta cell function in islet transplant&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group (6) will receive the current Edmonton islet transplant induction therapy&#xD;
      (Alemtuzumab with Etanercept and Anakinra). The intervention group (up to 12) will receive&#xD;
      islet transplant with same induction therapy as control group and PolyTregs (400-1600&#xD;
      million) six weeks post- transplant and will be followed for 1 year to assess safety and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of Treg therapy. The Treg product will be administered via a peripheral&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) line primed with saline per established standard operating procedures in&#xD;
      approximately 20 to 30 minutes. The intravenous line will be maintained after the infusion&#xD;
      and the participant will be asked to remain in the hospital for 24 hours. All participants&#xD;
      will be maintained on low dose tacrolimus and sirolimus immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also use retrospective data from the islet transplant cohort receiving&#xD;
      Tac/mycophenolate mofetil(MMF) with alemtuzumab (&gt;100 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will be followed up for 58 weeks. Tests and assessments will be&#xD;
      performed at each key study visit and will be allowed for +/- 2 weeks to accommodate&#xD;
      scheduling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measurements will be recorded at each key study visit :&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of&#xD;
      pancreatic beta (β)-cells, resulting in absolute deficiency of insulin. To date, clinical&#xD;
      islet transplantation is an accepted modality to treat select patients who exhibit frequent&#xD;
      hypoglycemic events and severe glycemic liability. The &quot;Edmonton Protocol&quot; became a milestone&#xD;
      by reporting sustained C-peptide production and high rates of insulin-independence after&#xD;
      transplant in patients with T1DM. Due to the challenges associated with allo- and&#xD;
      autoimmunity in islet transplantation, appropriate immunosuppression is necessary to prevent&#xD;
      acute and/or long-term rejection. Current immunosuppression protocols used in Edmonton and&#xD;
      many other international sites for islet transplantation consist of a combination of&#xD;
      induction, anti-inflammatory and maintenance therapy, accounting for higher success rates of&#xD;
      islet transplantation. In spite of the strengths of the current immunosuppression regimen&#xD;
      described above, it has failed to enhance single-donor success rates (15%), with the majority&#xD;
      of patients requiring 2 or more islet transplants to achieve insulin independence. In&#xD;
      Edmonton, clinical trials are designed to improve islet isolation, engraftment and long-term&#xD;
      graft survival. The need for life-long, high-dose immunosuppression is associated with&#xD;
      substantial side effects, and continues to limit application of islet transplantation earlier&#xD;
      in the course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a small subset of CD4+ T cells that depend on the FOXP3&#xD;
      transcription factor for their lineage differentiation and function. Tregs have emerged as&#xD;
      the major contributor to self-tolerance through suppression of activation and effector&#xD;
      function of other immune cells. Tregs function by preventing the initiation of unwanted&#xD;
      immune activation and by suppressing ongoing immune responses to limit bystander tissue&#xD;
      destruction. It has been suggested that infusion of Tregs before extensive graft damage may&#xD;
      improve long-term graft outcomes. Unlike generalized immunosuppressive regimens, Tregs are&#xD;
      long-lived and can function in a dominant and antigen-specific manner. Thus, therapeutic&#xD;
      infusion of Tregs has the potential to induce long-term donor-specific tolerance without&#xD;
      impeding desired immune responses to pathogens and tumors in transplant patients. In terms of&#xD;
      diabetes, both animal and human studies demonstrate the central role of Tregs in preserving&#xD;
      β-cell function. Infusion of Tregs prevents and even reverses diabetes in non-obese diabetic&#xD;
      (NOD) mice. It has been demonstrated in animal studies that infused Tregs migrate to the&#xD;
      allograft site shortly after transplantation and can induce stable islet graft survival&#xD;
      without immunosuppression. Recent human studies report functional defects of Tregs in T1DM,&#xD;
      which appear to be reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is collaboration between Dr. Shapiro's Clinical Islet Transplantation&#xD;
      Program team in Edmonton, Alberta with Drs. Tang and Bluestone's teams at the University of&#xD;
      California San Francisco (UCSF). Drs. Tang and Bluestone have been instrumental in developing&#xD;
      PolyTreg technology, providing an opportunity for this exciting collaboration in a clinical&#xD;
      trial of Treg infusion in islet transplantation. Dr. Tang's team focuses on translating&#xD;
      knowledge on mechanisms of immune tolerance into novel therapeutics for treating autoimmune&#xD;
      diabetes and preventing transplant rejection. They have demonstrated the efficacy of Tregs at&#xD;
      multiple levels to halt tissue destruction in diabetic mouse models by subverting fully&#xD;
      differentiated effector T-cells. Dr. Bluestone's research over the past 25 years has focused&#xD;
      on understanding the basic processes that control T-cell activation and immune tolerance in&#xD;
      autoimmunity and organ transplantation including a special emphasis on Tregs. Dr. Bluestone&#xD;
      has demonstrated that PolyTreg immunotherapy can be safely administered in adult patients&#xD;
      with new onset T1DM. Drs. Tang and Bluestone have abundant experience in Treg isolation and&#xD;
      production and Treg immunotherapy, and bring strong technical and scientific support to this&#xD;
      project. The investigators expect that this collaboration will integrate the strengths of&#xD;
      both Treg immunotherapy and the standard treatment for islet transplant. Hence, this trial is&#xD;
      to investigate the safety and efficacy of Treg infusion incorporated into the current&#xD;
      protocol for islet transplantation, in the hope of finding more effective alternatives to the&#xD;
      current immunosuppression regimen in islet transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on existing pre-clinical and clinical findings, the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      Tregs protect from both auto and allorejection of transplanted islets, thereby improving&#xD;
      insulin independent durability and C-peptide function over time in adults with T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of ex vivo-selected and ex&#xD;
      vivo-expanded autologous polyTregs in islet transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure/Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs of toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infusion reactions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications related to infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess effects on endogenous insulin secretion: Assess the effect of Tregs on b cell&#xD;
      function in islet transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measure/Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-peptide response during MMTTs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin use&#xD;
&#xD;
      HbA1C&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surrogate markers of diabetes immune response: Measure the effect of PolyTregs on the&#xD;
      pathologic autoimmune and allo-immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Outcome Measure/Endpoint Multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) to assess effect on&#xD;
      immune profile (pre- infusion, 1, 2, 4 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months post-infusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autoantibodies and autoreactive T cell using tetramer/or ELISA spot assay (pre-infusion, and&#xD;
      3, 6 and 12 months post infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistence and stability of infused PolyTregs in blood using deuterium labelling (Days 1, 7,&#xD;
      14, 28, 3 months,6 months and 12 months after infusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial design will allow determination of the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the safety of PolyTreg immunotherapy in islet transplantation in Type 1&#xD;
      diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the immunological impact of PolyTreg immunotherapy on patients receiving islet&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy and to establish the optimal dose for PolyTreg immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that PolyTregs will protect/dampen both auto and allo-rejection,&#xD;
      thereby improving insulin independent durability and C-peptide function over time. In this&#xD;
      trial, the investigators propose low level Tac/Sirolimus immunosuppression, the investigators&#xD;
      hope that less early exposure and long-term exposure to high dose tacrolimus will lead to&#xD;
      marked improvement in Beta cell function, less renal dysfunction, less opportunistic&#xD;
      infections, less Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). The long-term goal is to&#xD;
      develop and optimize PolyTreg dosing for a subsequent Phase 2 efficacy/safety randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will undergo a screening evaluation for this study. This will include the&#xD;
      screening for standard of care islet transplant. For women of child bearing potential, the&#xD;
      investigators will ask to confirm they are not pregnant with a blood test. If the patient is&#xD;
      eligible and has consented to take part, he / she will be assigned into either the control&#xD;
      group or treatment group at the investigator's discretion. The only difference between the&#xD;
      two groups will be that the treatment group will receive PolyTregs infusion and the control&#xD;
      group will not receive PolyTregs infusion. The investigators will collect certain details&#xD;
      from his / her medical records, including age, sex, ethnicity and medical information. If the&#xD;
      patient is assigned into the treatment group, a blood sample of 400 mL will be collected for&#xD;
      PolyTregs manufacturing, which will be infused back to the patient at week 6 after islet&#xD;
      transplant. The investigators will enrol two participants in the control group at first and&#xD;
      will proceed with further enrolment for both groups if the procedure appears safe in the&#xD;
      first two patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For treatment group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit 1: Pre-islet transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before initiation of islet transplant induction therapy, a total of 400 ml whole blood will&#xD;
      be collected and immediately transported to the UCSF for PolyTregs manufacturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit 2: Islet transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this visit, participants will undergo islet transplant according to the current standard&#xD;
      procedures at the University of Alberta Hospital. The only difference will be the use of&#xD;
      lower doses of Tacrolimus/Sirolimus for immunosuppression.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible, subjects must be 18-68 years old, and have had T1DM for more than 5 years,&#xD;
        complicated by at least 1 of the following situations that persist despite intensive&#xD;
        insulin management efforts:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Reduced awareness of hypoglycemia, as defined by the absence of adequate autonomic&#xD;
             symptoms at plasma glucose levels &lt; 3.0 mmol/L, indicated by, 1 or more episodes of&#xD;
             severe hypoglycemia requiring third party assistance within 12 months, or a Clarke&#xD;
             score ≥4, or HYPO score ≥1000, or lability index (LI) ≥400 or combined HYPO/LI&#xD;
             &gt;400/&gt;300.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Metabolic instability, characterized by erratic blood glucose levels that interfere&#xD;
             with daily activities and or 1 or more hospital visits for diabetic ketoacidosis over&#xD;
             the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, participants must be capable of understanding the purpose and risks of the&#xD;
        study and must sign a statement of informed consent.&#xD;

             recent myocardial infarction (within past 6 months); (b) left ventricular ejection&#xD;
             fraction &lt;30%; or (c) evidence of ischemia on functional cardiac exam&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active alcohol or substance abuse (must be abstinent for 6 months prior to transplant)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinical history of T1DM diagnosed &gt;age 40, insulin dependent &lt;5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active infection including Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B, HIV, tuberculosis (TB) (subjects&#xD;
             with a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) performed within one year of&#xD;
             enrolment, and no history of adequate chemoprophylaxis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 60mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence or history of macroalbuminuria (&gt;300 mg/g creatinine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Clinical suspicion of nephritic (hematuria, active urinary sediment) or rapidly&#xD;
             progressing renal impairment (e.g. Increase in serum creatinine of 25% within the last&#xD;
             3-6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Baseline Hb &lt; 105g/L (&lt;10.5 g/dL) in women, or &lt; 120 g/L (&lt;12 g/dL) in men&#xD;

             contraceptive measures, or presently breast-feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Previous transplant or evidence of significant sensitization on panel reactive&#xD;
             antibody (PRA) (at the discretion of the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Insulin requirement &gt;1.0 U/kg/day&#xD;
