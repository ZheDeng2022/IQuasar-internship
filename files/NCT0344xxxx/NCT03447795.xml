    <textblock>
      Alveolar bone resorption following tooth extraction is unavoidable. Graft placement following&#xD;
      extraction is recommended when considering restorative procedures afterwards. The extracted&#xD;
      tooth was considered a clinical waste. However, it is now seen as a convenient and available&#xD;
      source for graft material. Different protocols are applied to process the extracted tooth for&#xD;
      obtaining the graft material and investigations are needed to assess the protocol with the&#xD;
      best outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autogenous graft is widely accepted as the gold standard for grafting procedures(Sakkas et&#xD;
      al. 2017). And since the introduction of autogenous dentin graft for alveolar ridge&#xD;
      preservation by Kim et al. clinically (Y.-K. Kim et al. 2010), it has increasingly attracted&#xD;
      attention and teeth are no longer seen only as a waste. Tooth dentin has a chemical&#xD;
      composition similar to that of alveolar bone; the inorganic content is 70%-75%, organic&#xD;
      content 20%, and water content 10%, whereas alveolar bone has proportions of 65%, 25%, and&#xD;
      10% respectively(Y.-K. Kim et al. 2013). The similarity in chemical composition between&#xD;
      dentin and alveolar bone, as well as its content of growth factors such as bone morphogenetic&#xD;
      proteins (BMPs), made the dentin a successful graft for filing alveolar bone defects of same&#xD;
      patient(Y.-K. Kim et al. 2010, Nampo et al. 2010, Y.-K. Kim et al. 2013) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique proposed by Kim et al includes demineralization of the dentin as it reduces&#xD;
      minerals content, exposes collagen fibrils and increases BMPs released thus promoting the&#xD;
      process of osteogenesis(Y.-K. Kim et al. 2010). However, demineralisation step is&#xD;
      time-consuming, taking several days, which challenges same visit application. As a result,&#xD;
      two main approaches have been developed to overcome this obstacle. One approach is to&#xD;
      maintain the demineralization step but with improving the technique to shorten the processing&#xD;
      time(MURATA et al. 2010, E.-S. Kim 2015, Kabir et al. 2015). On the other hand, many&#xD;
      investigators have used the whole tooth without demineralization and reported satisfactory&#xD;
      clinical outcome(Gideon Hallel et al. 2014, Valdec et al. 2017). Hence, more investigations&#xD;
      are needed to evaluate the technique with the best outcome.&#xD;
