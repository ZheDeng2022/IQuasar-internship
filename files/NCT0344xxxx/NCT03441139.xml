  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the efficacy of 2 analgesic strategies,&#xD;
      based on percutaneous cryotherapy plus medical supportive care versus medical supportive care&#xD;
      alone in the treatment of cancer patients with painful musculoskeletal metastasis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a substantial body of evidences that support the rationale for percutaneous&#xD;
      cryotherapy in the treatment of painful musculoskeletal metastasis. Since the available&#xD;
      results are based exclusively on retrospective and single-arm prospective studies, all&#xD;
      authors agree that preliminary data deserves further investigation to provide high level&#xD;
      evidences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current knowledge, along with the need for relieving patients' pain, already leads&#xD;
      interventional radiologists to introduce analgesic cryotherapy in their routine practice. Our&#xD;
      team usually notes a clinically significant pain relief that is immediate, continuous and&#xD;
      prolonged in these patients. However, facing the lack of comparative studies, this technique&#xD;
      is still proposed to patients with poor life-expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous cryotherapy is an innovative strategy in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      uncontrolled painful metastases. It could provide a significant and durable pain relief and a&#xD;
      better quality of life, earlier in the patient's care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group hypotheses that an early procedure of percutaneous cryotherapy is able to&#xD;
      provide painful patients with better and prolonged analgesia and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective controlled study is proposed with two analgesic strategies (percutaneous&#xD;
      cryotherapy plus medical supportive care versus medical supportive care alone) in patients&#xD;
      with a painful metastasis not controlled by conventional analgesia strategy.&#xD;
