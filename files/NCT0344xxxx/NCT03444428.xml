      -  Patients with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) admitted to Lane Fox Unit /Royal Brompton&#xD;
           Hospital and/or reviewed in Lane Fox Unit /Royal Brompton Hospital clinics and/or&#xD;
           outreach review will be approached for participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiological assessment and measurement of arterial stiffness will be performed in all&#xD;
           patients at baseline and after the use of non invasive ventilation for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MND patients not requiring mechanical ventilation will serve as controls since non&#xD;
           invasive ventilation cannot be withheld from MND patients in type II respiratory&#xD;
           failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be analysed to look for differences between groups, relationships in baseline&#xD;
           or change from baseline in respiratory physiological measures, inflammatory indices,&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The stiffness of the arterial wall is highly relevant to cardiovascular disease. Large&#xD;
      elastic arteries and smaller muscular conduit arteries become stiffer with ageing, a process&#xD;
      that is accelerated in the presence of cardiovascular disease. Arterial stiffness increases&#xD;
      also with various disease states, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity,&#xD;
      smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and kidney disease. Numerous techniques have been developed to&#xD;
      measure arterial stiffness, either in single vessels or in entire muscular arterial trees.&#xD;
      These techniques have increasingly been shown to improve stratification of cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk and risk reduction beyond that provided by conventional risk factors. Furthermore, large&#xD;
      artery stiffness, measured via carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, independently predicts&#xD;
      the risk of cardiovascular events in both clinical and community-based cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormalities in arterial stiffness have been noted in disorders characterized by hypoxia&#xD;
      with or without hypercapnia. These abnormalities could be driven by the risk factors for&#xD;
      those conditions (e.g. cigarette smoke, obesity). In COPD, all studies are consistent showing&#xD;
      a significant increase in arterial stiffness compared with ex-smokers without airway&#xD;
      obstruction and nonsmoker healthy control subjects. The severity of airway obstruction is&#xD;
      consistently related to arterial stiffness in COPD. Furthermore, airflow limitation arising&#xD;
      from cigarette smoking, but not airflow limitation in non-smokers, was associated with&#xD;
      arterial stiffness in a general population independently of established risk factors. The&#xD;
      presence of OSA was associated with higher arterial stiffness indices independent of major&#xD;
      confounders. In this context, OSA is associated with increased arterial stiffness independent&#xD;
      of blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non invasive ventilation has been shown to reduce arterial stiffness in obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea. In particular, there are studies that have examined the impact of continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (CPAP) on arterial stiffness (measured with pulse wave velocity) in OSA&#xD;
      patients. Other studies have examined changes in arterial stiffness (measured with other than&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity method) after treatment of OSA with CPAP. Furthermore, to the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge no investigation exists on the impact of non invasive bilevel positive airway&#xD;
      pressure ventilation on arterial stiffness in neuromuscular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Lane Fox Unit, the UK's largest weaning, rehabilitation and home ventilation unit, is&#xD;
      treating neuromuscular patients. In neuromuscular disease, especially in MND, confounding&#xD;
      factors as obesity, cigarette smoke, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus can be excluded.&#xD;
      This gives the opportunity to determine whether hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia alone cause&#xD;
      arterial stiffness. Furthermore, in this pilot study it will be investigated whether non&#xD;
      invasive ventilation has any effect on arterial stiffness in MND patients.&#xD;
