  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related hearing loss is highly prevalent and hearing health care is underutilized. The&#xD;
      primary objective of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      of a community health worker (CHW)-delivered hearing loss intervention program. A preceding&#xD;
      pilot study demonstrated preliminary effectiveness of the intervention program in reducing&#xD;
      self-reported hearing handicap, and highlighted its acceptability among the target&#xD;
      demographic. The proposed trial will now expand upon lessons learned through previous pilot&#xD;
      studies and expand to other affordable residences for low-to-moderate income older adults in&#xD;
      Baltimore. Primary outcome measurements will investigate intervention effects on hearing&#xD;
      handicap, with secondary measurements investigating effects on domains such as social&#xD;
      isolation and quality of life. This trial is a first-in-kind investigation of a novel&#xD;
      community-based intervention that addresses hearing loss in a vulnerable, urban population.&#xD;

          <description>This 5 question survey measures listening self efficacy on a 0-10 scale in different situations such as being able to understand a conversation in a quiet room to a crowded restaurant. Participants answer with a higher number the more confident they are in the presented situation. Maximum possible score is 50.&#xD;
Change from baseline score is reported. An increase in the score from baseline (a positive number) indicates a higher self-efficacy.</description>
