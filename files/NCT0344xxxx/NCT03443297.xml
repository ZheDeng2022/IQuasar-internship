  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of enteral feeds for preterm, growth restricted infants are often delayed&#xD;
      due to concern that early introduction may not be tolerated and may increase the risk of&#xD;
      necrotizing enterocolitis. However, prolonged enteral fasting may diminish the functional&#xD;
      adaptation of the immature gastrointestinal tract and extend the need for parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition with its attendant infectious and metabolic risks. Early introduction of small&#xD;
      volumes of milk in the form of Trophic feeding, promote intestinal maturation, may enhance&#xD;
      feeding tolerance and decrease the time taken to reach full enteral feeding independently of&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Randomized Trial will be carried out over a period of 12 months in Department of&#xD;
      Neonatology of BSMMU. Sample size will be 50(25 in each group). Infants with gestation below&#xD;
      35 weeks, birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age, will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated by web-based randomization to commence enteral feeds &quot;early,&quot; whose feeding will be&#xD;
      started from 24 to 48 hours of age or &quot;late,&quot; whose feeding will be started from 48 to 72&#xD;
      hours of age. Gradually feeding will be increased. Rate of advancement of feeding will be&#xD;
      same for both groups. Primary outcomes will be time to achieve full enteral feeding sustained&#xD;
      for 72 hours. Statistical analyses will be performed by using Fisher Exact test and by&#xD;
      Student's t test for categorical data and quantitative data respectively. Logistic regression&#xD;
      analyses will be performed to determine the role of independent variable.&#xD;

      Eligible infants who will fulfill the inclusion criteria will be divided into two strata&#xD;
      &quot;Early feeding group&quot; and &quot; Late feeding group&quot; by computer based randomization after taking&#xD;
      informed written consent from parents or responsible caregivers. Feeding will be started in&#xD;
      early feeding group from 24 to 48 hours of age or in late feeding group, from 48 to 72 hours&#xD;
      of age. Initially 4 hourly feeding will be started with 0.5ml and 1 ml expressed breast milk&#xD;
      in babies with birth weight &lt;1200 grams and &gt;1200 grams respectively. On the following day 3&#xD;
      hourly, thereafter 2 hourly feeding will be provided in both groups. Gradually amount of&#xD;
      feeding will be increased after reaching 2 hourly feeding at the rate of 10 ml/kg/day for&#xD;
      initial 10 days then 20ml/kg/day in 2 aliquots till full feeding(150ml/kg/day).For babies&#xD;
      with birth weight &lt;1200 gram, rate of feeding advancement 10 ml/kg/day till full feeds. Any&#xD;
      baby who will develop shock (due to sepsis, cardiogenic, hypovolemic etc.) will be excluded&#xD;
      and will be replaced by new one in same category as per protocol analysis. Follow up&#xD;
      examinations will be done.&#xD;
