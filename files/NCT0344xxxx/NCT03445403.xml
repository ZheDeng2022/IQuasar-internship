  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric chronic pain disorders are common and consequential in Western societies, occurring&#xD;
      in 25-80% of population-based samples with a median prevalence of 11-38% and significant&#xD;
      pain-related disability in 3-5% of these children. Pediatric chronic pain disorders have a&#xD;
      negative impact on many aspects children's lives including mobility, night sleep, school&#xD;
      attendance, peer relationships, family functioning, and overall quality of life. Parents&#xD;
      caring for these children risk loss of parental earnings, and these disorders place a high&#xD;
      financial burden on healthcare. In a nationally representative sample in the United States,&#xD;
      costs related to health care were significantly higher ($1,339 per capita) for children with&#xD;
      chronic pain disorders compared to children with common pediatric health conditions of ADHD,&#xD;
      asthma and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children with clinical chronic pain conditions, such as daily headaches or fibromyalgia,&#xD;
      chronic pain is presumably a persistent state of an overly excitable nervous system. This&#xD;
      phenomenon known as central sensitization is characterized by excessive pain sensitivity that&#xD;
      occurs in response to non-painful stimuli, such as light touch or contact with clothing, and&#xD;
      slightly painful stimuli, such as a light pinprick. This hypersensitivity results from&#xD;
      peculiar changes in the working of the central nervous system, including the spinal cord and&#xD;
      brain, and leads to unusual intensification of pain that is out of proportion to the inciting&#xD;
      stimulus. For example, light touch from clothing on the skin is perceived as intensely&#xD;
      painful. Central sensitization is also thought to contribute to the spreading of pain to&#xD;
      other body sites in several chronic pain disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In chronic pain disorders, the function of the central descending inhibitory modulating&#xD;
      system is likely impaired and is traditionally measured by a phenomenon identified as&#xD;
      &quot;conditioned pain modulation (CPM)&quot; and more recently measured by a phenomenon of &quot;offset&#xD;
      analgesia&quot; (OA). The OA test is more robust than the CPM test and likely more acceptable to&#xD;
      most patients, especially children, because it is shorter in duration and uses a more&#xD;
      tolerable painful stimulus. Compared to CPM, the OA test is more tolerable because it is&#xD;
      conducted using a painful test stimulus that is less than the maximal (suprathreshold).&#xD;
      Additionally, the time of exposure to the painful stimulus is significantly shorter, a few&#xD;
      seconds, in the OA test compared to CPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central descending inhibitory pathway that modulates pain as tested by OA is functional&#xD;
      and mature in healthy children as young as 6 year of age, but it has yet to be investigated&#xD;
      in children with chronic pain disorders. The investigators plan to test OA responses in a&#xD;
      population of common pediatric pain disorders with overlapping symptomology attributed to&#xD;
      central sensitization (such as chronic musculoskeletal pain, chronic abdominal pain and&#xD;
      chronic headaches and chronic regional pain syndromes) and compare their responses with an&#xD;
      age- and sex-matched control group. The characteristics of OA responses in each group will&#xD;
      allow for assessment of the presence or absence of central sensitization as a mechanism&#xD;
      driving the persistent, abnormal pain in a subgroup of these chronic pain disorders. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that central sensitization is the potential contributory mechanism&#xD;
      of the central nervous system heightened sensitivity to two testing stimuli of painful&#xD;
      (moderate heat discomfort sensation) and non-painful (warmth sensation) in children with&#xD;
      chronic pain disorders. These types of sensations mimic those that children would be expected&#xD;
      to experience their natural environment during typical activities of daily living such as&#xD;
      showering/bathing in warm water or hand washing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ) and Central Sensitization Inventory&#xD;
      (CSI) will be used as clinical screening tools for subjective report of sensitization&#xD;
      symptoms, and are simple and easy to administer in a clinical setting. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that these measures will correlate with the objective offset analgesia responses&#xD;
      thus allowing for assessment of central sensitization in children with chronic pain&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These tests are advantageous because they are feasible to perform rapidly in a clinic setting&#xD;
      and have utility for measurement of patient responses to therapeutic interventions. If this&#xD;
      concept is supported by this study, future studies could utilize OA to examine the effects of&#xD;
      various pharmacological and physical interventions used to manage children with chronic pain&#xD;
      disorders including intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation or specific interventions such&#xD;
      as aerobic exercise, which likely modulates pain via similar mechanisms.&#xD;

      Specific Aims/Objectives To date, OA has not been evaluated in pediatric chronic pain&#xD;
      disorders. In the current study, the investigators plan to measure OA responses in a&#xD;
      population of common pediatric pain disorders. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if OA paradigm can detect impairment of central inhibitory modulation pathways in&#xD;
      subgroups of chronic pain disorders in children and adolescents. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that chronic pain in children and adolescents results from central sensitization&#xD;
      and impaired central inhibitory modulation of pain and thus children with chronic pain&#xD;
      disorders will have a decreased OA response compared with healthy controls. If the results of&#xD;
      this study are positive, this testing paradigm could be a valuable objective marker in&#xD;
      examining the efficacy of pharmacological and/or rehabilitative treatment modalities in&#xD;
      reversing or alleviating central sensitization-induced pain in children with chronic pain&#xD;
      disorders. Additionally, if existing self-report questionnaires, Pain Sensitivity&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PSQ) and Central Sensitivity Inventory, correlate with the magnitude of offset&#xD;
      analgesia observed, they could be used to screen for central sensitization in high volume and&#xD;
      busy clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine if children with common chronic pain disorders, including musculoskeletal&#xD;
      pain, complex regional pain syndrome, functional abdominal pain and chronic headaches&#xD;
      demonstrate impaired ability to actuate central descending inhibitory function as measured by&#xD;
      a test of offset analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish this aim, the investigators will compare 30 children with common chronic pain&#xD;
      disorders with 30 age and sex matched controls. Power will be 80% to detect a 20% or larger&#xD;
      difference in the change in self-reported pain scores as a result of the dynamic heat pain&#xD;
      test stimulus between the two groups using a Student t-test (nQuery Advisor version 7.0,&#xD;
      Statistical Solutions, Cork, Ireland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine if the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ) and/or Central Sensitization&#xD;
      Inventory (CSI) can serve as screening tools for assessment of central sensitization i.e.,&#xD;
      impairment of central descending inhibitory function in children with common chronic pain&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish this aim investigators will correlate scores on the above scales with the&#xD;
      magnitude of offset analgesia using Pearson correlations in 30 children with chronic pain&#xD;
      disorders and 30 healthy age and sex-matched controls. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      magnitude of OA will correlate with either PSQ, CSI or both thus these questionnaires would&#xD;
      serve as assessment tools for central sensitization in children with common chronic pain&#xD;
      disorders in clinical setting. The Mann-Whitney U-test will be applied to compare medians and&#xD;
      interquartile ranges on the PSQ and CSI between the chronic pain and healthy control groups.&#xD;
      In addition, investigators will identify individuals who show a decrease in VAS pain scores&#xD;
      after the dynamic test stimulus of at least 20% (responders) and will assess whether PSQ and&#xD;
      CSI can predict responders and non-responders using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC)&#xD;
      curve approach with area under the curve (AUC) to measure how well pain perception and&#xD;
      central sensitization assessment tools can help to identify responders and non-responders.&#xD;
