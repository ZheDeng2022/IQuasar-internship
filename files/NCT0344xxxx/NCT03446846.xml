    <textblock>
      MIN-117C03 is a 6-week, 3-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to&#xD;
      investigate the safety and efficacy of MIN-117 in male and female patients with Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder, aged 18 to 65 years. Approximately 324 patients were to be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms, including placebo, 2.5 mg MIN-117, or 5.0 mg MIN-117, in a&#xD;
      2:1:1 ratio.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a validated, physician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. The test consists of 10 items, each scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe conditions. MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. The test exhibits high inter-rater reliability and its capacity to differentiate between responders and nonresponders to antidepressant treatment has been shown to be comparable to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to the end of Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) measures the severity of a participant's anxiety, based on 14 parameters, including anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, somatic complaints and behavior at the interview. The subject is asked to rate the gravity of each item using a 5-level scale - from 0 to 4, where 0 being not present and 4 being severe - and afterwards, the results are collated and tabulated to determine the severity of anxiety. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-25 mild to moderate severity, 25-30 moderate to severe, and &gt;30 indicates very severe. To implement the HAM-A, the acting clinician proceeds through the 14 items, evaluating each criterion independently in form of the five-point scale described above.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with participants who have the same diagnosis: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?&quot; which is rated on the following scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill participants. The CGI-S will provide an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information including knowledge of the participant's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the participant's ability to function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale (CGI-I) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale (CGI-I) will provide an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information including knowledge of the participant's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the participant's ability to function. The CGI-I consists of a 7-point scale that evaluates the change from initiation of treatment similar to the Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale (CGI-S). This 7-point scale requires the clinician to assess how much the subject's illness has improved or worsened relative to a Baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.</description>

        <title>Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a validated, physician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. The test consists of 10 items, each scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe conditions. MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. The test exhibits high inter-rater reliability and its capacity to differentiate between responders and nonresponders to antidepressant treatment has been shown to be comparable to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.</description>

        <title>Change in Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A)</title>
        <description>Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) measures the severity of a participant's anxiety, based on 14 parameters, including anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, somatic complaints and behavior at the interview. The subject is asked to rate the gravity of each item using a 5-level scale - from 0 to 4, where 0 being not present and 4 being severe - and afterwards, the results are collated and tabulated to determine the severity of anxiety. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-25 mild to moderate severity, 25-30 moderate to severe, and &gt;30 indicates very severe. To implement the HAM-A, the acting clinician proceeds through the 14 items, evaluating each criterion independently in form of the five-point scale described above.</description>

        <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with participants who have the same diagnosis: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?&quot; which is rated on the following scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill participants. The CGI-S will provide an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information including knowledge of the participant's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the participant's ability to function.</description>

The CGI-I consists of a 7-point scale that evaluates the change from initiation of treatment similar to the Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale (CGI-S). This 7-point scale requires the clinician to assess how much the subject's illness has improved or worsened relative to a Baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.</description>

      <desc>The Safety Population is the population of all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment. Patients in this population will be analyzed according to the treatment they received, regardless of which treatment they were randomly assigned. All safety and tolerability analyses will be based on this population and treatment assignment. Treatment-emergent adverse events were those that were reported on or after the initiation of the study drug.</desc>
