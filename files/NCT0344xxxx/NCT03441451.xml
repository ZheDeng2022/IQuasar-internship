      Persons with obesity are more likely to suffer from many other serious health conditions and&#xD;
      are more likely to die young. Lifestyle interventions have not been found to be an effective&#xD;
      long-term solution for treating obesity. When usual weight loss measures are not successful,&#xD;
      bariatric, or 'weight loss,' surgery may be considered. Bariatric surgery is performed to&#xD;
      help people with obesity achieve weight loss which they can maintain. Weight loss following&#xD;
      bariatric surgery leads to improvement in health and well-being, and patients have been shown&#xD;
      to live longer. It is invasive surgery which has surgical risks and potential side effects,&#xD;
      including death. Since people are having this surgery to improve their health, it is&#xD;
      important that the surgery is performed with a minimum of side effects, otherwise it cannot&#xD;
      be justified. Information is collected about the surgery, any complications after the&#xD;
      surgery, weight at various time points, and if the patient has diabetes and how it is is&#xD;
      treated. Patient details are needed to be able to identify patients on the registry and track&#xD;
      their progress through data linkages. Participants have information about their bariatric&#xD;
      surgery provided to the registry by their surgeon or hospital. They may also be contacted&#xD;
      directly by the registry staff to see if they had any complications and if the surgery had&#xD;
      any effect on their health (if they have diabetes), weight, and well-being. The Registry will&#xD;
      hold their identifiable information as it aims to follow each patient for ten years after&#xD;
      their first bariatric operation. By systematically collecting information on every procedure&#xD;
      performed in Australia and New Zealand, the registry will help to identify when surgeons,&#xD;
      hospitals or procedures not performing to the expected standard. A Bariatric Surgery Registry&#xD;
      should also be able to demonstrate how effectively bariatric surgery results in weight loss&#xD;
      and improved health (using diabetes as a marker of health) across the two countries.&#xD;

      The Bariatric Surgery Registry (BSR) is a population based observational quality improvement&#xD;
      study of patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery and collects identifiable data&#xD;
      obtained from participants' medical records, the participants themselves and from surgeons or&#xD;
      hospitals. When mature, the registry will collect data from all public and private hospitals&#xD;
      in Australia and New Zealand that perform bariatric surgery (estimated to be around 152 sites&#xD;
      in Australia and 12 in NZ). Contributing surgeons or public hospital clinics are required to&#xD;
      make patients who will undergo bariatric procedures aware that information related to their&#xD;
      procedure will be provided to the BSR. Surgeons and public hospital clinics are required to&#xD;
      display a poster that advises their practice/clinic contributes to the Bariatric Surgery&#xD;
      Registry and give all bariatric patients a registry information flyer. Upon the registry&#xD;
      receiving patient demographic and procedure information from the surgeon or the hospital,&#xD;
      bariatric patients are posted a Participant Fact Sheet (PFS) further advising that&#xD;
      participation in the registry is voluntary and their decision not to participate in the&#xD;
      registry or to participate and later opt out, will not affect their relationship with their&#xD;
      treating surgeon or the hospital, and their surgeon will be unaware of their participation&#xD;
      status. After the PFS are posted, bariatric patients have two weeks to contact the Registry&#xD;
      staff via the free call telephone number to opt out. Their participation will be presumed if&#xD;
      no contact is made within that period. There are three options for participation: full&#xD;
      participation; partial opt out - data is included on the registry but registry staff will not&#xD;
      contact the participant during the follow-up period; or, complete opt out - no clinical data&#xD;
      is included on the registry. All participants retain the right to opt out at any time. For&#xD;
      those who choose to opt out, their information is disposed of in accordance with the National&#xD;
      Statement for Ethical Conduct in Human Research 2007 (2015). Data are provided using one of&#xD;
      the following options: web browser with secure authorised entry using the Bariatric Surgery&#xD;
      Registry Interface (BSR-i); paper based data forms securely faxed or posted; or, secure&#xD;
      electronic record transfer from surgeons' or hospitals' electronic medical record. In New&#xD;
      Zealand, data will only be collected through direct entry through the BSR-i. Completeness and&#xD;
      accuracy of the eligible population captured by the Registry will be assessed using hospital&#xD;
      International Classification of Disease 10-Australia Modified (ICD-10-AM) codes.&#xD;
      Cross-checking with ICD-10-AM codes allows for complete data capture at each hospital site&#xD;
      and provides data validation for each procedure submitted by the surgeon. Hospital&#xD;
      Information Services (HIS) at each hospital site or of a private hospital group provide&#xD;
      regular ICD-10-AM coding reports for bariatric procedures performed by surgeons who&#xD;
      participate in the Registry. These reports are sent to the registry at regular intervals by&#xD;
      the administering organising and will only contain data of contributing surgeons. The reports&#xD;
      are sent to the registry using a secure file transfer platform (SFTP). In the case where the&#xD;
      surgeon or hospital had not previously provided information of a bariatric patient, the&#xD;
      reports will be the primary source of data. When ICD-10-AM coding is the primary source,&#xD;
      surgeons are asked to complete the missing data elements not made available from the&#xD;
      hospitals (e.g. device/stapling information, whether it is a primary or revision operation,&#xD;
      height/ weight information and diabetes treatment). If the surgeons are providing the missing&#xD;
      operation data with the ICD-10-AM report verification process, they will also be asked to&#xD;
      provide their perioperative follow-up data at the same time to enable efficiency. Patients&#xD;
      whose details are obtained from ICD-10-AM reports will be sent a PFS and the opt-out approach&#xD;
      is followed. If the surgeons do not supply the missing data elements, registry staff will&#xD;
      contact the patient to confirm whether the procedure was a primary or revision and to&#xD;
      ascertain the participant's height, weight, diabetes status and treatment prior to surgery.&#xD;
      If surgeons or public data collectors indicate they have not seen the participant for&#xD;
      follow-up and are unable to provide post-operative data, registry staff will contact the&#xD;
      participant for a brief phone call to collect the information related to the perioperative&#xD;
      period and/or 12 month intervals after surgery. This call may also include the missing data&#xD;
      elements about their procedure if the surgeon or data collector had not provided them. Five&#xD;
      attempts will be made to contact the patient before they are allocated to &quot;Lost to&#xD;
      Follow-Up.&quot; A waiver of consent has been granted by 40 ethics committees for the time during&#xD;
      the data acquisition process when patients' data may be held without providing them the&#xD;
      opportunity to opt out. The waiver covers from the time when the surgeons and hospitals&#xD;
      provide patients' information before the PFS is posted and two weeks have passed; and, from&#xD;
      the time when the BSR receives the Health Information Services discharge coding (ICD-10-AM&#xD;
      reports) and when patients are identified whose data was not provided by surgeons or&#xD;
      hospitals until the PFS is posted and two weeks has passed. Further, a waiver of consent has&#xD;
      been also granted by the same ethics committees in the event that the patient dies following&#xD;
      bariatric surgery so as not to burden next of kin. Information related to a mortality is&#xD;
      essential to determine if the death is likely to have been caused by the bariatric surgery.&#xD;
      Data collected are defined in the BSR's data dictionary and governed by the Steering&#xD;
      Committee with any changes managed through a data element variation process. The data&#xD;
      elements collected include: Patient Identifiers-full name, address, date of birth, unit&#xD;
      record (UR) number/hospital, Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI) number when available,&#xD;
      email address; Patient Demographic Information-Medicare, or Department of Veterans' Affairs&#xD;
      (DVA) number, National Health Index number (NHI) in New Zealand, phone numbers, gender, and&#xD;
      indigenous status/ethnicity; Procedural information-surgeon name, procedure date, procedure&#xD;
      type, primary or planned/unplanned revision status, reason for revision, bariatric procedure&#xD;
      prior to revision, procedure abandoned or not, length of hospital stay, mortality status and&#xD;
      if death likely related to bariatric procedure; Clinical details: start weight (for primary&#xD;
      patients only), day-of-surgery (DOS) weight, height, diabetes status and treatment, and&#xD;
      whether there was a concurrent renal and liver transplant; Device or staple details: type,&#xD;
      brand, model, port fixation method, and buttressing; Peri-operative (up to 90 days&#xD;
      :post-surgery) outcome data: date patient examined for follow-up; defined adverse events&#xD;
      (unplanned return to theatre, unplanned admission to an intensive care unit, unplanned&#xD;
      re-admission to hospital, prolonged hospital stay and reason or complication that caused the&#xD;
      adverse event); mortality status and if death likely related to bariatric procedure; Annual&#xD;
      Outcome data (for primary patients only) up to 10 years after surgery: weight, diabetes&#xD;
      status and treatment, re-operation and reason; mortality status and if death likely related&#xD;
      to bariatric procedure; and, Participant Feedback For quality assurance purposes, and as a&#xD;
      basis for the potential development of the SMS/Secure Portal platform as described above,&#xD;
      participants will be given the opportunity to provide feedback on their experience with the&#xD;
      Registry and to advise how the BSR could better support their journey as bariatric patients.&#xD;
      Perioperative follow-up data refers to the period between 20 and 90 days post-surgery. Annual&#xD;
      follow-up refers to the period between 9 months prior to anniversary or 3 months following.&#xD;
      Participants are identified as &quot;primary&quot; if they are entered the Registry with their first&#xD;
      bariatric procedure or as &quot;legacy&quot; if they are entered with a revision bariatric procedure.&#xD;
      The Bariatric Surgery Registry data dictionary defines each of the items on which data is&#xD;
      collected and provides information on how the required data is sourced and entered in the&#xD;
      database. The dictionary consists of a contents page that groups data items according to data&#xD;
      that is collected from same source and refers to a particular phase of patient's care. Data&#xD;
      completeness and accuracy are optimized through in-built validation and completion checks in&#xD;
      the registry database to minimize data entry error. These include data entry controlled by&#xD;
      form logic and limited to feasible data; the use of built in edit checks to ensure data meet&#xD;
      required formats and ranges; accuracy enhanced by the use of exhaustive drop down lists&#xD;
      providing all possible answers to minimize free text entry where applicable; the use of hide&#xD;
      and show mechanisms to guide data entry to required fields; use of explanatory texts to&#xD;
      assist data entry; validation rules applied at the time of submission with alerts to assist&#xD;
      with errors and missing data; and the use of a participant management system to list&#xD;
      incomplete data and other actions required. Additional quality checks post data entry&#xD;
      includes checks for duplicate data, missing data, and data consistency. Data quality and&#xD;
      completeness are checked at a number of stages of the data management process. Errors in data&#xD;
      quality, when identified, may be referred back to contributing surgeons or sites for review.&#xD;
      Case ascertainment as well as both brief and comprehensive audit processes will be performed&#xD;
      on site by Monash University registry staff (Australia only). Registry staff will perform&#xD;
      regular remote audit checks to verify the accuracy of data received from surgeons. This will&#xD;
      be done during the course of a follow-up phone call from the call centre or by registry staff&#xD;
      directly contacting surgeons' rooms. In Australia, it is intended that the BSR will&#xD;
      periodically link to other repositories, or datasets, of health information which can&#xD;
      validate registry data. This is to verify critical quality data such as patient mortality,&#xD;
      defined adverse events and other outcome measures are completely captured, minimising the&#xD;
      risk of surgeons selectively choosing whom they enter on the BSR. Requests to link New&#xD;
      Zealand BSR data to national data sets will be considered by the Steering Committee on a case&#xD;
      by case basis. For data linkages in Australia and New Zealand, the necessary approvals from&#xD;
      an ethics committee will be sought when required. All statistical analyses of this registry&#xD;
      will be undertaken with the support of the Biostatistics unit at Monash University.&#xD;
      Non-identifiable data for both Australia and New Zealand will be provided to an independent&#xD;
      biostatistician employed by the Monash University, Department of Epidemiology and Preventive&#xD;
      Medicine by secure file transfer for review on at least a six monthly basis. Participants,&#xD;
      hospitals and surgeons will not be identified in this dataset. The results will be provided&#xD;
      to the Monash by the registry's Project Manager. Only non-clinical registry staff will have&#xD;
      access to identifiable data. All data to be used in reports or publications are to be cleaned&#xD;
      and verified prior to analysis. Routine, re-analysis of data will be undertaken by the&#xD;
      Project Manager to ensure findings are reproducible. The governance of how the data&#xD;
      activities are undertaken lies with the Steering Committee. The Terms of Reference of the BSR&#xD;
      Steering Committee outline specific roles of the Steering Committee in relation to data as&#xD;
      follows- monitor the registry's data quality management processes and timeliness of&#xD;
      reporting; develop and monitor policies for access to data and responses to quality of care&#xD;
      issues identified; review and advise on outputs from the registry; and review all research&#xD;
      and data requests for identifiable data.&#xD;
