      A multi-center Phase 1, First-in-Human study conducted in 2 Parts, testing AMG 424 in&#xD;
      subjects with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study is dose evaluating and aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      AMG 424 while determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or biologically active dose in&#xD;
      subjects with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study will further evaluate safety and tolerability of the AMG 424 MTD dose&#xD;
      determined in Part 1, in groups of subjects with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma that&#xD;
      include those with high or low cytogenetic risk.&#xD;

    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
