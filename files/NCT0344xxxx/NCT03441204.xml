      Multicenter, phase IV, registry-based, randomized controlled trial. Patients starting&#xD;
      long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) are randomized between LTOT prescribed 24 h/day or 15 h/day&#xD;
      using the Swedish Register for Respiratory Failure (Swedevox). Clinical follow-up and&#xD;
      concurrent treatments are according to routine clinical practice. The main endpoints of&#xD;
      mortality, hospitalizations, and incident disease are assessed using Swedish registry data,&#xD;
      with expected complete follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes are assessed using a posted&#xD;
      questionnaire at 3 and 12 months. The study is managed by the Uppsala Clinical Research&#xD;
      Centre (UCR).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LTOT given 15 h/day or more improves the survival time in patients with chronic daytime&#xD;
      hypoxemia due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) based on two randomized trials;&#xD;
      the 'Continuous or Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy' Trial (NOTT) published in 1980 [1] and the&#xD;
      Medical Research Council (MRC) trial published in 1981.[2] International guidelines recommend&#xD;
      that LTOT is prescribed continuously (24 h/day), which is based on an observational,&#xD;
      unadjusted comparison of the treatment arms of the MRC and NOTT studies only. [3] However,&#xD;
      LTOT 24 h/day may place an unnecessary burden on patients in terms of increased dependence,&#xD;
      isolation, side effects and restricted activity.[3, 4] Data from the National Swedish&#xD;
      Registry for Respiratory Failure (Swedevox) indicate no survival benefit from LTOT 24 vs 15&#xD;
      h/day (Figure 1). No randomized trial has evaluated the additional benefit of longer daily&#xD;
      duration of LTOT above 15 h/day.[4] Studies on the effect of LTOT are also lacking for&#xD;
      diseases other than COPD, such as pulmonary fibrosis, yet LTOT is given in these conditions&#xD;
      according to the same criteria as in COPD in clinical practice.[4]&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPORTANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first R-RCT in respiratory medicine and the largest trial of LTOT to date.&#xD;
      If LTOT 24 h/day is found to be superior to 15 h/day, this will confirm the importance of&#xD;
      oxygen therapy in chronic respiratory failure and the importance of implementing services to&#xD;
      optimize the daily duration of LTOT. If LTOT 24 h/day is non-superior to 15 h/day, this&#xD;
      supports that patients safely can be free of supplemental oxygen for up to nine hours per&#xD;
      day. This trial will also be the first to evaluate effects of LTOT on symptoms and HRQOL,&#xD;
      effects in patients with moderate hypoxemia and in diseases other than COPD. This study will&#xD;
      have direct impact on research and clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) 24 h/day is recommended to prolong survival time in severe&#xD;
      hypoxemia but may be burdensome and evidence of its additional benefit compared with LTOT 15&#xD;
      h/day is lacking. The purpose is to determine whether LTOT prescribed continuously 24 h/day&#xD;
      improves the rate of all-cause hospitalization or death at 1 year compared with LTOT 15&#xD;
      h/day. The aim is improved evidence-based treatment in chronic hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To determine whether oxygen prescribed 24 h/day compared with 15 h/day in patients&#xD;
      starting LTOT improves the rate of all-cause mortality or death at 1 year. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives: test improvement in overall and cause-specific mortality (respiratory and&#xD;
      cardiovascular deaths); overall and cause-specific hospitalization rate; incident&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease; breathlessness; fatigue; self-reported physical activity;&#xD;
      health-related quality of life; cognition; measured oxygen adherence; and patient preference&#xD;
      to continue treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis: In all randomized patients according to the intention-to-treat and per&#xD;
      protocol principles. Secondary analyses: In patients with severe resting hypoxemia (PaO2 &lt;&#xD;
      7.4 kPa breathing air); moderate resting hypoxemia (PaO2 7.4 to 8.0 kPa breathing air); COPD&#xD;
      verified by spirometry (FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 after bronchodilation); and in patients with other&#xD;
      conditions than COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter, single-blinded (analyst), effectiveness, phase IV, register-based, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (R-RCT). Patients starting LTOT are randomized between oxygen prescribed 24&#xD;
      h/day or 15 h/day using the Swedevox registry. Clinical follow-up and concurrent treatments&#xD;
      are according to routine clinical practice. Oxygen utilization is measured using oxygen flow&#xD;
      sensors on the equipment according to the level of funding. The main endpoints of mortality,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and incident disease are assessed using Swedish registry data, with&#xD;
      expected complete follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes are assessed using a postal&#xD;
      questionnaire at 3 months. The study is managed by the Uppsala Clinical Research Centre (UCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational products, dosage and mode of administration: Patients are randomized between&#xD;
      two daily durations of oxygen used in current clinical practice: LTOT 24 h/day (intervention)&#xD;
      or 15 h/day (control). The LTOT is provided according to standard clinical practice using&#xD;
      oxygen concentrator, cylinders or liquid oxygen and administered mainly through nasal prongs.&#xD;
      The oxygen dose (l/min) is titrated aiming at a PaO2 on oxygen &gt; 8 kPa in accordance with&#xD;
      current routine practice and management guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment: Throughout LTOT. Primary endpoint is at 1 year after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: The primary analysis is according to the intention to treat (ITT)&#xD;
      principle and the per protocol (PP) principle. Secondary analyses are according to the PP&#xD;
      principle. The primary endpoint of the composite event of death or 1st hospitalization is&#xD;
      analyzed with CoxÂ´s proportional hazards model. Hospitalizations are analyzed using Fine Gray&#xD;
      regression accounting for death as competing event. Other secondary endpoints are analyzed&#xD;
      using two-sided Student's t-tests for continuous variables (including HRQOL, breathlessness,&#xD;
      cognition, fatigue, activity, and health care usage) and chi-2 test for categorical variables&#xD;
      (causes of death, cognition, treatment preference). Correlational analyses, including of&#xD;
      factors predictive of the primary and secondary outcomes will be conducted using linear&#xD;
      regression (continuous outcomes), logistic regression (categorical outcomes), and Cox and&#xD;
      Fine-Gray regression models (time to event outcomes).&#xD;

Five items assess the sensory dimension of dyspnoea, both in terms of quality and intensity (on a scale of 0-10). Five items assess the affective dimension of dyspnoea, also in terms of quality and intensity (on a scale of 0-10).&#xD;
Two domain scores are calculated: an &quot;immediate perception domain&quot; score (S) as the sum of A1 intensity and the intensities of the five sensory descriptors; and an &quot;emotional response domain&quot; score (A2) as the sum of the five emotional descriptors. The median (IQR) ratings will be compared betwwen the groups.</description>
