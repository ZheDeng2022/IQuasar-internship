  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this R34 proposal is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      short-term outcomes associated with an innovative service delivery model to increase&#xD;
      adherence to extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) during the transition from jail to the&#xD;
      community for rural individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). The significance of this&#xD;
      study is grounded in the public health emergency associated with the opioid epidemic in rural&#xD;
      Appalachia, the increased vulnerability of rural individuals with OUD, and the dearth of&#xD;
      available and accessible evidence-based treatment in the region. This study has potential to&#xD;
      make a significant contribution to the OUD treatment field by advancing knowledge on&#xD;
      innovative service delivery models to increase access to evidence-based treatment to reduce&#xD;
      the prevalence of opioid use disorders and related health disparities among hard-to-reach,&#xD;
      high-risk, underserved populations.&#xD;

      adherence to extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) during the transition from jail to the&#xD;
      community for rural individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). The significance of this&#xD;
      study is grounded in the public health emergency associated with the opioid epidemic in rural&#xD;
      Appalachia, the increased vulnerability of rural individuals with OUD, and the dearth of&#xD;
      available and accessible evidence-based treatment in the region. This R34 has potential to&#xD;
      make a significant contribution to the OUD treatment field by advancing knowledge on&#xD;
      innovative service delivery models to increase access to evidence-based treatment to reduce&#xD;
      high-risk opioid use and related health disparities among hard-to-reach, high-risk,&#xD;
      underserved populations. The study will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) Adapt&#xD;
      XR-NTX services for use in community supervision (P&amp;P) offices to increase adherence during&#xD;
      re-entry from jail for rural individuals with OUD. (2) A small scale pilot will be conducted&#xD;
      to examine feasibility, acceptability, and short-term outcomes of the adapted protocol on&#xD;
      XR-NTX adherence and relapse to opioid use. Rural justice-involved individuals on community&#xD;
      supervision with OUD will be invited to initiate XR-NTX and continue injections for up to&#xD;
      three months in the community. If this study establishes feasibility of this innovative&#xD;
      community-based treatment model for XR-NTX in a rural, underserved area, findings will be&#xD;
      used to develop an R01 application to test the approach in a larger RCT during community&#xD;
      re-entry from jail among high-risk rural individuals with OUD in Appalachia. The long-term&#xD;
      goal of this research is to increase access to evidence-based treatment for OUD among&#xD;
      high-risk, underserved populations.&#xD;
