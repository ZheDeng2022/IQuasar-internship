  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      bread and that rice-bran soymilk will have an additional beneficial effect on the glucose and&#xD;
      insulin The proposed research project is important because it will provide, for the first&#xD;
      time, evidence on the benefits of the addition of rice-bran to soymilk by measuring the acute&#xD;
      effect on the glycaemic and insulinaemic response in co-consumption with a high GI meal in&#xD;
      Asians. Investigators hypothesize that soymilk will lower the glycaemic and insulinaemic&#xD;
      response of white response. This will have an important implication for public health as&#xD;
      investigators will understand better how additional dietary fibre can improve the local diet&#xD;
      which is typically of high GI values. Ultimately, results from this project will enable the&#xD;
      development of dietary recommendations for better glycaemic control in Asian people.&#xD;

      The study will recruit 15-20 young healthy Asian men of Chinese descent. Volunteers will&#xD;
      visit Clinical Nutrition Research Centre (CNRC) on 5 occasions: once for consenting and&#xD;
      screening procedures (visit 1) and four additional times, interspaced by a minimum of 2 days,&#xD;
      to follow a 3 hour test session (Visit 2-5). The study aims to compare the effects of four&#xD;
      different test meals , White bread, White bread , Rice-bran soymilk with white bread, Soymilk&#xD;
      with white bread, on the glycaemic and insulinaemic response. Visit 1 (screening): For&#xD;
      screening, potential subjects will come in the morning after an overnight fast. After&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent, a series of screening tests will be conducted, including&#xD;
      questionnaires (general health, physical activity and eating behaviour), anthropometry&#xD;
      (height, weight, waist and hip circumference), blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c&#xD;
      and body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Visits 2 to 5 (four experimental&#xD;
      trials, in random order): Each of the four study visits will last for approximately 3 hours&#xD;
      in the morning, during which the following will take place:During each test session, the&#xD;
      subject arrives at the centre between 8:00 and 9:00 in the morning after an overnight fast&#xD;
      and has been instructed to avoid any physical activity/exercise and alcohol on the day prior&#xD;
      to the test. The session will start by placing an indwelling catheter into a vein in the&#xD;
      forearm by trained personnel in a sterile environment. The catheter will be kept patent at&#xD;
      all times and left on the forearm until the end of the session. Blood samples will then be&#xD;
      taken from the cannula and from a finger prick to measure baseline levels of metabolites.&#xD;
      Finger pricks will be done using disposable individual lancets which can cause minimal&#xD;
      discomfort. After obtaining baseline blood samples, the subject will be given the test meal&#xD;
      to consume within 15 minutes. Following the consumption of the test meal, blood samples (from&#xD;
      the cannula and finger pricks) will be collected at periodic intervals (every 15 minutes for&#xD;
      the first 90 minutes and every 30 minutes for the remaining 90 minutes). At each time point,&#xD;
      a maximum of 5mL of blood will be drawn. In addition, at the same time points, finger prick&#xD;
      blood samples will be taken for glucose analysis. At the end of 3 hours of testing, the&#xD;
      catheter will be removed and the subject will be free to leave the laboratory. During the&#xD;
      entire test session, the subject will have to stay rested and in the laboratory. Television&#xD;
      and a workspace will be provided to the subject. In total over the 4 sessions, a maximum of&#xD;
      200 mL of blood (approximately 40 teaspoons) will be collected as part of this study. The&#xD;
      blood obtained will be used to measure parameters such as glucose and insulin. Any blood&#xD;
      obtained during the course of this study will be stored and analysed for the purposes of this&#xD;
      study for a period not exceeding 3 years upon completion of this study. All the study diets&#xD;
      will be prepared in the CNRC food preparation kitchen and will use locally sourced&#xD;
      ingredients and food purchased from local supermarkets and food distributors.&#xD;
