    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Exercise Capacity as Measured by the Distance Walked in 6 Minutes in Standardised Conditions (6MWTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to week 12 in exercise capacity as measured by the distance walked in 6 minutes in standardised conditions (6MWTD). If repeated 6-minutes walk test (6MWT) measurements were available for the same day, the longest distance was used for analysis. Change from baseline was defined as the distance walked in 6 minutes at Week 12 minus the baseline value.&#xD;
Baseline value was defined as the last available measurement before start of treatment with randomised study medication. If a participant was present at the visit at Week 12 but did not perform the 6MWT, the participant was evaluated as having walked a distance of 0 meter. If no value was available for Week 12, an imputed value was used. Patients with missing week 12 data who had no clinical event were ranked below any patient with non-missing data, but above the patients who had clinical events. Patients who died before week 12 were ranked below the patients in all categories above.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) Total Symptom Score (TSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in KCCQ-TSS was defined as the endpoint value at week 12 minus the last available measurement before start of treatment with randomised study medication. The KCCQ is 23 item self-administered questionnaire and comprises 7 domains: physical limitation, symptom frequency, symptom burden, symptom stability, social limitation, self-efficacy and quality of life. Additionally 3 summary scores exist: TSS, clinical summary score, and overall summary score. The scores of the KCCQ domains and summary scores range from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating better outcome. If no questionnaire was available at week 12, an imputed value was used. Patients with missing week 12 data who had no clinical event were ranked below any patient with non-missing data, but above the patients who had clinical events. Patients who died before week 12 were ranked below the patients in all categories above. If no questionnaire was available at baseline, change from baseline was not imputed.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Chronic Heart Failure Questionnaire Self- Administered Standardized Format (CHQ-SAS) Dyspnea Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in CHQ-SAS was defined as the endpoint value at week 12 minus the last available endpoint value before start of treatment with randomised study medication. The CHQ-SAS evaluates 3 domains: dyspnoea, fatigue, and emotional function. Scores of the domains range from 1 to 7, with higher score indicating better quality of life. If no questionnaire was available at week 12, an imputed value was used. Patients with missing week 12 data who had no clinical event were ranked below any patient with non-missing data, but above the patients who had clinical events. Patients who died before week 12 were ranked below the patients in all categories above. If no questionnaire was available at baseline, change from baseline was not imputed.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline and at Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to week 6 in exercise capacity as measured by the distance walked in 6 minutes in standardised conditions. Change from baseline was defined as the distance walked in 6 minutes at Week 6 minus the baseline value. Baseline value was defined as the last available measurement before start of treatment with randomised study medication.&#xD;
If a participant was present at the visit at Week 6 but did not perform the 6-Minuted Walking Test, the participant was evaluated as having walked a distance of 0 meter. If no value was available for Week 6, an imputed value was used.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Congestion Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to week 12 in Clinical Congestion score is defined as the score-value at week 12 minus the score-value at baseline. Baseline value was defined as the last available measurement before start of treatment with randomised study medication. The Clinical Congestion Score (summary score) is based on 3 items: orthopnoea, jugular venous distention (JVD) and oedema. Each item was assessed through a 4-measure questionnaire, which was further converted to a standardised 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating no or fewer symptoms and 3 indicating continous or more symptoms. If at least 2 of the 3 items are not missing, the summary score is calculated as: (average over items JVD, orthopnea and oedema actually answered)*3. The summary score ranges from 0 to 9, with lower value indicating better health, and higher value indicating worse health. Mean is adjusted mean.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline to week 12 in exercise capacity as measured by the distance walked in 6 minutes in standardised conditions (6MWTD). If repeated 6-minutes walk test (6MWT) measurements were available for the same day, the longest distance was used for analysis. Change from baseline was defined as the distance walked in 6 minutes at Week 12 minus the baseline value.&#xD;
Baseline value was defined as the last available measurement before start of treatment with randomised study medication. If a participant was present at the visit at Week 12 but did not perform the 6MWT, the participant was evaluated as having walked a distance of 0 meter. If no value was available for Week 12, an imputed value was used. Patients with missing week 12 data who had no clinical event were ranked below any patient with non-missing data, but above the patients who had clinical events. Patients who died before week 12 were ranked below the patients in all categories above.</description>

Additionally 3 summary scores exist: TSS, clinical summary score, and overall summary score. The scores of the KCCQ domains and summary scores range from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating better outcome. If no questionnaire was available at week 12, an imputed value was used.

        <description>Change from baseline to week 6 in exercise capacity as measured by the distance walked in 6 minutes in standardised conditions. Change from baseline was defined as the distance walked in 6 minutes at Week 6 minus the baseline value.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Congestion Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>Change from baseline to week 12 in Clinical Congestion score is defined as the score-value at week 12 minus the score-value at baseline. Baseline value was defined as the last available measurement before start of treatment with randomised study medication. The Clinical Congestion Score (summary score) is based on 3 items: orthopnoea, jugular venous distention (JVD) and oedema. Each item was assessed through a 4-measure questionnaire, which was further converted to a standardised 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating no or fewer symptoms and 3 indicating continous or more symptoms. If at least 2 of the 3 items are not missing, the summary score is calculated as: (average over items JVD, orthopnea and oedema actually answered)*3. The summary score ranges from 0 to 9, with lower value indicating better health, and higher value indicating worse health. Mean is adjusted mean.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline to week 12 in PGI-S of Heart Failure Symptoms. The Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) of Heart Failure Symptoms is a 1-item questionnaire to assess the patient's impression of symptoms severity, specifically: shortness of breath, fatigue and swelling. The PGI-S asks the Patient to choose one response that best describes how his/her heart failure symptoms, specifically: shortness of breath, fatigue and swelling are now on a 5-category scale, ranging from 'Not at all' (1) to 'Very severe' (5). Number of participants by change in score are reported. Change in score was defined as the number of categories improved/deteriorated from baseline to week 12.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline to week 12 in Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) of dyspnoea. The PGI-S of Dyspnoea is a 1-item questionnaire designed to assess the participant´s impression of symptom severity, specifically dyspnoea. The PGI-S item asks the participant to choose one response that best describes how his/her dyspnoea is now on a 5-category scale, ranging from 'Not at all' (1) to 'Very severe' (5). Number of participants by change in score are reported. Change in score was defined as the number of categories improved/deteriorated from baseline to week 12.</description>
