  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Internet-based program CaringGuidance™ After Breast Cancer Diagnosis and its new&#xD;
      electronic Summary Report (CGSR) tool are hypothesized to empower patients to raise their&#xD;
      emotional and social concerns during oncology consultations and assist medical oncology&#xD;
      clinicians in identifying patient needs. The purpose of this study is to assess satisfaction&#xD;
      and feasibility of clinical use of the new patient guided, Internet-based CGSR to support&#xD;
      patient-clinician communication in the outpatient breast oncology clinic. The study will&#xD;
      enroll 30 women who are being treated for breast cancer. They will all have access to the&#xD;
      CaringGuidance™ program for at home use on computer or mobile device for approximately one&#xD;
      month (or up to 6 months depending on when they return to their primary medical oncologist&#xD;
      for evaluation). Following this, these women will meet with the researcher or research&#xD;
      assistant prior to a medical oncology appointment and create a CGSR on an iPad while they&#xD;
      talk through the process with the researcher. Women will complete demographic data and&#xD;
      assessment of coping prior to receiving access to the program and at this appointment. These&#xD;
      assessments will help characterize the emotional state at the time of working with the&#xD;
      program and the CGSR, these measures are not to assess the efficacy of the program.&#xD;
      Clinicians will complete a brief, one-time demographics survey prior to enrollment of&#xD;
      patients to the study. Women will take the CGSR into their oncology appointment, record the&#xD;
      appointment if she and the physician have consented to this, and use the CGSR as much or as&#xD;
      little as desired. Clinicians will complete a brief satisfaction survey following the&#xD;
      appointment and patients will debrief (recorded) about whether they used the CGSR and their&#xD;
      impressions following the appointment. Data will be analyzed primarily qualitatively to&#xD;
      determine women's appraisal of the functionality, content satisfaction and usability of the&#xD;
      CGSR and the communication patterns, topics discussed during the appointment and&#xD;
      patient/clinician satisfaction with communication during the appointment when the CGSR was&#xD;
      available for use. Data will be used for future modification of the CGSR to assure that it&#xD;
      meets patients' needs prior to initiating a larger scale trial.&#xD;

    <description>quantitative measure of usability of the form by the System Usability Scale a 10 item scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) developed by John Brookes 1986 at Digital Equipment Corporation and used in multiple studies.The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. Though the scores are 0-100, these are not percentages and should be considered only in terms of their percentile ranking.&#xD;
Based on research, a System Usability Scale score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average, however the best way to interpret your results involves &quot;normalizing&quot; the scores to produce a percentile ranking.</description>
