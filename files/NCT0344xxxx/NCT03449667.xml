  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a limb is severed, pain perceived in the part of the body that no longer exists often&#xD;
      develops and is called &quot;phantom limb&quot; pain. Unfortunately, phantom pain goes away in only 16%&#xD;
      of afflicted individuals, and there is currently no reliable definitive treatment. The exact&#xD;
      reason that phantom limb pain occurs is unclear, but when a nerve is cut-as happens with an&#xD;
      amputation-changes occur in the brain and spinal cord that actually increase with worsening&#xD;
      phantom pain. These abnormal changes may often be corrected by putting local&#xD;
      anesthetic-called a &quot;nerve block&quot;-on the injured nerve, effectively keeping any &quot;bad signals&quot;&#xD;
      from reaching the brain with a simultaneous resolution of the phantom limb pain. However,&#xD;
      when the nerve block resolves after a few hours, the phantom pain returns. But, this&#xD;
      demonstrates that the brain abnormalities-and phantom pain-that occur with an amputation are&#xD;
      not necessarily fixed, and may be dependent upon the &quot;bad&quot; signals being sent from the&#xD;
      injured nerve(s), suggesting that a very long peripheral nerve block-lasting many months&#xD;
      rather than hours-may permanently reverse the abnormal changes in the brain, and provide&#xD;
      definitive relief from phantom pain. A prolonged nerve block lasting a few months may be&#xD;
      provided by freezing the nerve using a process called &quot;cryoneurolysis&quot;. The ultimate&#xD;
      objective of the proposed research study is to determine if cryoanalgesia is an effective&#xD;
      treatment for intractable post-amputation phantom limb pain. The proposed research study will&#xD;
      include subjects with an existing lower extremity amputation who experience intractable daily&#xD;
      phantom limb pain. A single ultrasound-guided treatment of cryoneurolysis (or sham&#xD;
      block-determined randomly like a flip of a coin) will be applied to the target nerve(s)&#xD;
      involved with the phantom pain. Although not required, each subject may return four months&#xD;
      later for the alternative treatment (if the first treatment is sham, then the second&#xD;
      treatment would be cryoneurolysis) so that all participants have the option of receiving the&#xD;
      active treatment. Subjects will be followed for a total of 12 months with data collected by&#xD;
      telephone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be asked to make no changes to their analgesic regimen for at least 1 month&#xD;
      prior to the cryoneurolysis procedure and continuing for 4 months until the measurement of&#xD;
      the primary end point-for the duration of the study, all patients will be allowed to continue&#xD;
      their pre-intervention analgesics. All subjects will have a peripheral intravenous catheter&#xD;
      inserted, standard noninvasive monitors applied, and oxygen administered via a facemask or&#xD;
      nasal cannula. Midazolam and fentanyl (IV) will be titrated for patient comfort. The specific&#xD;
      nerves targeted will be the sciatic and femoral (or their distal branches). The potential&#xD;
      cryoneurolysis sites will be cleansed with chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl alcohol. The&#xD;
      target nerves will be identified in a transverse cross-sectional (short axis) view using&#xD;
      ultrasound. A Tuohy-tip needle will be inserted beneath the ultrasound transducer and&#xD;
      directed until the needle tip is immediately adjacent to the target nerve. Local anesthetic&#xD;
      (1-3 mL, lidocaine 2%) will be injected. This will be repeated for the femoral nerve. Within&#xD;
      20 minutes of the second injection, the subject's limb pain level will be evaluated on the&#xD;
      0-10 NRS and if higher than at baseline prior to injection, the subject will NOT continue&#xD;
      with treatment and their participation in the study will terminate upon discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group assignment (randomization). Remaining subjects will be allocated to one of&#xD;
      two possible treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. cryoneurolysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. sham cryoneurolysis (placebo control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be computer-generated and stratified by enrolling institution in randomly&#xD;
      chosen block sizes. Cryoneurolysis probes are available that either (1) pass nitrous oxide to&#xD;
      the tip inducing freezing temperatures; or, (2) vent the nitrous oxide at the base of the&#xD;
      probe so that no gas reaches the probe tip, resulting in no temperature change (PainBlocker,&#xD;
      Epimed, Farmers Branch, Texas). Importantly, these probes are indistinguishable in&#xD;
      appearance. Unmasking will not occur until statistical analysis is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. The potential cryoneurolysis sites will be again cleansed with chlorhexidine&#xD;
      gluconate and isopropyl alcohol. With the same ultrasound transducer used to previously&#xD;
      administer local anesthetic, the target nerve will again be identified in a transverse&#xD;
      cross-sectional (short axis) view at or distal to the deposition of local anesthetic. A&#xD;
      cryoneurolysis device (PainBlocker, Epimed, Farmers Branch, Texas) will be inserted with the&#xD;
      appropriate randomization-designated probe (either active or sham/placebo) and nitrous oxide.&#xD;
      The cryoneurolysis device will be triggered using 3 cycles of 2-minute gas activation (active&#xD;
      or sham) separated by 1-minute defrost periods. The process will be repeated with the same&#xD;
      treatment probe for the femoral nerve (e.g., both nerves will receive either active&#xD;
      cryoneurolysis or sham/placebo, and not a mix of the two possible treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional crossover treatment. Four to 6 months following the initial treatment, subjects may&#xD;
      return for an optional repeated intervention procedure (&quot;crossover&quot;) with the alternative&#xD;
      treatment (either active cryoneurolysis or sham/placebo), again in a double-masked fashion&#xD;
      using the same protocol as described for the initial intervention. The crossover treatment is&#xD;
      not required for study participation, as the primary analyses will include a parallel study&#xD;
      design for the initial intervention evaluated prior to any crossover treatment. This&#xD;
      crossover will not affect the primary analyses, which will involve a parallel group study&#xD;
      design and investigate the effects of cryoneurolysis within 4 months of the initial&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements (endpoints). The primary end point will be the difference in average&#xD;
      daily phantom pain intensity at baseline and 4 months following the initial intervention&#xD;
      (measured with the NRS as part of the Brief Pain Inventory). The primary analyses will&#xD;
      compare the two treatments (inter-subject comparisons) during the initial treatment period in&#xD;
      which half of the subjects will receive active cryoneurolysis and the other half a&#xD;
      sham/placebo treatment. Endpoints will be evaluated at baseline and post-treatment (Day 0),&#xD;
      Days 1 and 7; and Months 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12. These same time points through Month 4 will be&#xD;
      evaluated following the optional second (crossover) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. The questionnaires for all subjects-regardless of enrolling center-will be&#xD;
      administered by telephone from the University of California San Diego by research&#xD;
      coordinators specifically trained in these instruments' application, minimizing inter-rater&#xD;
      discordance. Staff masked to treatment group assignment will perform all assessments.&#xD;
