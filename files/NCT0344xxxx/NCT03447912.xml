  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a matched-pairs community randomized controlled trial (CRCT) to examine the impact of&#xD;
      coalitions promoting smoke-free air policies on individual secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal will build the capacity of Georgia (GE) and Armenia (AM) researchers to conduct&#xD;
      high-quality mixed methods tobacco research and test the Community Coalition Action Theory&#xD;
      (CCAT) as a framework for impacting local community-driven policy change to inform such&#xD;
      processes for the region more broadly. Researchers from the GE National Center for Disease&#xD;
      Control (NCDC) and AM National Institute of Health (NIH) will collaborate with Emory to&#xD;
      execute the proposed research, train tobacco control researchers within their organizations&#xD;
      and partnering universities, and train practitioners within local communities to build local&#xD;
      coalitions for tobacco control policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-eight communities (14 per country) will participate in the population-level tobacco&#xD;
      survey at baseline and follow-up. Within each country, 7 communities will be randomized to&#xD;
      the intervention condition and 7 to the control condition (14 communities per condition). In&#xD;
      the intervention communities, public health center staff will form a coalition by recruiting&#xD;
      partner organizations from civil society and other government sectors (e.g., health care,&#xD;
      education), conduct situational assessment, and develop and implement action plans to promote&#xD;
      the adoption and enforcement of smoke-free policies in worksites and restaurants, settings&#xD;
      selected based on general support for smoke-free policies in these settings and the&#xD;
      likelihood of impacting population-level SHSe through widespread reach. The GE NCDC and AM&#xD;
      NIH will establish subcontracts with the local public health centers in the randomly selected&#xD;
      communities to provide funding for local staff to develop local coalitions and to support&#xD;
      program activities. The 14 communities assigned as controls will participate in the&#xD;
      population-level survey and be provided with a site-specific summary of findings but will not&#xD;
      participate in any aspects of the intervention. Additionally, to examine potential&#xD;
      contamination in the control communities, a follow-up interview will be conducted with public&#xD;
      health center leaders to assess any local coalition or grassroots actions regarding tobacco&#xD;
      control that may have naturally occurred or be influenced by coalition activity in other&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Public health efforts in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) could be catalyzed by&#xD;
      bolstering ways to optimally leverage local talents and resources, such as civil society.&#xD;
      Developing effective models for aligning civil society and governmental public health at the&#xD;
      local level in LMICs has the potential to impact a range of chronic diseases and risk&#xD;
      factors, including tobacco use. Local coalitions have been a dominant strategy in tobacco&#xD;
      control in the US, with well-documented success in establishing smoke-free policies&#xD;
      specifically. However, this approach has not been widely leveraged or well-studied in LMICs&#xD;
      or those with less democratic traditions than the US. Instead, in many LMICs, smoke-free&#xD;
      policy progress is largely initiated at the national level. Parallel civil society movements&#xD;
      at the local level may be needed to build support for and compliance with policies. Given&#xD;
      their sociopolitical histories and high tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe)&#xD;
      rates, Georgia (GE) and Armenia (AM) are two strategic settings for the proposed work. The&#xD;
      smoking prevalence is 57.7% and 52.3% in men (6th and 11th highest in the world) and 5.7% and&#xD;
      1.5% in women, respectively. Moreover, previous findings indicate extremely high rates of&#xD;
      SHSe. However, there is also documented high receptivity to public smoke-free policies&#xD;
      despite high use rates, particularly in worksites and restaurants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this matched-pairs community randomized controlled trial (CRCT), the impact of coalitions&#xD;
      promoting smoke-free air policies on individual secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) will be&#xD;
      examined. The Emory team will lead the oversight of the research design and execution of all&#xD;
      components of the research. This proposal will build the capacity of Georgia (GE) and Armenia&#xD;
      (AM) researchers to conduct high-quality mixed methods tobacco research and test the&#xD;
      Community Coalition Action Theory (CCAT) as a framework for impacting local community-driven&#xD;
      policy change to inform such processes for the region more broadly. Researchers from the GE&#xD;
      National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) and AM National Institute of Health (NIH) will&#xD;
      collaborate with Emory to execute the proposed research, train tobacco control researchers&#xD;
      within their organizations and partnering universities (Tbilisi State Medical University,&#xD;
      American University of Armenia), and train practitioners within local communities to build&#xD;
      local coalitions for tobacco control policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. conduct a matched-pair community randomized controlled trial in 28 municipalities in GE&#xD;
           and AM to examine the impact of local coalitions promoting the adoption of smoke-free&#xD;
           policies in worksites and restaurants, with the primary outcome of changes in SHSe over&#xD;
           time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. assess how community context and coalition factors influence adoption of organizational&#xD;
           and municipal smoke-free policies to provide an evidence-base for public health&#xD;
           practice;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. disseminate research findings regarding both the effectiveness and the process of&#xD;
           establishing and maintaining coalitions, and consequently increasing smoke-free policies&#xD;
           and reducing SHSe, to key stakeholders in GE and AM; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. capitalize on the proposed research and dissemination opportunities to build tobacco&#xD;
           control research capacity within the GE NCDC, AM NIH, and partnering universities, as&#xD;
           well as practice capacity within local public health centers and their civil society&#xD;
           partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-eight communities (14 per country) will participate in the population-level tobacco&#xD;
      survey at baseline and follow-up. Within each country, 7 communities will be randomized to&#xD;
      the intervention condition and 7 to the control condition (14 communities per condition). In&#xD;
      the intervention communities, public health center staff will form a coalition by recruiting&#xD;
      partner organizations from civil society and other government sectors (e.g., health care,&#xD;
      education), conduct situational assessment, and develop and implement action plans to promote&#xD;
      the adoption and enforcement of smoke-free policies in worksites and restaurants, settings&#xD;
      selected based on general support for smoke-free policies in these settings and the&#xD;
      likelihood of impacting population-level SHSe through widespread reach. The GE NCDC and AM&#xD;
      NIH will establish subcontracts with the local public health centers in the randomly selected&#xD;
      communities to provide funding for local staff to develop local coalitions and to support&#xD;
      program activities. The 14 communities assigned as controls will participate in the&#xD;
      population-level survey and be provided with a site-specific summary of findings but will not&#xD;
      participate in any aspects of the intervention. Additionally, to examine potential&#xD;
      contamination in the control communities, a follow-up interview will be conducted with public&#xD;
      health center leaders to assess any local coalition or grassroots actions regarding tobacco&#xD;
      control that may have naturally occurred or be influenced by coalition activity in other&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GE NCDC and AM NIH will conduct cross-sectional population-level surveys in Year 1&#xD;
      (baseline) and in Years 4/5 (follow-up) in the intervention and control communities. A&#xD;
      multi-stage, clustered sample design will be used to select 50 participants within each&#xD;
      municipality. The most recent census data for each country and the respective municipalities&#xD;
      will be used to establish the sampling frame.&#xD;
