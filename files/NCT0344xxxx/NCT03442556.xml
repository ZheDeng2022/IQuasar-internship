    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well docetaxel with carboplatin followed by rucaparib&#xD;
      camsylate works in treating patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      (spread outside of prostate and resistant to testosterone suppression) with homologous&#xD;
      recombination DNA repair deficiency. Chemotherapy drugs, such as docetaxel and carboplatin,&#xD;
      work to stop the growth of cancer cells, by stopping them from dividing or spreading.&#xD;
      Rucaparib camsylate may stop the growth of tumor cells with defects in the ability to repair&#xD;
      mistakes in DNA by forcing additional errors so that the cancer cells cannot overcome the&#xD;
      number of errors and will then die. Giving induction docetaxel and carboplatin followed by&#xD;
      maintenance rucaparib camsylate may work better in treating patients with castration&#xD;
      resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine radiographic progression free survival with 4 cycles of docetaxel with&#xD;
      carboplatin followed by maintenance rucaparib camsylate (rucaparib) in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer with homologous recombination&#xD;
      DNA repair deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess maximal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to induction docetaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess PSA response to switch maintenance with rucaparib. III. To assess PSA response&#xD;
      duration to docetaxel and carboplatin followed by switch maintenance with rucaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess time to PSA progression with induction docetaxel and carboplatin followed by&#xD;
      maintenance with rucaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess response of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) and carboplatin IV on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive rucaparib camsylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
