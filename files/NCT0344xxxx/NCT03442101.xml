  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosis is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number&#xD;
      of patients. In order to identify new therapeutic targets, this study will longitudinally&#xD;
      characterize the underlying pathologies in those with poor treatment response using&#xD;
      complimentary brain imaging modalities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying&#xD;
      pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets.&#xD;
      All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical&#xD;
      response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third&#xD;
      non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic&#xD;
      abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies&#xD;
      in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and&#xD;
      effectively develop new treatments. The investigators propose to longitudinally follow&#xD;
      treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP)&#xD;
      subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have already identified provisional markers for several different&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate,&#xD;
      brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that they can track with brain imaging. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to&#xD;
      delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By&#xD;
      characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic&#xD;
      alterations, the investigators will further complement their mechanistic understanding of the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to study 117 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication&#xD;
      naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. The investigators will&#xD;
      follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an&#xD;
      adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks.&#xD;
      All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. The investigators will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting&#xD;
      state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain&#xD;
      biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to&#xD;
      interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater&#xD;
      opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in&#xD;
      those with poor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification&#xD;
      of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct&#xD;
      therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology.&#xD;
