    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to define the complex genetic and pathogenic basis of&#xD;
      thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and other forms of aortopathy and/or aortic valve disease by&#xD;
      identifying novel disease-causing genes and by identifying important genetic modifiers for&#xD;
      aortic and aortic valve disease severity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a type of aortopathy describing dilation of the proximal&#xD;
      aortic dimensions including the aortic root, which is a risk factor for aortic dissection and&#xD;
      sudden cardiac death. TAA and other forms of aortopathy (e.g. aortic tortuosity or aortic&#xD;
      hypoplasia/stenosis) develop in the presence or absence of additional cardiovascular&#xD;
      malformations including bicuspid aortic valve. TAA is associated with connective tissue&#xD;
      disorders (e.g. Marfan syndrome), and familial clustering has been identified in a&#xD;
      significant proportion of nonsyndromic cases, establishing high heritability. Pedigree&#xD;
      analysis of TAA kindreds clearly identifies complex inheritance; however, progress towards&#xD;
      understanding the genetic basis of TAA and other forms of aortopathy and, ultimately, the&#xD;
      susceptibility to aortic dissection remains incomplete. There is a clinical need to develop&#xD;
      novel methods for predicting disease risk based on genotype and phenotype, to further&#xD;
      elucidate the genetic and pathogenic mechanisms of aortopathy, and to improve medical and&#xD;
      surgical therapies. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that individual genetic&#xD;
      variation modulates susceptibility to disease severity and progression. The goals of this&#xD;
      study are 1) to ascertain a cohort of subjects who have aortopathy and/or aortic valve&#xD;
      disease including TAA or who have genetic risk for the development of aortopathy and/or&#xD;
      aortic valve disease, 2) to collect paired blood and tissue samples from well-characterized&#xD;
      subjects, family members of subjects, and controls to perform genome-wide DNA sequence,&#xD;
      histopathologic, transcriptional, and proteomic analyses, and 3) to establish a tissue&#xD;
      biorepository with detailed phenotype information to facilitate a broad spectrum of current&#xD;
      and future studies.&#xD;
