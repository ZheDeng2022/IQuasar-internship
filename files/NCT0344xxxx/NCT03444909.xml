    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to create a comparative database, with data obtained with a new&#xD;
      monitoring device of pregnant women,Toconaute, and two standard : a clinical&#xD;
      cardiotocograph,and an electrophysiological signal medical device. It will allow to optimize&#xD;
      the development of this new device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the Toconaute and/or the electrophysiological medical device will succeed to the&#xD;
      usual monitoring of pregnant women with a cardiotocograph. It will not change their medical&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include up to 35 pregnant women between 24 and 41 weeks of amenorrhea that&#xD;
      requires discontinuous monitoring. It will last about 12 months, with an estimated inclusion&#xD;
      period of 11 month.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to compare measurements for different gestational age, between: the&#xD;
      standard cardiotocograph with those of our device, or between the standard cardiotocograph&#xD;
      and the Toconaute and the electrophysiological device, or between the Toconaute and the&#xD;
      electrophysiological device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a second objective, we want to build a database between the cardiotocograph, the Toconaute&#xD;
      and the electrophysiological device, to optimize the development of the Toconaute device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include up to 35 healthy adult women pregnant between 24 and 41 weeks of&#xD;
      amenorrhea requiring discontinuous monitoring. The trial will not change the usual medical&#xD;
      management of women, the Toconaute device will be tested following their usual monitoring.&#xD;
      The trial will last approximately 12 months, with an estimated inclusion period of 11 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be able to identify possible adverse effects related to the device, women&#xD;
      participating simultaneously in another clinical trial can not be included. A delay of 1&#xD;
      month minimum after participation in another clinical trial is requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks associated with the use of the Toconaute in the trial are considered low and&#xD;
      acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating women will receive information from the investigator or the midwife who&#xD;
      represents it, and will cover all the points provided for in Article L1122-1. They will be&#xD;
      informed of the risks and their right to refuse to participate in a search or to withdraw&#xD;
      their consent at any time without incurring any liability or prejudice. Women wishing to&#xD;
      participate will receive the newsletter and then sign a consent. A copy of the consent will&#xD;
      be issued to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the test, the care of the pregnant woman is not changed, the use of the Toconaute&#xD;
      will succeed to their usual monitoring with a cardiotocograph. The investigating physician or&#xD;
      midwife will therefore follow the recommendations of the usual medical procedure regarding&#xD;
      measurements performed by external cardiotocography.&#xD;
