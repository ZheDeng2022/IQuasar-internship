    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes LN-145&#xD;
      (LN-145) or LN-145-S1 works in treating patients with ovarian cancer, anaplastic thyroid&#xD;
      cancer, osteosarcoma, or other bone and soft tissue sarcomas that do not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory) or that has come back (relapsed). LN-145 is made by collecting and growing&#xD;
      specialized white blood cells (called T-cells) that are collected from the patient's tumor.&#xD;
      LN-145-S1 is made using a modified process that chooses a specific portion of the T-cells.&#xD;
      The T cells may specifically recognize, target, and kill the tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate efficacy using objective response rate (ORR) using Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 in each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the disease control rate (DCR) within and across cohorts. II. Determine the&#xD;
      duration of response (DOR). III. Determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS). IV. Further characterize the safety profile of adoptive cell therapy with&#xD;
      tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) across multiple tumor types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish duration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) persistence. II. Compare the&#xD;
      molecular and immunological features of tumors before and after TIL therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Prospectively evaluate the existing immunotherapy response criteria (immune-related&#xD;
      [ir]RECIST) as the best response assessment tool for TIL therapy among a diverse group of&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To investigate TIL attributes (CD8 percentage [%], CD27 and CD28 expression) and&#xD;
      correlation with response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess tumor marker (CA-125) response in patients who produce this tumor marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THYROID CANCER COHORT: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on&#xD;
      days -7 and -6, fludarabine IV over 15-30 minutes daily on days -5 to -1, autologous tumor&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes LN-145 IV over 45 minutes on day 0 and aldesleukin IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on days 1-4 for up to 6 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVARIAN CANCER, OSTEOSARCOMA, OR OTHER BONE AND SOFT TISSUE SARCOMAS COHORT (CLOSED TO&#xD;
      ENROLLMENT): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -7 and -6, fludarabine&#xD;
      IV over 15-30 minutes daily on days -5 to -1, LN-145-S1 IV over 45 minutes on day 0 and&#xD;
      aldesleukin IV over 30 minutes on days 1-4 for up to 6 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICI OVARIAN CANCER, OSTEOSARCOMA, OR OTHER BONE AND SOFT TISSUE SARCOMAS COHORT: Within 2-4&#xD;
      weeks prior to surgery, patients receive a single dose of nivolumab IV over 30 minutes,&#xD;
      followed by a single dose of ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes Patients receive cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      IV over 2 hours on days -7 and -6, fludarabine IV over 15-30 minutes daily on days -5 to -1,&#xD;
      LN-145-S1 IV over 45 minutes on day 0 and aldesleukin IV over 30 minutes on days 1-4 for up&#xD;
      to 6 doses. Within 12 weeks after receiving LN-145-S1, patients receive nivolumab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cohorts treated without immune checkpoint inhibitors, completion of treatment is defined&#xD;
      as having received any volume of LN-145/LN-145-S1 infusion followed by at least 1 dose of&#xD;
      adjuvant IL-2. For cohorts treated with TIL + ICI, completion of treatment will correspond to&#xD;
      the last dose of nivolumab or IL2 (if the subject is deemed unsuitable to receive adjuvant&#xD;
      nivolumab). Patients are followed up at 18 weeks, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months, then every 3&#xD;
      months for at least 3 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Primary immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic steroid therapy, however prednisone or its equivalent is allowed at =&lt; 10&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a significant psychiatric disease, which in the opinion of the principal&#xD;
             investigator or his/her designee, would prevent adequate informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of clinically significant autoimmune disease including active, known, or&#xD;
             suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with resolved side effects from prior&#xD;
             checkpoint inhibitor therapy, vitiligo, psoriasis, type 1 diabetes or resolved&#xD;
             childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that require&#xD;
             intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded.&#xD;
             Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren's syndrome will&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients with vitiligo or alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency stable on hormone&#xD;
                  replacement therapy&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients without active disease in the last disease in the last 5 years may be&#xD;
                  included but only after consultation with the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with celiac disease controlled by diet alone.&#xD;

             basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ&#xD;
             cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy. For the thyroid&#xD;
             cancer cohort, subjects have a higher likelihood of prior cancers. Therefore, for this&#xD;
             cohort, history of prior thyroid cancer or other indolent cancers is not considered&#xD;
             exclusionary if in the opinion of the treating physician such cancers are indolent or&#xD;
             unlikely to affect the overall prognosis based on the active thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided&#xD;
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned&#xD;
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using&#xD;
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to initiation of lymphodepletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the initiation of lymphodepletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a contraindication to or history of hypersensitivity reaction to any&#xD;
             components or excipients of the TIL therapy or the other study drugs:&#xD;
             non-myeloablative-lymphodepletion (NMA-LD) (cyclophosphamide, mesna, and fludarabine);&#xD;
             IL-2; antibiotics of the aminoglycoside group (i.e., streptomycin, gentamicin); any&#xD;
             component of the TIL infusion product formulation including human serum albumin (HSA),&#xD;
             IL-2, and dextran-40, nivolumab or ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that in the investigator's judgement would significantly increase&#xD;
             the risks of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anaplastic and poorly-differentiated thyroid cancer cohort only: BRAFV600E mutated&#xD;
             thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anaplastic and poorly-differentiated thyroid cancer cohort only: Previous systemic&#xD;
             therapy is not allowed except for chemotherapy used as a radiosensitizing agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anaplastic and poorly-differentiated thyroid cancer cohort only: Any disease that is&#xD;
             untreated or patient refuses treatment that could lead to airway compromise during TIL&#xD;
             manufacturing time.&#xD;
