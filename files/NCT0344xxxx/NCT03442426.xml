  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that older Canadians are high users of health care services. What is less&#xD;
      well known is that the health care system is not well-designed to meet the needs of those who&#xD;
      use it most. Older persons look to their primary care practitioners to assess their needs and&#xD;
      coordinate their care. Unfortunately, the health concerns of older persons are often missed&#xD;
      in too-short office visits. They may need care from a variety of providers and services, but&#xD;
      this care is often not well-coordinated. Older persons and their caregivers are the experts&#xD;
      in their own needs and preferences, but often do not have a chance to participate fully in&#xD;
      treatment decisions or care planning. As a result, they may have health problems that are not&#xD;
      properly assessed, managed or treated resulting in poorer health, as well as preventable and&#xD;
      expensive emergency department visits and hospital stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving the health of older Canadians means identifying health problems early. It means&#xD;
      providing timely supports so that manageable concerns do not spiral out of control. And,&#xD;
      above all, it means helping health care providers actively engage older patients and their&#xD;
      family caregivers as partners in care. Patients want to make informed choices about their&#xD;
      health and the care they receive, based on their personal values, preferences and goals, and&#xD;
      informed by available evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine primary care clinics in three provinces (Quebec, Ontario, Alberta) will use a quick&#xD;
      screening tool to identify older patients who are at risk of becoming frail. This will help&#xD;
      initiate referral to health care or support services where necessary. Innovative technology&#xD;
      will be used to streamline the referral process and help assist older adults in&#xD;
      decision-making about their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With support from the Canadian Frailty Network (CFN, formerly TVN), researchers,&#xD;
      collaborators, health care providers and older adults from across Canada will work together&#xD;
      to transform primary health care for frail elderly Canadians.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The team will be implementing evidence-based and tested interventions as a coherent strategy&#xD;
      to enhance primary health care for older adults, working collaboratively with study sites,&#xD;
      older adults, and other stakeholders to develop a scalable and sustainable model. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to develop the capacity of primary health care teams to identify, assess,&#xD;
      and support older adults (70+) who are frail, and to delay or prevent decline for those at&#xD;
      lower risk. The project will support patient/caregiver engagement, and stronger care&#xD;
      coordination and integration with other health and social services. The primary research&#xD;
      question is: compared to usual care in primary care settings, does the proposed model improve&#xD;
      health, social and economic outcomes for frail and at-risk older Canadians (aged 70+)? The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that older adults will benefit from screening, active engagement in&#xD;
      care planning, and appropriate referrals to services earlier in their care trajectories. In&#xD;
      addition to improving health outcomes and quality of life for patients, more proactive&#xD;
      interventions can reduce costly emergency department visits and unplanned hospital&#xD;
      admissions.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>We have proposed a strong quasi-experimental alternative with inclusion of a usual care group of patients prior to initiation of the intervention. Specifically, our study will use a quasi-experimental control group design with pre-test and post-test. Our control group will receive usual care, and the intervention group will receive the proposed intervention (screening, care coordination and individual care plans, engagement in decision making, and technology support). The usual care group will be followed for 6 months after study entry (baseline period). Once completed, the intervention will be implemented and recruitment for the intervention group will begin. The intervention group will also be followed for 6 months after study entry (intervention period). We will be able to compare the intervention group with the usual care group.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>The tool will be used at 4 time points: at baseline recruitment (B1), then 6 months later (B2), then 6 months later following intervention implementation (I1), and 6 months later (I2). Scores will be compared pre and post.</time_frame>
    <description>This tools measures specific items related to the Chronic Care Model, and reports on patient experience with the system. There are 5 sub scales (patient activation, delivery system, goal setting, problem solving and coordination) and 26-items. This tool has been validated.</description>

    <description>This tool measures health-related quality of life. The tool is comprised of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression).</description>

    <measure>Assessing Healthcare Utilization across different time points</measure>
    <time_frame>The tool will be used at 4 time points: at baseline recruitment (B1), then 6 months later (B2), then 6 months later following intervention implementation (I1), and 6 months later (I2). Scores will be compared pre and post.</time_frame>

    <measure>Assessing change in Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>GAS will be completed with a small sub-set of participants during qualitative interviews at baseline recruitment (B1), then 6 months later (B2), then 6 months later following intervention implementation (I1), and 6 months later (I2).</time_frame>
    <description>GAS is an individualized, client-centred goal-setting and measurement approach that can accommodate a client's individual wishes, values and preferences. Goals are scaled on a five-point rating scale from -2 (much less than expected) to +2 (much better than expected). The GAS formula translates the total GAS score into a standardized score, with a score of 50 representing overall goal attainment.</description>
