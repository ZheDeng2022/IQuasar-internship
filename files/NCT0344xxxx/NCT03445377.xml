  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine whether real-time continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring (CGM) for 8 weeks is more efficacious compared to self-monitoring of blood glucose&#xD;
      (SMBG) in young adults with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, randomised, crossover design study, involving a 2-week&#xD;
      run-in period with blinded CGM, followed by two 8 weeks study periods during which subjects&#xD;
      will monitor daily glucose levels either with real-time CGM or SMBG in random order. Subjects&#xD;
      will wear a blinded CGM for a 3-week period during the Control phase. A total of up to 40&#xD;
      subjects (aiming for 30 completed subjects) aged 16 to 24 years with T1D will be recruited&#xD;
      through diabetes clinics and other established methods in participating centres. Subjects who&#xD;
      drop out of the study within the first 2 weeks of the first intervention period will be&#xD;
      replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive appropriate training in the use of real-time CGM. Subjects will have&#xD;
      regular contact with the study team during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is time spent in target range between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L as recorded by&#xD;
      CGM. Secondary outcomes are the HbA1c, time spent with glucose levels above and below target,&#xD;
      as recorded by CGM, and other CGM-based metrics. Measures of subject's responses in terms of&#xD;
      daily diabetes management, diabetes distress and diabetes technology use and acceptance will&#xD;
      also be evaluated in this study.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be reviewed and a blood sample will be taken for the measurement of HbA1c. Training on the use of DEXCOM G5 or similar will be provided by the research team. Competency on the use of the system will be evaluated. Participants will be advised to use real-time CGM continuously for the next 8 weeks. At the end of the first intervention, a blood sample for the measurement of HbA1c will be taken. Validated questionnaires evaluating diabetes-related distress, management and user acceptance will be completed.</description>
