  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ageing is characterized by a loss of muscle mass that is detrimental for physical function&#xD;
      and metabolic health and increases the risk of mortality. The loss of muscle protein mass&#xD;
      with ageing is characterized by a blunted muscle anabolic response to nutrition and exercise.&#xD;
      Thus, interventions to counteract muscle anabolic blunting in old age might assist in the&#xD;
      long-term maintenance of muscle mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphatidic acid (hereafter defined as 'PA') is a novel nutrient compound that has been&#xD;
      suggested to play an important role in muscle growth. Oral consumption of PA may amplify the&#xD;
      signalling response to nutrition and exercise and restore muscle anabolic sensitivity in&#xD;
      older adults. In order for PA to be 'clinically' applied as a means to mitigate muscle loss&#xD;
      in aged populations, we must first understand the efficacy and mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      anabolic properties of this compound, which have yet to be defined in man. The proposed pilot&#xD;
      study is needed to investigate the acute muscle metabolic properties of oral PA&#xD;
      supplementation in older individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixteen healthy (non-obese, non-diabetic, non-smokers) older males aged 65-75 yrs will&#xD;
      initially complete a lower-limb strength assessment and undergo a body composition scan.&#xD;
      Between 4-14 days after these initial assessments, participants will be assigned to co-ingest&#xD;
      1.5g of either phosphatidic acid (N= 8; PA) or a non-caloric placebo (N=8; PL) after&#xD;
      following a bout of moderate intensity, single leg resistance exercise. A stable isotope&#xD;
      infusion will be combined with serial muscle biopsies from the thigh of each leg to determine&#xD;
      the measure rates of muscle protein synthesis in the fasted state and in the 'early' and&#xD;
      'late' phase of feeding-only and exercise-plus-feeding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 16 healthy (non-obese, non-diabetic, non-smokers) elderly men&#xD;
      aged 65-80 yrs to complete a double-blinded, parallel designed study, in which they will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to a phosphatidic acid (N= 8; PA) or placebo (N=8; PL) treatment group,&#xD;
      matched closely for anthropometric characteristics. Participants will be recreationally&#xD;
      active, but not involved in structured exercise training. All study procedures will be&#xD;
      clearly explained and written consent obtained prior to study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary assessments Following explanation of the study and the acquisition of informed&#xD;
      consent, participants will report to our laboratory at 0800 in an overnight fasted-state and&#xD;
      having refrained from strenuous physical activity for &gt;24 hrs. Participants will be weighed&#xD;
      on a digital scale to the nearest 0.1 kg in light clothing. A dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)&#xD;
      scan will be conducted to determine body composition (fat and fat-free mass). Following DXA&#xD;
      scanning, single-leg one repetition maximum strength (1RM) will be determined for knee&#xD;
      extension and leg press exercise machines. Selection of the limb to be exercised (dominant or&#xD;
      non-dominant) will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental trials Between 4 and 14 days after the preliminary assessments, participants&#xD;
      will report to the laboratory at ∼0700 following an overnight fast, having refrained from&#xD;
      strenuous physical activity for 72 hrs previously. A catheter will be inserted into a forearm&#xD;
      vein of both arms for frequent blood sampling (∼80mL in total) and a continuous infusion of a&#xD;
      stable isotope amino acid tracer (L- [ring] 13C6 phenylalanine). Participants will remain in&#xD;
      a supine position throughout the trial with the exception of the exercise bout. After 150 min&#xD;
      of steady-state tracer infusion a muscle biopsy will be obtained from the vastus lateralis&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle of a randomly selected leg under local anesthesia (1% lidocaine) using the&#xD;
      Bergström biopsy needle technique. Thereafter, participants will perform a bout of single-leg&#xD;
      resistance exercise on the opposite leg. Exercise will consist of 6 sets of knee extension&#xD;
      resistance exercise at 75% of the pre-determined 1RM; a protocol designed to elicit 8-12&#xD;
      repetitions per set prior to the onset of volitional fatigue. Immediately after exercise,&#xD;
      participants will ingest 750mg of PA or a placebo (both in non-identifiable capsule form)&#xD;
      with water and a further 750mg of PA or placebo at 60 mins post-exercise. Thereafter,&#xD;
      participants will lie in a supine position for the remainder of the trial. An individual with&#xD;
      no direct study involvement will administer treatments in a double-blind manner.&#xD;
      Investigators will be un-blinded to treatment arms upon completion of data analysis. At 150&#xD;
      and 300 min following treatment consumption muscle biopsies will be obtained from both legs.&#xD;
      Thus, a total of 5 invasive muscle biopsies will be obtained during the trial, which&#xD;
      precludes the use of a crossover design in older individuals. Each biopsy will be obtained&#xD;
      from a separate incision spaced ∼3cm apart. This model of study design will permit us&#xD;
      determine rates of muscle protein synthesis in the postabsorptive state and over the early&#xD;
      (0-2.5 h), late (2.5-5 h) and aggregate (0-5 h) time-course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses To calculate muscle protein synthesis, the investigators will adopt&#xD;
      sophisticated mass spectrometry techniques to determine isotopic tracer enrichment in&#xD;
      biopsy-isolated muscle proteins and plasma. Intramuscular &quot;anabolic signals&quot; (in the&#xD;
      mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway, a key regulator of cell size) will be determined via&#xD;
      Western Blot (a technique to detect the content of specific phospho-proteins). Plasma insulin&#xD;
      concentrations will be measured by immunoassay and plasma lipid profiles by Gas&#xD;
      Chromatography Mass Spectrometry.&#xD;
