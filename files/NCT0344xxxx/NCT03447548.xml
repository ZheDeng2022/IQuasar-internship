  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young people who are at great risk for developing psychosis have cognitive deficits which are&#xD;
      strongly related to functioning in the community. This study looks to target a specific&#xD;
      cognitive skill called processing speed to see if improving the ability to process&#xD;
      information in a timely manner will improve social function in adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      at risk for developing schizophrenia. Half will receive neurofeedback cognitive training&#xD;
      targeting processing speed while the other half will receive an active control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Processing speed deficits are characteristic of schizophrenia and related to its functional&#xD;
      impairment, including in its nascent stages, during a putatively prodromal or clinical high&#xD;
      risk period. These cognitive deficits have proven relatively refractory to pharmacologic&#xD;
      strategies, though the deficits can be improved with cognitive remediation programs in&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The cognitive gains can then generalize to functional improvement,&#xD;
      particularly early in the course of illness (i.e. first episode psychosis). Although&#xD;
      processing speed deficits are also prevalent in young people identified as at clinical high&#xD;
      risk for psychosis (i.e. &quot;psychosis risk syndrome&quot;), and related to their concurrent impaired&#xD;
      function and predictive of later psychosis (onset of which occurs in 20-25% of clinical high&#xD;
      risk cohorts), little research has focused on how to remediate these deficits in clinical&#xD;
      high risk patients. Remediating core cognitive deficits in clinical high risk patients could&#xD;
      plausibly address present functional impairment in these young people and moderate illness&#xD;
      progression. The investigators propose to conduct a double-blind randomized trial in 105&#xD;
      clinical high risk patients to examine a focal processing speed training program versus an&#xD;
      active control in terms of improvement in processing speed and social function, and reduction&#xD;
      in prodromal symptom severity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Case identification and ascertainment depends on the fulfillment of the Criteria of&#xD;
             Prodromal States as evaluated using the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes:&#xD;
             (1) attenuated positive symptom state which includes the emergence or worsening over&#xD;
             the past year of non-psychotic disturbances in thought content, thought process or&#xD;
             perceptual abnormality, (2) brief intermittent positive symptoms, and (3) genetic risk&#xD;
             and deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Processing speed at least 0.5 Standard Deviation below the norm, as indexed by&#xD;
             baseline performance on Digit Symbol Coding of 8 or below&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age range 12-25 (this age range also comprises the main period of risk for psychosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent by patients &gt;18 years old, and written assent by subjects &lt;18&#xD;
             years old, with written informed consent by both parents (unless one is deceased or&#xD;
             unavailable). Participants who turn 18 while in the study will be re-consented as&#xD;
             adults through written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or past diagnosis of psychotic disorder noted at baseline assessment&#xD;
             (schizophrenia, schizophreniform, bipolar, schizoaffective, major depression with&#xD;
             psychotic features, substance-induced psychosis, psychosis due to a medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurological, neuroendocrine or major medical disorders: as putative prodromal&#xD;
             symptoms could be secondary to these and unrelated to risk for primary psychotic&#xD;
             disorders (clinical interview), including seizure disorder and history of significant&#xD;
             traumatic brain injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intelligence Quotient &lt; 70: as putative prodromal symptoms could be secondary to these&#xD;
             and unrelated to risk for primary psychotic disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive symptoms that occur only in the context of substance abuse or withdrawal&#xD;
             (i.e. within one month), so as not to include those at risk for substance-induced&#xD;
             psychotic disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of fluency in English: subjects must speak English to complete behavioral&#xD;
             assessments for which psychometric properties have been established in English,&#xD;
             complete cognitive training, and in order to comprehend and comply with protocol&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substance abuse or dependence (including alcohol and marijuana) in previous six&#xD;
             months: for purposes of standardization and interpretation of cognitive data.&#xD;
