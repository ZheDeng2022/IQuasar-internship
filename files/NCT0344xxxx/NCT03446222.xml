  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of catheter ablation versus the Wolf Mini-Maze surgical&#xD;
      ablation for rhythm control in patients with persistent afib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Higher success rates have been achieved after a single surgical ablation when compared to&#xD;
      catheter ablation, however contiguous and transmural lesions are not always guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though, catheter ablation is now being offered for symptomatic persistent AF, recurrence&#xD;
      after the index procedure in such a persistent AF substrate is not unusual. Redo-catheter&#xD;
      ablation is routinely offered for such patients; however long term success still remains low.&#xD;
      Non-pulmonary vein triggers are often targeted in such redo-catheter ablation procedures;&#xD;
      though this approach remains controversial. More recently, the Wolf Mini-Maze procedure has&#xD;
      been utilized with promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to randomize a group of persistent AF patients to undergo either catheter&#xD;
      ablation or the surgical mini-maze procedure with left atrial appendage (LAA) ligation&#xD;
