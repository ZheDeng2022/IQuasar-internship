  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research was to relate the occurrence of post-endodontic pain after&#xD;
      single-visit RCT using Balanced Force technique and two reciprocating system when cryotherapy&#xD;
      is used. Methodology: All 216 patients had upper or lower molar, premolar or anterior teeth&#xD;
      selected for conventional RCT for prosthetic reasons detected with only vital pulps. Of the&#xD;
      sample of 216 teeth, were selected to the 3 instrumentation methods. For hand&#xD;
      instrumentation, Balanced Force were used. All canals were clean and shaped with hand Flex-R&#xD;
      files (fMoyco/Union Broach, York PA, USA). For mechanical shaping, all instruments were used&#xD;
      with a micro motor (VDW, Munich Germany). WaveOne and Reciproc instruments. Final irrigation&#xD;
      with cold (6oC) 17% EDTA served as a lubricant.&#xD;

      Patient selection Two hundred and sixteen of 245 patients (119 women and 97 men) aged 18-65&#xD;
      years were incorporated in this research while 29 were excluded as not meeting the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. (Fig. 1). Sample size estimate was achieved according with a method for this&#xD;
      specific purpose (Cochran's method, 1986). Therefore, the 56 teeth allocated to each group&#xD;
      were adequate to confirm an essential sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hand instrumentation, the Balanced Force technique was used. All root canals were shaped&#xD;
      with hand Flex-R files (Moyco/Union Broach, York PA, USA). Gates-Glidden drills (Dentsply&#xD;
      Maillefer) sizes #2 and #3 were used at the orifice of the root canals. For mechanical&#xD;
      preparations, all instruments were used with a micro motor (VDW Silver Motor, VDW, Munich&#xD;
      Germany). Torque and rotation were preset for each Reciproc or WaveOne instrument. Rotary&#xD;
      Ni-Ti instruments were used in continuous brushing rotary motion and reciprocating mode&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dentinal debris was eliminated from the file with a gauze, instantaneously to the instrument&#xD;
      change (WaveOne) or after 2-3 in-and-out (pecking) movements (Reciproc) following the&#xD;
      manufacturers' recommendations. Each root canal was irrigated with 2.5mL 2.6% NaOCl.&#xD;
      Irrigation was performed using a 24-gauge needle (Max-I-Probe; Tulsa Dental, York, PA) and a&#xD;
      31-G NaviTip needle (Ultradent Products Inc, South Jordan, UT) when reaching the WL after&#xD;
      each instrument insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group BF. For the Balanced Force group, the root canals were shaped and shaped using a #40&#xD;
      instrument for thin or curved canals and a #55 file for wide canals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group WON. For the WaveOne group, a file size 25/.08 was used to prepare narrow, straight and&#xD;
      curved canals, and a file size 40/.08 was used for large and wide canals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three in-and-out pecking motions were used with an amplitude of not more than 3 mm until&#xD;
      reaching the estimated working length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group REC. The R25 (size 25/ .08) instrument was used in thin and curved root canals, and R40&#xD;
      files (40/ .06) were used in wide root canals. Three in-and-out pecking motions were used&#xD;
      with an amplitude of not more than 3 mm until reaching the estimated working length.&#xD;
