  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fascia is defined as the soft tissue component of the connective tissue system. It is a&#xD;
      continuous mesh that has several functions such as maintaining structural integrity and&#xD;
      providing support and protection. Ligaments are part of the dense connective tissue system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies conducted for ankle retinacula, which are thickened bands of fascia, also confirmed&#xD;
      the presence of nervous tissue and proprioceptors within. Specific changes are seen in the&#xD;
      MRI of ankle retinacula of individuals with chronic ankle instability. These changes include&#xD;
      thickening of subcutaneous tissue. These structural changes may be responsible for&#xD;
      interrupting the signals from the mechanoreceptors or also in damaging them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since fascial manipulation can help reduce the densifications of deep fascia, it is possible&#xD;
      that on restoring the original structural and material properties, the proprioception may&#xD;
      improve due to clearer signals from the mechanoreceptors. For a normal individual, recurrent&#xD;
      sprains may lead to occupational absence and difficulty with their ADLs. Hence, there is a&#xD;
      need for this study to determine the influence of FM on chronic ankle instability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is defined as &quot;repetitive bouts of lateral ankle instability&#xD;
      due to the sprain of the lateral collateral ligament of the ankle, resulting in numerous&#xD;
      ankle sprains, episodes of giving way and decreased physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with chronic ankle instability often complain of repeated turning of the ankle&#xD;
      especially on uneven surfaces, self-reported feelings of the ankle feeling wobbly way and a&#xD;
      past history of at least one severe lateral ankle sprain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recurrence of ankle sprains can be attributed to the proprioceptive deficits that occur&#xD;
      due to joint deafferentation. Freeman et al originally proposed that joint deafferentation is&#xD;
      the loss of sensory input from the articular mechanoreceptors located in the capsule and&#xD;
      ligaments of the affected joint. Proprioceptive deficits manifest in the form of impaired&#xD;
      balance and postural control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of fascial manipulation on&#xD;
      improving ankle instability by measuring pre- and post-intervention measures of postural sway&#xD;
      and ankle range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Luigi Stecco's biomechanical model acts as the foundation for describing the framework of the&#xD;
      fascial system. This model describes a myofascial unit (MFU) as the functional unit of this&#xD;
      system. A myofascial unit consists of unidirectional muscle fibers, fascia, nerve structures&#xD;
      and other retinacular structures such as joint capsules and ligaments. Two crucial points can&#xD;
      be identified along a myofascial unit. These points are known as the centre of perception&#xD;
      (CP) and centre of coordination (CC). A total of six myofascial units have been established&#xD;
      for each body segment and it is in these myofascial units that dysfunction will be seen. The&#xD;
      indication or exhibition of these dysfunctions varies from one individual to the next.&#xD;
      However, the etiology remains universal i.e. densification of the CC due to abnormal tensile&#xD;
      and mechanical stresses. Movement and palpation assessments are carried out to identify the&#xD;
      involved CCs which are focused on during treatment using fascial manipulation.&#xD;
