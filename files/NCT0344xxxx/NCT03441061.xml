    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well inotuzumab ozogamicin works in treating patients with&#xD;
      B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia with positive minimal residual disease. Inotuzumab&#xD;
      ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody called inotuzumab linked to a toxic agent called&#xD;
      ozogamicin. Inotuzumab ozogamicin attaches to B cell-specific CD22 cancer cells in a targeted&#xD;
      way and kills them.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients B-cell acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in complete morphologic remission with positive minimal residual&#xD;
      disease (MRD) in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate other efficacy endpoints such as overall survival and MRD negativity rate by&#xD;
      flow cytometry and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) overall and after the first cycle, as&#xD;
      well as safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 8.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 day and then periodically&#xD;
      every 6 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with B-lineage ALL in hematologic complete remission (CR) with molecular&#xD;
             failure (i.e., had never achieved an MRD-negativity status before inotuzumab&#xD;
             ozogamicin) or had a molecular relapse (i.e., became MRD positive after having been&#xD;
             MRD negative) starting at any time point after 3 months of frontline therapy.&#xD;
             Molecular disease or minimal residual disease is defined by a value of at least of&#xD;
             10^-4 (0.01%) by multicolor flow cytometry, PCR and/or next-generation sequencing&#xD;
             (NGS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with B-lineage ALL in at least marrow CR in salvage 1 and beyond with MRD&#xD;
