  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is frequently reported in subjects with trisomy&#xD;
      21. The consequences of this syndrome are expressed in various disorders such as cognitive&#xD;
      and cardiovascular alterations. It is also reported a premature exhaustion with the&#xD;
      achievement of various professional or recreational activities, as well as an increase in the&#xD;
      frequency of daytime sleepiness. In trisomy 21, there are factors that are systematically&#xD;
      associated with obstructive apnea. The identification of these factors would make it possible&#xD;
      to diagnose OSAS earlier, under-diagnosed in the population with trisomy 21 even though these&#xD;
      OSAS are associated with increased cardiovascular risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify the predictive factors associated with sleep apnea in&#xD;
      the trisomy population in order to propose early detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSAS treatment in a young adult with Down syndrome could reduce physical fatigue apparition&#xD;
      during various activities, reduce daytime sleepiness, and have a positive impact on physical&#xD;
      fitness, and therefore more broadly on health.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The predictive factors for OSA that will be studied are: physical activity level, dentofacial&#xD;
      disharmonies, blood parameters, motor disabilities, heart rate variability parameters&#xD;
      measured during sleep and during autonomic nervous stimulation by orthostatic test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these factors will be linked to the data obtained by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. polysomnography&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. by the joint use of seismocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSAS lead to many associated disorders, which identified early can be better supported to&#xD;
      limit the deleterious effects of this OSAS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) a sudden and repeated activation of the sympathetic nervous system triggered by sleep&#xD;
      fragmentation (ii) intermittent hypoxia associated with OSAS may increase insulin resistance&#xD;
      through the involvement of an inflammatory state and oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) a significant level of diurnal fatigue limiting activities, thus promoting a sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle and increasing cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several secondary objectives will therefore be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can OSAS be predicted by the existence of autonomic dysfunction?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can OSAS be predicted by specific biological disturbances?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can OSAS be predicted by the presence of a specific cranial structure?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Can OSAS be predicted by an insufficient level of physical activity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally does the use seismocardiography make it possible to identify quickly and early these&#xD;
      risk factors linked to OSAS?&#xD;
