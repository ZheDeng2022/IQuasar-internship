  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SAFE-LAAC Trial has been designed to gather data on the most optimal strategy of antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy after transcatheter left atrial appendage occlusion with Amplatzer Amulet device&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcatheter left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) has been shown to be non-inferior to oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation in preventing cardioembolic strokes associated with atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
      However, optimal antithrombotic treatment regimen following successful LAAC remains an&#xD;
      unresolved issue. The scope and duration of antiplatelet treatment following LAAC is of&#xD;
      paramount importance as it may significantly contribute to post-procedural as well as&#xD;
      long-term procedural safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFE-LAAC Trial has been designed as a comparative heath effectiveness study with the&#xD;
      following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. compare safety and efficacy of 30 days vs. 6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy&#xD;
           following LAAC with Amplatzer Amulet device (randomized comparison)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. compare safety and efficacy of stopping all antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents 6&#xD;
           months after LAAC vs. long-term treatment with single antiplatelet agent (nonrandomized&#xD;
           comparison)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (n=160) with contraindications to oral anticoagulation, after successful LAAC with&#xD;
      Amplatzer Amulet device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this pilot trial will provide: 1. data to aid practitioners and guideline writers&#xD;
      recommend most optimal antithrombotic treatment after LAAC, and 2. data to support power&#xD;
      calculations for designing future randomized trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFE LAAC has been designed as a multicenter (4-5 centers in Poland), open-label, comparative&#xD;
      heath effectiveness trial with central, independent adjudication of events comprising primary&#xD;
      end-point. The first part of the trial is randomized and after 6 months of follow-up&#xD;
      continues for another 12 months as a non-randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the trial has been planned for 3 years. The enrollment phase will continue&#xD;
      over 1.5 years and follow up will extend to 3 years.&#xD;
