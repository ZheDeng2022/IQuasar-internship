  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cow's milk allergy (CMA) affects up to 3% of European children. In the absence of an&#xD;
      alternative to cow's milk, the management of CMA is based on the use of safe, affordable and&#xD;
      nutritionally adequate formulas. In Scientific Societies Guidelines, extensively hydrolyzed&#xD;
      casein formula (EHCF) is considered as safe first line approach for the treatment of children&#xD;
      with CMA, whereas amino acid-based formula (AAF) is considered as second line strategy in&#xD;
      children reacting to EHCF or as first line approach in children with CMA-induced anaphylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few and not recent studies, involving a poorly characterized study population, suggested that&#xD;
      up to 10% of CMA children could react to the extensively hydrolysed formulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that EHCF supplemented with L.rhamnosus GG (LGG) maintains&#xD;
      hypoallergenic status and that is able to accelerate oral tolerance acquisition in children&#xD;
      with CMA comparing with other formulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a &quot;step-down&quot; approach in&#xD;
      children affected by Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated CMA with the aim to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of EHCF + LGG on oral tolerance acquisition and on immune response and gut microbiota&#xD;
      shaping.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 Immunoglobulin E-mediated CMA children, consecutively observed at tertiary Centers for&#xD;
      Food Allergy, who will meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate to the&#xD;
      study. Anamnestic, demographic, anthropometric and clinical data, as well as information on&#xD;
      socio-demographic factors, family and living conditions, parental history of allergic&#xD;
      diseases, number of siblings, and pet ownership will be obtained from the parents of each&#xD;
      infant and recorded in a clinical database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then in all subjects an oral food challenge with EHCF + LGG will be performed. Only subjects&#xD;
      with negative oral food challenge will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups of&#xD;
      dietary interventions for a 12 months follow up period: group 1 received AAF , and group 2&#xD;
      received EHCF + LGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective use of the formula will be evaluated during the study by dieticians counselling&#xD;
      parents about issues that could arise during the elimination diet. Parents or caregivers will&#xD;
      be asked to keep a daily record of formula use. The amount prepared (millimetres of water and&#xD;
      number of formula spoons) and amount left after each consumption will be recorded in a diary&#xD;
      to assess the amount consumed by the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrolment, after 6 and 12 months body growth will be assessed by body weight, body length&#xD;
      and head circumference measured at enrolment, after 6 and 12 months of follow-up with&#xD;
      reference to growth charts. Unscheduled visits will be made if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition at enrolment, after 6 and 12 months, the investigators will perform:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All Oral food challenge procedures will be performed in double blind fashion in 2&#xD;
           consecutive days. Full emergency equipment and drugs (epinephrine, antihistamines,&#xD;
           steroids) will be at hand. The challenge will be stopped upon the appearance of clinical&#xD;
           symptoms or when the highest dose will be reached. The child will be observed for 2 h,&#xD;
           and then discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Skin prick test (whole milk, casein, α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin): allergens and&#xD;
           fresh milk will be applied to the patients volar forearm: cow's milk (CM) containing&#xD;
           3.5% fat. Skin prick tests were performed using a 1-mm single peak lancet (ALK,&#xD;
           Copenhagen, Denmark), with histamine dihydrochloride (10 mg/ml) and isotonic saline&#xD;
           solution (NaCl 0.9%) as positive and negative control, respectively. Reactions will be&#xD;
           recorded on the basis of the largest diameter (in millimetres) of the wheal and flare at&#xD;
           15 min. The SPT result will be considered &quot;positive&quot; if the wheal was 3 mm or larger,&#xD;
           without reaction of the negative control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Total IgE and specific IgE and Immunoglobulin G 4 against proteins and epitopes of cow's&#xD;
           milk: we will perform a venous blood sample; serum of the patients will be collected&#xD;
           using tube serum separator tubes and was obtained by centrifugation for 10-15 minutes.&#xD;
           Serum will be flash frozen and stored at -80 °C until further analysis. From serum,&#xD;
           total IgE and specific IgE and IgG4 against proteins and epitopes of cow's milk will be&#xD;
           analyzed with enzymatic immunoassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gut microbiota composition: a stool sample will be collect and immediately frozen to&#xD;
           -80°C and stored until further analysis. Total genomic DNA (gDNA) will be isolated from&#xD;
           fecal material using a specific DNA. Isolation kit and gut microbiota composition will&#xD;
           be analysed using an approach for bacteria and an internal transcribed spacer region&#xD;
           sequencing approach (High-throughput sequencing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) fecal and serum production: a stool sample and serum&#xD;
           will be collect. One gram of fecal samples will be weighed, diluted 1:2 in sterile&#xD;
           phosphate-buffered saline solution, and homogenized. Supernatants will be then obtained&#xD;
           by centrifugation (10 000g, 30 minutes, 4°C), filtered through 0.2-μm filters and stored&#xD;
           at -80°C until analysis. Serum of the patients will be collected using tube serum&#xD;
           separator tubes and was obtained by centrifugation for 10-15 minutes. Serum will be&#xD;
           flash frozen and stored at -80 °C until further analysis. Analysis of SCFAs will be&#xD;
           performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) to measure the concentrations&#xD;
           of acetic, propionic, and butyric acid in fecal samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Serum level of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-γ: we will&#xD;
           perform a venous blood sample; serum of the patients will be collected using tube serum&#xD;
           separator tubes and was obtained by centrifugation for 10-15 minutes. Serum will be&#xD;
           flash frozen and stored at -80 °C. From serum, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-10, IFN-γ will be&#xD;
           determined by ELISA (specific kit for each cytokine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Methylation status of the promoter region of genes involved in IgE-mediated allergy,&#xD;
           IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-10 and IFN-γ and of FoxP3+: Venous blood will be obtained from the&#xD;
           patients and DNA will be extracted from leukocytes using DNA Extraction Kit. Extracted&#xD;
           DNA will be modified with sodium bisulfite using the Methylation Gold Kit (ZYMO Research&#xD;
           Co.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The converted DNA will be stored at&#xD;
           -70°C until used. Methylation analyses will be performed using High resolution melting&#xD;
           Real Time (LightCycler® 480, Roche Applied Science). The results will be confirmed by&#xD;
           direct sequencing (Sanger method modified: ddNTPs labeled with four different&#xD;
           fluorophores).&#xD;
