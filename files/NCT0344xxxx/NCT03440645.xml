  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over a 12-month period, patients admitted with acute coronary disease to the cardiovascular&#xD;
      care unit at the Jewish General Hospital (JGH), an academic tertiary care referral center in&#xD;
      Montreal, Quebec, will be approached to refer first-degree relatives and/or household members&#xD;
      age 18 years or older to an outpatient cardiovascular (CV) risk factor screening and&#xD;
      treatment program. Relatives and household members will undergo a focused history, physical,&#xD;
      and CV risk factor assessment and will receive evidence-based guideline-recommended treatment&#xD;
      as indicated. Participants will be referred to nutritionists, smoking cessation programs, and&#xD;
      to other allied healthcare professionals as needed. A follow-up visit at 6-months will assess&#xD;
      treatment adherence and improvement in CV risk factors. All family and/or household members&#xD;
      including the index patient will be encouraged to attend all healthcare visits together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the screening strategy will be measured by the total number of&#xD;
      participants identified as intermediate or high modified Framingham 10-year risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. The effectiveness of the primary prevention intervention will be&#xD;
      measured by the change in percentage of the mean modified Framingham 10-year risk score for&#xD;
      participants between the initial visit and 6-month follow-up. The value of the referral,&#xD;
      screening, and treatment program, as well as participant engagement and satisfaction will&#xD;
      also be systematically evaluated.&#xD;
