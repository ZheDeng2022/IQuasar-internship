  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it is wondered whether cortical excitability level could predict/direct the&#xD;
      use of transcranial direct current stimulation combined with physical therapy on upper limb&#xD;
      rehabilitation of post stroke patients. Furthermore, the study aims to correlate the motor&#xD;
      recovery with cortical excitability level. For this purpose, after basal evaluation, patients&#xD;
      will be classified according motor function evaluated by Fugl Meyer in following categories:&#xD;
      (ii) moderate: more than 19 points on Fulg Meyer (ii) severe: less than 19 points on Fulg&#xD;
      Meyer.&#xD;

      After given prior informed consent, volunteers will be classified and randomized using a&#xD;
      website (randomization.com) by a non-involved researcher. At study beginning, volunteers will&#xD;
      be evaluated through structured questionnaire. They will be submitted to the following&#xD;
      evaluations: (i) Fugl-Meyer Scale; (ii) Motor Activity Log - 30; (iii) Functional&#xD;
      independence measure; (iv) Patient Global Impression of Change Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS - tDCS involves application of very low-amplitude direct currents (2 mA or less) via&#xD;
      surface scalp electrodes. It produces a sub-sensory level of electrical stimulation wich&#xD;
      remains imperceptible by most people during application. In a small percentage of patients,&#xD;
      it may cause minimal discomfort with a mild tingling sensation, which usually disappears&#xD;
      after a few seconds. Depending on the polarity, tDCS can increase or decrease corticomotor&#xD;
      excitability. Anodal tDCS is able to facilitate neurons depolarization - increasing cortical&#xD;
      excitability - while, on the other hand, cathodal tDCS hyperpolarizes the resting membrane&#xD;
      potential, reducing the neuronal firing and the cortical excitabilityquestionnaire will be&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure Change in Fugl Meyer assesment of paretic upper limb motor function&#xD;
      (time frame: baseline, before 6 session, after 10 sessions (10 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fugl Meyer assesment is used to measure motor control recovery. It is a 226 point scoring&#xD;
      system that includes the following sessions: range of motion, pain, sensation,motor function&#xD;
      of upper and lower limbs, balance, coordination and velocity. We will aplly only two&#xD;
      sessions: upper limb motor function and coordination/velocity, these sessions totalize 66&#xD;
      points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures Cortical excitabilit level it will be evaluated through single&#xD;
      pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigms (Neurosoft, Russia). Initially, rest motor&#xD;
      threshold (RMT) will be determined by finding the lowest stimulator output that elicit motor&#xD;
      evoked potential (MEP) around 50 μV (TMS Motor Threshold Assessment Tool -MTAT 2.0 - USA).&#xD;
      For RMT measure, a figure-eight coil connected to the magnetic stimulator held manually at 45&#xD;
      degrees from the midline, will be placed over the right primary motor cortex of lesioned and&#xD;
      non lesioned hemisphere (C3 and/or C4 - 10/20 System). After, motor evoked potential will be&#xD;
      evaluet by 20 pulses firing with 120% of RMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other pre specified outcome measures Change from Motor acitivy log - 30 (time frame: before&#xD;
      and after 10 sessions (10 days)) MAL is a scripetd , structured, interview to measure real&#xD;
      wordl upper extremity function. It was developed to measure the effects of therapy on the&#xD;
      most impaired arm following stroke. Consists of 30 activities of daily living such as using a&#xD;
      towel, brushing teath and picking up a glass. For a specificied time period post stroke,&#xD;
      patients are asked about the extent of activity performance and how well it was performed by&#xD;
      the most impaired arm. Response scale form o (never used) to 5 (same as pre stroke). Scores&#xD;
      average for activity comprises the amount os use scale: the mean of scores of how well the&#xD;
      acitivy was performed comprises the quality of movement. Ideaaly, ratings are obtained and as&#xD;
      well as caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional independence measure is a questionanere used to evaluate the functional ability of&#xD;
      the patient after the disease. The scale contains 18 items, divided in two subscales: motor&#xD;
      and cogntion. The evaluated activites included eating dressins, bathing, transfer and others.&#xD;
      Each item ranges from 7 (complete independe) to 1 (total dependence), higher scores indicate&#xD;
      more independece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG Patients will perform an assessment of brain activity through the EEG. Initially,&#xD;
      patients will be placed seated in a chair at 90cm in front of a computer. Then, the equipment&#xD;
      will be assembled, the points according to the 10-20 marking system will be identified: Cz,&#xD;
      C3, C4, F3, F4, P3, P4, Fz and Pz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will follow the sequence of six consecutive moments (1 minute each) to monitor&#xD;
      the patient's brain activity through Neuro Spectrum software:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 1st minute: REST: the patient will be relaxed, at rest, without any communication and&#xD;
           with eyes open;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 2nd minute: OBSERVE - the patient will observe the video of the movement hand to mouth;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 3rd minute: EXECUTION - the patient will reproduce the movement of the video with&#xD;
           healthy limb;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 4th minute: IMAGINATION - the patient will imagine the previous movement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 5th minute: EXECUTION - the patient will reproduce the movement of the video with a&#xD;
           paretic limb;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 6th minute: IMAGINATION - the patient will imagine the previous movement; Changes on&#xD;
           Patient Global Impression of Change Scale - (time frame: before 10 sessions, before 6&#xD;
           session, after 10 sessions (10 days))&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PGICS is a one-dimensional measure in which individuals rate their improvement associated&#xD;
      with intervention on a scale of 7 items ranging from &quot;1 = no change&quot; to &quot;7 = Much better&quot;.&#xD;
