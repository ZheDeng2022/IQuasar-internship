      A multicenter double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative Phase&#xD;
      II / III clinical study to assess safety, tolerability, efficacy and optimal dose ranging of&#xD;
      XC8 vs. placebo in patients with uncomplicated influenza or other ARVI during a 5-day&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the difference in time before the onset&#xD;
      of a sustained improvement in clinical symptoms according to the Severity Rating Scale for&#xD;
      ARVI, and to determine the optimal dose of XC8 in the treatment of influenza and other ARVI.&#xD;

      Twenty-three Russian centers were approved for participation in this study. Twenty centers&#xD;
      were initiated. Patients were enrolled in 18 centers. The study consisted of two parts: phase&#xD;
      II and phase III. Each of the parts included 3 periods: screening, treatment, follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of the study (Phase II), all eligible patients were randomized into 4&#xD;
      groups (groups A, B, C, and D) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A - XC8 20 mg daily (40 patients); Group B - XC8 100 mg daily (40 patients); Group C -&#xD;
      XC8 200 mg daily (40 patients); Group D - placebo (40 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis was planned after the end of the first part of the study (Phase II). Based&#xD;
      on the results of the interim analysis, the most promising XC8 dose group was selected and&#xD;
      the necessary set was calculated to compare this group with the placebo group by the primary&#xD;
      endpoint in a pooled set using an adaptive design with type I error control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study (Phase III), all eligible patients were randomized into 2&#xD;
      groups (groups C and D) in a 1:1 ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C - XC8 200 mg daily (80 patients); Group D - placebo (80 Patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period (5 days), patients received XC8 / placebo daily on a background&#xD;
      of standard symptomatic therapy. The follow-up period lasted for 9 days.&#xD;
