      The proposed project will develop, implement, and test methodology for the design of an&#xD;
      acceptable, effective intervention for diabetes prevention in a real-world setting. By&#xD;
      determining the effectiveness of the intervention, the study will serve to guide the&#xD;
      translation of research into routine public health prevention programs and policy. And, the&#xD;
      hands-on experience will directly support the development of expertise, tools and training to&#xD;
      advance translational science as a discipline. The study aims to test the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      environmental and individual level intervention to prevent diabetes at Dhulikhel&#xD;
      Hospital-Kathmandu University Hospital (DH-KUH), Nepal. Specific aims are to measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of a canteen intervention on a composite score based upon improvement in 3&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic risk factors (0-3) [HbA1c decrease ≥0.5%; a systolic blood pressure decrease&#xD;
      (SBP) ≥5 mm Hg; and plasma triglycerides decrease ≥10 mg/dl] Effectiveness of a behavioral&#xD;
      intervention on a composite score based upon improvement in 3 cardio-metabolic risk factors&#xD;
      (0-3) [HbA1c decrease ≥0.5%; SBP decrease ≥5 mm Hg; and plasma triglycerides decrease ≥10&#xD;
      mg/dl] Effectiveness of a canteen intervention on change in HbA1C and healthy food intake&#xD;
      after six months of the canteen only (CO) intervention compared to the change over six months&#xD;
      during the control period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of a behavioral intervention on change in Hba1c and healthy food intake after&#xD;
      six months of behavioral intervention plus the canteen (CB) intervention compared to the&#xD;
      change over six months during CO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 366 adult employees of DH-KUH. At baseline (T1), 6 months (T2), 12 months&#xD;
      (T3) and 18 months (T4), we will administer a standard questionnaire to record relevant&#xD;
      characteristics of the participants (age, sex, education, income, marital status, and family&#xD;
      history of CVD, physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake and diet). We will abstract food&#xD;
      consumption data from the administrative database in DH-KUH. Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      and analyzed for HbA1c, fasting glucose, and lipid profile (HDL, LDL, total cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides). We will measure height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, and&#xD;
      blood pressure. After 6 months of control period, the participants will receive the canteen&#xD;
      intervention: (a) form and train a canteen improvement team; (b) train canteen staff on&#xD;
      healthy cooking; (c) add healthy food and remove unhealthy food; (d) information and&#xD;
      communication of canteen changes to employees; (e) monitoring of the interventions. After six&#xD;
      months of the canteen intervention, half of the participants will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      the behavioral intervention. The behavior intervention will be a combination of intensive&#xD;
      education sessions, group counselling, goal setting and monitoring based on the Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Program (DPP). The primary analysis will use χ^2test use to compare (a) Proportion&#xD;
      of individual with score ≥ 2 during CO intervention to the proportion of individual with&#xD;
      score ≥ 2 during the control period; (b) Proportion of individual with score ≥ 2 during CB&#xD;
      intervention to the proportion of individual with score ≥ 2 during CO intervention. We will&#xD;
      conduct a logistic regression with the proportion of individual with score ≥ 2 as outcome and&#xD;
      CO vs CB as exposure at T4. Secondary analysis will use paired t-test to compare (a) the&#xD;
      change in healthy food intake and HbA1c during CO to the change in healthy food intake and&#xD;
      HbA1C during the control period (b) the change in healthy food intake and HbA1C% during CB to&#xD;
      the change in healthy food intake and HbA1C% during CO period. We will conduct linear&#xD;
      regression with HbA1c% as the outcome and CO vs CB as the exposure variable at T4. Further&#xD;
      analysis will adjust for confounding in time-varying variables and assess effect&#xD;
      modification.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular disease (CVD),&#xD;
      diabetes, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),are on the rise in low-&#xD;
      and middle- income countries. CVD is the leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and&#xD;
      disability in South Asia, where 20% of the world's population resides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and excessive body weight are reported to have a large effect&#xD;
      on the risk of developing NCD's. Lifestyle interventions addressing diet and exercise have&#xD;
      reduced cardiovascular risk. Despite the evidence supporting the use of lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions to prevent hypertension and diabetes and to improve glucose tolerance, their&#xD;
      translation into real world settings has been challenging. Worksites provide unique&#xD;
      opportunities for health promotion and disease prevention programs since people spend a&#xD;
      majority of their time at work, and they allow access to large segments of the population.&#xD;
      Worksites also provide an infrastructure and natural environment for social support.&#xD;
      Worksite-based health programs have shown positive impacts on employee health, and they have&#xD;
      shown significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factor profiles. Worksite interventions&#xD;
      encompassing environmental changes (i.e. low-cost healthy food options), places for physical&#xD;
      activity (i.e. fitness centers or gyms), , and group-based health education classes, have&#xD;
      been highlighted as components of successful worksite interventions. As an important way to&#xD;
      translate CVD prevention efforts, worksite interventions can promote healthy food choices,&#xD;
      facilitate health education, and provide social support. Thus, we planned a pioneer study&#xD;
      that will measure the effectiveness of a cafeteria-based intervention and a behavioral&#xD;
      intervention on cardio-metabolic risk among employees of a hospital based in Nepal, by&#xD;
      evaluating the change in number of individuals reaching two or more cardio-metabolic risk&#xD;
      goals, specifically reductions in blood pressure, triglycerides, and glycosylated hemoglobin&#xD;
      (HbA1c,).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS AND MATERIALS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Nepal Pioneer Worksite Intervention Study is a two-step intervention study. In the first&#xD;
      step, we will use a pre-post design to assess how a cafeteria-based intervention, that&#xD;
      provides a healthier diet, effects cardio-metabolic risk. In the second step, we will conduct&#xD;
      an open-masked, two-arm randomized trial by allocating half of the participants to a&#xD;
      cafeteria and behavioral (CB) intervention on prevention of cardio-metabolic risk, while the&#xD;
      other half of participants will receive the cafeteria-only (CO) intervention. The study&#xD;
      protocol has been approved by the institutional review committee at Harvard T.H. Chan School&#xD;
      of Public Health, Nepal Health Research Council, and Kathmandu University School of Medical&#xD;
      Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at Dhulikhel Hospital -Kathmandu University Hospital (DH-KUH) in&#xD;
      central Nepal. Dhulikhel Hospital is an independently owned, not-for-profit institution which&#xD;
      was conceived and supported by the Dhulikhel community. The hospital has approximately 1040&#xD;
      employees and four functional cafeterias that are in operation 16 hours a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a 20-minute information session in all of the hospital departments. Employees&#xD;
      will be invited to attend sessions through flyers posted around the hospital and through&#xD;
      announcements in department meetings. During the information session, we will explain the&#xD;
      purpose and the expectations of the study. We will explain the ethical considerations,&#xD;
      emphasizing the importance of protecting participant's privacy during research-related&#xD;
      interactions and outcomes, the volunteer nature of the study, the option to drop out of the&#xD;
      study at any time and we will establish there should not be any coercion from supervisors to&#xD;
      participate in the study. After the information session, research assistants (RAs) will set&#xD;
      up an appointment for eligibility screening among interested participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are: (a) adults 18 years or older; (b) full time employees of DH-KUH;&#xD;
      with (c) systolic blood pressure of &gt;=120 mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt;=80 mmHg; or HbA1c of&#xD;
      5.7% to 6.4%, or fasting blood sugar of &gt;=100 mg/dL. The exclusion criteria of the study are:&#xD;
      (a) pregnant women since dietary habits may change during pregnancy, (b) taking diabetes&#xD;
      medication, or (c) taking hypertension medication. The details of the screening process are&#xD;
      described below. The RA will obtain written informed consent in a private room for those&#xD;
      individuals who are deemed eligible to participate in the study. A short oral consent process&#xD;
      will be utilized for participants who cannot read the consent form. This will entail&#xD;
      presenting all of the elements of the consent form verbally to the participant, in the&#xD;
      presence of a witness. The witness will be required to sign a document stating the consent&#xD;
      form has been verbally presented to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The schedule of enrollment and assessment is presented in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: The RAs will conduct a 2 phased screening to identify the eligible participants.&#xD;
      In the first screening, the RAs will screen participants by measuring blood pressure, and&#xD;
      administering a questionnaire along with measures to calculate an Indian Diabetes Risk Score&#xD;
      (IDRS).13 The IDRS takes age, abdominal obesity, self-reported physical activity, and family&#xD;
      history of diabetes into account. The IDRS score ranges from 0 to 100, with a high number&#xD;
      indicating higher risk. The IDRS has been considered a reliable instrument to screen the risk&#xD;
      of diabetes in Asian-Indian populations.13 An IDRS of 30 or more has been shown to have 95%&#xD;
      sensitivity and 45% specificity to detect prediabetes using fasting blood sugar criteria&#xD;
      (100-120 mg/dL); and 87% sensitivity and 47% specificity using HbA1c criteria (HbA1c&#xD;
      5.7-6.5%) in an analysis of 560 free residents of Dhulikhel (Unpublished).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure will be measured in the right arm of seated participants, after a five- minute&#xD;
      rest period. Three measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be taken using&#xD;
      a Microlife automatic blood pressure measuring device. The mean of three blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements will be used. The participants with systolic blood pressure of &gt;=120 mmHg or&#xD;
      diastolic pressure &gt;=80 mmHg will be invited to participate regardless of their IDRS score.&#xD;
      In the second screening, the participants scoring 30 or more on IDRS will be asked to provide&#xD;
      a blood sample to measure HbA1c and fasting blood glucose. The individuals with HbA1c between&#xD;
      5.7% to 6.4% or fasting blood sugar of &gt;=100 mg/dL will be invited to participate. All&#xD;
      eligible individuals that provided informed consent will be enrolled. No compensation or&#xD;
      reimbursement will be provided to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment: At baseline, RAs will interview the participants using a standardized&#xD;
      electronic questionnaire using Open Data Kit software.14 RAs will receive two weeks training&#xD;
      on data collection and ethical issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will assess socioeconomic characteristics including age, sex, ethnicity,&#xD;
      religion, marital status, annual income, education, and lifestyle factors including smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol intake, and physical activity. We will use the Global Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire,15 and calculate the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per week. A&#xD;
      weekly MET equivalent of 600 would represent 30 minutes of brisk walking five times per week&#xD;
      or 15 minutes of running five times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty four hour diet recall: To measure dietary intake, we will conduct two&#xD;
      interviewer-administered 24-hour dietary recalls within a week. Each 24-hour dietary recall&#xD;
      will take approximately 25 minutes to complete. First, activities of the previous day will be&#xD;
      documented to refresh the participant's memory. Then, a dietitian will ask the participant to&#xD;
      recall everything s/he consumed from the first meal to last meal. The time and place of each&#xD;
      meal will be noted, followed by detailed information on each food including: specific brands,&#xD;
      ingredients, and/or recipes. Participants will be asked to report their food portions using&#xD;
      colorful examples of sizes or household measures such as spoon, bowl, etc. If a participant&#xD;
      reports using their own recipe, then complete information on each individual ingredient will&#xD;
      be inquired about. Energy and nutrient intakes will be calculated using the food composition&#xD;
      table for Nepal.16&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry: Body weight will be measured with minimum clothing and without shoes using an&#xD;
      Omron Model hbf-400 scale and recorded to the nearest 0.1 pounds. The weighing scale will&#xD;
      calibrated to zero every day. Participants' heights will be measured, without shoes, while&#xD;
      the participants stand against a wall. Height will be measured using a tape measure and&#xD;
      recorded to the nearest 0.1cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory: Blood samples will be analyzed for HbA1c, fasting glucose, low density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and&#xD;
      total cholesterol. All of the laboratory procedures will be carried out in the biochemistry&#xD;
      laboratory of DH-KUH. Blood samples will be collected using evacuated blood collection tubes.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to fast overnight (8-14 hours). The HbA1c will be measured using&#xD;
      Boronate affinity chromatography (Axis-Shield, Norway); fasting blood glucose using&#xD;
      hexokinase method (Dialab, Austria); LDL and HDL using the elimination method (Dialab,&#xD;
      Austria); triglyceride using gpo-pap (Dialab, Austria); and total cholesterol using chod-pap&#xD;
      (Dialab, Austria). For each type of assay, the laboratory has quality control (QC) materials&#xD;
      (sing commercially available assayed and unassayed control material) from biorad&#xD;
      Laboratories, USA. Each QC is run at least in duplicate. External QC is arranged by&#xD;
      internationally recognized reference laboratories that distribute batches of samples of&#xD;
      various concentrations for each assay. The laboratory performs External Quality Assurance&#xD;
      Scheme from unknown assayed sample from the Department of Clinical Biochemistry CMC, Vellore,&#xD;
      India for 23 routine parameters, 5 immunological parameters and HbA1c. Additionally, 5% of&#xD;
      the blood samples will be obtained in duplicates and sent for testing all parameters, blinded&#xD;
      to the laboratory personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control period: We will have a control period of six months before implementing the&#xD;
      intervention. There will not be any contact with the enrolled participants six months after&#xD;
      the study enrollment. The control period will allow us to conduct the difference in&#xD;
      difference analysis; hence minimizing potential biases in effect size, including increases or&#xD;
      decreases in a health condition with time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Step 1: Cafeteria Intervention: After six months of the control period, all of&#xD;
      the participants will receive the cafeteria intervention (Table 2). The cafeteria&#xD;
      intervention was developed based on the findings from four focus group discussions with&#xD;
      cafeteria users and nine in-depth interviews with cafeteria operators and managers, about&#xD;
      strategies to promote healthy foods in the worksite. The four cafeterias in the hospital will&#xD;
      improve the quality of their meals by (1) increasing the availability of fresh fruit (not&#xD;
      fruit juice) and vegetable options, (2) avoiding sales of sugar sweetened beverages, (3)&#xD;
      replacing whole grains with refined grains in cooking; (4) using healthy vegetable oils such&#xD;
      as soy and sunflower ; (5) minimizing the sale of fried foods; (6) trimming animal fats from&#xD;
      meats before cooking; (7) using healthier protein sources such as chicken, beans, and nuts&#xD;
      (8) making potable water free of cost; and (9) reducing salt in cooking. These guidelines are&#xD;
      based on the recommendations for a healthy diet to improve cardiovascular health.22 To&#xD;
      facilitate these changes, a cafeteria operation team will be formed and they will be trained&#xD;
      on procedures to implement, supervise, and monitor the worksite's healthy changes. In&#xD;
      addition, we will train the cafeteria staff on healthy eating, and how to modify recipes to&#xD;
      incorporate healthy options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: The behavioral intervention: After six months of the cafeteria intervention, half of&#xD;
      the participants will be randomized using computer generated random numbers to receive a&#xD;
      cafeteria and behavioral intervention (CB), the other half of the participants will continue&#xD;
      to receive the cafeteria only (CO) intervention. The behavioral intervention will be&#xD;
      comprised of intensive education sessions, group counseling, and goal setting and monitoring&#xD;
      exercises based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)23 tailored to local needs. The&#xD;
      curriculum includes 24 sessions of 16 cores weekly sessions during the first four months of&#xD;
      the intervention followed by 8 weekly maintenance sessions. Each session will be 1 hour long,&#xD;
      facilitated by a dietitian. Broadly, the curriculum covers the subject matters of importance&#xD;
      of healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, increasing physical activity, stress management,&#xD;
      and challenges of lifestyle changes. Similar to the cafeteria intervention, healthy eating&#xD;
      messages include increasing fresh fruits and vegetable intake, avoiding added sugar, choosing&#xD;
      whole grains, choosing healthier sources of protein, reducing sodium, and monitoring portion&#xD;
      sizes. Participants will be encouraged to keep food and activity diaries throughout the&#xD;
      course of the study. The maintenance period's focus will be on overcoming declines in&#xD;
      motivation and maintaining long-term healthy behaviors. All of the sessions will be conducted&#xD;
      at the worksite during the workday. There will be about 20 participants in each education&#xD;
      class. Participants will set a minimum of two lifestyle-change goals (i.e. Half of their&#xD;
      total grain intake will be whole grains, walking 30 minutes a day, or reducing 7% of their&#xD;
      body weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess outcomes at 6 months (at the end of the control period), 12 months (at the end&#xD;
      of the cafeteria intervention), and 18 months (at the end of the behavioral intervention).&#xD;
      During each follow up, fasting blood samples will be collected and analyzed for HbA1c,&#xD;
      fasting glucose, and lipid profile (HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides). We will&#xD;
      re-administer the global physical activity questionnaire, and the two 24-hour diet recalls.&#xD;
      We will re-measure height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure at each time point&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the proportion of individuals reaching two or more of their&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic risk goals, namely, reductions in blood pressure, triglycerides, and HbA1c.&#xD;
      Participants will be scored on the number of improved risk factors (0-3) as defined by&#xD;
      decreases in (1) HbA1c ≥0.5%; (2) systolic blood pressure ≥5 mm Hg; or plasma triglycerides&#xD;
      ≥10 mg/dl. These outcomes were selected because blood pressure, HbA1c, and triglycerides are&#xD;
      commonly measured in clinical settings. This makes their use clinically-appropriate and&#xD;
      translatable, as other CVD risk scores such as the Framingham Risk Score, do not perform well&#xD;
      in South Asian populations.24 Moreover, the composite outcome allows for individuals to&#xD;
      reduce different factors based on their variable risk profiles at baseline. For example, an&#xD;
      individual with a baseline systolic blood pressure of 120 mmHg many not reduce this risk&#xD;
      factor by as much as 5 mmHg, but may succeed in reducing HbA1c or triglycerides. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are absolute changes in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, and triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have taken four robust provisions to ensure data quality. First, the electronic&#xD;
      questionnaire will be closed only if the data collection is complete to avoid partial or&#xD;
      missing values. The data will be cleaned and checked every month. The answer fields for all&#xD;
      integer variables will be constrained to ensure entry of only valid numbers. Second, RAs will&#xD;
      receive intensive training on data collection and ethical considerations. Third, the site&#xD;
      investigator will supervise the RAs on a day-to-day basis. Fourth, the principal&#xD;
      investigators will hold weekly meetings with site investigators, and if required, with the&#xD;
      RAs, to discuss the course of the intervention and to address any issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Plan: The primary analysis will be intention to treat. The quantitative data&#xD;
      analysis will follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.25&#xD;
      Flowcharts will include the number of participants seen at each stage, including the number&#xD;
      screened, eligible, randomized, and analyzed for the primary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of the cafeteria intervention: At the 12-month follow-up, we will compare the&#xD;
      proportion of participants who achieved two or more of their cardio-metabolic risk factor&#xD;
      reduction goals during the cafeteria intervention period, to the proportion of participants&#xD;
      in the control period, using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach with the&#xD;
      binary distribution, logit link function and an exchangeable working correlation structure.26&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of the behavioral intervention: At the 18-month follow-up, we will compare the&#xD;
      proportion of participants who have achieved two or more of their cardio-metabolic risk&#xD;
      factor reduction goals in CO arm to the proportion of participants in the CB arm using&#xD;
      chi-square test. In the event that randomization does not control for differences between the&#xD;
      treatment and control groups on baseline characteristics, we will statistically control for&#xD;
      those differences using the GEE approach with the binary distribution, logit link function&#xD;
      and an exchangeable working correlation structure.26&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary analysis will compare the change in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, and lipids&#xD;
      during the cafeteria-only intervention to the change during the control period using a paired&#xD;
      t-test. Similarly, we will compare the change in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, and lipids&#xD;
      between CO group and CB group using a paired t-test. In the event that randomization does not&#xD;
      control for differences between the treatment and control groups on baseline characteristics,&#xD;
      we will conduct the GEE approach with the Gaussian distribution, identity link function and&#xD;
      an exchangeable working correlation matrix26 to adjust for potential confounding factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-post design, with at least 366 eligible and enrolled participants27 and 5% loss to&#xD;
      follow-up (LTF) after 12 months, will have over 90% of power to detect the primary&#xD;
      effectiveness endpoint of this trial, of 31.5% or greater, compared to the 21% change in the&#xD;
      control group in a South Asian population.28 For the analysis of two randomized groups (CO&#xD;
      and CB arms), with 320 participants, we will be able to detect a relative risk of 1.5 given&#xD;
      0.315 risk probability in the control group, 5% LTF rate with 80% power and 5% level of&#xD;
      significance.29&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the secondary analysis will be the comparison of changes in HbA1c, systolic and diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure, and lipids observed in the cafeteria intervention and the behavioral&#xD;
      intervention. Given the sample sizes of 366 and 320 respectively, 5% LTF rate with 80% power&#xD;
      and 5% level of significance, we will be able to detect the minimum differences presented in&#xD;
      Table 1. For the before-after design, we considered three possible values of the correlation&#xD;
      (ρ=0.5,0.6,0.7) between changes during the control period and during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimization of contamination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk and level of contamination during the randomized study phase for the behavioral&#xD;
      intervention will be monitored at the participant level. The participants will be instructed&#xD;
      not to share information about the study and not to provide any support to people in their&#xD;
      worksite, other than their class mates. The behavioral classes will be conducted in a&#xD;
      separate building outside of their workspace to ensure privacy. Further, we will measure&#xD;
      possible contamination by asking if the participants have received any information / advice&#xD;
      regarding diet and lifestyle changes from any of their peers and if they did, collect the&#xD;
      name and contact information of the peer. If the contamination is found to be significant, we&#xD;
      will make adjustments while estimating the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention fidelity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention fidelity refers to the extent the intervention is delivered as it was&#xD;
      intended.30 In the proposed study, we will warrant and quantify the fidelity of both the&#xD;
      cafeteria and the behavioral intervention. First, we will provide training sessions on the&#xD;
      study objectives, details of the interventions, and the importance of fidelity to the study&#xD;
      staff, cafeteria improvement committee and cafeteria staff. . Second, we will monitor the&#xD;
      implementation of changes in the cafeteria using a structured checklist on a weekly basis.&#xD;
      The checklist is provided in the supplementary materials. The deviance in fidelity will be&#xD;
      discussed during the monthly meeting of the cafeteria improvement team where necessary action&#xD;
      will be taken. For the behavioral intervention, we will measure attendance from participants&#xD;
      and we will test pre- and post- knowledge on diabetes prevention, covered in the health&#xD;
      education sessions. Finally, a site investigator will supervise the implementation of&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We do not have a plan for interim analysis and do not expect a situation that would lead us&#xD;
      to stop the study. The participants with newly reported pregnancy during the course of the&#xD;
      study will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reportable Events and Indemnities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse events are not expected. Other events related to study participation (such as&#xD;
      an infection at the site of a blood draw clinic, or a breach of confidentiality) will be&#xD;
      documented. All unanticipated problems (non-medical occurrence) that involve risk to subjects&#xD;
      or others will be reported to the institutional review board at Kathmandu School of Medical&#xD;
      Sciences and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&#xD;
