  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 106 patients with drug-refractory persistent atrial fibrillation, who are planned&#xD;
      to undergo circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI), will be randomly allocated into&#xD;
      two groups. These patients will receive cryoballoon ablation, radiofrequency ablation under&#xD;
      the guidance of 3D mapping respectively (allocation ratio, 1:1). Atrial electrical activity&#xD;
      including atrial effective refractory period, atrial conduction time, electromechanical&#xD;
      conduction time, P wave dispersion and spatial dispersion of atrial refractory will be&#xD;
      measured before and after the operation. Left atrial appendage flow velocity of all patients&#xD;
      are measured by Transesophageal Echocardiography(TEE) 24 hours before the operation.&#xD;
      Real-time ultrasound examinations of left atrial function are carried out for all patients&#xD;
      before the operation and after the operation. Blood samples are extracted in all patients&#xD;
      before the operation and after the operation.This study will clarify whether these different&#xD;
      operation methods have different effects on the recovery of postoperative left atrial&#xD;
      function and electrical activity in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, and whether&#xD;
      changes in left atrial function electrical activity are related to indicators such as&#xD;
      inflammation, blood clotting and myocardial injury. Cryoballoons ablation is still less used&#xD;
      to operate on persistent atrial fibrillation. To investigate the ablative effect, electrical&#xD;
      remodeling and structural remodeling of persist atrial fibrillation with different operating&#xD;
      methods. Therefore, the ablation is related indicators such as the success rate of the&#xD;
      operation, intraoperative complications, postoperative recurrence rate and the amount of&#xD;
      x-ray exposure are compared among two groups. At the same time, biochemical indicators of&#xD;
      inflammation, blood clotting and myocardial injury such as blood routine, myocardial enzyme,&#xD;
      BNP, troponin I and D-D dimmer are detected to analyze and determine which indicators are&#xD;
      related to the postoperative recurrence of atrial fibrillation, the recovery of postoperative&#xD;
      left atrial function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From February 2018 to February 2020, the investigators enroll consecutive patients with&#xD;
      drug-refractory persistent atrial fibrillation who were scheduled for an initial catheter&#xD;
      ablation.Patients are divided in to two group: persistent AF in radiofrequency ablation&#xD;
      group, cryoballoon ablation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Radiofrequency ablation group: Each patient randomly allocated into the radiofrequency&#xD;
           ablation group receives circumferential pulmonary vein isolation(CPVI), if atrial&#xD;
           flutter is diagnosed before and during operation,then a radiofrequency is used to ablate&#xD;
           cavo-tricuspid isthmus. Under the 3D electro-anatomical mapping system (Carto 3,&#xD;
           Biosense Webster), after passing through the transseptal sheath, the ablation catheter&#xD;
           is infused under pressure to enter into the left atrium to carry out radiofrequency&#xD;
           ablation.The default strategy is to create a circle surrounding the two ipsilateral&#xD;
           pulmonary veins. The cardioversion is performed if spontaneous conversion is not&#xD;
           observed after CPVI. Observation is carried out for 20-30 minutes after the entrance and&#xD;
           exit block of pulmonary vein potentials,in the meantime investigators will mapping the&#xD;
           left atrial substrate. If mapping system detect a poor substrate,the investigators&#xD;
           should continue to ablate for left atrial roof and posterior line.The situation of&#xD;
           pulmonary vein potential conduction will be detected again. If there is a recovery,&#xD;
           ablation will be continuously carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cryoballoon ablation group: Cryoablation is performed using a single cryoballoon. The&#xD;
           diameter of the cryoballoon (Arctic Front Advance™ Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter;&#xD;
           Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) is determined as 28 mm or 23 mm according to pulmonary&#xD;
           venography results. After passing through the transseptal sheath, the cryoballoon&#xD;
           catheter enters into the left atrium and is continuously infused with heparin saline&#xD;
           through a 15F oriented sheath. The balloon is inflated at the entrance of the pulmonary&#xD;
           vein. The mapping confirms that the balloon blocks the entrance of the pulmonary vein.&#xD;
           After blocking of the entrance of the pulmonary vein is enhanced, liquid nitrogen is&#xD;
           injected for cryoablation. Before performing right pulmonary vein ablation, a secondary&#xD;
           catheter is placed into the superior vena cava during the cryoablation. A cycle length&#xD;
           of 999 ms is taken to continuously make the right phrenic nerve pulsate. If diaphragm&#xD;
           movement is weakened or disappears, the cryoablation will be immediately stopped. In&#xD;
           general, the cryoablation of each pulmonary vein is carried out twice. According to the&#xD;
           objective condition, the operator determine whether or not to carry out an additional&#xD;
           cryoablation. The cardioversion is performed if spontaneous conversion is not observed&#xD;
           after CPVI. Then investigators will applicate electrophysiological substrate mapping for&#xD;
           guiding ablation of atrial fibrillation,If mapping system detect a poor substrate,&#xD;
           investigators should continue to ablate for left atrial roof and posterior line. By&#xD;
           testing the entrance and exit block of pulmonary vein potentials，the investigators&#xD;
           observe the duration of potentials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All patients fill the follow-up form before operation. After catheter ablation therapy,&#xD;
           all patients invited to come back to the outpatient clinic every week in the first&#xD;
           month, and then at 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 month to follow up. Patients received&#xD;
           electrocardiogram and Holter monitor examination if with symptoms of palpitations. Those&#xD;
           patients with no symptoms received electrocardiogram every month and Holter monitor&#xD;
           examination every 6 months. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation was defined as atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation/flutter or atrial tachycardia lasting ≥ 30 seconds 3 months after ablation&#xD;
           therapy. Atrial electrical activity including atrial effective refractory period, atrial&#xD;
           conduction time, electromechanical conduction time, P wave dispersion and spatial&#xD;
           dispersion of atrial refractory will be measured before and after the operation.Blood&#xD;
           samples (routine blood, high sensitivity c-reactive protein,B-type natriuretic peptide&#xD;
           (BNP), cystatin C,homocysteine,β2-microglobulin) and transthoracic echocardiography&#xD;
           indexes (left atrial anterior to posterior diameter, left atrial length-diameter,left&#xD;
           atrial transverse-diameter,left atrial volume index, mitral e', E peak, A peak,&#xD;
           E/A,velocity time integral (VTI), left atrial ejection fraction, left atrial strain,&#xD;
           strain rate and atrial electrical - mechanical conduction time) are recorded in all&#xD;
           patients at each follow-up. Patients with AF recurrence must have an electrocardiogram&#xD;
           or a 24 hour holter monitor evidence.&#xD;
