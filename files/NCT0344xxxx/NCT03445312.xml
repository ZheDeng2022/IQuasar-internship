  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational cohort study of 1000 consecutive patients on medical and surgical&#xD;
      wards at the Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto who have a mid-stream urine culture ordered.&#xD;
      When these cultures are ordered or received in the laboratory, a message is posted that the&#xD;
      specimen will not be processed in the laboratory unless a call is received to say that the&#xD;
      patient has local urinary symptoms. The goal is to establish whether not processing&#xD;
      mid-stream urine cultures is safe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical information system for Mount Sinai Hospital will be programmed such that,&#xD;
      whenever a mid-stream urine sample is received in the microbiology laboratory from medical&#xD;
      and surgical wards, the specimen will be held rather than processed. The system will reflex a&#xD;
      result the specimen (either at a set time twice daily, or at the time the specimen is&#xD;
      accessioned) with a message saying: &quot;The great majority of positive urine cultures from&#xD;
      inpatients without an indwelling urinary catheter represent asymptomatic bacteriuria and are&#xD;
      no longer routinely processed. If you strongly suspect that your patient has developed a&#xD;
      urinary tract infection or if you have mislabeled this specimen, please call the Microbiology&#xD;
      laboratory within 48 hours to request processing of this urine culture&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any urine being held in the microbiology laboratory will automatically generate an email&#xD;
      alert to the study coordinator. Within 24 hours of receipt of the urine culture, the&#xD;
      coordinator will confirm that the specimen was a midstream urine specimen, interview the&#xD;
      patient, determine if they have had any symptoms of a urinary tract infection, and collect&#xD;
      information on what other symptoms of infection were present when the culture was ordered,&#xD;
      why the culture was ordered, and whether antibiotic therapy was started empirically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients whose urines have not been processed will have a second follow-up visit/call at&#xD;
      72-96 hours to ensure that urinary symptoms have not developed or worsened. If symptoms&#xD;
      develop/worsen, the study coordinator will have the investigator follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a follow-up telephone call/visit 28-35 days after the specimen is&#xD;
      obtained to identify any intercurrent infections (including C. difficile infection), and any&#xD;
      potential complications/adverse effects from antibiotics. Permission will be obtained to&#xD;
      contact family or other attending physicians to clarify any information if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected for each patient will include: age, gender, underlying medical conditions,&#xD;
      reason for hospitalization, date of admission to hospital, service at admission and at the&#xD;
      time urine specimen obtained, date urine specimen obtained, whether or not urine culture&#xD;
      processed, urine culture results and date reported (if the urine culture was processed),&#xD;
      urinalysis results (if ordered), why the urine culture was ordered, whether the patient had&#xD;
      fever, hypothermia, dysuria, urgency, frequency, costophrenic angle tenderness, increased&#xD;
      incontinence, presence/absence of delirium, presence/absence of any other behavior changes,&#xD;
      whether the patient was capable of reporting urinary tract symptoms, duration of each&#xD;
      symptom, whether or not empiric antibiotics were ordered (name, dose, duration) at the time&#xD;
      the specimen was ordered and what the indication for antibiotics was, what the whether or not&#xD;
      antibiotics ordered empirically were stopped if the urine culture was reported as negative;&#xD;
      whether empiric antibiotics were appropriate to the pathogen (if the urine was cultured),&#xD;
      whether the antibiotic regimen was changed in response to culture results (urine or other);&#xD;
      what the final diagnosis from the most responsible physician was regarding the episode for&#xD;
      which the urine culture was ordered; whether the episode met NHSN criteria for any infection,&#xD;
      whether the patient developed any adverse events potentially associated with antibiotics&#xD;
      (includes solicited: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (including CDI), rash, vaginitis, any&#xD;
      allergic reaction) and unsolicited - if the unsolicited are known to be adverse events&#xD;
      associated with the antibiotic in question (eg. Stevens-Johnson syndrome with Septra,&#xD;
      achilles tendon rupture with fluoroquinolones). Data will be collected by chart review, and&#xD;
      by interview with the patient/next of kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient in whom a serious adverse event occurs, a case summary will be prepared.&#xD;
      Based on the case summary, hospital chart, and study notes, two internists/infectious disease&#xD;
      physicians, otherwise unrelated to the study will be asked independently to assess whether&#xD;
      the serious adverse event was associated with the failure to process a urine culture (if one&#xD;
      was not processed), or associated with antibiotic prescribed for asymptomatic bacteruria. If&#xD;
      the two physicians disagree, a third physician will review, and the three will meet to arrive&#xD;
      at a consensus. If consensus cannot be achieved, the event will be recorded as associated&#xD;
      with not performing the culture or with the antibiotic if 2 physicians of the 3 agree.&#xD;
