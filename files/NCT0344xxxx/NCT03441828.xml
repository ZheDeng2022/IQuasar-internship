      Objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is to compare the impact of a deep neuromuscular blockade&#xD;
      (TOF count = 0 and posttetanic count [PTC] 1-2) and a moderate neuromuscular blockade (TOF&#xD;
      count= 1 - 3) on intraoperative surgical conditions assessed by the surgeon as a 5 points&#xD;
      scale (Optimal= 5 points/ Good= 4 points / Adequate= 3 points / Poor = 2 points / Inadequate&#xD;
      = 1 point).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of low intraabdominal pressure (IAP) and its impact on the surgical operating&#xD;
      conditions has not yet been adequately defined in the literature, although, it is reasonable&#xD;
      to consider that a deep neuromuscular blockade may be beneficial1, especially in gynecologic&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery.2, 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome is to compare the time to discharge from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)&#xD;
      assessed with the WAKE© score.4 As per protocol adopted in our institution, patients are&#xD;
      evaluated with the Modified Aldrete Score5 before discharging from PACU. However the WAKE©&#xD;
      score , whichis constructed from the basic 10-point Modified Aldrete Score, addsthe &quot;Zero&#xD;
      Tolerance Criteria&quot;. In fact, the WAKE© score assigns a score from 0 to 2 to motor function,&#xD;
      blood pressure, level of consciousness, respiratory function and oxygen saturation (with a&#xD;
      maximum score of 10), plus the Zero Tolerance Criteria which address the presence or absence&#xD;
      of pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), shivering, pruritus, and orthostatic&#xD;
      symptoms. A patient can be discharged from PACU when the WAKE© score is ≥ 9 and when there&#xD;
      are not present any zero tolerance criteria (no pain, PONV, shivering, pruritus, and&#xD;
      orthostatic symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of low IAP associated with the use of a deep neuromuscular blockade may improve the&#xD;
      respiratory function and reduce the postoperative pain and PONV,1, 6-8 thus reducing the time&#xD;
      spent in PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of deep neuromuscular blockade may improve the surgical operating conditions and&#xD;
      reduce the time spent in PACU by applying a lower intraabdominal pressure. Sugammadex may be&#xD;
      useful to rapid reverse the neuromuscular block. Therefore, discharge time may be reduced.&#xD;
      Even if all the surgical procedures in this study will be performed as inpatient surgery,&#xD;
      some of this may be possibly performed as outpatient surgery. Evaluating the time to&#xD;
      discharge may be relevant, especially for ambulatory surgery, as the cost may be reduced when&#xD;
      the time spent in PACU is reduced.9&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic surgery requires the formation of the surgical field within the peritoneal&#xD;
      cavity by insufflating CO2, and creating a pneumoperitoneum. This type of procedure is not&#xD;
      free of adverse effects10 related to insufflation of CO2 and IAP that can induce changes in&#xD;
      liver function, hemodynamic and respiratory compromise.11, 12 Moreover, the use low&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum pressure (&lt;12 mmHg) is associated with a significant reduction of&#xD;
      postoperative pain.13 The optimization of the surgical field during laparascopic surgery can&#xD;
      be achieved with a deep neuromuscular block, using low pressure of insufflation.1 The benefit&#xD;
      of using a deep neuromuscular blockade to improve the conditions of laparoscopic surgery is&#xD;
      still controversial.14&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single center, prospective clinical trial. Patients scheduled for gynecologic&#xD;
      laparoscopy surgery with planned duration less than 60 min, will receive a deep (TOF count =&#xD;
      0 and posttetanic count -PTC- 1-2) or a moderate neuromuscular blockade (TOF count= 1 - 3)&#xD;
      according to clinical routine. 50 patients will be studied&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who give written informed consent to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age: 18-60 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASA risk class: I - II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elective gynecologic laparoscopic surgery lasting &lt;60 min (excision of ovarian cyst,&#xD;
           endometriosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Mass Index (BMI)&gt; 30 Kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with renal and hepatic dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuromuscular disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known hypersensitivity to study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conversion to laparotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be hospitalized (inpatient surgery). One hour before surgery, all the&#xD;
      subjects included in the study will receive 75 mg diclofenac SC, whilst ranitidine 100 mg IV&#xD;
      and ondansetron 4 mg IV will be administered as premedication before entering in the&#xD;
      operating room. Standard monitoring will be applied before induction of anesthesia: ECG,&#xD;
      pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure, BIS, acceleromyography at the adductor pollicis&#xD;
      muscle (TOF-Watch SX ®). A balanced general anesthesia will be adopted. Propofol 2mg/kg and&#xD;
      fentanyl 4mcg/kg IV will be administered during induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After calibration and stabilization of the TOF-Watch, tracheal intubation will be facilitated&#xD;
      with rocuronium bromide 1.2 mg/kg in the DNMB, and 0.6 mg/kg in the MNMB. Anesthesia will be&#xD;
      maintained with inhalation of a mixture of air / oxygen 50%/50%, and sevoflurane titrated to&#xD;
      obtain a BIS value between 40 - 60. Neuromuscular block will be maintained intraoperatively&#xD;
      by a) a continuous intravenous infusion of rocuronium at the starting dose of 0.3-0.6 mg / kg&#xD;
      / h , titrated to maintain a TOF count of 0, and a PTC between 1-2; b) neuromuscular blockade&#xD;
      will be maintained with intravenous bolus of rocuronium (0.15-0.25 mg/kg) titrated to obtain&#xD;
      a TOF count of 1-3. PTC will be evaluated every 5 min, whilst TOF every 15 sec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After insertion of the Veress needle, pneuomoperitoneum will be accomplished with a set&#xD;
      pressure up to 15 mmHg, but reduced to a value of 9 mmHg after all trocar placements. After&#xD;
      every 15 min from pneumoperitoneum and at the end of the procedure (before desufflation of&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum), surgeon will be asked to judge the surgical conditions with a five points&#xD;
      scale (Optimal= 5 points/ Good= 4 points / Adequate= 3 points / Poor = 2 points / Inadequate&#xD;
      = 1 point). In case of inadequate or poor surgical field that hampers surgery,&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum pressure will be increased to 12 mmHg and a bolus of rocuronium will be&#xD;
      given as judged appropriate by the attending anesthesiologist. In this case, the final score&#xD;
      (which is the average of all values) will be automatically 1 (inadequate). At the end of&#xD;
      surgery, after careful desufflation of pneumoperitoneum, sugammadex 4mg/kg in DNMB or 2mg/kg&#xD;
      in MNMB will be administered, and patients will be extubated when TOF-ratio &gt;0.9. In PACU,&#xD;
      the WAKE© score will be evaluated every 5 mins. When the score is ≥ 9 and the zero tolerance&#xD;
      criteria (pain, PONV, shivering, pruritus, and orthostatic symptoms) are not present,&#xD;
      patients will be discharged to ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For postoperative pain, diclofenac 50 mg SC will be given after 12 hours from the last&#xD;
      administration with paracetamol 1 gr IV q 6h starting at the end of surgery. Tramadol 1mg/kg&#xD;
      IV will be given as a rescue therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will necessitate at least 1 year from IRB approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables/Time Points of Interest Primary outcome is the evaluation of the intraoperative&#xD;
      surgical conditions assessed by the surgeon as a 5 points scale (Optimal= 5 points/ Good= 4&#xD;
      points / Adequate= 3 points / Poor = 2 points / Inadequate = 1 point).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 15 min from pneumoperitoneum and at the end of the procedure, surgeon will be asked to&#xD;
      judge the surgical conditions with this five points scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome is to compare the time to discharge from PACU assessed with the WAKE©&#xD;
      score. The WAKE© score will be assessed every 5 minutes from the arrival of the patient in&#xD;
      PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods The data analysis will be based on the intent-to-treat approach. The&#xD;
      primary end-point of the study is the influence of the depth of the NMB on the surgical&#xD;
      conditions assessed by a 5 points scale. For each patient, the final score will be the&#xD;
      average of all values (assessed every 15 min from pneuomoperitonuem and at the end of&#xD;
      surgery). The analysis on the final score will be tested using a t-test or a&#xD;
      Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, using R version 2.15.2 (R: A Language and Environment for&#xD;
      Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), with a P-value&lt;0.05 considered significant. Data&#xD;
      will be presented as mean (SD) or median (IQR), as judged appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary end-point evaluates the difference in time spent in PACU between the two&#xD;
      groups. The analysis will compare the average times to reach a WAKE© score ≥ 9 plus the&#xD;
      absence of the &quot;zero tolerance criteria&quot; (pain, PONV, shivering, pruritus, and orthostatic&#xD;
      symptoms) of the two groups. The WAKE© score will be assessed every 5 minutes from the&#xD;
      arrival of the patient in PACU. The analysis will be tested using a t-test or a&#xD;
      Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, using R version 2.15.2 (R: A Language and Environment for&#xD;
      Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), with a P-value&lt;0.05 considered significant. Data&#xD;
      will be presented as mean (SD) or median (IQR), as judged appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power/Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies,13, 15 a sample size of 50 patients would allow us to detect a&#xD;
      clinically relevant difference in the proportion of optimal surgical space conditions during&#xD;
      the entire procedure with a power of 80% and a type 1 error risk (α) of 5%.&#xD;
