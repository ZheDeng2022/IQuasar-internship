  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      obstetric hemorrhage remains one of the major causes of maternal death in both developed and&#xD;
      developing countries. Because of its importance as a leading cause of maternal mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity, and because of evidence of substandard care in the majority of fatal cases,&#xD;
      obstetric hemorrhage must be considered as a priority topic for national guideline&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some obstetricians believe that the cervix of women at non-labor cesarean section is&#xD;
      undilated and might cause obstruction of blood or lochia drainage, leading to postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage and endometritis from the collection of lochia or debris. Dilatation of the cervix&#xD;
      helps with the drainage of blood during postpartum, reducing intrauterine infection or the&#xD;
      risk of postpartum hemorrhage. To avoid this problem, some obstetricians routinely dilate the&#xD;
      cervix from above during an elective/ non-labor cesarean section using finger, sponge forceps&#xD;
      or other instruments&#xD;

      Obstetric hemorrhage remains one of the major causes of maternal death in both developed and&#xD;
      developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of its importance as a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, and because&#xD;
      of evidence of substandard care in the majority of fatal cases, obstetric hemorrhage must be&#xD;
      considered as a priority topic for national guideline development. Obstetric hemorrhage&#xD;
      encompasses both antepartum and postpartum bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The direct pregnancy-related maternal mortality rate in the United States is approximately&#xD;
      7-10 women per 100,000 live births. National statistics suggest that approximately 8% of&#xD;
      these deaths are caused by Post Partum Hemorrhage (PPH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In industrialized countries, PPH usually ranks in the top 3 causes of maternal mortality,&#xD;
      along with embolism and hypertension. In the developing world, several countries have&#xD;
      maternal mortality rates in excess of 1000 women per 100,000 live births, and World Health&#xD;
      Organization statistics suggest that 25% of maternal deaths are due to PPH, accounting for&#xD;
      more than 100,000 maternal deaths per year . The most recent Practice Bulletin from the&#xD;
      American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists places the estimate at 140,000 maternal&#xD;
      deaths per year or 1 woman every 4 minutes. The rate of PPH increased from 1.5% in 1999 to&#xD;
      4.1% in 2009, and the rate of atonic PPH rose from 1% in 1999 to 3.4% in 2009. In the&#xD;
      triennium 2006-2008, 261 women in the UK died directly or indirectly related to pregnancy.&#xD;
      The overall maternal mortality rate was 11.39 per 100,000 maternities. Direct deaths&#xD;
      decreased from 6.24 per 100,000 maternities in 2003-2005 to 4.67 per 100,000 maternities in&#xD;
      2006-2008 (p = 0.02). The number of deaths from postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) has halved to&#xD;
      ﬁve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many countries cesarean section (CS) has become the mode of delivery in over a quarter of&#xD;
      all births. It is the most commonly performed operation in obstetrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infectious morbidity is the most frequent complication of cesarean delivery. Of women who&#xD;
      have caesareans, 5-24% have clinically significant fevers; and 6-21% are diagnosed with&#xD;
      uterine infections (endomyometritis or endometritis), 1- 5% with more extensive pelvic&#xD;
      infections including abscesses and 2-9% with a breakdown of the surgical incision, most often&#xD;
      caused by wound infection. Strategies to minimize postoperative infectious and other&#xD;
      morbidities have included modifications of surgical technique, changing of gloves, methods of&#xD;
      placental delivery and altering the uterine position during repair of the uterine incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, none of these studies have evaluated the dilatation of the cervix during elective&#xD;
      CS. The practice of routine cervical dilatation at elective cesarean section is performed by&#xD;
      some surgeons to facilitate discharge of lochia from a uterus that was not in labor in the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mechanical dilatation of the cervix at cesarean section is deﬁned as an artiﬁcial&#xD;
      dilatation of the cervix performed by ﬁnger, sponge forceps or other instruments at non-labor&#xD;
      cesarean section.An important concern when dilating the cervix in a non-labor uterus is the&#xD;
      theoretical risk of ascending infection to the uterus from the vagina, abdominal cavity and&#xD;
      abdominal incision. In addition, cervical dilatation may be associated with the creation of a&#xD;
      false passage or hemorrhage from cervical injury. However, an undilated cervix may prevent&#xD;
      discharge of lochia following elective CS with retention of lochia, a potential culture&#xD;
      medium for bacteria, which can cause puerperal genital tract infection. Some published data&#xD;
      from developed countries have suggested that there is no difference in outcome between a&#xD;
      practice of routine cervical dilatation or non- dilatation at elective cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Turnbull's Obstetrics mentions using an extra glove on the left hand to dilate the cervix.&#xD;
      The information currently available about the advantages of cervical dilatation at cesarean&#xD;
      section is inconclusive. Therefore, evidence to support the effectiveness or safety of&#xD;
      cervical dilatation at cesarean section is needed&#xD;
