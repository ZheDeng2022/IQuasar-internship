    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm, post-approval study of the&#xD;
      FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System intended to characterize the safety of the&#xD;
      Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System when used in pediatric patients with diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 400 pediatric subjects aged 4-17 years with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who require&#xD;
      daily blood glucose monitoring to manage their diabetes, will be enrolled to obtain at least&#xD;
      314 subjects who complete the final visit. Subjects and/or their caregivers will utilize&#xD;
      capillary SMBG for managing diabetes for 6 months (control phase) followed by diabetes&#xD;
      management using FreeStyle Libre for 6 months (intervention phase). Subjects and/or their&#xD;
      caregivers will maintain a diary/log book of Adverse Events during each phase. Assessment of&#xD;
      Adverse Events will occur via self reporting at each monthly visit and/or phone call.&#xD;
