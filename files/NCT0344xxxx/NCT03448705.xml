  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safe usability of the study drugs, i.e.&#xD;
      4Fluart ID 1 µg haemagglutinin (HA)/0.1 ml QIV and 4Fluart ID 2 µg haemagglutinin (HA)/0.1 ml&#xD;
      QIV in terms of safety concerns emerged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to further assess safety in terms of safety&#xD;
      parameters, as well as to assess the immunogenicity of 4Fluart ID 1 µg haemagglutinin&#xD;
      (HA)/0.1 ml QIV and 4Fluart ID 2 µg haemagglutinin (HA)/0.1 ml QIV in terms of immunogenicity&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;

      Healthy volunteers (male and female) aged 18-59 years were enrolled into the study by signing&#xD;
      subject information leaflet and informed consent form. After screening them, subjects&#xD;
      complying with inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study, randomised and&#xD;
      vaccinated with one of the investigational medicinal products assigned by the randomisation&#xD;
      list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were observed for thirty (30) minutes after vaccination for any immediate reactions.&#xD;
      All adverse events (AEs) were collected from the enrolment to Day 21-28. Safety data between&#xD;
      Day 0 and Day 7-9 were documented on a Diary card by each subject. Safety assessment were&#xD;
      performed based on Day 7-9 and Day 21-28 safety data compared to the baseline on Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for immunogenicity assays were collected immediately before vaccination on Day&#xD;
      0 (pre-vaccination blood samples) and on Day 21-28 (post-vaccination blood samples) in all&#xD;
      subjects included in the study and complying with the study procedures. Immunogenicity were&#xD;
      evaluated by hemagglutinin inhibition test in order to assess immune response 3-4 weeks after&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of safety and immunogenicity of 4Fluart ID 1 µg/0.1 ml QIV and 4Fluart ID 2&#xD;
      µg/0.1 ml QIV was performed in comparison to the authorised 3Fluart, i.e. 3Fluart&#xD;
      intramuscular (IM) 6 µg/0.5 ml TIV.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>According to the objective, as well as the primary endpoints of the study, this is a Phase I study, open-label to the route of administration, single-blind to the ID doses, randomised, active-controlled that will be conducted in three parallel groups. Three visits will be performed in the study: on Day 0, Day 7-9 and Day 21-28. Pre-vaccination and post-vaccination serum samples are to be taken on Day 0 and Day 21-28. Adverse events will be documented between the enrollment and Day 21-28.</intervention_model_description>
