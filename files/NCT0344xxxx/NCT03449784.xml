  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis of the arterial vessel wall and to&#xD;
      thrombosis is the foremost cause of premature mortality and of disability-adjusted life years&#xD;
      in Europe, and is also increasingly common in developing countries. In the European Union,&#xD;
      the economic cost of CVD represents annually €192 billion in direct and indirect healthcare&#xD;
      costs. The main clinical entities are coronary artery disease (CAD), ischaemic stroke, and&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The causes of these CVDs are multifactorial. Some of these&#xD;
      factors relate to lifestyles, such as tobacco smoking, lack of physical activity, and dietary&#xD;
      habits, and are thus modifiable. Other risk factors are also modifiable, such as elevated&#xD;
      blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidaemias, or non-modifiable, such as age and male&#xD;
      gender. LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) is one of the major risk factors for CVD, through its role in&#xD;
      the development of atherosclerosis. The efficacy of statins has been demonstrated by a&#xD;
      considerable amount of literature not only in lowering LDL cholesterol levels but also in&#xD;
      reducing cardiovascular events, both in diabetes and non-diabetes patients. Guidelines for&#xD;
      the management of dyslipidemia have emerged from different countries. Thereby, in 2016 the&#xD;
      French Society of Endocrinology (SFE) and the New French Society of Atherosclerosis (NSFA)&#xD;
      published a consensus statement on the management of dyslipidemias integrating features from&#xD;
      European recommendations and in 2017 the Haute Autorité de Santé updated the French&#xD;
      guidelines. However, LDL-C goal attainment has rarely been assessed specifically in diabetes&#xD;
      population, in which CVD is of particular importance. This study aimed to assess the rate of&#xD;
      dyslipidaemias in a population of patient hospitalized in Endocrinology-Diabetology-Nutrition&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study was carried in the Diabetes-Nutrition unit of the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Montpellier - France. All consecutive patients admitted to that unit during the&#xD;
      study period were assessed for eligibility. Data on age, sex, tobacco smoking, body mass&#xD;
      index, hypertension (treatment of previously diagnosed hypertension or blood values &gt; 140/90&#xD;
      mmHg), presence and type of CVD (coronary artery disease, stroke and transient ischemic&#xD;
      attack, peripheral arterial disease), were collected at admission. LDL-C, HDL-C and&#xD;
      triglycerides levels calculated with the Friedewald formula, and glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      calculated according to the CKD-EPI formula were obtained from blood samples taken within 24&#xD;
      hours of hospitalization admission. Information on the name and daily dose of lipid lowering&#xD;
      drugs (statins, fibrate, ezetimibe …) at admission was documented. Cardiovascular risk level&#xD;
      and LDL-C target values were defined according to 2011 and 2016 ESC guidelines and 2017&#xD;
      French guidelines.&#xD;
