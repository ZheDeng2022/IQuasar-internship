  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most severe forms of alcohol-use disorder are thought to reflect an abnormal interplay&#xD;
      between two neural systems: an overly active impulsive one driven by immediate rewards&#xD;
      prospects and a weak reflective one, tuned on long-term prospects. The investigators propose&#xD;
      that two non-pharmacological interventions, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)&#xD;
      and Inhibitory Control Techniques (ICT) may act on both systems when combined, which might&#xD;
      ultimately result is a reduction of alcohol relapse rate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Treating Alcohol dependence remains notoriously difficult despite use of several medications,&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions. Alcohol dependence is thought to reflect an&#xD;
      abnormal interplay between two neural systems: an overly active impulsive one driven by&#xD;
      immediate rewards prospects and a weak reflective one, tuned on long-term prospects. The&#xD;
      investigators proposes that two non-pharmacological interventions, Transcranial Direct&#xD;
      Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Inhibitory Control Techniques (ICT) may act on both systems&#xD;
      when combined. tDCS has been found to improve working memory, which is necessary to evaluate&#xD;
      long-term consequences of actions. ICT is able to modify the automatic approach tendencies&#xD;
      towards appetitive cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 160 alcohol-dependent patients and divide them randomly&#xD;
      between four treatment conditions : real transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with&#xD;
      active or control Inhibitory Control Technique (ICT ); or sham (placebo) tDCS with active or&#xD;
      control ICT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated with primary outcome measures (alcohol consumption patterns) and&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures (working memory and changes in alcohol-related stimuli affective&#xD;
      values).&#xD;
