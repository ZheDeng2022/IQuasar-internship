  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early identification of trauma patients in need for Damage Control Resuscitation (DCR) has&#xD;
      potential to be beneficial for general emergency units that are not expected to be ready for&#xD;
      this rare situation 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. It could also be useful for high&#xD;
      performing trauma centers to identify such patients earlier and be able to provide earlier&#xD;
      adequate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By contrast, initiation of DCR in patients who do not require this aggressive therapy may&#xD;
      negatively affect their survival. An early identification of patients who do not require DCR&#xD;
      would probably be beneficial (impact on cost-effectiveness and on patients' survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence of the Trauma Induced Coagulopathy Clinical Score (TICCS) accuracy has been&#xD;
      evaluated in several studies but the potential effect of its use on patient outcomes needs to&#xD;
      be evaluated. There has never been any evaluation of the impact of a prehospital&#xD;
      discrimination of trauma patients with or without the need for DCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact on mortality of a prehospital&#xD;
      discrimination between trauma patients with or without a potential need for DCR. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives include evaluation of the feasibility of such discrimination and its impact on&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness. We hypothesize that the information will lead to improved quality of care&#xD;
      with reduced mortality and morbidity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be designed as randomized phase II clinical trial with comparison of the&#xD;
      experimental protocol (prehospital discrimination using the TICCS) against the standard of&#xD;
      care. Patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio in two groups: the intervention group will&#xD;
      benefit from a prehospital evaluation using the TICCS and from a specific treatment protocol&#xD;
      regarding the TICCS value. The control group will benefit from the standard local care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will involve several participating prehospital and hospital teams across Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control and intervention group will only differ in the management of potential bleeding and&#xD;
      coagulopathy. All patients will benefit from the recommended level of care regarding their&#xD;
      situation, including airway management, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) management, control of&#xD;
      external bleeding, cervical spine and extremities immobilization if needed …&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group The patients allocated in the control group will be managed as recommended in&#xD;
      the local guidelines and protocols. As the trial involves participating centers with&#xD;
      different prehospital and hospital realities and local practices, the control group will&#xD;
      reflect a wide panel of levels of care and will not be limited to a unique approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group The TICCS will be calculated on the site of injury for the patients taken&#xD;
      in charge in the intervention group. Those patients will be classified in two categories&#xD;
      regarding their TICCS value. Patients with TICCS ≥ 10 will be classified as in need for DCR;&#xD;
      while patients with TICCS &lt; 10 will be classified as not in need for DCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TICCS &lt; 10 This subgroup will be considered without a need for DCR and without coagulopathy.&#xD;
      There will not be any activation of the DCR components (no phone contact to the blood bank,&#xD;
      to the surgical team, no prehospital transfusion). There will be any prehospital&#xD;
      treatment/prevention of the hyperfibrinolysis using Tranexamic acid (TXA). Crystalloids&#xD;
      infusion will be allowed. All patients will benefit from the recommended level of care&#xD;
      regarding their situation (airway, TBI …), including trauma team activation if locally&#xD;
      recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TICCS ≥ 10&#xD;
&#xD;
      This subgroup will be considered with a need for DCR and with coagulopathy. They will be&#xD;
      treated using the STTTOPPP the bleeding protocol. The STTTOPPP the bleeding protocol is the&#xD;
      acronym for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical team pre-activation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trauma team pre-activation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transfusion team pre-activation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tranexamic acid (administration of 1 gram of TXA if documented hyperfibrinolysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  O negative Red Blood Cells (RBC) transfusion as soon as possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma and Platelets transfusion as soon as possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Permissive hypotension (restrictive use of crystalloids: no more than 500 milliliters&#xD;
           before definitive control of the bleeding is achieved)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prophylaxis (initiate antithrombotic prophylaxis as soon as the bleeding is under&#xD;
           control and coagulation tests are normal, first evaluation before the 24th hour after&#xD;
           trauma)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected locally in each participating center and will be anonymously recorded&#xD;
      on the trial website by the local Principal Investigator or his research assistant. The&#xD;
      website has been designed to avoid incomplete data, will give feedbacks (about the number of&#xD;
      patients included) to this respective centers every six months. The participating centers&#xD;
      will only have access to their own center database. The trial coordination team will have&#xD;
      access to the whole database and will not be able to record or change any data. After one&#xD;
      year of inclusion and in the end of the 24 months period of inclusion, data will be extracted&#xD;
      for interim and final analysis.&#xD;
