  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The need for empathy and the difficulties of coping with morality when caring for&#xD;
      the dying and the bereaved pose great psychological and spiritual strains. End-of-Life (EoL)&#xD;
      care professionals including doctors, nurses and social workers are particularly prone to&#xD;
      burnout given the intense emotional and existential nature of their work. Supervision is one&#xD;
      important way to provide adequate support that focuses on both professional and personal&#xD;
      competencies in working with death and loss. Previous research has provided strong evidence&#xD;
      that support the inclusion of art therapy within supervision for it had effectively reduced&#xD;
      burnout and enhanced emotional regulation. Combining the practice of mindfulness in&#xD;
      art-therapy based supervision has immense potential to create a dynamic platform for&#xD;
      self-care and collegial support, of which could ultimately cultivate sustained resilience,&#xD;
      compassion and growth among those immersed the fields of hospice and palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: A randomized wait-list control trial design. 60 EoL care professionals were&#xD;
      randomly allocated into one of two groups: (i) Intervention group (MCAT Supervision), and&#xD;
      (ii) Control group (MCAT Supervision will be provided after the intervention group completed&#xD;
      all supervision sessions). Both quantitative and qualitative outcomes were assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, immediately after intervention, and four weeks post intervention. Primary outcome&#xD;
      measure included level of burnout. Secondary outcomes included death attitude and fear of&#xD;
      death, emotional awareness and regulation, resilience, compassion, and overall quality of&#xD;
      life. Qualitative data were analyzed using Framework method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The integration of art and mindfulness practice to process the needs of&#xD;
      professional EoL caregivers for self-care is a scarcely explored area in the field of hospice&#xD;
      and palliative care in Singapore and in the international context. This pilot study proposes&#xD;
      to develop and test a novel Mindful-Compassion Art Therapy (MCAT) Supervision for&#xD;
      professional EoL caregivers. The expected outcome would generate new knowledge contributing&#xD;
      to advancements in both theories and practice in hospice and palliative care for Singapore&#xD;
      and across the globe.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on the established protocol of Art-Therapy based supervision together with the&#xD;
      additional elements of mindfulness practice, this study will adopt an randomized wait-list&#xD;
      control trial design comprising of two groups: (i) Intervention group (MCAT Supervision), and&#xD;
      (ii) Control group (MCAT Supervision will be provided after the intervention group completed&#xD;
      all supervision sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from a community-based collaborating partner, Hospice Care&#xD;
      Association (HCA), Singapore's largest home hospice care provider. Deputy Medical Director&#xD;
      and Programme Director of HCA Star PALs, together with his appointed staffs will provide&#xD;
      assistance in recruitment as well as tracking of participants, allowing for timely&#xD;
      intervention and efficient data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will comprise of 60 frontline EoL caregivers including doctors, nurses, social&#xD;
      workers and allied health professionals currently working in field of hospice and palliative&#xD;
      care (N=60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allowing for an attrition rate of 15% at follow-up, a sample of 60 will provide 80% power to&#xD;
      detect an effect size of 0.80 standard deviation units in the primary outcome measure of&#xD;
      Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey between the intervention and control group at the&#xD;
      (two-tailed test) 5% level of significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment, assessment, intervention, and follow up procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon informed consent and baseline assessment [T1] conducted via paper or electronic online&#xD;
      questionnaires, participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or waitlist&#xD;
      control group. Those assigned to in the intervention group will attend 6 weekly&#xD;
      Mindful-Compassion Art Therapy supervision led by a credentialed art therapist and an&#xD;
      experienced mindfulness practitioner at the training facilities of HCA. Each session will&#xD;
      last for 3 hours and each group will consists of 15 participants. Outcome assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted at two-time-points: immediately after intervention [T2] and four weeks post&#xD;
      intervention [T3]. Those assigned to the waitlist control group will receive no intervention&#xD;
      until approximately three month later; equivalent intervention and assessment procedures will&#xD;
      be administered. The 6-week 3-hour MCAT supervision will include elements of brief&#xD;
      psycho-education, weekly mindful mediation that serve as a foundation to foster art making,&#xD;
      reflective writing, group sharing and discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between and within participants comparisons of quantitative outcomes will be conducted and&#xD;
      the appropriate effect size estimates reported. The intervention group and control group will&#xD;
      be compared on the main outcome (i.e. burnout) and secondary outcomes (i.e. fear and negative&#xD;
      attitudes of death, emotional awareness and regulation, resilience, compassion, and overall&#xD;
      quality life). T2 and T3 assessments will be compared with baseline assessment. The&#xD;
      intervention and control groups will also be compared on demographic characteristics with&#xD;
      baseline measures; if necessary, they variables will be controlled in the analyses. The SPSS&#xD;
      statistical software package will be used to manage the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Framework method of analysis will be used to analyze qualitative data. 28 Analyses will&#xD;
      be both deductive (from pre-set aims and objectives) and inductive (arising from participants&#xD;
      view). This method tends to be more structured than some other methods of qualitative&#xD;
      analysis and the process more explicit and more informed by a priori questions. It is&#xD;
      designed so that it can be more easily understood and assessed by people other than the&#xD;
      analyst, such as funding bodies, policy makers and participants. Throughout the analytical&#xD;
      process we will use strategies to maximize credibility, criticality, and authenticity. The&#xD;
      QSR NVIVO software package will be used to manage the data.&#xD;
