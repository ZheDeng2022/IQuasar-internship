  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify a titration regimen of ABX-1431 in adults with neuropathic&#xD;
      pain with satisfactory tolerability to central nervous system (CNS) adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
      During the course of this study, each participant will take a daily dose of ABX-1431 or a&#xD;
      matching placebo for 28 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, optimized titration study of ABX-1431 HCl. The&#xD;
      study will explore whether patients experiencing ABX-1431-related CNS AE accommodate or&#xD;
      become tolerant to them with continued dosing. The efficacy of ABX-1431 in treating&#xD;
      neuropathic pain will be assessed by the change from baseline in pain intensity scores using&#xD;
      numerical rating scale (NRS-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a screening visit for enrollment criteria. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      be treated with daily medication for 28 days which will include some treatment with placebo&#xD;
      and some treatment with ABX-1431 HCl. Patients will record their daily average pain using a&#xD;
      paper numerical rating scale (NRS-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll up to 32 patients with peripheral neuropathic pain due to one of the&#xD;
      four following diagnostic groups: post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy,&#xD;
      small fiber neuropathy or post-traumatic neuropathic pain.&#xD;

Patients will undergo an optimized titration of ABX-1431 HCl with the daily dose between 8 mg and 24 mg of ABX-1431.
