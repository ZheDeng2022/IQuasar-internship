    <textblock>
      Nowadays radio-chemotherapy is considered an alternative to surgical treatment in patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced cancer of the cervico-cephalic district (LA-HNC), in order to guarantee&#xD;
      organ preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radio-induced dysphagia, as a multifactorial final effect, represents the real &quot;Achilles&#xD;
      Heel&quot;; it occurs in more than 50% of patients and can lead to a serious state of&#xD;
      malnutrition, with consequent long-term maintenance of a predominantly enteral nutrition with&#xD;
      PEG or risk of aspiration pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A therapeutic strategy of organ preservation should guarantee the greater probability of&#xD;
      tumor control and the minimum damage to the organ functions. Moreover, the reduction of&#xD;
      symptoms, related to changes in swallowing function and possible complications, could lead to&#xD;
      an improvement in the patient's quality of life and to a significant reduction in&#xD;
      hospitalization costs. Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT), have shown very promising&#xD;
      results both in terms of increased tumor control and reduction of toxicity, due to a&#xD;
      reduction in dose of radiation to the major salivary glands, pharyngeal mucosa and also to&#xD;
      the structures responsible for swallowing. For a correct and complete evaluation of the&#xD;
      deglutitory function should be useful the use of both clinical scales and instrumental&#xD;
      methods. It is strongly recommended by the international scientific community to use, in&#xD;
      association with the clinical evaluation, appropriate instrumental examinations for a correct&#xD;
      evaluation of the swallowing function both before and after radiotherapy. The examens that&#xD;
      are recognized as gold standards in the study of dysphagia are the Endoscopic Fibroscopy of&#xD;
      Swallowing (FEES) and Videofluoroscopy (VFS). The protocol envisages the use of Swallowing&#xD;
      Videoendoscopy (FEES) and Videofluoroscopy (VFS), that have to be performed in the baseline&#xD;
      conditions to assess the presence or absence of dysphagia cancer related, and after 6 and 12&#xD;
      months to evaluate the effect of the treatment. Patients should also complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      for the assessment of quality of life in relation to dysphagia problems. The Primary aim is&#xD;
      the Evaluation of changes of instrumental scores for swallowing function, the Secondary aims&#xD;
      are the correlation between instrumental scores and clinical score and the dose received from&#xD;
      each of the SWOARs with the deterioration of the instrumental and clinical scores. The&#xD;
      evaluation of the swallowing functions effectuated by VFS and FEES have to be done in the 20&#xD;
      days before the beginning of the treatment (Baseline Evaluation) and then at a distance of 6&#xD;
      and 12 months from the end of the treatment. Clinical evaluation of the impact of dysphagia&#xD;
      on quality of life by administering a specific MDADI (MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory)&#xD;
      questionnaire at baseline conditions and then at 6 and 12 months. Radiotherapy treatment have&#xD;
      to be necessarily performed with IMRT technique (static or dynamic). For the optimization&#xD;
      process of &quot;Inverse Planning&quot; the primary risk organs (P-OARs) and the secondary risk organs&#xD;
      must be both identified as &quot;Objective Structures&quot; (S-OARs), which include the organs&#xD;
      responsible for swallowing, indicated by the acronym SWOARs. In the treatment planning&#xD;
      process, the highest priority must be given to respect the constraints on the P-OARs, the PTV&#xD;
      coverage must have a higher priority than the constraints on the S-OARs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of extensive overlapping between PTV and a secondary risk organ (eg for the upper&#xD;
      constrictor muscle in patients with large nasopharyngeal tumor) it's a medical decision to&#xD;
      set any dosimetric constraint and to limit the average dose received from the structure in&#xD;
      analysis. At the end of radiotherapy planning, the average doses received from each of the&#xD;
      SWOARs must be recorded and will be used in the final statistical analysis. The use of image&#xD;
      fusion with MRI for the definition of both target volumes and OARs is strongly recommended.&#xD;
      Finally, the radiation treatment must include the use of on-line verification and correction&#xD;
      systems for the patient's Set-Up through three-dimensional imaging. The instrumental&#xD;
      assessment of the swallowing function involves the execution, under basal conditions (in the&#xD;
      20 days before the beginning of RT) and subsequently at a distance of 6 and 12 months from&#xD;
      the end of RT, both of the FEES and of the VFS. The exams must be done by specialist doctors&#xD;
      in Otorhinolaryngology (FEES) and Diagnostic Imaging (VFS), with consolidated experience in&#xD;
      the field of deglutology. Both tests are important for the evaluation of the pharyngeal phase&#xD;
      of the swallowing act.&#xD;

      Introduction Nowadays radio-chemotherapy is considered an alternative to surgical treatment&#xD;
      in patients with locally advanced cancer of the cervico-cephalic district (LA-HNC), in order&#xD;
      to guarantee organ preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, radiotherapy performed using conventional techniques (two-dimensional or&#xD;
      three-dimensional conformational) has always been burdened by high rates of severe toxicity,&#xD;
      that often had influenced the final result of treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact radio-induced dysphagia, as a multifactorial final effect, represents the real&#xD;
      &quot;Achilles Heel&quot;; it occurs in more than 50% of patients and can lead to a serious state of&#xD;
      malnutrition, with consequent long-term maintenance of a predominantly enteral nutrition with&#xD;
      PEG or risk of aspiration pneumonia; the percentage of dependence on PEG at 1 and 2 years is&#xD;
      around 24% and 14%, the incidence of aspiration pneumonia is around 3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A therapeutic strategy of organ preservation should guarantee the greater probability of&#xD;
      tumor control (TCP) and the minimum damage to the organ functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the reduction of symptoms, related to changes in swallowing function and possible&#xD;
      complications, could lead to an improvement in the patient's quality of life and to a&#xD;
      significant reduction in hospitalization costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent decades, technological improvements in the delivering of radiation treatment, for&#xD;
      example Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), have shown very promising results both&#xD;
      in terms of increased tumor control and reduction of toxicity, due to a reduction in dose of&#xD;
      radiation to the major salivary glands, pharyngeal mucosa and also to the structures&#xD;
      responsible for swallowing, identified as SWOARs (SWOARs: Swallowing Organs At Risk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have tried to evaluate the role of IMRT in organ preservation but the most&#xD;
      are retrospective studies, on heterogeneous case studies and in the absence of a baseline&#xD;
      evaluation of the swallowing function, that would allow a real analisys of the impact of&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy (RTCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, in most studies dysphagia was defined through the use of surrogate endpoints&#xD;
      such as the time of use of PEG from the end of treatment, the events of aspiration pneumonia&#xD;
      or the evidence of pharyngo-esophageal stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a correct and complete evaluation of the deglutitory function should be useful the use of&#xD;
      both clinical scales and instrumental methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of clinical assessment scales seems to significantly underestimate the dysphagic&#xD;
      phenomenon, compared to the use of instrumental methods that seem to be more objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is strongly recommended by the international scientific community to use, in&#xD;
      association with the clinical evaluation, appropriate instrumental examinations for a correct&#xD;
      evaluation of the swallowing function both before and after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examns that are recognized as gold standards in the study of dysphagia are the Endoscopic&#xD;
      Fibroscopy of Swallowing (FEES) and Videofluoroscopy (VFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The aim of the study is to prospectively investigate the impact of RTCT on the&#xD;
      deglutitory function in patients affected by LA-HNC, with the final goal of an organ&#xD;
      conservation therapy, that provides to preserved both anatomic and function of the&#xD;
      deglutitory apparatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this aim the protocol envisages the use of Swallowing Videoendoscopy (FEES) and&#xD;
      Videofluoroscopy (VFS), that have to be performed in the baseline conditions (before RTCT) to&#xD;
      assess the presence or absence of dysphagia cancer related, and after 6 and 12 months to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should also complete a questionnaire for the assessment of quality of life in&#xD;
      relation to dysphagia problems (MDADI questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary aim is the Evaluation of changes of instrumental scores for swallowing function,&#xD;
      evaluated at 6 and 12 months from the end of the RTCT (variations between dichotomous&#xD;
      variables or dichotomous yields); the Secondary aims are the correlation between instrumental&#xD;
      scores and clinical score and the correlation of the dose received from each of the SWOARs&#xD;
      with the deterioration of the instrumental and clinical scores Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Histological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma of the&#xD;
           otoiatric district&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. ECOG Status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Chemiotherapy concomitant at radiotherapy (Cisplatin 100mg / m2 every 21 days or 40mg /&#xD;

&#xD;
        5. Prior induction chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Prior oncological surgery on the ENT district&#xD;

        7. Prior radiation treatment on the ENT district&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Concomitant diseases that could modify the swallowing function (ex Amyotrophic Lateral&#xD;
           Sclerosis or Multiple Sclerosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. A history of excessive use of benzodiazepines or similar (ex patients in psychiatric&#xD;
           therapy) or eastroesophageal reflux resistant at medical therapy Methods Evaluation of&#xD;
           the swallowing functions effectuated by Videofluoroscopy (VFS) and Endoscopic Fibroscopy&#xD;
           of the Swallowing (FEES) in the 20 days before the beginning of the treatment (Baseline&#xD;
           Evaluation) and then at a distance of 6 and 12 months from the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation of the impact of dysphagia on quality of life by administering a specific&#xD;
      MDADI (MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory) questionnaire at baseline conditions and then at 6&#xD;
      and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy Radiotherapy treatment have to be necessarily performed with IMRT technique&#xD;
      (static or dynamic), after TC acquisition of the anatomical volume of interest (from the&#xD;
      skull base to the sternum-clavicular junction) with slices of 2.5 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the optimization process of &quot;Inverse Planning&quot; the primary risk organs (P-OARs) and the&#xD;
      secondary risk organs must be both identified as &quot;Objective Structures&quot; (S-OARs), which&#xD;
      include the organs responsible for swallowing, indicated by the acronym SWOARs (8 in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment planning process, the highest priority must be given to respect the&#xD;
      constraints on the P-OARs, the PTV coverage must have a higher priority than the constraints&#xD;
      on the S-OARs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of extensive overlapping between PTV and a secondary risk organ (eg for the upper&#xD;
      constrictor muscle in patients with large nasopharyngeal tumor) it's a medical decision to&#xD;
      set any dosimetric constraint and to limit the average dose received from the structure in&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of radiotherapy planning, the average doses (DM) received from each of the 8&#xD;
      SWOARs must be recorded and will be used in the final statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of image fusion with MRI for the definition of both target volumes and OARs is&#xD;
      strongly recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the radiation treatment must include the use of on-line verification and correction&#xD;
      systems for the patient's Set-Up through three-dimensional imaging (IGRT-3D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumental evaluation of the deglutitory function (Endpoints) The instrumental assessment&#xD;
      of the swallowing function involves the execution, under basal conditions (in the 20 days&#xD;
      before the beginning of radiotherapy) and subsequently at a distance of 6 and 12 months from&#xD;
      the end of radiotherapy, both of the FEES and of the VFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exams must be done by specialist doctors in Otorhinolaryngology (FEES) and Diagnostic&#xD;
      Imaging (VFS), with consolidated experience in the field of deglutology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both tests are important for the evaluation of the pharyngeal phase of the swallowing act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instrumental parameters to be studied are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-deglutitory Fall: Deficit in the oral phase; delay in triggering the swallowing act;&#xD;
           nasal regurgitation (Velopalatin insufficiency)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TTF (Faringeal Transit Time): expression of the transit time of the bolus through the&#xD;
           pharynx&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IRF (Pharyngeal Retention Index): expression of the bolus residue percentage in pharynx&#xD;
           (glosso-epiglottic vallecule and / or piriform sinuses and / or posterior laryngeal&#xD;
           commissure, pharyngeal lateral wall) following the deglutitory act&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Penetration / Aspiration: expression of the bolus entry into the airways above the&#xD;
           glottal plane (Penetration) or beyond the glottal plane (Aspiration) and the&#xD;
           effectiveness of the tussigen reflex mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exams must be performed following the intake of boluses of different consistencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For FEES it's important to use liquid bolus (L), semi-solid bolus (SS) and solid bolus (S),&#xD;
      while for VFS a liquid (L) and semi-solid (SS) bolus; each instrument parameter must be&#xD;
      tested for the different consistencies of boluses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, being assessed for FEES 3 parameters for 3 different bolus consistencies and for&#xD;
      VFS 4 parameters for 2 different bolus consistencies, 9 instrumental scores for FEES and 8&#xD;
      instrumental scores for VFS will be reported by the operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of penetration or aspiration, a score (from 1 to 8) must be assigned according to the&#xD;
      PAS scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation of swallowing function (Endpoints) Before the start of the RTCT treatment&#xD;
      and at 6 and 12 month from the end of treatment, the MDADI questionnaire will be administered&#xD;
      in order to evaluate the impact of treatment related dysphagia on the patient's quality of&#xD;
      life .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology Primary objective n. 1 The Mc Nemar Test will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      significant changes in instrumental scores related to the different parameters of dysphagia&#xD;
      between the baseline and 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The p-value and the power of the study are fixed at 0.05 and 0.80 respectively. To make the&#xD;
      deterioration of one or more (variable) parameters of dysphagia (eg, predegulatory and&#xD;
      aspiration fall) significant after radiochemotherapy, which involves a variation from 5%&#xD;
      (baseline) to 25% (6 or 12 months post-treatment), 35 patients are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective n. 2 To evaluate the correlation between instrumental scores and the&#xD;
      clinical score of dysphagia (quantitative variables), Pearson correlation analysis will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The p-value and the power of the study are fixed at 0.05 and 0.80 respectively. To make a&#xD;
      coefficient of correlation between instrumental and clinical scores equal to 0.3, 85 patients&#xD;
      are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective For the analysis of the correlations between the dose received from each&#xD;
      of the 8 structures responsible for swallowing (SWOARs) and the worsening of instrumental&#xD;
      scores, Pearson correlation analysis will be used (after which multivariate analyzes will be&#xD;
      carried out).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The p-value and the power of the study are fixed at 0.05 and 0.80 respectively. To make a&#xD;
      correlation coefficient of 0.3 between the doses received by each individual SWOAR and the&#xD;
      worsening of the instrumental scores of one or more parameters of dysphagia significant,&#xD;
      about 85 patients are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPSS Sample Power program was used to calculate the sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating Mode The referring physician of each participating, will have the database in&#xD;
      Access format for the compilation and electronic registration of the data, which must be&#xD;
      personalized by inserting the center of origin in the appropriate box.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of recruitment the patient will be registered on the database in addition to&#xD;
      personal data (initial surname and name and date of birth), general oncological data (staging&#xD;
      and risk factors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of radiotherapy, the scores of the instrumental examinations relative to the&#xD;
      baseline evaluation and the average doses (Dm) that will receive the single SWOARs will have&#xD;
      to be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the radiotherapy, the clinical data of the treatment will be recorded (date of&#xD;
      start and end of radiotherapy, scheduling of the chemotherapy and total number of cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the revaluation instrumental tests will instead be updated respectively at 6&#xD;
      and 12 months from the end of the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up will finally be systematically updated at each control visit, based on the&#xD;
      timing provided by the single center, according to the specifications reported in the&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be excluded form study in case of persistence / relapse of histological&#xD;
      documented local or regional disease, that includes rescue surgery on T or chemotherapy in&#xD;
      the period of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, rescue surgery on N is not a criterion for leaving the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also the appearance of distant metastases documented with radiological and nuclear imaging in&#xD;
      the study enrollment period is an exit criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to verify the correctness in the performance of the instrumental evaluation, the&#xD;
      Coordinating Center will be able to request, in a &quot;random&quot; way, the sending of the videos of&#xD;
      the examinations carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      indicating the progressive identification number, the patient's initials and the enrollment&#xD;
      center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Benefits and Economic / Organizational Relapses The clinical management of patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced neoplasm of the head-neck district has always been extremely complex&#xD;
      due to the serious &quot;treatment-related&quot; toxicities, that have as main factor the difficulty in&#xD;
      feeding and consequently maintain an adequate nutritional intake, essential for cope with&#xD;
      curative treatments such as radiochemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore frequent the placement of devices for enteral feeding, such as nasogastric&#xD;
      tubes or percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG), or to the use of parenteral nutrition pockets, which&#xD;
      inevitably require long periods of hospitalization for the patient, during treatment and&#xD;
      often for weeks after the end of RTCT. The consequences are doubly negative, for the&#xD;
      worsening of the patient's quality of life and psychological conditions, and also for the&#xD;
      considerable increase in healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical management of this type also requires a period of suspension of the radiant&#xD;
      treatment, with negative repercussions in terms of the patient's chance of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A view to a multidisciplinary sharing of therapeutic choices, that involve not only the&#xD;
      surgeon, the oncologist, radiotherapist and the medical oncologist as usually in done, but&#xD;
      also involving other professionals figures (deglutologist, nutritionist, speech therapist)&#xD;
      that can improve the clinical management of the radiochemotherapy patient, and consequently&#xD;
      reduce the number of admissions for toxicity during and after the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, we believe that a study of swallowing capacity and nutritional set-up may&#xD;
      help in establishing early, before treatment and shortly distance from the end of the same,&#xD;
      all possible aids, for example by means of postural compensation exercises, swallowing&#xD;
      maneuvers and advice on the type of food to be preferred in relation to the risks of&#xD;
      inhalation and nutrition, through careful monitoring and personalized nutritional support .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way the patient is n the best conditions to face the radiochemotherapy treatment and&#xD;
      to recover from the side effects.&#xD;
