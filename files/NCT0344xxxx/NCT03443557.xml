      A retrospective study based on Thai data from Nutrition Day study (nD). Comparing clinical&#xD;
      outcome between malnourished patients who were prescribed oral nutrition supplement along&#xD;
      with hospital diet and those without oral nutrition supplement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of malnutrition in hospitalized patients varies from 30-70% depend on category of&#xD;
      patients recruited. Adverse effects of malnutrition include increase of infection&#xD;
      complication, increase hospital length of stay, and increase mortality. Prescription of oral&#xD;
      nutrition supplement (ONS) have been proved to provide patients more calorie and protein&#xD;
      intake and can improve patients' outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the proved benefits of oral nutrition supplement(ONS), prescription of it in Thai&#xD;
      hospitalized patients are far less than it should. The main reason of this under-practice is&#xD;
      the limitation of health policies which considered ONS as an optional from main meals.&#xD;
      Additional cost for ONS has to be paid by patients themselves, therefore the patients who&#xD;
      have no willing to pay usually refuse to receive ONS. Unawareness of physician regarding its&#xD;
      benefits is also a problem. In order to convince Thai authorities to allow for reimbursement&#xD;
      of ONS and encourage prescription of ONS among physicians, an evidence based benefits of ONS&#xD;
      in large Thai population is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nD study was a single-day, population-based, standardized, multinational, cross-sectional&#xD;
      audit and was performed worldwide, includes Thailand, in hospitals, nursing homes and&#xD;
      intensive care units performing since 2006 to present. Every year, registered hospitals&#xD;
      survey their patients regarding nutritional status, nutritional support. A follow-up for&#xD;
      clinical outcome are perform at 30 days after the first survey, include mortality,&#xD;
      readmission. This study will based on data of Thai patients collected from nD study during&#xD;
      2006-2016.&#xD;
