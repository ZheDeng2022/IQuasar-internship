    <textblock>
      Gingivitis in the geriatric population is one of the growing global public health concerns,&#xD;
      thus finding the most effective and non-invasive approach to prevent and treat gingivitis in&#xD;
      the geriatric population is essential to prevent tooth loss and maintain oral health and&#xD;
      function. Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) is Class II medical device. It was cleared for use in&#xD;
      US August 2014 and became commercially available in April 2015. It is a chemical agent which&#xD;
      has bifunctional properties. The silver itself kills caries causing bacteria directly. Silver&#xD;
      and fluoride together interact to form fluorapatite, in addition, assist in hardening the&#xD;
      teeth and preventing further demineralization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though SDF has been approved in dental caries prevention and treatment, there are no&#xD;
      published studies or evidence that evaluated the direct effect of SDF on gingivitis. If SDF&#xD;
      improves or prevents gingivitis is unknown. The main goal of this clinical study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of SDF on gingival status in geriatric patients with gingivitis. There&#xD;
      is an urgent need to solve this common oral disease in the geriatric population. The logic&#xD;
      for this research in a geriatric population is to find the most effective approach to treat&#xD;
      gingivitis to prevent tooth loss and maintain oral health and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find an effective approach to treat gingivitis in the geriatric group, we will investigate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of SDF application on gingival tissues in this group. The patients with&#xD;
      gingivitis will be randomly allocated to two groups: group1(case group) will receive SDF&#xD;
      application and group 2 (control group) will receive a normal saline application. The gingiva&#xD;
      will be evaluated for both groups at baseline before the application. Then 2 weeks and 4&#xD;
      weeks after the last application of the intervention. In addition, a sample of plaque will be&#xD;
      taken from the teeth selected in this study by swab using the dental kit (Ubiome) before and&#xD;
      after both applications to quantify the presence of bacterial pathogen at baseline and follow&#xD;
      up visits. The feasibility of this proposed therapy is supported by published literature that&#xD;
      has shown that SDF was effective in dental and root caries prevention and treatment in&#xD;
      geriatric patients.&#xD;

      The Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1 To investigate the effect of SDF application on gingival status in elder patients&#xD;
           with gingivitis. To accomplish this aim, the subjects with gingivitis will be randomly&#xD;
           allocated to two groups: group 1(case group) will receive SDF application and group 2&#xD;
           (control group) will receive Normal Saline. The SDF and normal saline will apply on the&#xD;
           selected teeth with gingivitis once a week during a three-week period. The gingival&#xD;
           status will be evaluated at baseline before the application of either SDF or normal&#xD;
           saline. Then at the second week and fourth week after the final application. The&#xD;
           measurable outcomes will be Plaque Index (PI) and the Gingival Index (GI). In addition,&#xD;
           record of existing brushing and flossing habits. If SDF application shows an improvement&#xD;
           in the gingival condition (reduction in the plaque and gingival indices) in treatment&#xD;
           group comparing to the control group it indicates that its effectiveness not only on&#xD;
           dental caries as published, but it is also may extended to include gingivitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2 To quantify the presence of bacterial pathogen in the dental biofilm. To&#xD;
           accomplish this aim, a sample of dental plaque will be taken from the teeth selected in&#xD;
           this study by swab using the dental kit (Ubiome) before and after the SDF or normal&#xD;
           saline application to quantify the presence of bacterial pathogen at baseline before the&#xD;
           application, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed therapeutic intervention of Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) in treating geriatric&#xD;
      patients with gingivitis will establish a new adjunctive and inexpensive protocol for&#xD;
      treatment of gingivitis. Gingivitis is inflammation of gingival tissues caused by dental&#xD;
      biofilm bacterial infection. Left untreated, gingivitis will cause tooth loss. The&#xD;
      preliminary results will provide new recommendations for treating geriatric patients in a&#xD;
      safe, effective, and low-cost manner. This study will also address the gap in scientific&#xD;
      knowledge regarding the use of SDF to treat gingivitis in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis: The application of SDF varnish is expected to improve the gingival&#xD;
      condition and can be an effective approach in the treatment of gingivitis in geriatric&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis: The application of SDF varnish does not improve the gingival condition and&#xD;
      cannot be an effective approach in the treatment of gingivitis in geriatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question: Does the application of silver Diamine Fluoride on teeth with gingivitis&#xD;
      will improve the gingival condition in geriatric patients with gingivitis&#xD;
