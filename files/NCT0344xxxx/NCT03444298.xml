      Purpose: To determine the efficacy of 1400 mg gamma tocopherol-enriched supplement for&#xD;
      mitigating inhaled wood smoke particle-induced airway inflammation in healthy adults with no&#xD;
      more than mild asthma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Particulate matter (PM) is a leading cause of respiratory tract and cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      the United States and world-wide. Wood smoke particles (WSP) derived from wildland and other&#xD;
      fires account for a significant fraction of ambient air PM. Health effects associated with&#xD;
      WSP include acute bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, cough and systemic&#xD;
      inflammation. While these effects are seen in both healthy and asthmatic individuals, many&#xD;
      studies indicate that asthmatics have increased susceptibility to the effects of WSP. The&#xD;
      investigators have developed a 500 μg/m3 WSP exposure protocol (levels similar to those&#xD;
      encountered by firefighters and residents in close proximity to wildland burn sites) that&#xD;
      induces airway and systemic inflammation in healthy volunteers. As with other pollutants,&#xD;
      these inflammatory responses modulate non-specific bronchial reactivity (NSBR), inflammatory&#xD;
      cell recruitment to the airways (primarily neutrophils), and potentially cardiovascular&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have focused on gamma tocopherol (γT) as a nutritional intervention to&#xD;
      prevent inflammatory responses to air pollutants such as WSP. Building on animal and in vitro&#xD;
      preclinical studies, the investigators have established that 1400 mg/day of oral γT-enriched&#xD;
      supplement for 7 and 14 days in healthy volunteers and mild asthmatics, respectively,&#xD;
      inhibited neutrophil influx into the airways, reduced production of sputum mucins, and&#xD;
      improved mucociliary clearance following challenge with inhaled endotoxin, another common&#xD;
      component of PM. The findings occurred in the context of significantly increased plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of γT and its active metabolite&#xD;
      2,7,8-trimethyl-2-(β-Carboxy-Ethyl)-6-Hydroxychroman (γ-CEHC). Given the findings in these&#xD;
      early phase clinical trials, γT supplementation is an attractive approach to prevent&#xD;
      WSP-induced adverse health effects. The investigators propose to use γT supplementation in a&#xD;
      human model of WSP inhalation to mitigate key features of airway inflammation: inflammatory&#xD;
      cell recruitment, production of inflammatory cytokines and mucous, and changes in airway&#xD;
      physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gamma tocopherol will be administered in softgel form, with each softgel containing 700 mg of&#xD;
      tocopherols, 89.5% of which is d-gamma tocopherol. Subjects will consume two softgels by&#xD;
      mouth once daily for 7 days. This dosing regimen was chosen based on the results of the&#xD;
      investigators' previous early phase clinical trials examining the impact of gamma tocopherol&#xD;
      on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced airway inflammation in healthy adults and adults with&#xD;
      asthma. These studies tested a 7 and 14 day course of treatment, respectively, and found&#xD;
      similar plasma concentrations of γT and active metabolites in both studies. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators showed in both studies that γT significantly reduced LPS-induced sputum&#xD;
      neutrophilia compared to placebo. Based on the previous findings, the investigators will now&#xD;
      study the efficacy of γT for mitigating WSP-induced airway inflammation.&#xD;

             non-therapeutic protocol. Individuals over 45 years of age will not be included due to&#xD;
