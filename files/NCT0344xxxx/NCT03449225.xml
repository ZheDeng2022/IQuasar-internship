  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A standard part of obstetrical care is offering prenatal genetic screening. Numerous&#xD;
      professional guidelines have emphasized the importance of pretest counseling for prenatal&#xD;
      genetic screenings. Informed consent includes the optional nature of the test, information on&#xD;
      the conditions being screened, possible test results, implication of each result, and the&#xD;
      type of test offered (screening or diagnostic). This responsibility falls on the physician in&#xD;
      a busy clinic. Technology may be able to address this limitation and give consistent pretest&#xD;
      counseling for patients waiting for their appointment. This study is looking to evaluate the&#xD;
      use of computer-aided genetics education module for facilitating decision making about&#xD;
      prenatal genetic screening and testing for fetal chromosome conditions and carrier status.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale Cytogenetic abnormalities are present in nearly 1% of live births, in approximately&#xD;
      2% of pregnancies in women older than 35 years who undergo prenatal diagnosis, and in fully&#xD;
      half of all spontaneous, first-trimester abortions. Genetic counseling and screening for&#xD;
      cytogenetic abnormalities are an integral part of routine obstetrical care. There are various&#xD;
      screening options and strategy available commercially, including screening for the fetus and&#xD;
      parental carrier screening. Currently American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG)&#xD;
      recommends that all pregnant women should be offered screening for fetal aneuploidy. ACOG&#xD;
      also recommends panethnic screening for cystic fibrosis, hemoglobinopathies and spinal&#xD;
      muscular atrophy carrier status. For other conditions, glycogen storage diseases and fragile&#xD;
      X syndrome, the recommendation currently is to screen based on ethnicity and family history.&#xD;
      Without thorough counseling, pregnant women may accept multiple screenings without&#xD;
      considering the downstream consequences, including anxiety created by additional, sometimes&#xD;
      uncertain, information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous professional societies guidelines have emphasized the importance of pre-test&#xD;
      counseling in this setting due to the delicate and complicated nature of genetic conditions.&#xD;
      Along with these guidelines, typically minimal recommended information to be provided during&#xD;
      a pre-test counseling was included. Generally it involves, the optional nature of the test,&#xD;
      general information about condition tested, nature of testing (screening, carrier screening&#xD;
      or diagnostic), testing options, possible testing result, implication of each result, cost&#xD;
      and availability of genetic counseling should needed. The responsibility of offering these&#xD;
      tests and to perform pre-test counseling lie primarily on the obstetrical care providers and&#xD;
      has become more burdensome as the number of testing options expands and also due to limited&#xD;
      time for discussion during a prenatal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technology may be able to address these limitations. Various studies have evaluated the use&#xD;
      of Computerized Decision Aids (CDAs) in facilitating high-quality decision making in various&#xD;
      health related contexts with promising results (17-20). CDAs are generally superior to&#xD;
      traditional decision aids such as, paper-based or video-based, due to the possibility to&#xD;
      tailor CDAs based on the information provided, the ease of information dissemination and also&#xD;
      their interactive features which reinforce participation. This study is looking to evaluate&#xD;
      the use of computer-based pre-test education for prenatal cytogenetic abnormalities&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of Problem Per professional society guidelines, all women should be offered&#xD;
      prenatal screening and/or diagnostic testing for fetal aneuploidy (chromosome conditions such&#xD;
      as Down syndrome, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and sex chromosome abnormalities) during pregnancy.&#xD;
      Women should also be offered population-based carrier screening but have the option of&#xD;
      expanded carrier screening as well. There are an increasing number of testing and screening&#xD;
      options available during pregnancy. The obstetrics provider is primarily responsible for&#xD;
      ensuring patients are informed about their options and the benefits, risks, and limits of&#xD;
      each. These discussions can be time intensive in a setting where the time available is often&#xD;
      limited. As such, there is a need to find alternate ways to educate women about their&#xD;
      prenatal testing and screening options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The overarching purpose of the full project is to determine whether a computer&#xD;
      aided genetics education module can improve pregnant women's knowledge about their options&#xD;
      for fetal aneuploidy (chromosome) screening and testing and carrier screening and facilitate&#xD;
      informed decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the current study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a computer-aided genetics education module for prenatal cytogenetic&#xD;
           abnormalities screening and testing and carrier screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the acceptability of the computer-aided genetics educational module for&#xD;
           women presenting for care in an obstetrics clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of using the computer-aided genetics educational module in&#xD;
           a busy obstetrics clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether use of the module increases knowledge and enhances informed decision&#xD;
           making&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effectiveness of the computer-aided education module to standard care in&#xD;
           terms of knowledge gained and impact on decision making&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done in two phases. Phase 1 will involve evaluating the acceptability of&#xD;
      the computer-aided genetics education module. Changes will be made to the module based on the&#xD;
      feedback obtained. The revised module will then be used for Phase 2. Phase 2 will involve&#xD;
      comparing the effectiveness of the computer-aided genetics education module to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinician who has access to the daily clinic patient list will identify patients eligible&#xD;
      to participate in the study and notify an onsite study team member. Eligible study&#xD;
      participants will then be approached by one of the study team members (either a genetic&#xD;
      counselor, a genetic counseling student, a medical student, or a maternal-fetal medicine&#xD;
      fellow) and be invited to participate in the study. The potential participant will be given&#xD;
      the study information sheet and the study team member will review it with her. If the&#xD;
      approached participant agrees to take part, participant will be randomized into one of the&#xD;
      two arms of the study-control versus tests arm. Randomization will be performed using&#xD;
      Qualtrics platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control arm: The participant will be given a digital device (IPad or Kindle Fire) to&#xD;
           complete a pre-education survey (web-based pre-intervention survey housed on the&#xD;
           Qualtrics platform). Once the survey is complete, the participant will proceed with&#xD;
           standard education, provided by a resident/physician in the clinic, about prenatal&#xD;
           screening and testing for chromosome conditions and for carrier status. Once the&#xD;
           standard education has been completed, the participant will be approached to complete a&#xD;
           post-education survey which includes questions about knowledge, intent to have or&#xD;
           decline screening or testing, and demographic variables. Once the post-education survey&#xD;
           is completed, the participant will be given a $5 gift card for her time. Participation&#xD;
           in the study is then complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test arm: The participant she will be given a digital device on which to access the&#xD;
           computer-aided genetics educational module. Prior to accessing the module, the&#xD;
           participant will be asked to complete a pre-education survey (web-based pre-intervention&#xD;
           survey housed on the Qualtrics platform). Once she has completed the survey, she will&#xD;
           interact with the module which is tailored for her clinical situation. Once the&#xD;
           participant has completed reviewing the module, she will be asked to complete the&#xD;
           web-based post-module survey which includes questions about knowledge, intent to have or&#xD;
           decline screening or testing, acceptability of the module, and demographic variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All responses (control and test) will be recorded using a unique participant&#xD;
           identification number in order to pair pre- and post-intervention responses. The&#xD;
           identifier will not be linked to any identifiable information. Of note, all subjects&#xD;
           will receive standard provider counseling after completion of the study module (standard&#xD;
           of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: During Phase 1, The investigators will assess the acceptability of the&#xD;
      computer-aided genetics educational module in our target study population. During this&#xD;
      initial phase, The investigators will only be doing the test arm of the study. Quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative responses from the pre- and post-surveys will be obtained from batches of 10&#xD;
      samples; the module will then be optimized based on the qualitative feedback and overall&#xD;
      results on the knowledge, acceptability, and informed consent questions. This will be&#xD;
      repeated until user acceptability reaches 80% of the maximum score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computerized educational module has been developed based on counseling points recommended&#xD;
      by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and is based on a previous study&#xD;
      investigating computer-aided education. The application can be accessed at&#xD;
      https://interva-online.mobi/CAGEM/participant/guestLogin.do?packageId=178&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey Instruments There are three separate survey instruments, all of which have been&#xD;
      developed on the Qualtrics survey platform. The pre-education survey instrument is the same&#xD;
      for control and test participants and includes basic knowledge questions about genetic&#xD;
      testing and screening for chromosome conditions and carrier status. The questions are based&#xD;
      on the standard information that should be presented when providing genetic counseling on&#xD;
      these topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two versions of the post-intervention survey. Both versions include knowledge&#xD;
      questions (same as pre-test questions) and demographic questions. The surveys differ in that&#xD;
      the survey for those taking part in the test arm include questions about the acceptability of&#xD;
      the computer-aided genetics educational module.&#xD;
