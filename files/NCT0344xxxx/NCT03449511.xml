  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of&#xD;
      aromatherapy in relief of commonly reported symptoms in cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Aromatherapy is a noninvasive, minimal risk intervention that could potentially&#xD;
      alleviate the severity of treatment-related symptoms. This study will evaluate the ability of&#xD;
      four aromatherapy scents (ginger, lavender, orange, jojoba) to reduce the severity of seven&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety/distress, fatigue, sleep&#xD;
      difficulties, and lack of appetite). Jojoba oil is a &quot; carrier oil&quot; and will act as a placebo&#xD;
      comparator in this study. Jojoba oil is present in small amount (1 drop) in the ginger,&#xD;
      lavender, and orange aromatherapy inhalers. As part of the study, the participants will be&#xD;
      asked to use an aromatherapy inhaler, which resembles a lipstick container, during three&#xD;
      chemotherapy cycles. The participants will use the aromatherapy inhaler for 7 consecutive&#xD;
      days. The investigators will ask the participants questions regarding demographics, clinical&#xD;
      information, current severity of symptoms, and current methods of symptom management. There&#xD;
      is a non-intervention baseline cycle during which subjects rate the severity of the seven&#xD;
      different symptoms from 0 to 10 for seven consecutive days during their first chemotherapy&#xD;
      study cycle. The next two study cycles are intervention cycles using the randomized&#xD;
      aromatherapy. The participants will rate the severity of seven different symptoms from 0 to&#xD;
      10 each day the aromatherapy inhaler during one or two chemotherapy cycles (i.e., 7&#xD;
      consecutive days during each chemotherapy cycle). At the end of the study, the participants&#xD;
      will be asked about his/her satisfaction with the aromatherapy used during the study. All of&#xD;
      these measurements will provide a better understanding of the effectiveness of aromatherapy&#xD;
      for symptom management.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the ability of four aromatherapy scents (ginger, lavender, orange,&#xD;
      jojoba) to reduce the severity of seven chemotherapy-induced symptoms (nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      pain, anxiety/distress, fatigue, sleep difficulties, and lack of appetite). Subjects will&#xD;
      participate in the study for two or three chemotherapy cycles. The first cycle is a&#xD;
      non-intervention baseline cycle during which subjects rate the severity of the seven&#xD;
      different symptoms from 0 to 10 for seven consecutive days during their first chemotherapy&#xD;
      study cycle. The next one or two cycles are intervention cycle(s) using the assigned&#xD;
      randomized aromatherapy. The subjects will rate the severity of seven different symptoms from&#xD;
      0 to 10 each day the aromatherapy inhaler during one or two chemotherapy cycles (i.e., 7&#xD;
      consecutive days during each chemotherapy cycle) and report if they felt the aromatherapy was&#xD;
      helping with symptoms compared to the previous cycle. At the end of the study, the&#xD;
      participants will be asked about his/her satisfaction with the aromatherapy used during the&#xD;
      study. All of these measurements will provide a better understanding of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      aromatherapy for symptom management.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a) Male and female subjects, at least 8 years of age, prescribed chemotherapy for&#xD;
             cancer. (NOTE: Only non-pregnant females are eligible). University of Rochester will&#xD;
             enroll young adults (i.e., 21-39 years) and adults (i.e., 40 years and older). RPCI&#xD;
             will enroll adolescents (i.e., 8-20 years) and young adults (i.e., 21-39 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
             b) Scheduled to receive two or more cycles of chemotherapy. (NOTE: Subjects may have&#xD;
             already started chemotherapy, but must have at least three chemotherapy cycles&#xD;
             remaining in their current prescribed course.)&#xD;
&#xD;
             c) Day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle must be separated from Day 1 of the next&#xD;
             chemotherapy cycle by at least 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             d) All cancer types and chemotherapy regimens are eligible. (NOTE: Monoclonal antibody&#xD;
             therapies are allowed if administered in combination with chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
             e) The chemotherapy regimen must be the same regimen for all study cycles. For&#xD;
             example, if a subject with breast cancer was prescribed TAC for Study Cycle 1, the&#xD;
             subject must receive TAC for Study Cycles 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             f) Any number of chemotherapy administrations per week during a chemotherapy treatment&#xD;
             cycle is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             g) Subjects must agree to discontinue their current use of aromatherapy for symptom&#xD;
             management during the course of the study. They must solely use the jojoba and&#xD;
             aromatherapy inhalers provided by the study during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             h) University of Rochester will enroll subjects who are able to read and understand&#xD;
             English or Spanish. RPCI will enroll subjects who are able to read and understand&#xD;
             English. All subjects must be able to provide informed consent in order to participate&#xD;
             in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects &lt; 8 years old are not eligible for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant females are ineligible for the study because pregnancy is a contraindication&#xD;
             for chemotherapy and exposure to essentials oils.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with more than six weeks between chemotherapy treatment cycles are not&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Concurrent radiation therapy or interferon treatment is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with any known allergy to ginger, lavender, orange, citrus of any kind,&#xD;
             jojoba, or essential oils are not eligible.&#xD;
