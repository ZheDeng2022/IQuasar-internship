  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although little is known about compliance with the World Health Organization (WHO) 5 Moments&#xD;
      of hand hygiene, the few existing studies report a high number of opportunities and&#xD;
      compliance ranging from just 22 to 60%. Previous studies have reported an increased density&#xD;
      of opportunities, perceived insufficient time and glove use as factors associated with&#xD;
      non-compliance. A healthcare worker performing multiple tasks in one encounter may spend up&#xD;
      to half the time in the room doing hand hygiene. Strategies to reduce the time required for&#xD;
      hand hygiene may in turn promote increased compliance and may ultimately be most effective in&#xD;
      limiting microbial transmission. In this study, the investigators examine whether cleansing&#xD;
      gloves at each hand hygiene opportunity at the point of care and reusing the same gloves is&#xD;
      as effective as standard practice and the current recommendation (remove gloves, perform hand&#xD;
      hygiene, and don new gloves).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During this multi-center, randomized non-inferiority trial, eligible healthcare personnel&#xD;
      entering rooms of patients on Contact Precautions (or other rooms in which hand hygiene (HH)&#xD;
      is an expectation) and who agree to study participation will be randomized to either ideal&#xD;
      standard (healthcare worker (HCW) will be directed by study personnel to remove gloves,&#xD;
      perform hand hygiene and replace gloves at each HH opportunity), experimental glove-reuse&#xD;
      (HCW will be directed by study personnel to use alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) to cleanse&#xD;
      gloves at each HH opportunity) or usual care (study personnel silently observe and record&#xD;
      what the HCW does at each HH opportunity without direction to the HCW).Care for patients with&#xD;
      C. difficile will be excluded as ABHR is not recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed at the University of Maryland Medical Center, The R.Adams Cowley&#xD;
      Shock Trauma Hospital, University of Iowa Hospitals and The Johns Hopkins Hospital.&#xD;
      Healthcare workers on any patient units will be potentially eligible, but the investigators&#xD;
      will strive for diversity across unit types (e.g. adult med-surg, general pediatrics, adult&#xD;
      ICUs, emergency care areas and inpatient hemodialysis units). The investigators will use a&#xD;
      stratified, block randomization scheme to ensure an equal number of participants from each&#xD;
      participating unit and facility. The HCW, regardless of random assignment, may choose to&#xD;
      remove gloves at any point (e.g. if gloves are heavily soiled or are compromised).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be instructed on how to perform HH using the standardized WHO&#xD;
      methodology and will also receive brief instruction regarding HH opportunities at the point&#xD;
      of care using a WHO 5 Moments pamphlet. Participants will don gloves and enter the room to&#xD;
      perform patient care activities as planned. Research staff will be in the room to monitor the&#xD;
      HCW activity. Research staff trained using the WHO Hand Hygiene Monitoring Method will&#xD;
      identify HH opportunities. At each opportunity, the participant will be instructed to stop&#xD;
      current activity in the intervention and ideal standard group. Participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group will be instructed to cleanse gloves using an ABHR in a standardized way&#xD;
      and in a similar fashion to the WHO recommendations for HH. Participants in the ideal&#xD;
      standard group will be instructed to remove gloves, perform HH using an ABHR, and don new&#xD;
      gloves. The HCW will continue with planned activities and continue to cleanse gloves or&#xD;
      perform HH according to study assignment for each opportunity until either the HCW has&#xD;
      completed patient care or five HH events have occurred. Study staff will record what the HCW&#xD;
      randomized into the usual care arm does at each HH moment. The investigators chose a maximum&#xD;
      of five HH events because since most encounters will have five or fewer HH opportunities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final opportunity and after cleansing gloves and allowing them to dry (Intervention&#xD;
      Group, glove reuse) after donning new gloves (Ideal Standard) or at moment 5 or before room&#xD;
      exit which ever comes first (Usual Care Group) the non-dominant gloved hand will be sampled&#xD;
      by directly imprinting the non-dominant gloved hand onto an agar plate. HCWs who have no HH&#xD;
      opportunities while at the point of care (e.g. a nurse who enters to the room and interacts&#xD;
      only with the intravenous pump and performs HH at exit) will be withdrawn from the study&#xD;
