  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of a specific, multidisciplinary and personalized&#xD;
      rehabilitation program compared to usual care, on motor control and functional disability in&#xD;
      patients with neuralgic amyotrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the participants will start with the 17-week specific rehabilitation program while&#xD;
      the other half will first continue their usual care for 17 weeks, after which they will also&#xD;
      receive the 17-week specific rehabilitation program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuralgic amyotrophy (NA) is a common (incidence 1:1000) peripheral nervous system disorder&#xD;
      caused by acute autoimmune inflammation of the brachial plexus, the nerve bundle going to the&#xD;
      shoulder and arm. Many NA patients develop abnormal motor control of the shoulder region&#xD;
      (i.e. scapular dyskinesia), which persists even after the peripheral nerve damage has&#xD;
      recovered. This suggests that persistent scapular dyskinesia in NA may result from&#xD;
      (mal)adaptive changes in the central motor system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical experience shows that the specific, multidisciplinary and personalized&#xD;
      rehabilitation program, focused on cognitive motor control can restore scapular dyskinesia in&#xD;
      NA patients. This indicates that impairments in the central motor system likely play a role&#xD;
      in persistent scapular dyskinesia and that specific rehabilitation may restore any&#xD;
      alterations in central motor control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the specific rehabilitation program, focused on cognitive motor control&#xD;
      is more effective in improving functional disability than usual care and that it can reverse&#xD;
      maladaptive changes in central motor control.&#xD;

    <description>17-week specific and personalised rehabilitation program. The program starts with a visit to the Plexus out patient clinic in week 1. During this visit, the patient will be examined by a multidisciplinary team, consisting of a rehabilitation physician, neurologist, physical therapist and occupational therapist, which will form a rehabilitation treatment plan. This treatment plan is implemented through 4 weekly sessions in week 2-5, 2 biweekly sessions in week 6-9 and 2 monthly sessions in week 10-17 . Each treatment session involves one hour of physical- and one hour of occupational therapy.</description>
