  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no reliable biomarker for stroke, meaning that treatment is often delayed&#xD;
      and patients are often left with a disability. Stroke is one of the largest causes of&#xD;
      mortality (death) and morbidity (disease) in the UK and affects around 120 and 15 people per&#xD;
      100,000 population. This has huge economic implications, with around £9 billion a year being&#xD;
      spent on stroke in the UK alone, and health and social care costs accounting for half of this&#xD;
      amount. Productivity losses (i.e. income costs) are estimated at £1.33 billion and benefit&#xD;
      payments total £840 million per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies involving heart attack patients have suggested that succinate (a biomarker)&#xD;
      levels rise after reperfusion (reoxygenation) of the heart tissue and in the context of&#xD;
      ischaemia (i.e. when a restriction of blood supply to the heart has caused a heart attack and&#xD;
      the tissue has been reoxygenated to improve blood flow around the body). Malonate is a&#xD;
      therapeutic option to block this rise in succinate and reduce any potential resulting damage.&#xD;
      Animal studies support these findings and have further shown that malonate prevents ischaemic&#xD;
      brain damage and reduces the succinate increase in tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is currently no pre-clinical data for the release of succinate into blood, nor&#xD;
      for stroke. This study aims to explore whether elevated succinate levels are present in&#xD;
      stroke patients having thrombolysis (brain reperfusion). If we can show that elevated&#xD;
      succinate levels are attributed to stroke (and not a result of thrombolysis), it might be&#xD;
      possible to identify a therapeutic intervention at baseline for these patients and this&#xD;
      reduce disability in all stroke patients, and healthcare costs in turn.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are around 150,000 incidents of stroke every year in the UK alone. By the age of 75, 1&#xD;
      in 5 women and 1 in 6 men will have had a stroke; 26% of which will have occurred before the&#xD;
      age of 65. Moreover, over half of all stroke survivors are left with a disability and 41% of&#xD;
      these are discharged from hospital requiring help with daily activities. Without a reliable&#xD;
      biomarker for stroke patients, the development of a therapeutic intervention at baseline&#xD;
      which has the capability to reduce disability in stroke patients is not possible. There is a&#xD;
      dire need for further research into stroke. In 2012, £56 million was spent on stroke-related&#xD;
      care/research, compared to £544 million on cancer research and £166 million on heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies involving heart attack patients suggest that succinate could be used as a biomarker&#xD;
      for stroke patients. Furthermore, the current therapeutic option used to block the rise in&#xD;
      succinate levels, malonate, has been shown to prevent ischaemic brain damage in animal&#xD;
      studies. No work to date has explored this phenomenon in humans with stroke and therefore&#xD;
      this study has huge potential to bridge the gap in helping to treat stroke patients in the&#xD;
      future and thus reduce healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DETECT study is a pilot study and has been specifically designed to be as simple as&#xD;
      possible. For stroke patients undergoing thrombolysis, they will already have a cannula&#xD;
      inserted to aid with the procedure. We propose that research bloods could be taken from this&#xD;
      same cannula to reduce the burden to the patient. Wherever possible we will conduct the&#xD;
      safety follow-up with stroke patients whilst they are still an inpatient at the hospital, to&#xD;
      again reduce the burden to the patient.&#xD;
