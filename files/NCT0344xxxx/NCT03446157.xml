      This research study is designed to provide a better understanding of study drugs cetuximab&#xD;
      (Erbitux®) and palbociclib when used in combination to treat patients with metastatic colon&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab (Erbitux®) is an antibody designed to target a protein called Epidermal Growth&#xD;
      Factor Receptor (EGFR). EGFR plays an important role in the growth and survival of colon&#xD;
      cancer. Antibodies are proteins that are naturally produced by the immune system and&#xD;
      circulate throughout your body to help protect you from disease caused by bacteria, viruses,&#xD;
      cancer cells or any foreign or toxic substance. Antibodies work by sticking to and flagging&#xD;
      or marking foreign cells or substances so that your body's immune defense system will&#xD;
      recognize, attack and remove them. Antibodies help the body rid itself of disease. Antibodies&#xD;
      can also be designed in the laboratory to stick to specific parts of cancer cells (or normal&#xD;
      cells) to change or block the ways those cells function in your body and to produce a&#xD;
      therapeutic anti-cancer effect. Cetuximab (Erbitux®) is an antibody drug approved by the FDA&#xD;
      and is commonly used to treat your type of colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palbociclib is an FDA-approved drug for patients with breast cancer. Palbociclib is not&#xD;
      FDA-approved for the treatment of colon cancer, and is considered an investigational drug in&#xD;
      this research study. Palbociclib targets a protein called CDK4/6 that is a critical part of&#xD;
      the cell division and cell growth processes known as &quot;the cell cycle&quot;. Laboratory studies&#xD;
      have shown that palbociclib inhibits the cell cycle, slows or stops cell growth, and can&#xD;
      cause cell death in cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of Cetuximab (Erbitux®) with palbociclib is not approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      treating colon cancer and is considered investigational in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are being asked to be in the study because your colon cancer has been found to contain&#xD;
      the proteins KRAS, NRAS and BRAF that are normal (wild-type). These proteins play an&#xD;
      important role in the growth and survival of colon cancer. This requirement is important&#xD;
      because colon cancer with these characteristics has been shown to be more responsive to EGFR&#xD;
      inhibitors such as cetuximab (Erbitux®), one of the drugs used in this study that is also a&#xD;
      standard treatment option for your type of cancer. Also, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor&#xD;
      (EGFR) has been shown to stimulate cancer cell division, growth and survival by working&#xD;
      together with KRAS, NRAS and BRAF to activate CDK4/6 and to support an accelerated cell&#xD;
      cycle. This accelerated cell cycle allows the cancer cells to divide and grow faster than&#xD;
      your normal cells but also can make them sensitive to the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitor&#xD;
      palbociclib, a cell-cycle inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To participate in this study you also must meet one of the following requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. You have not been treated with EGFR inhibitors such as cetuximab (Erbitux®) or panitumumab&#xD;
      (Vectibix®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. You were treated with anti-EGFR drugs such as cetuximab (Erbitux®) or panitumumab&#xD;
      (Vectibix®) and experienced at least 4 months of response to treatment, and it has been at&#xD;
      least 8-weeks since you were last treated with an anti-EGFR drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will allow investigators to compare the anti-cancer effects of cetuximab (Erbitux®)&#xD;
      combined with palbociclib in 2 different groups of cancer patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients that have never received EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab (Erbitux®) or&#xD;
           panitumumab (Vectibix®). This group will test whether resistance to the combination of&#xD;
           cetuximab (Erbitux®) plus palbociclib develops in this type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients that have previously shown an anti-cancer response to EGFR inhibitors, such as&#xD;
           cetuximab (Erbitux®) or panitumumab (Vectibix®), of four or more months, but then&#xD;
           developed resistance. This group will test whether the combination of cetuximab&#xD;
           (Erbitux®) plus palbociclib is more effective against this resistant type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, laboratory studies have shown that the combination of EGFR and CDK inhibitors&#xD;
      provide a stronger anti-cancer effect when used in combination than seen when each inhibitor&#xD;
      is used alone. Thus, the reason researchers are using cetuximab (Erbitux®) and palbociclib in&#xD;
      combination is to simultaneously target and inhibit multiple processes inside of the cancer&#xD;
      cell that are critical to growth and survival of the tumor. With this combination strategy,&#xD;
      researchers hope to improve upon existing anti-cancer therapies.&#xD;
