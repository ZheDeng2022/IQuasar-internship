      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intra-articular&#xD;
      administration of ART-I02 (AAV5.NF-kB.IFN-β), a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) type&#xD;
      5 vector in subjects with RA and active arthritis of a wrist.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DMARDs such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine and leflunomide used alone or in combination, are&#xD;
      considered to be standard treatment for RA and may be combined with other conventional DMARDs&#xD;
      and/or corticosteroids and/or anti-inflammatory or centrally working analgetics (NSAIDS).&#xD;
      During the last decade, treatment with biological (e.g. TNF-inhibitors), together with&#xD;
      improved timing and dosing of conventional therapy, has significantly improved the outcome in&#xD;
      a significant proportion of RA patients. The advent of biologicals and implementation of more&#xD;
      intensive treatment protocols has significantly improved the outcome in a significant&#xD;
      proportion of RA patients and prevented disabilities. However, drug-free remissions are still&#xD;
      rare and hence most RA patients require continued immunosuppressive treatment which&#xD;
      predisposes them to potentially serious infections. Also up to 50% of RA patients continue to&#xD;
      suffer from symptomatic disease. Intra-articular glucocorticoids are often used in these&#xD;
      patients, e.g. when single joints are inflamed. The duration of their effect is however&#xD;
      variable. It regularly occurs in clinical practice that reasonable clinical remission in&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis patients is achieved with current treatment options, but that one or&#xD;
      more joints still display persistent signs of inflammation while the inflammation of other&#xD;
      joints has been greatly reduced. This means that for the joint(s) still affected by active&#xD;
      inflammation other therapies are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for additional RA therapies with good tolerability and efficacy profiles that&#xD;
      can be used in patients who suffer from a few inflamed joints despite previous treatment.&#xD;
      Intra-articular gene therapy could provide a solution by providing local treatment for&#xD;
      arthritis, with prolonged expression of a therapeutic protein at the site of inflammation&#xD;
      after a single injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ART-I02 is an investigational new drug, expressing human IFN-β from a recombinant (r)&#xD;
      adeno-associated virus type 5 (rAAV5) β under the influence of a promoter, which is induced&#xD;
      by an inflammatory stimulus. Due to the relapsing nature of RA, therapeutic expression should&#xD;
      be maximal during flare-ups of the disease. This is achieved by employing the NF-kB&#xD;
      responsive promotor to regulate expression of IFN-β. Under inflammatory conditions, the NF-kB&#xD;
      responsive promoter will be activated in the synovium and will upregulate the expression of&#xD;
      hIFN-β and turned down during remission. In this way, transgene expression can be controlled,&#xD;
      following the intermittent course of disease. The selection of IFN-Beta as the therapeutic&#xD;
      protein is based on the notion that IFN-β has anti-inflammatory, and bone and cartilage&#xD;
      protective effects, which have been extensively demonstrated in non-clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I open label, dose escalating study to investigate the safety of a single&#xD;
      intra-articular ART-I02 injection in patients with RA and active arthritis of a wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a two-phase staggered dose escalation design, dosing will start with a low dose (2.4x1012&#xD;
      vg/ wrist) and progress to the highest dose of 2.4x1013 vg/wrist. Three patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at each of the two dose levels. The interval between dosing of patients within dose&#xD;
      escalation cohorts I and II is at least two weeks to allow for safety evaluation by the&#xD;
      investigator. Following dosing of the last patient in cohort I and II, a dosing pause of two&#xD;
      weeks is included to allow an assessment of the safety data by the Data Review Committee&#xD;
      (DRC). Enrollment in the subsequent cohort will continue only after a thorough assessment of&#xD;
      safety and tolerability data (medical history, vital signs, physical examination, laboratory&#xD;
      parameters and adverse events) through day 14 post dose; for the first treated patient in&#xD;
      each cohort safety data up to a minimum of six weeks, for the second patient up to a minimum&#xD;
      of four weeks and for the third patient up to a minimum of two weeks are available at the&#xD;
      time of the assessment of the safety data by the DRC. In cohort III nine patients will be&#xD;
      administered the highest safety dose of ARTI02 as determined in the previous dose escalating&#xD;
      cohorts (cohorts I and II) and following a thorough assessment of all available safety data&#xD;
      including a minimum of 2 weeks data post ART-I02 administration from the 3rd patient of&#xD;
      cohort II. The interval between dosing of patients within cohort III is at least one week.&#xD;
      Cohort III is added to the study to substantiate the safety profile of the highest tolerated&#xD;
      dose of ART-I02. The consideration to treat one joint in this clinical study is that it&#xD;
      provides the opportunity to examine the administration of a single dose at the site where the&#xD;
      promoter is activated and where the therapeutic protein IFN-β is required.&#xD;
