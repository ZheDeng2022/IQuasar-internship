    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the MTD of PTS following local and&#xD;
      intratumoral injections over a treatment course of two 5-day cycles to patients with palpable&#xD;
      advanced solid malignancies who have failed standard treatment.&#xD;

      The study will be an open, uncontrolled, single-center, phase I study to assess the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of local intra-tumoral injection 2.0ml (660mg), 4.0ml (1220mg), 6.0ml&#xD;
      (1880mg) and 8.0ml (2440mg) PTS in female breast cancer patients.&#xD;
