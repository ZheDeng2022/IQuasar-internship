  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cirrhosis is a chronic disease characterized by a progressive accumulation of fibrosis,&#xD;
      loss of liver function and portal hypertension leading to several hemodynamic changes.The&#xD;
      exact pathophysiological mechanisms causing the hyperdynamic alterations in cirrhosis are not&#xD;
      fully elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess hemodynamic alterations in liver cirrhosis by non-invasive&#xD;
      MRI and echocardiography compared to portal hypertension measured with liver vein&#xD;
      catheterization (HVPG, hepatic vein pressure gradient). Furthermore, the aim is to explore&#xD;
      hemodynamic differences between cirrhotic patients and healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a cross-sectional design and a cohort with 99 patients with liver cirrhosis -&#xD;
      with and without complications and 27 healthy volunteers. The patients are recruited at the&#xD;
      Gastrounit Hvidovre University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day before the first visit patients are hospitalized and fasting overnight. At first&#xD;
      visit liver vein catheterization (LVC) and echocardiography are performed. Second visit must&#xD;
      be performed within 4 weeks after first visit. At the second visit patients are fasting&#xD;
      minimum 6 hours before having MR-flow scanning, cardiac-MR and MR-Elastography (MR-E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healthy volunteers are only offered MR-flow scanning, cardiac MR and MR-E as well as&#xD;
      urine- and blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up for liver-related clinical outcome and mortality in medical records&#xD;
