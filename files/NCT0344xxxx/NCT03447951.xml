    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 20% and 30% PTS100 of&#xD;
      total tumor volume as intra-tumoral injection therapy in primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma&#xD;
      patients who are ineligible for operation or local regional therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BCLC stage B patients who are ineligible for operational or current locoregional therapy.&#xD;
      Enrolled patients are randomly assigned to either of the two total doses, 20% or 30% of total&#xD;
      tumor volume. PTS100 is administrated via intratumoral injection. The required total dose is&#xD;
      given in separate injection days, with maximal daily dose up to 10 mL at first IP&#xD;
      administration, and is adjusted based on each patient's tolerability along the treatment. The&#xD;
      treatment course lasts up to completion of the total dose, and the efficacy is evaluated 28&#xD;
      days afterwards.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the health-related Quality of life, assessed by change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep, version 4, Traditional Chinese). The FACT-Hep, version 4, Traditional Chinese Scale is a patient completed questionnaire consisting 45 items that assesses health related quality of life (HRQL) in HCC patients. The FACT-Hep, version 4, Traditional Chinese consists of the 27-item FACT-G assessing generic HRQL concerns and 18-item Hepatobiliary Subscale assessing disease-specific issues. Instrument scoring yields a range from 0 to 180 with higher scores representing better patient status. This questionnaire should be completed by patient prior to any procedures being performed at the visit, if possible. The form should then be checked by site staff for completeness.</description>

It comprises the same 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels. However, this results have no arithmetic properties and should not be used as a cardinal score. This questionnaire should be completed by the patient prior to any procedure being performed at the visit, if possible. The form should then be checked by site staff for completeness.</description>

    <description>A total dose of PTS100 in this study, the expected accumulated dose in the treatment duration, depends on the patient's tumour size. For each patient, up to 4 tumors, each not exceeding 8.8 cm in diameter, are selected for treatment by the joint decision of the investigator and the radiologist. The total dose is defined as the accumulated dose in treatment duration. The total dose is randomly assigned as either 20% or 30% of TTV for each patient and maximum TTV should be less than 366 cm3.</description>
