  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The feeling of pain is not just a sensory experience, but is also influenced by emotions,&#xD;
      beliefs and expectations, making pain a highly subjective experience. This is evident in&#xD;
      clinical practice, where the behavior of the physician and the treatment context can strongly&#xD;
      influence the pain experience of patients. Research has shown that patients' expectation that&#xD;
      a treatment will reduce pain influences individual perception of pain, even if the treatment&#xD;
      has no active ingredient. The expectancy-induced analgesia emerges due to a modulation of the&#xD;
      individual pain experience of patients by an engagement of endogenous inhibitory systems in&#xD;
      the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of expectancy-induced analgesia can be generated in several ways. The&#xD;
      investigators have previously demonstrated that social information and observational learning&#xD;
      (e.g. the patient observes analgesia in another person receiving a treatment) can lead to&#xD;
      expectancy-induced analgesia and pain reduction. However, the neural mechanisms (mechanisms&#xD;
      in the brain) of how these expectancies are acquired and the neural mechanisms of analgesia&#xD;
      induced by observational learning are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently established a procedure to investigate neural mechanisms of&#xD;
      observational learning in placebo analgesia. Here the investigators propose to investigate&#xD;
      the influence of vasopressin, a neurotransmitter that is important for social interaction, on&#xD;
      observational learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a non-invasive&#xD;
      method, to investigate neural activity in humans. Participants will either receive&#xD;
      vasopressin or saline with a nasal spray. During fMRI scanning, participants will then&#xD;
      undergo an observational learning phase, where the study participants will learn the&#xD;
      experience of analgesia in another person through a video, and a testing phase, where&#xD;
      participants will perceive painful stimulations with the same cues as the observational&#xD;
      phase. The comparison of the vasopressin group and the saline group will allow us to&#xD;
      investigate how vasopressin influences behavioral effects of observational learning on pain&#xD;
      perception as well as its effect on the neural processing of observational learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of how the human brain processes observationally-induced analgesia&#xD;
      would allow us to improve the therapeutic context of pain treatments by increasing the&#xD;
      contextual factors which help patients cope with pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to investigate how vasopressin (AVP) influences the neural&#xD;
      mechanisms associated with observationally-induced analgesia. More specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators will determine how observing another person experiencing analgesia shapes&#xD;
      subsequent behavioral and neural responses to painful stimulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To investigate how AVP influences the neural mechanisms associated with&#xD;
      observationally-induced analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: The investigators expect that AVP will boost activation in brain regions&#xD;
      involved in social cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective is to determine the effect of AVP on brain mechanisms associated with&#xD;
      observationally-induced analgesia. This experiment has a between-subject study design.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into an AVP group and a control group. The experimenter as&#xD;
      well as the participant will be blinded regarding the allocation of the participant.&#xD;
      Participants in the AVP group will receive intranasal AVP and the participants in the control&#xD;
      group will receive intranasal saline before the fMRI experiment. Participants have 50% chance&#xD;
      of being placed in either group. The experiment in the fMRI scanner is divided into two&#xD;
      phases: an observational phase, in which participants will observe a video of a demonstrator&#xD;
      experiencing analgesia, and a testing phase, in which study participants will receive heat&#xD;
      pain to investigate how pain perception was influenced. During both phases there will be a&#xD;
      placebo condition (pain with the expectation of having received a treatment) and a control&#xD;
      condition (pain without the expectation of having received a treatment). All participants&#xD;
      will complete both phases, including the observational and testing phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expectancy of analgesia related to the act of receiving a treatment (e.g. a painkiller) can&#xD;
      reduce pain perception, even if this treatment is in fact an inert substance (e.g. placebo).&#xD;
      Expectancies about analgesic treatments can be acquired in several different ways, including&#xD;
      direct experience of analgesia (i.e. the patient learns that after taking a specific drug,&#xD;
      pain will decrease), verbal instructions (i.e. the doctor tells the patient that a specific&#xD;
      drug will reduce pain) or social observation (i.e. the patient observes pain relief in&#xD;
      another patient after this patient took a specific drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The direct experience of pain relief in the context of treatment cues (i.e. conditioning)&#xD;
      reduces subsequent pain perception when the same treatment cues are present. The neural&#xD;
      underpinnings of how treatment expectancies are acquired during conditioning have been&#xD;
      investigated previously. These studies indicate that the prefrontal cortex is involved in&#xD;
      learning treatment expectations in the context of conditioned analgesic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these expectancies can also be acquired by observing others. Our group was the first&#xD;
      to demonstrate that analgesia can be triggered by observing another person that experiences&#xD;
      analgesia. This finding has been corroborated with additional studies by our group and other&#xD;
      groups. In these experiments, participants acquire expectancies of analgesia not by&#xD;
      experiencing pain relief themselves, but rather by observing another person (the&#xD;
      demonstrator) experiencing analgesia after receiving a certain analgesic treatment (actually&#xD;
      a sham treatment). These placebo manipulations generate expectancies which lead to placebo&#xD;
      effects of similar sizes that those shown through direct experience via conditioning&#xD;
      paradigms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though previous research has focused on the direct experience of pain relief within a&#xD;
      treatment context, social psychology suggests that most human behaviors are in fact modulated&#xD;
      by sociality and learned by observing others. The investigators recently established a&#xD;
      paradigm to investigate neural mechanisms of observational learning in placebo analgesia. The&#xD;
      preliminary data analysis (unpublished data) suggests that while participants are observing&#xD;
      someone else experiencing less pain due to an analgesic treatment, brain regions associated&#xD;
      with mentalizing processes such as left and right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and medial&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC) show increased activation. However, the underlying neurotransmitter&#xD;
      systems are unknown. Here, the investigators aim to investigate how AVP modulates this&#xD;
      network of brain regions. AVP is a likely candidate system, because recently it has been&#xD;
      associated with placebo analgesia by my current mentor's lab, is involved in controlling a&#xD;
      wide variety of social behaviors, and has been shown to critically modulate TPJ activity. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that AVP will lead to increased activation of the mentalizing network&#xD;
      during observational learning, and therefore, to increased placebo analgesia as a result of&#xD;
      the observational learning. In order to investigate this, the investigators will perform a&#xD;
      similar observational learning study in a group receiving intranasal AVP and a control group&#xD;
      receiving intranasal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Clinical outcomes are not just related to pharmacological substances, but also to&#xD;
      the context in which a treatment is given as well as expectancies, fears, desires and beliefs&#xD;
      of the patient. The beneficial effects on health related outcome changes due to the treatment&#xD;
      context and not due to specific actions of a drug are known as placebo effects. In the field&#xD;
      of pain, the reduction of pain perception due to placebo effects is called placebo analgesia&#xD;
      or expectancy-induced analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research shows that in placebo analgesia, informational cues of the treatment&#xD;
      context generate the expectancy of pain relief due to a treatment. These expectations can be&#xD;
      acquired through several ways, including learning through direct experience (i.e.&#xD;
      conditioning), verbal instruction or observation of others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies investigated the influence of direct experience of analgesia using&#xD;
      conditioning paradigms on placebo effects. These studies show that conditioning creates more&#xD;
      robust placebo effects than verbal suggestions alone and that the magnitude of experienced&#xD;
      pain relief and the duration influence subsequent placebo effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the neural level, placebo effects on pain perception are mediated by the descending pain&#xD;
      modulatory system. Endogenous opioids are involved in the pain descending modulation systems,&#xD;
      and placebo analgesia can be substantially reduced by opioid antagonists. Several studies&#xD;
      implicate functional connectivity between the rostral anterior cingulate and the&#xD;
      periaqueductal gray, a region critical for descending pain modulation, and placebo analgesia.&#xD;
      Additionally, there is considerable evidence that prefrontal regions, especially the&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), are critically involved in placebo analgesia. The&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex consistently shows higher activations related to the anticipation of&#xD;
      analgesia and experience of pain relief induced by a placebo manipulation, and is involved in&#xD;
      the acquisition of expectancies during conditioning of placebo analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the current understanding is that the prefrontal cortex maintains and updates&#xD;
      expectancies regarding pain, and that these prefrontal regions influence the experience of&#xD;
      pain by activating the descending pain modulatory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of social learning on placebo analgesia has been investigated to a lesser&#xD;
      degree. Recent research suggests that placebo analgesia can also be induced by observational&#xD;
      learning, however, the neural neurotransmitter systems underpinning observationally-induced&#xD;
      placebo analgesia have not yet been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: To harness the placebo effects in clinical contexts, it is important to understand&#xD;
      how placebo effects arise and are maintained. Previous neuroscience research has primarily&#xD;
      focused on conditioning paradigms, however human behaviors are affected by social learning.&#xD;
      Social learning refers to learning about the environment due to information gained by&#xD;
      observing others. Our overall hypothesis is that AVP will increase neural activation in&#xD;
      regions related to social cognition during observational learning. Our objective is to&#xD;
      determine the interplay of AVP and observationally-induced analgesia using an fMRI approach.&#xD;
      fMRI is a noninvasive technique to measure changes in blood oxygenation in the brain enabling&#xD;
      us to draw inferences about the localization and extend of neural activation associated with&#xD;
      specific events and cues including the perception of experimental painful stimulations and&#xD;
      modulation. The investigators designed an experiment to be performed behaviorally and with&#xD;
      fMRI measurements in order to determine the interplay of AVP and observationally-induced&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This experiment will advance our understanding of endogenous processes&#xD;
      associated with observationally-induced analgesia and the factors that influences pain&#xD;
      processing. A better understanding of how treatment expectancies, formed through social&#xD;
      observation, influence the individual experience of pain is significant in several ways.&#xD;
      First, it will allow a better understanding of the contextual factors shaping pain and&#xD;
      responses to treatments in clinical settings. Second, knowledge about the neural processes&#xD;
      associated with endogenous pain relief might lead to novel developments in pain therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies. Third, the investigators anticipate generating findings that will advance our&#xD;
      knowledge of how cognitive processes (i.e. expectancy) are represented in the brain and how&#xD;
      these factors influence human social behaviors.&#xD;
