  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an experimental observational study in ten healthy volunteers. Based on an in&#xD;
      vitro study, it is hypothesize that a low dose epinephrine infusion will improve platelet&#xD;
      function in healthy volunteers who have received ticagrelor. Volunteers fulfilling all of the&#xD;
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be included. Enrollment will be continued&#xD;
      until the required sample size is achieved (10 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed consent is obtained, screening data will be collected to determine each&#xD;
      subject's eligibility for study participation. The total expected duration of subject&#xD;
      participation is 18 days, from screening visit to end of follow-up. The active participation&#xD;
      is 8h (study procedure 4 hours, observation period 4 hours).&#xD;

      The study is an experimental observational study in ten healthy volunteers. Volunteers&#xD;
      fulfilling all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be included.&#xD;
      Enrollment will be continued until the required sample size is achieved (10 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total expected duration of subject participation is 18 days, from screening visit to end&#xD;
      of follow-up. The active participation is 8h (study procedure 4 hours, observation period 4&#xD;
      hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include four visits in total, beginning with the written informed consent at&#xD;
      the screening visit, followed by the study visit. A phone follow-up visit is conducted the&#xD;
      day after the treatment and after 72h to ensure subject's well-being/ inquire if the subject&#xD;
      have had any Adverse Event (AE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the treatment day, an arterial catheter for continuous invasive blood pressure&#xD;
      registration and blood sample collection will be inserted in the radial artery. In addition,&#xD;
      a catheter for drug administration will be inserted in the brachial vein. After baseline&#xD;
      registration (blood pressure and pulse), blood sampling and assessment of dyspnea&#xD;
      (Borg-scale), ticagrelor is administered orally to the subjects. Two hours after&#xD;
      administration, the registrations and blood sampling (outcome samples) are repeated after&#xD;
      which an infusion of epinephrine is started at a weight-adjusted rate of 0.01, 0.05, 0.10 and&#xD;
      0.15 Î¼g kg-1 min-1. Each infusion will be maintained for 15 minutes. At the end of each&#xD;
      infusion period, registrations and blood sampling are repeated. The blood pressure may&#xD;
      increase as a result of epinephrine infusion and metoprolol will therefore be administered to&#xD;
      investigate if it affects platelet function. Hence, after the last measurement with the&#xD;
      highest dose of epinephrine, 5 mg metoprolol (Abcur, Haelsingborg , Sweden) will be given&#xD;
      intravenously and thereafter registrations and blood sampling will be repeated. The infusion&#xD;
      is then stopped and the healthy volunteers are observed for 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects will be contacted the day after treatment and three days after treatment&#xD;
      and asked about their wellbeing/ if they have had any AEs.&#xD;
