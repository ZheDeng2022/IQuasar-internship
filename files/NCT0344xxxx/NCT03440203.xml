  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trend of diabetes prevalence was increased by comparing these two national surveys in&#xD;
      2009 and 2014. However, the studies only focused on the prevalence and risk of diabetes and&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases in Myanmar. The study focused on the common complications of&#xD;
      Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is rare. The studies in other countries showed high&#xD;
      prevalence rate and under-diagnosis of DPN. Most of the patients with DPN did not complain&#xD;
      about their symptoms because of without prominent symptoms. DPN is the major complication of&#xD;
      diabetes. According to the international studies, DPN has the hidden epidemic and is the&#xD;
      common causes which can lead to disability and decreased the quality of life in diabetes.&#xD;
      Therefore, the study focused on the prevalence of DPN and its impact on the ADLs is&#xD;
      obligatory as the descriptive study to explore the actual situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nursing care is not only for the patients in the hospital but also for the people in the&#xD;
      community. Moreover, the nurses have to focus on all levels of prevention. Diabetes is the&#xD;
      lifelong diseases and accessibility of health care for everyone with diabetes is a very&#xD;
      important issue in the era with increased prevalence of diabetes. Therefore, we all have to&#xD;
      focus not only on the primary prevention but also on the secondary and tertiary prevention of&#xD;
      diabetes. The secondary and tertiary prevention in the diabetic patients also means the&#xD;
      primary prevention of other diseases and disabilities (the complications of diabetes). For&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathic patients, maintaining normal daily living is very important liked&#xD;
      everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of DPN and DPNP in type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients and impact on the activities of daily living. The descriptive, cross-sectional study&#xD;
      design will be used in this study. The inclusion criteria are the person aged over 25 years&#xD;
      of age who had already diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus, taking any anti-glycemic&#xD;
      treatment. The persons who are suffering from neuropathy and neuropathic pain other than&#xD;
      diabetes, severe illness of diabetic patients, mental illness and alcoholism will be excluded&#xD;
      from this study. The patients who meet the inclusion criteria and come to outpatient diabetic&#xD;
      clinics at YGH, NOGH, EYGH, and WYGH will be chosen as a sample after obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be done at this outpatients diabetic clinic of these four hospitals.&#xD;
      This study has already obtained ethical clearance from Nursing Science Ethical Review&#xD;
      Committee, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Okayama University, Japan with the review&#xD;
      number D1605. It will be carrying out after obtaining approval from Department of Medical&#xD;
      Research, Myanmar. At the outset, informed consent will be obtained with detailed information&#xD;
      about the purpose of research, the part they need to participate, possible benefits and their&#xD;
      rights to withdraw.&#xD;

        The patients went to the diabetic clinic at the outpatient department of Yangon General&#xD;
        Hospital (YGH), North-Okkalapa General Hospital (NOGH), East Yangon General Hospital&#xD;
        (EYGH), and West Yangon General Hospital (WYGH) in Myanmar used as the sample. These four&#xD;
        hospitals are providing outpatient services for diabetics on selected weekdays. Most of the&#xD;
        patients who are receiving the care are from Yangon Region.&#xD;
