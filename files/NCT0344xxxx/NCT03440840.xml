      This study investigates the effectiveness of computer-based cognitive training with or&#xD;
      without transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in improving the functioning of older&#xD;
      individuals with HIV-related cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of advances in its treatment, persons with HIV continue to develop HIV-associated&#xD;
      neurocognitive disorders (HAND) over time. HAND may be an even more significant problem in&#xD;
      older persons (age 50+) with HIV who may experience age-related changes in cognition in&#xD;
      addition to HAND. Because of HAND's impact on patients' functioning and quality of life,&#xD;
      treatments are needed. Pharmacologic treatments have, in general, been ineffective and&#xD;
      investigators have argued that computer delivered cognitive training may be an effective&#xD;
      alternative. While results of small studies have been encouraging, the effect size of&#xD;
      cognitive training may be small and of unclear practical importance. The nature of cognitive&#xD;
      training programs, often building on laboratory measures of cognition, may reduce how&#xD;
      inherently interesting (i.e., fun) they are, limiting their uptake outside of paid research&#xD;
      studies. Others have argued for the use of computer games targeting psychomotor speed,&#xD;
      problem solving, and visuospatial skills to improve cognitive function in older adults. Data&#xD;
      support the utility of this approach, but again effect sizes may be small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be an effective way to enhance the effects&#xD;
      of cognitive training. It involves the application of a small electric current (1-2 mA) to&#xD;
      the head, inducing small currents within the brain that enhance cognitive training. Multiple&#xD;
      studies have shown that tDCS enhances cognition, including attention and psychomotor speed.&#xD;
      The investigators previously completed a single-blind pilot study of individuals with&#xD;
      HIV-related mild neurocognitive disorder using a high-interest car racing game with or&#xD;
      without tDCS. Results were encouraging in showing moderate to large effect sizes consistent&#xD;
      with tDCS enhancement of cognitive function after six 20-minute training sessions over two&#xD;
      weeks. Participants' subjective reports of cognitive difficulties supported observed effects&#xD;
      on objective measures, and their mood improved. The intervention was acceptable to&#xD;
      participants, many of whom stated they enjoyed it. Everyone indicated a willingness to&#xD;
      participate in a similar study in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will expand on a pilot-tested training intervention with 120&#xD;
      individuals randomly assigned to an attention control condition or game-based cognitive&#xD;
      training with either sham or active tDCS. The investigators will employ a battery of&#xD;
      cognitive measures as well as self-report measures of mood, cognitive difficulties, and&#xD;
      everyday functioning in order to evaluate the effects of study interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will first be screened for eligibility by telephone, and then scheduled for a&#xD;
      visit during which their eligibility will be further assessed. Those who are eligible based&#xD;
      on inclusion and exclusion criteria will complete a battery of measures of their cognitive&#xD;
      and functional status. They will then complete six training sessions over a period of three&#xD;
      weeks, and then once again complete the battery of assessments. Participants will then be&#xD;
      asked to return one month after the post-training assessment to evaluate the persistence of&#xD;
      training effects.&#xD;
