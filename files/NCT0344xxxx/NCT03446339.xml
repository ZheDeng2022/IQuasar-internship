  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious and often fatal complication of connective&#xD;
      tissue diseases including systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It has been&#xD;
      reported primarily from European series that the prevalence of PAH in patients with&#xD;
      connective tissue diseases particularly systemic sclerosis is as high as 15-20%. However,&#xD;
      given the paucity of medical literature in the area from Chinese population, the prevalence&#xD;
      of PAH amongst Chinese patients with these conditions is largely unknown. Even worse, PAH is&#xD;
      often undiagnosed amongst patients with connective tissue diseases due to the lack of&#xD;
      awareness and/or access to echocardiography, which is a non-invasive first-line screening&#xD;
      tool for PAH. As a result, most patients at diagnosis of PAH are at a relatively late stage,&#xD;
      rendering pharmacological treatment less effective. Here, the investigators propose a&#xD;
      territory-wide pulmonary hypertension screening for patients with connective tissue disease&#xD;
      in order to (1) detect pulmonary hypertension amongst patients with connective tissue disease&#xD;
      through systematic screening, and (2) understand the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in&#xD;
      Chinese patients with connective tissue diseases.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To detect pulmonary hypertension amongst patients with connective tissue diseases&#xD;
           through systematic screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To understand the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in Chinese patients with&#xD;
           connective tissue diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a territory-wide pulmonary hypertension screening project. Patients fulfilling&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo screen echocardiography as baseline to&#xD;
      detect subclinical pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo usual clinical assessment by the rheumatology teams of the parent&#xD;
      hospitals including standard 12-lead ECG and 6-minute hall walk distance. then they will be&#xD;
      referred to the Division of Cardiology, the Department of Medicine, the University of Hong&#xD;
      Kong for (1) Echocardiography and (2) BNP (or pro-NT BNP) assay. The echocardiography will be&#xD;
      performed based on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Respiratory Society&#xD;
      (ERS) Guidelines. The echocardiographic probability of pulmonary hypertension will be&#xD;
      determined (low, intermediate, and high).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no studies on which to calculate a power equation, because there are no previous&#xD;
      reports on the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in Chinese rheumatological patients. The&#xD;
      sample size is based on our local prevalence of the rheumatological diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be expressed in mean ± SD. Statistical comparisons were performed&#xD;
      using Student's t test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. The outcomes would be&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
