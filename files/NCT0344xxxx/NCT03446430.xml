      The aim is to compare a new technique for assessing local and regional arterial stiffness:&#xD;
      the Laser Doppler Vibrometry with the reference techniques, the applanation tonometry and&#xD;
      echotracking.&#xD;

      Cardiovascular (CV) diseases and their risk factors are the major contributors to global&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. CV diseases are responsible for over 17.3 million deaths per year&#xD;
      worldwide, representing 30% of all global deaths. The measurement of arterial stiffness&#xD;
      during the medical investigation of a hypertensive subject is essential to estimate the&#xD;
      overall CV risk. The European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and the European Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology (ESC) working group recommend its use for CV risk assessment. Indeed, arterial&#xD;
      stiffness is currently the subject of a scientific consensus due to the large number of&#xD;
      pathophysiological, epidemiological and pharmacological studies demonstrating that it&#xD;
      integrates the duration and the level of exposure of the patient to known and identified CV&#xD;
      risk factors (hypertension, tobacco, diabetes...) as well as those still discussed or more&#xD;
      difficult to quantify (low birth weight, inflammation, infection, genetics...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness can be assessed in a number of ways, but the non-invasive measurement of&#xD;
      the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) by applanation tonometry is regarded as the&#xD;
      current gold standard because it corresponds to the aortic stiffness and it has been widely&#xD;
      validated in epidemiological studies. However, the routine measurement of PWV by applanation&#xD;
      tonometry is technically demanding and uncomfortable for the patient because the sensors can&#xD;
      be attached around the neck or involve a palpation of the groin. The more advanced devices&#xD;
      for PWV assessment are bulky, require trained operators due to the complexity of the&#xD;
      procedure, and are relatively expensive. Therefore, none of the devices available for&#xD;
      measurement of PWV are suitable for use in primary care. Measurement of arterial stiffness at&#xD;
      primary care would allow large population screening for CV risks and thus enable more&#xD;
      accurate CV risk prediction to better target preventive therapy among those individuals&#xD;
      considered to be at low or moderate risk according to current guidelines. However, the tools&#xD;
      and devices available today do not allow for mobile, low-cost, reliable, fast and non- or&#xD;
      minimally-invasive point-of-care screening for measurement of arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PWV measurement by laser Doppler vibrometry, contactless, is more comfortable, acceptable and&#xD;
      could thus be a substitute for applanation tonometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) is an instrument that is used to make non-contact vibration&#xD;
      measurements of a surface. The laser beam from the LDV is directed at the surface of interest&#xD;
      (in our case the skin covering the artery or the heart), and the vibration amplitude and&#xD;
      frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the reflected laser beam frequency due to&#xD;
      the motion of the surface. Preliminary data suggest that LDV can lead to an improved&#xD;
      screening and assessment of CV risk as a technique that makes it possible to measure aortic&#xD;
      and local PWV. Indeed, Ghent University has successfully demonstrated that aortic PWV can be&#xD;
      correctly measured with LDV. This method will greatly simplify procedures for measuring&#xD;
      aortic stiffness if it is available in a compact form and adapted to clinical practice. This&#xD;
      is the purpose of the CARDIS project, H2020 (http://www.cardis-h2020.eu/), which aims to&#xD;
      develop a compact device for measuring local and segmental arterial stiffness without contact&#xD;
      to the skin thanks to the LDV technique. The objective of this study is to compare the CARDIS&#xD;
      LDV prototype with the reference techniques, carotid-femoral and local carotid PWV.&#xD;
