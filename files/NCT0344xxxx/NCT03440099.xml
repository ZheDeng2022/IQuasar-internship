  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In general, men and women experience differing degrees of age-related decreases in physical&#xD;
      function, with women having a greater prevalence of functional limitations and disability. A&#xD;
      key predictor of this decrease in functional capacity is the reduction in leg muscle maximal&#xD;
      power (product of force and velocity), which can be improved with exercise training. However,&#xD;
      the development of exercise interventions to optimally improve skeletal muscle function in&#xD;
      older adults has been difficult, in part because we now know that men and women respond&#xD;
      differently to the same exercise training stimulus. In fact, the fundamental mechanisms by&#xD;
      which habitual exercise improves physical function in older adults are still not well&#xD;
      understood. The proposed studies are designed to address these knowledge gaps by examining&#xD;
      the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the response to two distinct exercise&#xD;
      training paradigms, and determining how these responses differ between older men and women.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that molecular, cellular and whole muscle contractile&#xD;
      performance will be most improved in men by traditional low-velocity, high-load resistance&#xD;
      training, and in women by high-velocity, low-load power training. Moreover, sex-specific&#xD;
      structural responses in myofilament remodeling, protein expression and post-translational&#xD;
      modifications will explain these sex-specific performance adaptations to each modality. To&#xD;
      test these hypotheses, data will be gathered from 50 healthy, sedentary older men and women&#xD;
      (65-75 years) prior to and following a 16-week unilateral exercise training program in which&#xD;
      one leg undergoes resistance training and the other power training. The Specific Aims of this&#xD;
      project are to identify the sex-specific effects of low-velocity resistance training versus&#xD;
      high-velocity power training on: Aim 1) skeletal muscle function at the molecular, cellular&#xD;
      and whole muscle levels, and Aim 2) protein expression and modification as well as size at&#xD;
      the molecular and cellular levels. The within subject, unilateral intervention design&#xD;
      provides a powerful model to minimize the effects of between-subject variability, and the&#xD;
      translational approach will take advantage of our unique expertise with state-of-the-art&#xD;
      measures from the molecular to whole body levels.&#xD;

          -  Older adult (65-75 years old) volunteers will be healthy, by self-report, and&#xD;
             sedentary, defined as no formal exercise program for the year prior to evaluation and&#xD;
             &lt; 2 sessions (30 min or more) of volitional exercise per week. Volunteers will be&#xD;
             ambulatory without the use of walking aids and living independently in the community.&#xD;
