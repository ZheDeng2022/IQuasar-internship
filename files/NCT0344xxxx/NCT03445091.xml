      Clinical study to evaluate impact on quality of life in patients with Chronic Venous&#xD;
      Insufficiency during 4 weeks period of using SANKOM® Patent Socks&#xD;

      Despite the application of compression stockings looks simple, it must be remembered that&#xD;
      inappropriately worn stockings have the potential to cause certain problems. Unevenly&#xD;
      distributed and excess pressure may break the skin, especially in older, malnourished&#xD;
      patients and those with thin, brittle skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although an extreme case, it highlights the importance of careful assessment, application,&#xD;
      and monitoring of compression stockings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically, the stockings are safe and wearing them results in few or no complications,&#xD;
      provided they're worn smoothly against the leg, without any folds. But some groups of people&#xD;
      should avoid them, including those with peripheral neuropathy or any other condition that&#xD;
      impacts skin sensation; a history of a peripheral arterial bypass grafting; peripheral artery&#xD;
      disease; skin infection; dermatitis with oozing or fragile skin; massive leg swelling; or&#xD;
      pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure. Each of these conditions presents a different&#xD;
      series of risks. For example, for people with peripheral artery disease, stockings can worsen&#xD;
      oxygen delivery in arteries with impaired blood flow. People who have sensory problems, such&#xD;
      as those with peripheral neuropathy, may not feel when a compression stocking is too tight,&#xD;
      which could impede circulation. And certain skin conditions or infections may worsen with a&#xD;
      compression stocking covering and pressing on the area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, if subject has any medical condition, he/she should talk with health care&#xD;
      professional before using compression stockings to see if they are good candidate for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since probability of side/adverse effects from IP use is considered as very low vs of high&#xD;
      probability of expected positive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Purpose and Design Multi-center, observational open label study aimed to evaluate an&#xD;
      impact on quality of life in Chronic Venous Insufficiency patients using SANKOM® Patent Socks&#xD;
      during 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve a maximum of 30 subjects. Subjects will be followed through&#xD;
      outpatient's observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement of QoL by scores of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aberdeen Varicose Veins Questionnaire (AVVQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CIVIQ-2 Venous Quality of Life Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement of US-examination picture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement of QoL by Subject's questionnaire&#xD;
