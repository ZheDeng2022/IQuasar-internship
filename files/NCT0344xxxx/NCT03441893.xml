  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract of&#xD;
      unknown etiology. UC is characterized by recurring episodes of inflammation limited to&#xD;
      mucosal and submucosal layers of the colon. The object of the present study was to determine&#xD;
      the prevalence of intestinal protozoa and helminthes in UC patients, and the role of this&#xD;
      changes in aetiopathogenesis of diseases. Patients will be examined before and after therapy.&#xD;
      Parasites and protozoa prevalence and intensity will be detected by triple&#xD;
      coproscopy.Microbiological study will be conducted before therapy for detection pathogenic&#xD;
      bacteria only from UC patients infected with B. hominis . If intestinal pathogenic bacteria&#xD;
      are found, participants will be excluded from further investigation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The prospective cohort and randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study will be&#xD;
      conducted on the basis of Research Institute of Epidemiology, Microbiology and Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases and Coloproctology department of the Republic clinical hospital №1, Ministry of&#xD;
      Public Health of the Republic of Uzbekistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Diagnosis of UC will be confirmed using standard clinical, endoscopic,&#xD;
      radiographic, and pathological criteria according to the Montreal classification of extent&#xD;
      and severity of ulcerative colitis (Silverberg MS et al. 2006). UC categories include&#xD;
      proctitis, left-sided colitis, and extensive colitis or pancolitis. Activity of the disease&#xD;
      will be measured by Mayo Clinic score that consists of 4 items: stool frequency, rectal&#xD;
      bleeding, findings of flexible proctosigmoidoscopy, and patient's functional assessment&#xD;
      (D'Haens G et al. 2007). The disease duration will be measured in years from the first time&#xD;
      of symptoms onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UC patients hospitalized in coloproctology department of Republic clinical hospital №1 will&#xD;
      be examined before surgery and receiving of medications. Additional cohort groups: the 1st&#xD;
      one will include UC patients infected with B. hominis which will be examined before and after&#xD;
      taking nitazoxanide (monotherapy), the 2nd group will include UC patients infected with B.&#xD;
      hominis before and after taking nitazoxanide and mesalazine (combination therapy) and 3rd one&#xD;
      - patients with UC infected with B. hominis before and after taking mesalazine (monotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will include residents of Tashkent region without any complaints from the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, who will apply to the clinic for planned medical examinations.&#xD;
      Suggested age of the population from 17 to 90 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Patients with diagnosis of Crohn's disease will be excluded from the&#xD;
      analysis. Other exclusion criteria are toxic megacolon, abdominal abscess, symptomatic&#xD;
      colonic stricture, stoma, a history of colectomy, an increased risk of infectious&#xD;
      complications (e.g. as a result of recent pyogenic infection, enteric pathogens detected in&#xD;
      microbiological stool analysis, active or latent tuberculosis, immunodeficiency, hepatitis B&#xD;
      or C, or recent live vaccination), clinically meaningful laboratory abnormalities, pregnancy&#xD;
      or lactation, unstable or uncontrolled medical disorders, an anticipated requirements for&#xD;
      major surgery, colonic dysplasia or adenomas, and malignant neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For additional groups except the above mentioned the followed patients will be excluded:&#xD;
      individuals who were operated, ever used immunosuppressants or biological drugs, infected&#xD;
      with intestinal pathologenic bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, Salmonella spp,&#xD;
      Shigella spp, Campylobacter spp, Yersinia spp, and Mycobacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasitological method Collection of stool samples. Three stool samples for parasitological&#xD;
      examination will be taken from both control subjects and UC patients at 2 days interval&#xD;
      before therapy (all participants) and in the 2nd week of monotherapy therapy with&#xD;
      nitazoxanide, nitazoxanide in combination with mesalazine and monotherapy with mesalazine and&#xD;
      in 6th and 12th weeks from beginning of the therapy. Stool samples (1-2g.) will be collected&#xD;
      in individual containers, with 5 ml of Turdiev's preservative provided conservation and&#xD;
      staining of proozoa cysts and eggs of worms for a year. The Turdiev's preservative includes:&#xD;
      80 ml of 0.2% aqueous solution of sodium nitrite, 10 ml of formaldehyde, 2 ml of glycerin, 8&#xD;
      ml of Lugol's solution, 250 ml of distilled water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples (1-2g.) for detection of C. parvum (Cryptosporidium parvum) will be collected&#xD;
      in individual empty containers no less 1 hour before parasitological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microscopy. Parasitological diagnosis will be performed by triple coproscopy using formalin -&#xD;
      ethyl acetate concentration technique [Truant AL, Elliott SH] and iodine stained smears [King&#xD;
      M.]. For preparations staining Lugol's solution will be used. The intensity of protozoa will&#xD;
      be estimated by the number of protozoa in the field of view (ocular x10, objective x40) in&#xD;
      iodine stained smears taken before application of formalin - ethyl acetate concentration&#xD;
      technique, the number of protozoa will be calculated at least in 10 fields of view. 1-2, 3-4&#xD;
      and 5-6 microorganisms in a field of view were considered as infection of low, mean and high&#xD;
      intensity respectively. For detection of C. parvum modified Ziehl - Neelsen method&#xD;
      [Henricksen SA, Pohlenz JF] will be used for staining the preparations. The stained smears&#xD;
      will be scanned with ×100 oil immersion lens for the presence of C. parvum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological methods Microbiological methods wil be conducted for detection pathogenic&#xD;
      bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, Salmonella spp, Shigella spp, Campylobacter spp,&#xD;
      Yersinia spp, and Mycobacteria only from UC patients infected with B. hominis before therapy.&#xD;
      If intestinal pathogenic bacteria are detected participants will be excluded from further&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of stool samples. Fecal samples will be collected from UC patients infected with&#xD;
      B. hominis before therapy in sterile, wide-mouth, screw capped containers and immediately&#xD;
      transferred to the laboratory, preferably within 2 h. Specimens will be processed for&#xD;
      microscopy, anaerobic and aerobic culture, and ELISA (only for Clostridium difficile).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Parasitological examination in UC patients and population will be provided.&#xD;
      Additional UC patients infected with B. hominis will be divided into 3 cohorts, in&#xD;
      double-blinded fashion, to receive 1 of the following treatments: (1) patients with UC&#xD;
      infected with B. hominis will be treated with nitazoxanide, 1.0 g/daily (two pills) twice&#xD;
      over orally for 14 consecutive days; (2) UC patients infected with B. hominis will be treated&#xD;
      with nitazoxanide by a 1.0 g/day (one pill - 500 mg) twice over orally and mesalazine 1.5&#xD;
      g/day (one pill - 500 mg) three times a day orally for 14 consecutive days; (3) patients with&#xD;
      UC infected B. hominis will be treated with mesalazine ≥3 g/day (one pill - 500 mg) three&#xD;
      times a day orally for 14 consecutive days. Except drugs patients of all three groups adhered&#xD;
      to the diet. The purpose of follow-up was to monitor compliance with medications and to&#xD;
      record response to therapy, adverse events, and recurrence of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other detected pathogenic protozoan and helminthes was treated by standard dosage of&#xD;
      antiparasitic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up The study was conducted in two stages. At the first stage parasitological&#xD;
      examination of patients with UC before treatment and population will be provided . At the&#xD;
      second stage of the study in patients with UC infected with B. hominis drugs with anti&#xD;
      Blastocystis activity will be applied as well as monitoring of therapy efficiency.&#xD;
      Parasitological, microbiological, clinical and endoscopic examination will be conducted&#xD;
      before therapy and at the 2nd, 6th and 12th weeks. At each visit, a Mayo Clinic score will be&#xD;
      calculated and intensity/elimination of B. hominis will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The outcome measures of therapy are : eradication/ reduction of intensity of&#xD;
      B. hominis infection and a clinical response of UC patients at the 2nd, 6th and 12th weeks&#xD;
      will be defined as a reduction in the Mayo Clinic score.&#xD;
