  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether 1 year of supervised exercise training in&#xD;
      obese individuals at high risk for developing HF, incorporating high intensity interval&#xD;
      training (HIIT) two to three times per week in conjunction with daily oral administration of&#xD;
      omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids will lead to reduction in visceral adiposity, regression&#xD;
      of myocardial triglyceride levels and improvements in cardiac diastolic and vascular&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The global objective of this project is to test novel strategies to prevent obesity related&#xD;
      abnormalities in diastolic function that may progress to heart failure with preserved&#xD;
      ejection fraction (HFpEF). These include: a) identifying high risk individuals by using&#xD;
      population derived imaging and blood biomarkers; and b) implementing novel exercise training&#xD;
      and &quot;nutri-ceutical&quot; strategies in obese middle aged individuals with high amounts of&#xD;
      visceral fat, an important risk factor in the development of heart failure and adverse&#xD;
      cardiac remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior work has demonstrated that: a) high levels of myocardial triglyceride content are&#xD;
      associated with a smaller and less distensible left ventricle with reduced tissue relaxation&#xD;
      rates compared to those with low levels and b) low fitness and high body mass index were the&#xD;
      strongest predictors of elevated myocardial content. The consequences of excess visceral&#xD;
      adiposity (intra- and retro-peritoneal adipose tissue) on cardiac remodeling suggest&#xD;
      individuals with high visceral fat content and low fitness are at particularly high risk for&#xD;
      heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this project is therefore to identify high risk, sedentary, middle&#xD;
      aged obese individuals with high visceral fat levels, and initiate an exercise program in&#xD;
      conjunction with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation designed to reduce visceral adiposity and&#xD;
      regress myocardial triglyceride accumulation. Findings from this aim would have enormous&#xD;
      public health significance and establish a novel, practical exercise training program and&#xD;
      &quot;nutria-ceutical&quot; strategy to reverse obesity related cardiovascular remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High aerobic exercise training in conjunction with daily omega-3 supplementation will reduce&#xD;
      visceral myocardial triglyceride accumulation by reducing visceral adiposity. A reduction of&#xD;
      myocardial fat will lead to improved LV structure and diastolic function by an approach that&#xD;
      is not necessarily predicated on weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test our hypothesis that reduction in myocardial triglyceride content will improve markers&#xD;
      of diastolic function, we have designed a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial.&#xD;
      We will study four groups of previously sedentary obese middle aged subjects at high risk for&#xD;
      development of HF for one year with the following interventions: A) sedentary controls taking&#xD;
      placebo; B) sedentary subjects taking omega-3 fatty acids; C) subjects undergoing high&#xD;
      intensity aerobic exercise training while on placebo and D) subjects undergoing high&#xD;
      intensity aerobic exercise training while taking omega-3 fatty acids. Subjects will be&#xD;
      categorized as high risk and enrolled on the basis of elevated serum biomarkers (cTnT) and&#xD;
      high visceral fat content (&gt;2.5 kg). We will perform comprehensive non-invasive assessments&#xD;
      of cardiovascular structure and systolic/diastolic function before and after 1 year of an&#xD;
      exercise intervention involving high intensity intervals and omega-3 administration. We&#xD;
      anticipate the combination of high intensity aerobic exercise in conjunction with high dose&#xD;
      omega-3 supplementation will reduce visceral adiposity, decrease myocardial triglyceride&#xD;
      content and improve markers of diastolic and vascular function.&#xD;
