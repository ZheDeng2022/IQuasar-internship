  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PURPOSE of this study is to investigate the combined influence of 2-weeks blueberry&#xD;
      ingestion and banana ingestion (during exercise) on performance and in mitigating metabolic&#xD;
      perturbation, immune dysfunction, and increase in inflammation following a 75-km cycling time&#xD;
      trial. We hypothesize that the combination of 2-weeks ingestion of blueberries (versus&#xD;
      placebo) and acute ingestion of bananas (versus water alone) during 75-km cycling will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enhance performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Attenuate the magnitude of metabolic perturbation due to exercise (using a targeted&#xD;
           panel of metabolites) which may be associated with increased plasma levels of beneficial&#xD;
           gut-derived phenolics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Attenuate post-exercise inflammation (as measured with cytokines, muscle damage markers,&#xD;
           regulatory lipid mediators, ex-vivo monocyte cell cultures, and targeted immune proteins&#xD;
           including S100A8 and S100A12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Counter post-exercise downturns in innate immune function (natural killer cell lytic&#xD;
           activity), and viral defense (using an ex-vivo cell culture with Hela cells).&#xD;

      LAB VISIT #1: ORIENTATION AND BASELINE TESTING (about 1.5 hours):&#xD;
&#xD;
      One to two weeks prior to the start of the study, study participants will report to the NCRC&#xD;
      Human Performance Lab for orientation and baseline testing. Study participants will be&#xD;
      screened to verify &quot;low risk&quot; status for cardiovascular disease, and provide voluntary&#xD;
      consent. Demographic and training histories will be acquired with questionnaires. Study&#xD;
      participants will be tested for VO2max (i.e., maximal oxygen consumption) using the Lodi&#xD;
      cycle ergometer. Percent body fat will be measured using the BodPod. Study participants will&#xD;
      sit inside the BodPod with a tight-fitting swim suit for about 10 minutes while body fat is&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LAB VISIT #2: START OF 2-WEEK SUPPLEMENTATION PERIOD (about 20 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the assigned date and time, study participants will return to the lab in an overnight&#xD;
      fasted state (9 or more hours with no food or beverage including coffee and tea, other than&#xD;
      water). A blood sample will be collected from an arm or hand vein by trained phlebotomists.&#xD;
      Each blood sample will not exceed 35 ml (2.3 tablespoons), and will be analyzed for&#xD;
      indicators of immune function, inflammation, muscle damage, stress hormones, and indicators&#xD;
      of plant polyphenol metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomized to blueberry and placebo groups, and be given a 14-day&#xD;
      supply of freeze-dried blueberry powder or placebo powder. The blueberry and placebo&#xD;
      supplements will be ingested daily for 2-weeks prior to participation in the 75-km cycling&#xD;
      time trial, the day of the exercise trial (after the blood draw, and supplied at the lab),&#xD;
      and one day of recovery (after the blood draw, and supplied at the lab (thus 16 days total).&#xD;
      The blueberry powder supplement (26 g per day or approximately one cup fresh blueberries&#xD;
      equivalent) will consist of freeze-dried wild blueberries prepared by Future Ceuticals&#xD;
      (Momence, IL). This product contains all of the polyphenols (in particular, anthocyanins),&#xD;
      fiber, and natural sugars contained in fresh wild blueberries. The placebo powder will look&#xD;
      identical but not contain freeze-dried blueberries. The placebo blueberry powder will consist&#xD;
      of blueberry flavoring (2.8%), coloring (0.7% artificial purple, 0.3% artificial red),&#xD;
      maltodextrin (21%), fructose (3.5%), citric acid (0.7%), and a silica flow agent (0.5%).&#xD;
      Study participants will consume the blueberry and placebo powders by mixing them in fruit&#xD;
      juices, yogurts, milk, or other products during the first meal of each day for two weeks. The&#xD;
      blueberry and placebo powders should be stored in the freezer section of the refrigerator in&#xD;
      the containers supplied to study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LAB VISIT #3: POST-SUPPLEMENTATION LAB VISIT WITH 75-km CYCLING (about 8-9 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the 3-day period prior to the 75-km cycling trial, study participants will taper&#xD;
           exercise training and ingest a moderate-carbohydrate diet, with foods chosen from a food&#xD;
           list moderating use of high fat foods, visible fats, and fruit/vegetable polyphenols.&#xD;
           Study participants will record all food and beverage intake during the 3-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the 2-week supplementation period, study participants will return to the lab at&#xD;
           7:00 am in an overnight fasted and rested state (on the same day of the week and time as&#xD;
           the pre-supplementation lab visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study participants will turn in the 3-day food record.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study participants will verify that they have ingested the assigned supplement each&#xD;
                day.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A 35 ml blood sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study participants will next ingest 26 g of freeze-dried blueberry powder or&#xD;
                placebo powder in 1.5 cups of water (with Equal packets available to improve taste&#xD;
                as desired).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A simple questionnaire will be used for study participants to indicate muscle&#xD;
                soreness (DOMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study participants will complete a symptom log, which will include questions on&#xD;
                digestive and mental health (heartburn, bloating, diarrhea, nausea, energy levels,&#xD;
                ability to focus, etc.). Study participants will indicate responses using a&#xD;
                12-point Likert scale, with 1 relating to &quot;none at all&quot;, 6 &quot;moderate&quot;, and 12 &quot;very&#xD;
                high&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study participants will be randomized to cycle 75-km on water alone or with bananas&#xD;
                and water (and this will be revealed after the blood draw). Twenty minutes after&#xD;
                ingesting the supplement, study participants will start the 75-km cycling time&#xD;
                trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
                75-km CYCLING TIME TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      7:30 am: Start 75-km cycling time trial. Study participants are to complete the 75-km course&#xD;
      as fast as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participants will use their own bicycles on CompuTrainer Pro Model 8001 trainers&#xD;
           (RacerMate, Seattle, WA). A mountainous 75-km course with moderate difficulty will be&#xD;
           utilized using the CompuTrainer software system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be recorded every 30 minutes, and&#xD;
           workload (watts) continuously monitored using the CompuTrainer MultiRider software&#xD;
           system (version 3.0, RacerMate, Seattle, WA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and ventilation will be measured using&#xD;
           the Cosmed metabolic cart after 16 km and 55 km cycling (through a facemask similar to&#xD;
           what occurred during baseline testing). Performance will be monitored throughout the&#xD;
           75-km cycling time trial using percentage of maximal watts to ensure that a full effort&#xD;
           is being given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participants will consume 3 ml/kg water every 15 min (e.g., about one cup for a 75&#xD;
           kg cyclist).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If randomized to ingest bananas with water: Study participants will ingest Cavendish&#xD;
           bananas, with the volume adjusted to 0.2 g carbohydrate/kg body weight every 15 minutes&#xD;
           (or 0.8 g/kg carbohydrate per hour) during the 75-km time trials. For a 75-kg cyclist,&#xD;
           fruit intake will be approximately one-half banana every 15 minutes. Bananas will be&#xD;
           provided by Dole Foods at the appropriate ripening stage (full yellow, stage six). No&#xD;
           other beverage or food containing energy or nutrients will be allowed during the cycling&#xD;
           time trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ~10:00-11:30 am: Immediate-post-exercise, 1.5-h recovery blood samples; lunch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be taken from the arm vein immediately after completing the 75-km&#xD;
           time trial, and then at 1.5-h post-exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediately post-exercise, study participants will complete the symptom log.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participants will indicate muscle soreness using the DOMS questionnaire&#xD;
           immediately post-exercise and 1.5-h post-exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participants will ingest no food or beverage other than water (7 ml/kg or about&#xD;
           two cups during the 1.5 h post-exercise period).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right after the 1.5-h recovery blood sample has been collected, study participants will&#xD;
           ingest a meal adjusted to 12 kcal/kg body weight. The meal will be prepared by Dole&#xD;
           Foods and include grilled chicken, rice, corn, green beans, salt, and water.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ~11:30 am to 3:00 pm: 3-h and 5-h recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional blood samples and DOMS responses will be collected 3-h and 5-h post-exercise.&#xD;
           During this time, study participants will rest quietly in the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LAB VISITS #4 and #5: RECOVERY DAY BLOOD SAMPLES, 7:00 am:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Study participants will return to the lab the following two mornings in an overnight fasted&#xD;
      state at about 7:00 am (~21-h and 45-h after completing the 75-km time trial). Blood samples&#xD;
      and responses to the DOMS questionnaire will be collected at both lab visits. Study&#xD;
      participants will ingest the blueberry or placebo powder in the lab on the first recovery day&#xD;
      following the blood sample collection.&#xD;
