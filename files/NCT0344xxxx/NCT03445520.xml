    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will randomize 20 families per site (across 4 sites) to be&#xD;
      in the BBB Transition Passport Only Group or BBB Intervention Group. Both groups will receive&#xD;
      the BBB Transition Passport, which include the Transition Checklist, Student Snapshot,&#xD;
      Parent/Caregiver Guide, and Student Guide. In addition to receiving the Transition Passport,&#xD;
      the BBB Intervention Group will also receive coaching support to implement these resources.&#xD;
      This coaching will include a member of the research team assigned as a coach for each family.&#xD;
      This coach will introduce the resources to the family, briefly teach them fundamental&#xD;
      information about the transition process, provide brief coaching phone calls, and guide&#xD;
      parents in using the tools and requesting help from the child's provider(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be testing the differences between these two groups in terms of: 1)&#xD;
      quality of the transition as reported by the parent and teacher, 2) self-efficacy of the&#xD;
      parent during the transition process, 3) child school engagement and behavior during the&#xD;
      transition as rated by the teacher and parent, and 4) the quality of the child's team to&#xD;
      communicate about information important to the child's transition.&#xD;

      Building Better Bridges (BBB), will evaluate an intervention designed to support the needs of&#xD;
      students with autism who are transitioning from either preschool to elementary school, or&#xD;
      from elementary to secondary school. In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators&#xD;
      will randomly assign a total of 160 families (40 families/site, across 4 sites, over 2 years)&#xD;
      to one of two intervention groups: BBB Transition Passport Only Group (Comparison) or BBB&#xD;
      Intervention Group. Both groups will receive the BBB Transition Passport, which include the&#xD;
      Transition Checklist, Student Snapshot, Parent/Caregiver Guide, and Student Guide. In&#xD;
      addition to receiving the Transition Passport, the BBB Intervention Group will also receive&#xD;
      coaching support to implement these resources. The coach will be a member of the research&#xD;
      team who will introduce the resources to the family, briefly teach them fundamental&#xD;
      information about the transition process, provide brief coaching phone calls, and help&#xD;
      parents identify an appropriate person at the school or district who can work with them to&#xD;
      complete the Student Snapshot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research staff will first recruit interested schools, and school administrators will&#xD;
      identify potential teachers who may have eligible students. If the teacher agrees to&#xD;
      participate, he/she will send the study flyer home to parents where parents can either call&#xD;
      the study phone line to learn more, or can fill out the study interest portion of the flyer&#xD;
      and turn it in to their teachers. Parents who fill out the interest sheet will be contacted&#xD;
      by the research staff. Interested parents can also contact research staff. All parents will&#xD;
      receive a screening over the telephone to determine eligibility, which will include an Social&#xD;
      Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) over the phone and will ask if their child has received a&#xD;
      diagnosis of Autism by the administration of an Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)&#xD;
      or any other official diagnosis. The investigators will accept an ADOS diagnosis within one&#xD;
      year for children in preschool and within three years for students transitioning to secondary&#xD;
      school.. If an ADOS or any record of an official diagnosis is not provided, the research&#xD;
      staff will schedule a time to administer the ADOS to determine eligibility. We will also ask&#xD;
      if the child has a record of a cognitive test like the Stanford Binet-5. If parents do not&#xD;
      have a record or if it has been over a year since the pre-school child or over 3 years since&#xD;
      the older child has had one, the research staff will also schedule with the parents to&#xD;
      administer it around the same time as the ADOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial phone screen and verification of autism diagnosis, the parent will be&#xD;
      consented and then will complete baseline T1 measures. Pre-transition teachers will complete&#xD;
      T1 measures as well. Schedule of measures can be found in the Outcome Measures Section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following enrollment into the study, the child will be randomized to one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups, BBB Comparison Group(Control) or BBB Intervention Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families randomized to the control group will only have access to the BBB Transition&#xD;
      Passport, which consists of the Transition Checklist, Parent Guide, Student Guide, and the&#xD;
      Student Snapshot. A hard copy of these tools will be given to them. We will also provide them&#xD;
      with a link to download them online through LiveBinder (online website).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families randomized to the BBB Intervention group will be enrolled in ParentSquare if they&#xD;
      agreed to it in the consent form. ParentSquare is an app that provides a safe and secure&#xD;
      platform for program-to-parent communication. ParentSquare is in compliance with Family&#xD;
      Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Any school team members who want to use&#xD;
      ParentSquare will be consented to use it and agree to allow the de-identified data from&#xD;
      ParentSquare to be used for research purposes. The participants in this group will also have&#xD;
      access to download the tools and share them with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents in the intervention group will also receive six, 1 hour, coaching sessions (one&#xD;
      session per month for six months), with a research staff coach, to discuss key information&#xD;
      about transitions (knowing parent's rights about special education services, communicating&#xD;
      effectively with school staff, knowing the roles of the school team members, preparing their&#xD;
      child over the summer, developing and sharing their Snapshot). These coaching sessions will&#xD;
      occur individually (in-person or by telephone) during the pre-transition school year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, parents will receive ongoing 1-2 monthly follow up phone calls (10 minutes each)&#xD;
      to see how the transition planning is going, to help the parent problem-solve around any&#xD;
      concerns about the transition, and to encourage the parent to implement all components of the&#xD;
      intervention (including conducting at least one school visit, working on the student guide,&#xD;
      and completing the Student Snapshot with the school team). These coaching calls are expected&#xD;
      to start in February during the pre-transition school year and continue through November of&#xD;
      the post-transition year. Coaching calls are designed to be flexible and brief and can occur&#xD;
      in person or by telephone, or by a secure internet-based platform (Zoom), depending on the&#xD;
      parent's preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coach will encourage the parent to identify a school staff member to help with preparing&#xD;
      for the transition. This person can be the child's teacher, provider, or someone else from&#xD;
      the school or district who can assist with the child's transition. The coach will encourage&#xD;
      the parent to work with this school person to arrange a meeting prior to the transition (or&#xD;
      join an existing meeting), for the purpose of completing the Student Snapshot and meeting&#xD;
      with a post-transition teacher or staff from the receiving school, if possible. This school&#xD;
      staff person can also help to recruit other school team members working on the transition&#xD;
      process and to utilize Parent Square for all communication and sharing of transition&#xD;
      materials. Any team member involved in the transition will be offered to be consented and&#xD;
      given access to Parent Square. This meeting will occur at a time convenient for the school&#xD;
      team, likely in April or May. If the post-transition school personnel can attend the meeting&#xD;
      (if known prior to the transition), they will also be consented for the study form. During&#xD;
      this meeting, everyone will work together to complete the BBB Passport materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the post transition school team is not able to participate in a pre-transition meeting,&#xD;
      then the coach will encourage the parent to share the Student Snapshot with the&#xD;
      post-transition teacher(s) and school team when the new school year begins in the Fall.&#xD;
