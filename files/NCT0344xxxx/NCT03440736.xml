  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 40% of moderate to severe psoriasis patients are affected by concomitant metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, making it one of the clinically most relevant comorbidities. Psoriasis as well as&#xD;
      the metabolic syndrome are both characterized by a state of low-grade systemic inflammation&#xD;
      (e.g. in the skin, joints, adipose tissue, liver or vascular endothelium). This shared&#xD;
      pathophysiology makes systemic inflammation an attractive target for the treatment of both&#xD;
      diseases. Secukinumab as well as lifestyle intervention are able to reduce systemic&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is designed to answer the question whether the combination of Secukinumab with&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention can primarily improve skin symptoms and secondly cardiometabolic&#xD;
      status more than Secukinumab alone in psoriasis patients with concomitant metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      by targeting the shared pathophysiology behind both diseases, which is systemic inflammation.&#xD;

         18. Any medical or psychiatric condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would&#xD;
             preclude the participant from adhering to the protocol or completing the study per&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Serum creatinine level exceeding 2.0 mg/dl (176.8 μmol/L) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Total white blood cell (WBC) count &lt; 2,500/μl, or platelets &lt; 100,000/μl or&#xD;
             neutrophils &lt; 1,500/μl or hemoglobin &lt; 8.5 g/dl at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Active systemic infections during the last two weeks (exception: common cold) prior to&#xD;
             baseline (visit 2) or any infection that reoccurs on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. History of an ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease, or evidence of&#xD;
             tuberculosis infection as defined by a positive QuantiFERON TB-Gold test (QFT) at&#xD;
             screening. Subjects with a positive or indeterminate QFT test may participate in the&#xD;
             study if full tuberculosis work up (according to local practice/guidelines) was&#xD;
             completed within 12 weeks prior to visit 2 and establishes conclusively that the&#xD;
             subject has no evidence of active tuberculosis. If presence of latent tuberculosis is&#xD;
             established, then appropriate treatment must have been initiated at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to baseline (visit 2) and maintained according to local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Past medical history record or current infection with HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C&#xD;
             prior to baseline (visit 2).&#xD;

             malignancy of any organ system treated or untreated within the past 5 years,&#xD;
             regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases (except for&#xD;
             Bowen's disease, or basal cell carcinoma or actinic keratoses that have been treated&#xD;
             with no evidence of recurrence in the past 12 weeks prior to baseline (visit 2);&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix or non-invasive malignant colon polyps that have been&#xD;
             removed).&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Inability or unwillingness to undergo repeated venipuncture (e.g., because of poor&#xD;
             tolerability or lack of access to veins).&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. History or evidence of ongoing alcohol or drug abuse, within the last six months&#xD;
             before baseline (visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using basic methods of contraception during dosing&#xD;
             of investigational drug for at least 20 weeks after the end of Secukinumab treatment.&#xD;
             Basic contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking investigational drug. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
                  assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 m prior to screening). For female subjects on the&#xD;
                  study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods&#xD;
                  of contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable&#xD;
                  efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal&#xD;
                  hormone contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or&#xD;
                  intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they&#xD;
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have&#xD;
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total&#xD;
                  hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of&#xD;
                  oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been&#xD;
                  confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
                  bearing potential.&#xD;
