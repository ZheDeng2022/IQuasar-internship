  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There exists continued controversy over the use of propofol in Emergency Department&#xD;
      procedural sedation, this is despite its widespread existence in clinical practice for at&#xD;
      least a decade. These concerns are not limited to the ED setting and are primarily related to&#xD;
      the pharmacological properties of the drug itself and its potential for harm. The bolus&#xD;
      administration of propofol, aimed at a target of sedation, offers several advantages over&#xD;
      more traditional agents, yet these advantages are also its limitations. The use of a&#xD;
      target-controlled infusion may provide the sedationist with greater control over the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of propofol and thus reduce the rate of adverse incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study aims to use a pragmatic design to test the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      propofol TCI whilst assessing the practicalities of it's use in the ED. If it proves to be&#xD;
      feasible then the researchers plan to proceed to a multi centre pilot study to gather&#xD;
      information to adequately power a larger randomised multi centre trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) has long been a core skill of the Emergency&#xD;
      Physician, although over the last decade, developments in patient monitoring and the use of&#xD;
      newer sedative and analgesic agents have served to improve both safety and efficacy. Despite&#xD;
      these advances and their consolidation into well-designed guidelines concern regarding the&#xD;
      safety of ED PSA persists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, concerns have been raised regarding the use of propofol, an ultra-short&#xD;
      acting anaesthetic agent. The practice of using sub-anaesthetic doses of propofol to achieve&#xD;
      sedation in ED PSA originated around the turn of the millennium and has since become the most&#xD;
      common choice of sedative in the ED. Propofol offers a number of advantages as a sedative&#xD;
      agent, including; a short onset and recovery time, amnesiac properties and good efficacy. The&#xD;
      cost of these properties is in part, a narrow therapeutic range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When given as a bolus, propofol will induce a spectrum of states up to and including general&#xD;
      anaesthesia, dependent on the dosage. The correlation between dose and effect varies based on&#xD;
      several patient factors. Whilst targeting a state of sedation it is possible for the operator&#xD;
      to 'overshoot' moving rapidly from Conscious Sedation to Deep Sedation to General&#xD;
      Anaesthesia. The inadvertent induction of general anesthesia may result in unanticipated&#xD;
      complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle complications associated with accidental over-sedation or general anesthesia&#xD;
      relate to the patency of the patient's airway. The reported frequency of airway complications&#xD;
      during ED PSA with propofol range from 5.0% to 9.4%7, this includes a rate of supplemental&#xD;
      ventilation of between 3.0% and 9.4%, with oxygen desaturation occurring in between 5% and 7%&#xD;
      of cases12. In addition, the bolus administration of propofol may result in transient&#xD;
      hypotension. Despite being a relatively short lived effect, this may be pronounced in those&#xD;
      with intravascular volume depletion or in the elderly, and in some may be profound, with one&#xD;
      series demonstrating that 3.5% of those undergoing PSA with propofol experience â‰¥ 20% falls&#xD;
      in blood pressure. At first inspection the reported rate of complication may appear low, and&#xD;
      has by some been interpreted as evidence of the relative safety of ED PSA, however&#xD;
      alternative views have been expressed in the context of much lower rates of adverse events&#xD;
      seen in elective painful procedures requiring conscious sedation. This is compounded by the&#xD;
      non-standard way in which adverse events have been reported across studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential solution to the adverse events experienced with the bolus administration of&#xD;
      propofol is the use of a target-controlled infusion (TCI). This method is widely used in&#xD;
      anaesthetic practice and whilst the PK remains the same irrespective of if you give a bolus&#xD;
      or infusion of propofol, TCI allows the titration in perhaps a more controlled manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim when administering propofol, as with any drug, is to induce a desired clinical&#xD;
      effect, in this context a level of sedation. As previously alluded to, when administering&#xD;
      propofol in a bolus fashion or as a fixed rate infusion, without regard to those factors&#xD;
      which cause biologic variability (e.g. age, gender, weight), it is difficult to accurately&#xD;
      and consistently predict clinical effect. The development, in the early 1990's, of computer&#xD;
      assisted infusion devices, for the first time, allowed the clinician to target a plasma&#xD;
      concentration, with the pump automatically altering the rate of infusion based on a&#xD;
      pre-programmed pharmacokinetic model. These target-controlled infusion (TCI) devices have&#xD;
      undergone significant development and are now in widespread clinical use. Their operation&#xD;
      uses a mathematical mode that reflects a theoretical 'three-compartment' model that may&#xD;
      comprise the central compartment (plasma), and two peripheral compartments (highly perfused&#xD;
      tissue e.g. brain and poorly perfused tissue e.g. adipose). In a state of equilibrium,&#xD;
      propofol will diffuse between compartments at a constant rate. These rate constants have been&#xD;
      used in pharmacokinetic models to mathematically predict the plasma concentration and&#xD;
      latterly the effect site concentration, in this case that in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practical terms, TCI allows the operator to more accurately target a specific clinical&#xD;
      effect. When propofol is administered as a bolus, the operator is likely to either&#xD;
      under-dose, delivering an insufficient effect site concentration, or over-dose, exceeding the&#xD;
      desired effect site concentration. TCI allows the operator to titrate to effect and then to&#xD;
      maintain a steady state, potentially eliminating the risk of 'over shooting' and reducing the&#xD;
      rate of adverse events. TCI is not without limitation. PK models are an estimate as they have&#xD;
      been derived from a healthy population but any inherent inaccuracy is consistent in different&#xD;
      populations and accounted for by careful titration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of propofol TCI has been studied in a number of settings, including gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy, dental surgery, oocyte retrieval and bronchoscopy. To our knowledge propofol TCI&#xD;
      in sedation has not been studied in an ED setting. Trials have demonstrated a good safety&#xD;
      profile for propofol TCI, with at least one large randomised-controlled trial in an endoscopy&#xD;
      setting, showing a reduction in both respiratory and cardiovascular adverse events in&#xD;
      comparison to the bolus administration of propofol. Unfortunately, trials to date have&#xD;
      suffered from a high degree of heterogeneity, leading the Cochrane review, on the subject of&#xD;
      propofol TCI versus manually controlled infusion in both general anaesthesia and sedation, to&#xD;
      conclude that there was insufficient evidence to make firm recommendations regarding its use&#xD;
      in clinical practice.&#xD;
