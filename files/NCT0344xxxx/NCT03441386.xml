    <textblock>
      Cognitive function and psychological well-being are two variables related to academic&#xD;
      performance. Several studies have shown that these variables are sensitive to acute physical&#xD;
      exercise, but it is not known which doses of exercise are the most adaptive. To explore this&#xD;
      issue, a quasi-experimental study was conducted with 35 adolescents from three physical&#xD;
      education classes. Participants performed three sessions of physical education with different&#xD;
      doses of exercise: no exercise, light/moderate exercise, and moderate/vigorous exercise,&#xD;
      controlling intensities with accelerometers. All subjects completed the Stroop test (to&#xD;
      measure cognitive inhibition) and well-being questionnaires of subjective vitality, positive&#xD;
      affect and negative affect before and after each session.&#xD;

      Participants The initial sample comprised 35 students from 2nd grade of high school (19 boys&#xD;
      and 16 girls), aged between 16 and 18 years (M =16.49, SD = .79). The students belonged to a&#xD;
      public school of a large city in Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval and informed consent The experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      the authors' university and approved by the corresponding academic authority of the high&#xD;
      school. All participants signed an informed consent by themselves and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures Measure of Interference Index (Stroop Test). The interference index was calculated&#xD;
      from the scores obtained by the participants in the Spanish adaptation of the Stroop test 25&#xD;
      using a pencil-and-paper version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test consists of three pages of words and drawings printed in colors that combine in&#xD;
      different ways. The first set or page, called Word (W), is made up of the words blue, green,&#xD;
      and red, written in black ink on a white background. The second page, called Color (C),&#xD;
      presents groups of four Xs (XXXX), printed in one of the above-mentioned colors (blue, red or&#xD;
      green). The participants are requested to name the color of the four Xs presented. The last&#xD;
      page, called Word-Color (WC) is made up of the names of the colors that appear on page 1, but&#xD;
      in ink colors that are incongruent with the printed word. Participants are requested to name&#xD;
      the color while inhibiting the reading of the word.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the pages have 100 items, and each test lasts 45 seconds. The number of hits is added.&#xD;
      For this study, we calculated the interference index with the formula, Interference Index =&#xD;
      WC - ((WxC)/(W+C)). As indicated by Martín et al. (2012), this index represents the&#xD;
      difference between the real performance on page 3 and the expected performance as a function&#xD;
      of the hits on pages 1 and 2. Higher values indicate better control of interference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure of psychological well-being Subjective vitality. To measure the students' perception&#xD;
      of vitality before and after the three sessions, we used the Subjective Vitality&#xD;
      Questionnaire 26, adapted to Spanish by Molina-García, Castillo, and Pablos 27. This&#xD;
      questionnaire can be considered as a eudaimonic measure of psychological well-being 17. The&#xD;
      questionnaire is made up of 7 items that indicate how the person feels at that moment (e.g.,&#xD;
      &quot;I am full of energy&quot;). The responses are rated on an 8-point Likert-type scale ranging from&#xD;
      0 (not at all) to 7 (very true). Cronbach's alpha in the different experimental situations&#xD;
      ranged from .74 to .82.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Affect. The Spanish version 19 of the short form of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule&#xD;
      28 was used to measure positive and negative feelings before and after the sessions of&#xD;
      physical education. This questionnaire is considered a hedonic measure of well-being. The&#xD;
      scale is made up of 9 adjectives, which are grouped into two factors in response to the item&#xD;
      &quot;Indicate how you feel right now…&quot;. Four of the items represent feelings associated with&#xD;
      Positive Affect (glad, happy, content, amused), and five of them represent Negative Affect&#xD;
      (depressed, worried, frustrated, angry, unhappy). The responses are rated on an 8-point&#xD;
      Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely). Cronbach´s alpha ranged&#xD;
      between .76 and. 90 for the two factors in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Only the participants who handed in an informed consent signed by themselves, their&#xD;
      parents, and the school could participate. They were informed of the confidentiality and&#xD;
      anonymity of the results obtained. Although all the adolescents of the three classes that&#xD;
      participated in the study underwent all the experimental sessions (as a part of their&#xD;
      physical education curriculum), the investigators only measured the students who had handed&#xD;
      in the signed informed consent. The final sample (N = 35) was made up of those who&#xD;
      participated in all the pre and post-experimental sessions. The investigators counterbalanced&#xD;
      the three experimental sessions in the three classes. The participants carried out four&#xD;
      sessions (one pre-experimental session and three experimental sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-experimental session. In the first session, the participants completed the&#xD;
      socio-demographic data and then carried out a Stroop test training session, before receiving&#xD;
      a theoretical physical education class, in order to prevent a possible &quot;learning effect&quot; in&#xD;
      test performance. The participants performed a minimum of 2 attempts of each page. When the&#xD;
      participants made two attempts with a variability of intra-page hits below 5% with regard to&#xD;
      the previous attempt, the training session ended. Thus, the researchers respected individual&#xD;
      variability in learning the test. Prior studies have also used this percentage of&#xD;
      intra-variability as an indication of stable performance in cognitive inhibition tests 24.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that the intra-class correlation coefficient of the&#xD;
      test in the paper-and-pencil version in Spanish is high when comparing different temporal&#xD;
      measures in the same population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental sessions. The other three sessions consisted of: (a) a 20-min theoretical&#xD;
      physical education session, without a physical component, in which the students answered&#xD;
      questions about theoretical concepts of training; (b) a session of physical activity of light&#xD;
      and moderate intensity, structured as follows: a 5-min warm-up, 20 min of predominantly light&#xD;
      and moderate physical activity, and a 5-min cool-off; and (c) a session of physical activity&#xD;
      of predominantly moderate and vigorous intensity, with the same structure as before. There&#xD;
      was a one-week interval between the sessions. The physical activity sessions were based on&#xD;
      aerobics class directed by an instructor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the main part of the sessions was established from previous recommendations,&#xD;
      which indicate that, for acute sessions of physical activity, the greatest cognitive benefits&#xD;
      are obtained with durations of about 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after each session, the adolescents completed the instruments that measured&#xD;
      psychological well-being and cognitive interference. The data were collected 15 minutes after&#xD;
      the end of each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control of the intensity of the exercise. To control the intensity of the sessions, in&#xD;
      addition to measures with accelerometry in each session, the investigators performed a pilot&#xD;
      study with 5 adolescents in which they adjusted the intensity of the exercises and the&#xD;
      recovery times to ensure that they fulfilled the goals of the session. For this purpose, the&#xD;
      investigators used simple aerobic exercises that do not pose any coordination difficulties,&#xD;
      and the students followed a monitor's instructions. After adapting the sessions, they were&#xD;
      performed in the experimental situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators calculated the intensity of the sessions with accelerometry. The&#xD;
      investigators used tri-axial GT3X accelerometers that each of the participants wore while&#xD;
      performing sessions &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;. The students were shown how to put on and use the&#xD;
      accelerometer before beginning the sessions 30. The frequency of time storage was a 1-second&#xD;
      &quot;epoch&quot;. The investigators ignored periods of use fewer than 15 epochs, and periods of no&#xD;
      activity of longer than 1 minute were eliminated from the analysis. The software used for&#xD;
      data treatment was ActiLife 6 (Actigraph, Actilife version 6.11.5) and to define the type of&#xD;
      activity (light/moderate and moderate/vigorous), the investigators used the cutpoints defined&#xD;
      by 31. The investigators chose this author because he clearly and concisely defines the&#xD;
      cutpoints as a function of concrete ages. The specific criteria for each age are found in the&#xD;
      SAS code available at http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/nhanes_pam/ (National Cancer Institute).&#xD;
