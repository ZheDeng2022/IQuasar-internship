  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective work is to study the consequences of obstetrical brachial&#xD;
      plexus paralysis on the rotator muscles of the shoulder. First of all, the investigators want&#xD;
      to study the reproducibility of the isometric contraction forces of the rotator muscles of&#xD;
      the shoulder thanks to an isokinetic dynamometer. The investigatorsthen want to compare the&#xD;
      measurements obtained from the paralyzed side compared to the healthy side. The preoperative&#xD;
      MRI performed will be studied in search of amyotrophy. These data will be compared with those&#xD;
      of the isokinetic assessment to identify children requiring muscle transfer of reinforcement&#xD;
      of the external rotator muscles.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstetrical brachial plexus palsy is caused by arm stretching at birth. Recovery is not&#xD;
      complete in a third of cases. The main sequelae is a decrease in the mobility in external&#xD;
      rotation (ER) of the shoulder at the clinical examination. This is attributed to an imbalance&#xD;
      between the deficient external rotator muscles (mainly infraspinatus), and the internal&#xD;
      rotator muscles (subscapularis, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi). A stiffness would appear&#xD;
      because of the permanent vicious attitude of the shoulder. There is a surgical indication for&#xD;
      arthroscopic retraction before the age of 2 years. A muscle transfer to strengthen the&#xD;
      shoulder RE can be performed secondarily from the age of 3 years in case of persistent&#xD;
      sequelae but the investigators lack of objective elements to ask this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study of the reproducibility of the isometric contraction forces of the internal and&#xD;
           external rotator muscles obtained by isokinetic apparatus in paralyzed children.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The isokinetic device is the gold standard for assessing muscle strength. The&#xD;
           reproducibility of Peak Torque (PT) and Total Work (TT) will be analyzed in paralyzed&#xD;
           children aged 3 to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of isometric contraction forces of internal and external rotator muscles&#xD;
           obtained by isokinetic device in a group of POPB children.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria: patients with obstetrical brachial plexus palsy aged between 3 and 5&#xD;
           years. Investigation of a significant difference in PT and TT with respect to ER and IR&#xD;
           on the paralyzed side compared to the healthy side.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MRI analysis of muscular atrophy of the shoulders of paralyzed patients. The absence of&#xD;
           recovery induces a deformation of the known shoulder joint with criteria to quantify it,&#xD;
           but muscular amyotrophy has never been studied on the MRI of patients with brachial&#xD;
           plexus palsy. Analysis of bilateral shoulder MRI of paralyzed patients (performed at 1&#xD;
           year of age as part of systematic follow-up if no-shoulder ER): describe and quantify&#xD;
           muscle amyotrophy by measuring muscle thickness compared to healthy contralateral side.&#xD;
           Index &lt;0.5 in favor of amyotrophy, look for a positive correlation between the presence&#xD;
           of muscular atrophy and joint deformity of the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What are the predictive factors for recovery of external and internal shoulder rotators&#xD;
           of children with brachial obstetrical plexus palsy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      By correlating the results of projects 1 to 3, it would be possible to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify the favorable or unfavorable prognostic factors of shoulder recovery of&#xD;
           paralyzed children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify patients with early signs of muscle recovery that do not require muscle&#xD;
           transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: change of the therapeutic algorithm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  modification of the surgical technique according to the analysis of amyotrophy on the&#xD;
           MRI: if subscapularis amyotrophic, more extended release with section of its upper&#xD;
           fibers to mitigate its harmful effect on the development of the shoulder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  not to make unnecessary muscle transfer in patients with recovery of external rotator&#xD;
           muscles masked by subscapularis fibrosis. Transfer performed if necessary secondarily&#xD;
           according to the testing of muscular strength at the age of 3 years by isokinetic&#xD;
           device.&#xD;
