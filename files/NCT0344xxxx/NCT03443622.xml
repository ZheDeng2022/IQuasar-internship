  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study will be conducted in an open-label, conventional 3+3 dose escalation&#xD;
      design manner (for the first 28 days of dosing) followed by an extension period for subjects&#xD;
      responsive to the study drug to continue dosing up to 52 weeks. This study is intended to&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of the investigational product (IP), SC-43 Oral Solution, in&#xD;
      subjects with refractory solid tumors. Subjects who have diseases progressing unresponsive to&#xD;
      the previous treatments or who have no standard treatments for their current diseases will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study once the eligibility is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 28 days, the study will be done in the conventional 3+3 design to determine&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SC-43 Oral Solution. The dose will be increased in a&#xD;
      step-wise fashion from the initial dose of 100 mg/day to the dose of 200, 400, 600, 900, and&#xD;
      1200 mg/day. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of SC-43 will also be measured in this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of SC-43 Oral Solution will be escalated to the subsequent cohorts when there is no&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in 3 subjects or only one DLT in 6 subjects of the previous&#xD;
      cohort, and it is recommended by Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The safety results&#xD;
      will be reviewed by DSMB after the last subject in the each cohort has finished the Visit 6&#xD;
      (Day 29), and DSMB will determine if it is safe to proceed to the next dose cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have finished the 28-day dose escalation period and with complete response (CR),&#xD;
      partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) will be eligible to enter the extension period&#xD;
      and continue SC-43 Oral Solution therapy up to 52 weeks or until occurrence of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, withdrawn consent, disease progression, not receiving medical benefit as considered&#xD;
      by investigators, loss of follow-up, or death, whichever comes first. For ethical and safety&#xD;
      concerns, the dosage used in this extension period can be adjusted and different from the&#xD;
      original dosage assignment. The actual dose of SC-43 Oral Solution, which must be confirmed&#xD;
      safe, administered during this extension period will be at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SC-43, has been shown to enhance the activity of Src homology region 2 domain-containing&#xD;
      phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), leading suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation and tumor growth&#xD;
      inhibition. SC-43 enhances SHP-1 activity by impairing the association between the N-SH2&#xD;
      domain and the PTP domain of SHP-1, triggering a conformational change of SHP-1 and relieving&#xD;
      its autoinhibition. SC-43 treatment leads to cancer cell death in multiple cancer cell lines.&#xD;
      SC-43 also exhibits anti-cancer activity in a variety of nonclinical xenograft tumor models.&#xD;

    <description>SC-43 Oral Solution has drug substance of 1-[4-chloro-3(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-3-[3-(4-cyanophenoxy)] urea, or SC-43. SC-43 inhibits tumor growth through the activation of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and the repression of p-STAT3 signalings. As a result of STAT3 inhibition by SC-43 treatment, decreased cell viability and enhanced apoptosis have been observed in cancer cells. The anti-tumor activity of SC-43 was also investigated in a variety of xenograft tumor models. Administration of SC-43 provides the tumor-bearing animals survival benefits, including the reduction of tumor volume and prolonged lifespan. SC-43 has been proposed to be evaluated as an anticancer therapeutic in in subjects with refractory solid tumors in the phase I trial.</description>
