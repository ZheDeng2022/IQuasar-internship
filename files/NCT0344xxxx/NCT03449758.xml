    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>RAID was a participant reported outcome measure used to evaluate the impact of RA on participant's quality of life which comprised 7 domains: • pain, • function, • fatigue, • physical and psychological well-being, • sleep disturbance, and • coping. Each domain was a single question scored on a 0 to 10 continuous NRS. The values for each of these domains were weighed by participant assessment of relative importance and combined in a single value. Total RAID score range was 0 (not affected, very good) to 10 (most affected), where higher value indicated worse status.</description>

          <title>Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease (RAID) - Baseline Total Score</title>
          <description>RAID is a participant-reported outcome measure used to evaluate impact of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on participant's quality of life which comprised 7 domains: pain, function, fatigue, physical and psychological well-being, sleep disturbance, and coping. Each domain was a single question scored on 0 to 10 continuous numerical rating scale (NRS). Values for each of these domains were weighed by participant assessment of relative importance and combined in single value. Total RAID score range was 0 (not affected, very good) to 10 (most affected), where higher value indicated worse status.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease Total Score at Weeks 4 and 12</title>
          <description>RAID was a participant reported outcome measure used to evaluate the impact of RA on participant's quality of life which comprised 7 domains: • pain, • function, • fatigue, • physical and psychological wellbeing, • sleep disturbance, and • coping. Each domain was a single question scored on a 0 to 10 continuous NRS. The values for each of these domains were weighed by participant assessment of relative importance and combined in a single value. Total RAID score range was 0 (not affected, very good) to 10 (most affected), where higher value indicated worse status.</description>

        <title>Multidimensional Assessment of Thymic States (MAThyS) Scale Total Score at Baseline, Weeks 4, 12 and 24</title>
        <description>MAThyS was a multi-dimensional self-administered questionnaire comprised of five dimensions (emotional reactivity, cognition speed, psychomotor function, motivation and sensory perception) divided into 20 items relating to individual states as perceived by participants for the preceding week (at each specified Week). Each item was measured on a visual analog scale (VAS; in centimeters [cm]) ranged from 0 (inhibition of the state evaluated by the item) to 10 (excitation for the evaluated state). Total MAThyS score was sum of the 20 items and that might vary from score range 0 to 200 with lower scores indicated general inhibition and higher scores indicated general excitation.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on ITT population. Here, 'number analyzed' = participants with available data for each specified category.</population>

        <description>FACIT-F was a 13-item questionnaire that assess fatigue in participants under chronic illness therapy. Participants scored each item on a 5-point Likert scale ranged from 0 to 4 (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much). The scores of each item were reversed during score calculations, so that higher score values indicated more favorable conditions. Total score was the sum of score from each item and resulted in a score range from 0 to 52, with higher score indicated better participant health status (lower level of fatigue).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue Total Scores at Weeks 4, 12 and 24</title>
        <description>FACIT-F was a 13-item questionnaire that assess fatigue in participants under chronic illness therapy. Participants scored each item on a 5-point Likert scale ranged from 0 to 4 (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much). The scores of each item were reversed during score calculations, so that higher score values indicated more favorable conditions. Total score was the sum of score from each item and resulted in a score range from 0 to 52, with higher score indicated better participant health status (lower level of fatigue).</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI was a participant-oriented questionnaire developed specifically to assess the extent of a RA participant's functional ability. It consisted of at least 2 or 3 questions per category, participant reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week (at each specified visit) rated on a 4-point scale where 0 = no difficulty; 1 = some difficulty; 2 = much difficulty; 3 = unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of category scores and divided by the number of categories answered, and ranged from 0 to 3, where 0 = no disability and 3 = completely disabled, higher score indicated more disability.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in International Physical Activity Questionnaire Total Score at Weeks 4, 12 and 24</title>
        <description>IPAQ was a 27-item self-reported questionnaire designed to measure physical activity of participant. The score was reported in MET minutes per week. MET minutes represented the amount of energy expended to carry out physical activity. For IPAQ total score, the minimum value is zero and there is no maximum. Higher scores mean better levels of physical activity.</description>

        <description>DAS28-ESR was a composite score that included 4 variables: tender joint count (TJC) (based on 28 joints); swollen joint count (SJC) (based on 28 joints); participant's global assessment of health activity using 100 mm VAS: range 0 (no pain) to 100 (maximum pain imaginable); marker of inflammation assessed by ESR in mm/h. DAS28-ESR total score ranged from 0-10, higher score indicated more disease activity. The DAS28-ESR score provided a number indicating the current disease activity of the RA. A DAS28-ESR score above 5.1 indicated high disease activity, DAS28-ESR score less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3.2 indicated low disease activity (LDA), greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to &lt;=5.1 implied moderate disease activity and DAS28-ESR score below 2.6 indicated disease remission.</description>

DAS28-ESR total score ranged from 0-10, higher score indicated more disease activity. The DAS28-ESR score provided a number indicating the current disease activity of the RA. A DAS28-ESR score above 5.1 indicated high disease activity, DAS28-ESR score &lt;= 3.2 indicated LDA, &gt; 3.2 to &lt;=5.1 implied moderate disease activity and DAS28-ESR score below 2.6 indicated disease remission.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving Low Disease Activity (DAS28 ESR Score &lt;=3.2) and Remission (DAS28 ESR Score &lt;2.6) at Weeks 12, and 24</title>
        <description>DAS28-ESR was a composite score that included 4 variables: TJC (based on 28 joints); SJC (based on 28 joints); participant's global assessment of health activity using 100 mm VAS: range 0 (no pain) to 100 (maximum pain imaginable) marker of inflammation assessed by ESR in mm/h. DAS28-ESR total score ranged from 0-10, higher score indicated more disease activity. The DAS28-ESR score provided a number indicating the current disease activity of the RA. A DAS28-ESR score above 5.1 indicated high disease activity, DAS28-ESR score &lt;= 3.2 indicated LDA, &gt; 3.2 to &lt;=5.1 implied moderate disease activity and DAS28-ESR score below 2.6 indicated disease remission.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving Clinical Disease Activity Index: Low Disease Activity (CDAI Score &lt;=10.0) and Remission (CDAI Score &lt;=2.8) Weeks 12, and 24</title>
        <description>CDAI was a composite index constructed to measure clinical remission in RA that does not included a laboratory test, and is a numerical summation of 4 components: SJC (28 joints), TJC (28 joints), participant's global disease activity (in cm), and physician's global assessment (in cm). Total score ranged from 0 to 76 with a lower score indicated less disease activity. A CDAI score of &lt;=2.8 represents clinical remission and a score of &lt;=10.0 represents LDA.</description>
