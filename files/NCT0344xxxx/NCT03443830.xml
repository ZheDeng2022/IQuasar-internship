  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a new emerging arbovirus disease, caused by the same vector&#xD;
      that transmits Dengue virus, Aedes aegypti. ZIKV is a growing public health problem, rapidly&#xD;
      spreading throughout the continents since the first epidemic was reported in the French&#xD;
      Polynesian islands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are several ZIKV vaccine candidates in clinical trials. However, no ZIKV&#xD;
      therapy (biologic or small molecule) has advanced to clinical trials. Tyzivumab will be the&#xD;
      first therapeutic in the world, specifically targeting ZIKV, to enter clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, first in human, time-lagged, parallel-group, single dose ascending (6 dose&#xD;
      cohorts), Tyzivumab, ZIKV monoclonal antibody (mAb), study to be conducted in 24 flaviviral&#xD;
      naïve healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tyzivumab will be administered once through single IV infusion over 30 minutes. Total&#xD;
      duration of study participation is estimated at approximately 98 days from the date of&#xD;
      screening. Post-trial monitoring through weekly telephone calls will continue from Day 85&#xD;
      post-dose onwards for another three (3) more months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate safety of Tyzivumab in healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers through assessment of subject vital signs, clinical laboratory results, ECG,&#xD;
      presence/absence of AE/SAE, PK and ADA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose escalation in this study will include 24 healthy volunteers in six (6) dose cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0.2 mg/kg, N = 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0.5 mg/kg, N = 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 mg/kg, N = 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 mg/kg, N = 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 mg/kg, N = 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 mg/kg, N = 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 20-hour interval from the first dosing must take place before the second subject&#xD;
      can be dosed within each cohort. No such time interval will be required for dosing of&#xD;
      subsequent subjects (third subject onwards) within the same cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalations will be guided by review of clinical signs, adverse events (AEs), and&#xD;
      laboratory tests of the prior group (up to Day 7 after dosing) by a safety monitoring&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the safety and tolerability of an intravenous (IV) infusion of Tyzivumab&#xD;
      when given to healthy adult volunteers, the following vital signs and tests will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse Rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory Rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum Chemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Haematology&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess Tyzivumab pharmacokinetics (only for doses 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg &amp; 20&#xD;
      mg/kg), the following parameters will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maximum concentration (Cmax)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time to maximum concentration (Tmax)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AUC calculated from time of administration to the last measurable concentration&#xD;
           (AUC0-last)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  half-life (t1/2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  volume of distribution (Vd)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clearance [CL] in serum PK will be assessed at pre-dose, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24&#xD;
           h, 48 h, 72 h, 120 h, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, Day 56 and Day 84.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence and extent of anti-drug antibody (ADA) production in response to dosing with&#xD;
      Tyzivumab will also be assessed at pre-dose, Day 14, Day 56 and Day 84.&#xD;
