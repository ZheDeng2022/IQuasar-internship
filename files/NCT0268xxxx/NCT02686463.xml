    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to compare diagnostic and therapeutic effects of laparoscopy vs.&#xD;
      laparotomy on early malignant ovarian cancer, and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      laparoscopy in early malignant ovarian cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principle for treating early-stage ovarian cancer is first to stage the cancer, and then&#xD;
      to determine the optimal surgical and non-surgical treatments. Ovarian cancers mainly&#xD;
      metastasize as extensive diffusions on surfaces of organs in the abdominal cavity. Although&#xD;
      the most common ovarian cancer staging method is laparotomy, this procedure often misses&#xD;
      upper abdominal metastases, especially on the diaphragm muscles, thus leading to inaccurate&#xD;
      staging and prognostic assessments, and insufficient treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A laparoscopic approach allows closer observation of relevant tissues, as these tissues are&#xD;
      magnified in laparoscopies, which facilitates discovery of small lesions on surfaces of&#xD;
      diaphragmatic muscle, liver and stomach fundus. Laparoscopes allow lavage of a wider area of&#xD;
      the abdominal cavity, including hepatic flexure, splenic flexure and diaphragmatic muscle;&#xD;
      and can also improve the accuracy of peritoneal lavage examinations while avoiding blood&#xD;
      contamination. Laparoscopic surgery is also a very accurate staging procedure, with&#xD;
      potentially reduced complications, bleeding, hospitalization days and expense, and recovery&#xD;
      time compared with laparotomy-thus shortening the interval between surgery and initiation of&#xD;
      postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, although some studies have compared laparoscopy and laparotomy for ovarian cancer,&#xD;
      most are individual or small-sample case report or case-control studies. A prospective&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, open, parallel, randomized, controlled clinical trial, designed&#xD;
      to compare the advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopy and laparotomy in diagnosing and&#xD;
      treating early malignant ovarian cancer in terms of surgical safety, postoperative survival&#xD;
      rate, reoperation rate, postoperative quality of life and medical cost, to provide evidence&#xD;
      for clinical application of laparoscopic surgical staging in in diagnosing and treating early&#xD;
      malignant ovarian cancer, and to fill some gaps in the evidence for laparoscopy versus&#xD;
      laparotomy. Endoscopic surgical staging of early malignant ovarian cancer accords with the&#xD;
      trend of minimal invasion and radical treatment for tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures Laparoscopy: (1) Pneumoperitoneum will be established for laparoscopy.&#xD;
      Ascites or pelvic peritoneal lavage fluid will be used for cytologic examination. (2)&#xD;
      Unilateral or bilateral attachments will be resected, placed in specimen bags, and removed,&#xD;
      to be pathologically examined as fast-frozen samples. Alternatively, the ovarian artery and&#xD;
      vein will be ligated, and attachments on the lesion side will be resected and placed in the&#xD;
      specimen bag, which will be tied and placed at right iliac fossa. (3) The uterus will be&#xD;
      resected and removed through the vagina with the specimen bag at the right iliac fossa. (4)&#xD;
      Pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes will be resected and separately removed through the&#xD;
      vagina. (5) The greater omentum below the transverse colon will be resected and, together&#xD;
      with parietal peritoneum at the paracolic sulci and basin side, receive multiple punch&#xD;
      biopsies. (6) Removal of vermiform appendix; closure of vaginal stump by vaginal suture and&#xD;
      laparoscopic suspension; (7) wound hemostasis, irrigation, and drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparotomy: Hysterectomy + oophorotomy + high ligation of ovarian artery and vein +&#xD;
      dissection of pelvic and abdominal aortic lymph nodes + resection of greater omentum +&#xD;
      resection of vermiform appendix. Procedures are the same as with the laparoscopy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal process Criteria for withdrawal during the trial Patients may withdraw from the&#xD;
      trial (1) if the researchers consider withdrawal to be medically necessary, (2) if patients&#xD;
      ask to withdraw, or (3) if patients who have no fixed means of contact plan to move to other&#xD;
      cities during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of consent during follow-up If patients or their families do not agree to do&#xD;
      further tests during follow-up, we will not conduct further evaluation. The corresponding&#xD;
      data will not be collected, although data previously collected will be retained, and can be&#xD;
      used for analysis with informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data archiving, collection and monitoring Paper-based case report forms will be archived, and&#xD;
      their data will be converted to an electronic version by professionals using a double-data&#xD;
      entry strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure the safety of the patient and the integrity of the clinical data, correct informed&#xD;
      consent procedures and assessment of primary end points and compliance will be monitored by&#xD;
      professional inspectors. Inspectors have the right to query key documents. Besides site&#xD;
      visits, inspectors and the test center will keep in touch through email and phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Security of patients' data Each patient will be encoded separately during the trial. Case&#xD;
      report forms will be saved in accordance with local data protection laws. These data will be&#xD;
      strictly confidential. During clinical interviews, clinical research associates will examine&#xD;
      patient-related data to ensure its correctness and completeness, and its preservation in&#xD;
      accord with legal requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed using Statistical Product and&#xD;
      Service Solutions(SPSS) 18.0 software, with normally distributed variables expressed as mean&#xD;
      Â± standard deviation; abnormally distributed variables as median and interquartile range; and&#xD;
      categorical variables expressed as number and percentage. Continuous variables will be&#xD;
      compared among groups using Student's t-test. Abnormally distributed data will be compared&#xD;
      among groups using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables will be compared&#xD;
      among groups using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Repeated measure analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA) will be performed for the different time point assessments between groups. P&#xD;
      &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact and communication Our communication strategy mainly involves patients enrolled in&#xD;
      trials, who can consult with doctors, family members or friends to decide whether to&#xD;
      participate in the trial.&#xD;
