  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess whether an auto-titrating oxygen system can maintain&#xD;
      constant oxygen saturations (SpO2) in patients who are on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT)&#xD;
      during activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently LTOT is provided at a constant fixed-flow rate e.g. 2 litres per minute all the&#xD;
      time after appropriate assessment. The flow rate is not changed during usual household&#xD;
      activities but is increased for walking. A number of studies have investigated the SpO2 of&#xD;
      patients on LTOT during the daytime in patients' homes. The results have shown that patients'&#xD;
      SpO2 decreases intermittently whilst they are doing activities of daily living such as&#xD;
      watching television, putting away the shopping, having a shower or bath and dressing and&#xD;
      undressing. This is a problem as it can lead to breathlessness, increased stress on the heart&#xD;
      and affect brain function. In order to correct the drop in SpO2 that patients experience&#xD;
      during everyday activities, the investigators have developed an oxygen system, which can&#xD;
      automatically change the amount of oxygen delivered depending on a patients' oxygen&#xD;
      saturations - an auto-titrating oxygen system. In this study, patients on LTOT will be asked&#xD;
      to simulate a series of activities of daily living twice: once whilst on their usual&#xD;
      fixed-flow oxygen therapy and once on the auto-titrating oxygen system. The activities will&#xD;
      be carried out in a hospital setting. During the activities, SpO2 will be recorded&#xD;
      continuously. The main outcome of interest from the study will be the SpO2 throughout the&#xD;
      study on fixed-flow oxygen and the auto-titrating oxygen system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is prescribed for patients with stable severe hypoxemic&#xD;
      respiratory failure according to specific criteria set out in different guidelines from&#xD;
      international respiratory societies. The aim of LTOT is to maintain the resting partial&#xD;
      pressure of oxygen (PO2) &gt;60 mmHg or oxygen saturation (SpO2) &gt;90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have demonstrated that whilst at home, patients on LTOT experience&#xD;
      episodes of intermittent hypoxia (SpO2 &lt;90%) and spend significant amounts of time with SpO2&#xD;
      &lt;90%. These episodes of desaturation occur most frequently during activities of daily living&#xD;
      and may be harmful as they could lead to pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias and ischaemic&#xD;
      heart disease. Simply increasing the LTOT flow rate by 1 or 2 litres in one option but this&#xD;
      exposed the patients to hyperoxaemia and the risk of hypercapnia. An another method&#xD;
      optimising LTOT is to utilise an auto-titrating oxygen system. These system allow close&#xD;
      control of SpO2 by automatically adjusting the flow of oxygen to match a target SpO2. At the&#xD;
      Royal Brompton Hospital and Imperial College London, the investigators have developed our own&#xD;
      auto-titrating oxygen system - called intelligent oxygen therapy (iO2t).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This system has been tested in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and&#xD;
      LTOT during a 6 minute walk test with promising results (ERS 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether the intelligent oxygen therapy system can&#xD;
      reduce intermittent hypoxia in patients on LTOT during simulated activities of daily living.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to a series of activities of daily living over a period of 1 hour&#xD;
      including: washing, dressing, putting away shopping and cleaning. The patients will do these&#xD;
      activities twice: once on their usual LTOT and once on the auto-titrating oxygen system in a&#xD;
      cross-over design.&#xD;
