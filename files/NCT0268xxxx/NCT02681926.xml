  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is the cornerstone of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. A&#xD;
      novel technology was recently developed to allow an automatic points annotation when indirect&#xD;
      parameters of lesion formation reach predefined target values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to evaluate, in a prospective and multicenter study, the safety,&#xD;
      efficiency and PVI effectiveness of a new ablation tracking tool (VISITAG; Biosense Webster)&#xD;
      during paroxysmal AF ablation using a contact force sensing catheter.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter ablation is an effective treatment for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and&#xD;
      pulmonary vein isolation is the most prevalent approach for catheter ablation of this kind of&#xD;
      arrhythmia. Long-term success of the procedure is diminished by arrhythmia recurrences&#xD;
      occurring predominantly because of reconnections in previously isolated pulmonary veins. The&#xD;
      durability of pulmonary vein isolation is the cornerstone of the ablation and is influenced&#xD;
      by transmurality and continuity of lesions. Limited animal and human studies suggest a&#xD;
      correlation between electrode-tissue contact and radiofrequency lesion generation.&#xD;
      Particularly, some contact forces (CFs) parameter (minimum contact force and minimum force&#xD;
      time integral values) were strong predictors of gap formation in small studies . High contact&#xD;
      force during ablation was also associated with the incidence of steam pop and with the&#xD;
      subsequent risk of cardiac tamponade. A recent multicenter trial demonstrated that the&#xD;
      irrigated CF-sensing catheter is safe and effective for the treatment of drug refractory&#xD;
      symptomatic PAF, with no unanticipated device-related adverse events. The increased percent&#xD;
      of time within investigator-targeted CF ranges correlated with increased freedom from&#xD;
      arrhythmia recurrence. Stable CF during radiofrequency application increased the likelihood&#xD;
      of 12-month success. Real-time measurement of contact force (CF) during catheter ablation of&#xD;
      PAF has been recently confirmed to potentially impact procedural outcome, while in another&#xD;
      small study, whatever CF visualization could assist operators in avoiding both low and high&#xD;
      CF, CF-guided ablation did not affect AF recurrence. A recent tool, called VISITAG, has been&#xD;
      developed (and approved by EMEA) for Biosense Webster Navistar Smart Touch catheter in order&#xD;
      to allow collection of ablation points with pre-determined characteristics, such as stability&#xD;
      of catheter during ablation, mean contact force, drop in impedance. The aim of this tool is&#xD;
      to improve success rate of the procedure, reducing site of reconnections with a better&#xD;
      understanding of lesion formation point by point, and in parallel to reduce complications,&#xD;
      avoiding to give unnecessary ablation shots in sites already treated with a good set of&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a strategy using a new&#xD;
      ablation tracking tool (VISITAG; Biosense Webster) during PAF ablation with contact force&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;

      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be performed using clinical visit with ECG, 12 hours ECG monitoring , loop&#xD;
      recorder analysis or telephonic contact, following the centre strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who are successfully registered will be included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculations and Assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being this an observational registry aiming at quantifying effect estimates without direct&#xD;
      comparisons to literature benchmarks, the investigators relied on confidence interval&#xD;
      profiling for sample size justification, without proceeding with formal power analysis. As&#xD;
      the main analysis is a pooled analysis of patients with atrial fibrillation ablation, an&#xD;
      overall and comprehensive analysis is planned as the primary analytical approach.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the investigators computed that a target sample of 209 patients will enable the&#xD;
      computation of reasonably precise 95% confidence intervals. Specifically, assuming a 12-month&#xD;
      freedom from 72.5% AF/atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia recurrence at 1 year (in keeping with&#xD;
      results of SMART-AF trial), confidence intervals computed with the adjusted Wald method would&#xD;
      be 60% to 85% for a 209-patient sample (point estimate 151/209 [72.5%]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous endpoints will be summarized by presenting the total number of patients, mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Tabulation of categorical parameters will&#xD;
      include counts and percentages. The outcomes will be summarized as both a discrete and a&#xD;
      continuous variable using the method described above. Survival analysis (freedom from&#xD;
      arrhythmia) will be performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical inference will be&#xD;
      based on the computation of 95% confidence intervals using the adjusted Wald method.&#xD;
      Additional analyses will involve key subgroups defined according to baseline, lesion, and&#xD;
      procedural features, with statistical significance set at the 5% 2-tailed level.&#xD;
      Specifically, Student t, Fisher exact, and log-rank tests will be used for such bivariate&#xD;
      analyses, whereas multivariable linear regression, logistic regression, and Cox proportional&#xD;
      hazard analyses will be used to adjust for confounders.&#xD;
