      Phase Ib/II study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of PM01183 in combination with&#xD;
      olaparib in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be split into 2 parts: an open label Phase I dose escalation part followed by&#xD;
      a non-randomized Phase II part, as an expansion study, in patients with selected tumors at&#xD;
      the recommended doses and schedule determined in the phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: A dose escalation study will be performed in patients with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      solid tumors without established standard therapeutic alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: An expansion dose study selecting patients with potential tumors with possibly&#xD;
      sensitivity to PARP inhibitors according to histology, including triple negative breast&#xD;
      cancer, high grade serous platinum-resistant ovarian and endometrial cancer patients, or&#xD;
      patients with molecular features such as endometrial cancer with PTEN loss, breast or ovarian&#xD;
      cancer with PTEN loss, known BRCA1/2 germline, somatic mutation or somatic methylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib: To establish the safety [dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and recommended Phase II doses (RP2D)], of orally administered olaparib in combination with&#xD;
      PM01183 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors without established standard&#xD;
      therapeutic alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: To assess the efficacy in terms of Tumor response rate according to RECIST v1.1&#xD;
      criteria of PM01183 in combination with olaparib in the selected populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the pharmacokinetics of PM01183 and olaparib when administered in combination. To&#xD;
      determine the effects of the study treatment on the level of PARP activity and&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA damage in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulating tumor cells (CTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsy samples. To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity (overall response&#xD;
           rate) by RECIST of the combination in the exposed population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression free survival. Overall Survival. Toxicity profile of the combination in patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. To explore the possible correlation between the expression of certain&#xD;
      biomarkers and the efficacy of this therapeutic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Sample size. Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 18-48 patients are expected to participate in the Phase Ib part of the study. The&#xD;
      number of patients may vary depending upon the tolerability of the combination and the number&#xD;
      of dose levels required to identify the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total accrual up to 73 subjects would be required, according to an MinMax two-stages Simon&#xD;
      design. With an α-error 0.05 and a power 90%, RR with a poor scenario according previous one&#xD;
      would be 24%, and in a favourable scenario RR would reach 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression-free survival according to previous reported is 3.5 months and the objective for&#xD;
      the study is 6.5 months (n=56). According to this objective, the maximum sample size is 73&#xD;
      patients, and first sample size is 61 patients (upper limit for first stage rejection: 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two stages are established:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the first step 61 evaluable patients will be included in the study. If 18 or fewer&#xD;
           responses are observed, the study will be stopped due to an inadequate response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Efficacy data for the patients included at this first step will be reviewed by an&#xD;
           independent assessment committee (IAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If 19 or more responses are observed recruitment will continue until the group has 73&#xD;
           evaluable patients. If 23 or fewer responses are detected among these 73 patients, it&#xD;
           will be concluded that the regimen is not sufficiently active to warrant further&#xD;
           testing. If 24 or more responses are observed it will be concluded that the regimen is&#xD;
           sufficiently active to warrant further testing in posterior Phase III.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are&#xD;
        fulfilled:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous enrolment or randomization in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Simultaneous participation in any other study involving an investigational medicinal&#xD;
             product, or having participated in a study less than 28 days prior to the start of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients included in the phase I of the study, previous treatment with olaparib or&#xD;
             PM01183. For patients included in the phase II of the study, any previous treatment&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except for palliative&#xD;
             reasons), within 2 weeks from the last dose prior to study treatment (or a longer&#xD;

             study as long as these were started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment with study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Olaparib and PM01183 are metabolized mainly by CYP3A4. Therefore, concomitant use of&#xD;

             family history of long QT syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. A scan to confirm the absence&#xD;
             of brain metastases is not required. The patient can receive a stable dose of&#xD;
             corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were started at least 28&#xD;
             days prior to treatment.&#xD;

             uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             unstable spinal cord compression (untreated and unstable for at least 28 days prior to&#xD;
             study entry), superior vena cava syndrome, extensive bilateral lung disease on HRCT&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known active hepatic disease (i.e., Hepatitis B or C) due to risk of&#xD;
             transmitting the infection through blood or other body fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who present any contraindication or suspected allergy to the products (or any&#xD;
