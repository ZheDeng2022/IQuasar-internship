    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a common, expensive, frequently fatal and highly complex inflammatory syndrome&#xD;
      wherein multiple cellular and humoral pathways are involved. Since it's a multifactorial&#xD;
      syndrome merely blocking one of the various inflammatory pathways may not suffice to provide&#xD;
      effective treatment and this may partly explain why most of the adjunctive therapies&#xD;
      developed for severe sepsis have yielded disappointing results in rigorous clinical trials.&#xD;
      Statins have varied pleiotropic effects on the inflammatory mediators and there addition to&#xD;
      the current adjuvant therapies in septic shock may help in reduction of mortality. The&#xD;
      present trial aims to study survival benefit and changes in bio-marker levels in septic&#xD;
      shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients (&gt;=18 years) in septic shock and admitted to ICU will be included in the&#xD;
      study. Patients will be randomized as per computer generated random number into the Drug&#xD;
      (Atorvastatin, 40 mg) or matched placebo group. Drug or placebo will be given to selected&#xD;
      patient via nasogastric tube for 7 days. Bio markers (Il-6, TNF-alpha) estimated during the&#xD;
      trial week (Days 1, 4, and 7). All clinical and study personnel and patients remained blinded&#xD;
      to the study group assignment throughout the trial.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study impact of statins on levels of biomarkers (IL-6 and TNF-α) of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study survival benefit of statins in septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in non-coronary ICUs. Mortality associated with&#xD;
      sepsis is still considerably high. Rising economic burden of managing sepsis is a major&#xD;
      concern. Statin is an anti-hyperlipidemic drug with pleiotropic effects. It has properties&#xD;
      like anti-inflammatory/oxidative, immunomodulatory effects, enhances endothelial function,&#xD;
      reduction in blood thrombogenicity, and increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability.&#xD;
      Available evidence suggests that statins may play a positive role in reduction of mortality&#xD;
      in sepsis. However, the multidimensional heterogeneous character of the available studies&#xD;
      does not allow drawing firm conclusions about its usefulness in sepsis and septic shock. This&#xD;
      randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial is an attempt to study the impact of&#xD;
      statins on mortality and biomarker levels in septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &gt;= age 18 yrs meeting the American European consensus conference definition of&#xD;
      septic shock will be enrolled into the study. After the written informed consent from the&#xD;
      primary decision maker the patients will be randomized into either the drug or placebo group.&#xD;
      Each group will either receive Atorvastatin 40mg or a matched placebo for 7 days. IL-6 and&#xD;
      TNF alpha levels will be estimated on D1, D4 and D7 of the trial week. Relevant clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory (clinical biochemistry, hematological, coagulation parameters, LFT and renal&#xD;
      function tests) will be recorded simultaneously. Severity scores, event free days&#xD;
      (vasopressor, ventilation, dialysis, transfusion, parenteral nutrition), and mortality after&#xD;
      28 days of inclusion in study will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be taken from either the patient (if possible) or from the&#xD;
      primary decision maker related to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 patients of septic shock admitted in ICU will be enrolled into this study.&#xD;
      Patients either admitted with septic shock or who develop septic shock during their stay in&#xD;
      ICU will be eligible for inclusion into the study. The statin and placebo group will have 40&#xD;
      patients each.&#xD;
