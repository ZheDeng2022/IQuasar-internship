      This observational study aims to develop and validate quantitative magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      biomarkers as measures of disease activity in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). This&#xD;
      includes patients with enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This body of research will comprise a number of sub-studies, each designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      use of quantitative MRI in JIA. Although patients will receive treatment during the study,&#xD;
      this will form part of their routine clinical care and therefore this study is best regarded&#xD;
      as observational.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects and recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be recruited by clinical rheumatologists working in a specialist&#xD;
           adolescent and young adult inflammatory arthritis tertiary referral centre, on a&#xD;
           person-to-person basis. Patients will be aged 12-24 and have a diagnosis of JIA&#xD;
           according to established clinical criteria.8,9 Individuals with enthesitis-related&#xD;
           arthropathy and those with other forms of JIA (extended oligorticular and polyarthritis&#xD;
           (rheumatoid factor positive and negative)) will be divided into separate groups and&#xD;
           asked to have an MRI scan. Control subjects will be recruited from the same clinic, and&#xD;
           will consist of individuals with mechanical back pain (non-inflammatory - thought to&#xD;
           arise from vertebrae, discs or ligaments) and normal inflammatory markers. Such patients&#xD;
           still require an MRI scan as part of their routine care to confirm the mechanical cause&#xD;
           for their back pain and definitively rule out inflammation as a cause, but serve as&#xD;
           non-inflammatory controls. All patients will be asked to provide written consent at the&#xD;
           time of enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will include both patients with a new diagnosis of JIA and those with&#xD;
           established disease who are already on treatment. For obvious ethical reasons, patients&#xD;
           will not be divided into different treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be divided according to diagnostic group - group A will consist of&#xD;
           patients with ERA (and also controls who are subsequently diagnosed with mechanical back&#xD;
           pain), while group B will consist of patients with ERA, extended oligo- and&#xD;
           polyarthritis. As detailed below, the scan protocol will be different for these two&#xD;
           groups. JIA patients in both groups will be scanned at enrolment and will have repeat&#xD;
           scans every 6-12 months, depending on clinical need, for up to five years in total.&#xD;
           Thereafter, scans will be performed as defined by the requirements of their clinical&#xD;
           care up to year 10 of study. The control group in group A will only be scanned once.&#xD;
           They will be asked to provide written consent prior to enrolling. The imaging component&#xD;
           of the study will run for up to five years in total, and approximately 200 patients will&#xD;
           be recruited in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In group A, DWI and FF measurements will be performed in the SIJs. These measurements&#xD;
           will be correlated (see statistics, below) with conventional scores of inflammation so&#xD;
           that DWI and FF can be validated as biomarkers of inflammation in the SIJ (see below for&#xD;
           more detail on these techniques).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In group B, whole body MRI scans will be performed with a view to developing a&#xD;
           quantitative score of inflammation in the whole body. This score will be validated by&#xD;
           correlation with validated clinical measures of disease activity such as physician&#xD;
           global assessment of disease activity, juvenile arthritis disease activity score&#xD;
           (JADAS), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ - measure of function) and and biochemical&#xD;
           (blood) markers of inflammation (see below for further detail).&#xD;
&#xD;
           This technique will be piloted in approximately 10 patients with JIA (ERA, extended&#xD;
           oligo and polyarthritis) over the course of 1-3 months before beginning full-scale&#xD;
           recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Scan Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
           The scan protocol will be tailored according to diagnostic group. Group A (ERA)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  T1-weighted axial and coronal pelvis, sagittal spine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post-contrast T1 axial and coronal pelvis, sagittal spine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  STIR, axial and coronal pelvis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diffusion-weighted images (b values 0, 50, 100, 300 and 600) of the pelvis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mDixon images (in and out of phase images will be acquired and used to generate fat&#xD;
                only and water only images; protocol design as per Dr Alan Bainbridge)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group B (oligoarthritis and polyarthritis) patients will undergo whole-body MRI&#xD;
           including the following sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mDixon&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mDixon with contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diffusion weighted imaging The protocol will requires some technical development&#xD;
                and optimisation at the start of the study. This will be undertaken in&#xD;
                collaboration with Dr Alan Bainbridge. 2-3 b values (e.g. 50, 100, 300) will be&#xD;
                used for the DWI sequences. Anatomical stations will include feet, knees,&#xD;
                hips/pelvis and spine (TMJ to pelvis); the shaft of the femur and tibia will be&#xD;
                omitted. Image quality is likely to be poor in the arms so these may not be imaged&#xD;
                using dedicated sequences. STIR (short tau inversion recovery) methods will be used&#xD;
                for fat suppression in the feet, knees and hips.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Group A (ERA) - Development of Scoring Systems&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. DWI DWI is already in use as a clinical scan in the ERA cohort. We aim to validate&#xD;
           the use of ADC measurements as a quantitative biomarker in the ERA cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps will be generated with vendor software using a&#xD;
           monoexponential fit. ADC maps will be analysed using a linear region-of-interest (ROI)&#xD;
           technique, as previously described.10 Two or three ROIs are drawn across both joints on&#xD;
           each image slice. Each ROI measuring 14-16mm in length, but is subsequently 'cut' to a&#xD;
           standard 14mm length using dedicated Matlab software. This procedure is repeated on the&#xD;
           central four axial slices (each of which measures 8mm in thickness). A further ROI will&#xD;
           be drawn on normal sacral bone to use as a reference. Normalised ADC values (nADC) will&#xD;
           be calculated for each ROI as the mean ADC divided by the mean reference ADC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, the images will be analysed using histographic analysis of joint ADC values&#xD;
           (using 'area' ROIs). Analysis will include thresholding methods and measurement of&#xD;
           skew/kurtosis in inflamed compared to normal joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is hypothesised that there will be a significant, positive correlation between ADC&#xD;
           and conventional STIR scores of inflammation (as shown by pilot data).11 The study will&#xD;
           assess the correlation between the various ADC scores and the STIR score in order to&#xD;
           determine which correlates most closely.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Fat fraction FF measurements are a novel approach to quantifying inflammation; our&#xD;
           aim is to develop and ultimately validate FF as a biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inflamed joints will be analysed using region-of-interest (ROI) analysis on mDixon&#xD;
           images, to determine the fat fraction (FF) in inflamed bone compared to normal bone.&#xD;
           Polygonal ROIs will be hand-drawn across large joints in a standardized fashion. The&#xD;
           pixel values derived from these ROIs will be analysed using multiple methods, including&#xD;
           simple averaging and histographic analysis. Again, thresholding methods and analysis of&#xD;
           skew/kurtosis will be explored as methods of assessing inflamed compared to normal&#xD;
           joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is hypothesized that fat fraction will be decrease in inflamed bone compared to&#xD;
           normal bone, due to infiltration by inflammatory cells and increased extracellular&#xD;
           water.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii. Contrast uptake Post-contrast and perfusion images are already in clinical use in&#xD;
           ERA. In this study, post-contrast mDixon images will be developed and validated.&#xD;
           Patients will be injected with intravenous contrast and scanned after a fixed delay.&#xD;
           Inflamed joints will be analysed on post-contrast images, which will be compared with&#xD;
           pre-contrast images to determine contrast uptake. Inflamed joints will again be analysed&#xD;
           using region-of-interest (ROI) analysis. Again, quantitative scores will be correlated&#xD;
           with clinical data and STIR scores for biological validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Group B (ERA, extended oligoarticular and polyarthritis) - Whole Body Scoring&#xD;
&#xD;
           Whole-body images will be scored using a selection of methods, and each will be&#xD;
           validated against conventional measures to determine the optimal approach. Techniques&#xD;
           will include a qualitative 'joint count' and also quantitative analysis of affected&#xD;
           joints using histographic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Clinical Data Clinical data will be collected as part of routine care, in conjunction&#xD;
           with specialist adolescent and young adult rheumatologists in the Arthritis UK Centre&#xD;
           for Adolescent Rheumatology at UCLH. Validated clinical measures of disease activity&#xD;
           will be documented at each clinic visit such as physician global assessment of disease&#xD;
           activity, juvenile arthritis disease activity score (JADAS), Health Assessment&#xD;
           Questionnaire (HAQ - measure of function), biochemical (blood) markers of inflammation&#xD;
           such as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and for ERA validated&#xD;
           measure of disease activity for spondyloarthritis will be collected (Bath Ankylosing&#xD;
           Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional&#xD;
           Index (BASFI) and Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (ASDAS). All of the&#xD;
           above measures are collected as part of routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients' medication use will be documented at each clinic attendance again as part of&#xD;
           routine care. This data will also be analysed as part of the study so that clinical&#xD;
           measures of disease activity before and after treatment can then be correlated to&#xD;
           radiological measures of inflammation (e.g. apparent diffusion coefficient and fat&#xD;
           fraction) over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical data will be stored on an electronic medical record (as for routine data&#xD;
           collection at UCLH). For analysis, the data will be downloaded onto secure hospital or&#xD;
           university computers in encrypted form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical approaches have been chosen to biologically validate these quantitative markers&#xD;
      of inflammation (ADC, fat fraction and contrast uptake) in JIA. Analyses will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of correlation between clinical scores listed above to radiological measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of ADC, FF and contrast uptake in affected joints compared to normal joints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of ADC, FF and contrast uptake in affected joints before treatment compared&#xD;
           to after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients will undergo serial scans during treatment. The study aims to determine&#xD;
      whether ADC, fat fraction and measures of contrast uptake correlate with other measures of&#xD;
      disease response (including clinical and biochemical measurements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses have been chosen in collaboration with a university statistician from&#xD;
      the Cancer Trials Centre (Dr Andre Lopes). Correlation analyses for Group A will be performed&#xD;
      using Pearson product-moment correlation. In Group B, a mixed regression model will be used&#xD;
      to evaluate the association between whole body inflammation scores and clinical scores.&#xD;
      Intra- and inter-observer variability will be calculated for each parameter (in both groups)&#xD;
      using interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis and Bland-Altman plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations have also been performed in collaboration with Dr Andre Lopes. It is&#xD;
      expected that approximately 100 patients will be recruited for both groups A and B, which&#xD;
      will provide sufficient statistical power. nquery advisor was used to calculate the sample&#xD;
      size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group A, our assumptions are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-sided alpha 5%, power at 80%, null correlation of 0.50 and alternative correlation of 0.70&#xD;
      This suggests a required sample size of 65 patients. A sample size of 88 patients will&#xD;
      provide a power of 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group B, as pilot data are not available, a comparable effect size and therefore sample&#xD;
      size has been assumed (approximately 100 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Long term goals (beyond the scope of this study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The study aims to determine whether measures of inflammation have an impact on clinical&#xD;
           management. This could be achieved by comparing treatment decisions made by clinicians&#xD;
           when ADC, FF and contrast uptake information is available compared to when it is not in&#xD;
           a 'virtual clinic'. Whether the scans are available will be determined at random (NB: As&#xD;
           this this in a virtual clinic environment it will have no impact on patients' actual&#xD;
           management). WB-MRI may be of particular value in this regard, as it has the potential&#xD;
           to reveal inflammation in joints which the patient or clinician is not aware of.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A further, long term goal is to determine whether inflammatory burden correlates with&#xD;
           health outcomes. If patients with greater inflammatory burden have poorer long term&#xD;
           outcome, this will be an argument for earlier, more aggressive biologic therapy in these&#xD;
           patients. Data will also be collected beyond five years (up to ten years) allowing the&#xD;
           prospective identification of radiological predictors of poor outcomes in adults with&#xD;
           JIA from analysing scan data in their adolescents years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Introduction into Clinical Practice If quantitative measures of inflammation are shown&#xD;
           to significantly change clinical practice, these scanning techniques will introduced&#xD;
           into routine clinical care. These techniques also have the potential to be useful in&#xD;
           other inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis in adults.&#xD;

        Participants with JIA will have a definitive clinical diagnosis of JIA according to&#xD;
        established clinical criteria.9 Patients will be divided according to subtype - patients&#xD;
        with ERA will be recruited into groups A (DWI and FF) and / or Group B (WB MRI) along with&#xD;
        the polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis groups. Once the WB MRI protocol is defined,&#xD;
        for ERA patients recruited to both arms of the study the intention is to combine the DWI&#xD;
        and WB MRI scan together to limit participation to 6 months scans only for this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additionally, patients who are being investigated for possible JIA/ERA will be asked to&#xD;
        participate in this study. Those patients who are subsequently diagnosed with JIA/ERA will&#xD;
        be included in the study as described above. Those patients who are diagnosed with&#xD;
        mechanical back pain will be treated as controls, and will not be imaged again after this&#xD;
        point.&#xD;
