  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study in which patients with a history of habitual snoring will use&#xD;
      the low-pressure CPAP device at home for about 4 weeks. This study is designed to document&#xD;
      the adherence of the snorer, the acceptance and comfort of the therapy, and bed partners'&#xD;
      subjective report of improvement in sleep quality, and/or reduction or elimination of&#xD;
      snoring. Study outcomes will consist of an assessment of the nightly usage time, and&#xD;
      questionnaires that the snorer and the bed-partner have to complete before the start of the&#xD;
      study and at the end of the study period.&#xD;

      This is an interventional study in which patients with a history of habitual snoring use the&#xD;
      Cloud9™ Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) device that delivers a low level of&#xD;
      continuous nasal air pressure between 2 cm H2O and 4 cm H2O, for about four weeks at their&#xD;
      home. This study is designed to document the adherence of the snorer, the acceptance and&#xD;
      comfort of the therapy, and bed partners' subjective report of improvement in sleep quality,&#xD;
      and/or reduction or elimination of snoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment: The study begins with a baseline assessment to determine whether each&#xD;
      participant meets the entry criteria for the study. After consent, participant snorers will&#xD;
      have a history and physical exam to confirm entry criteria and answer questionnaires: Epworth&#xD;
      Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Snore Outcomes Survey (SOS),&#xD;
      and Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) to assess their sleepiness and snoring. In a second step,&#xD;
      snoring participants who initially meet the entry criteria will receive a full night Home&#xD;
      Sleep Test (HST) to confirm snoring and to rule out sleep apnea or any other sleep related&#xD;
      disorder. Participants who already performed a full night polysomnography (PSG) as a part of&#xD;
      the earlier sleep lab study for the Cloud9 device (Treatment of Snoring NA_00073250) do not&#xD;
      have to be re-screened, if the earlier PSG is not older than 36 months, and the participant's&#xD;
      BMI remains within 3 kg/m2 of its original value. In parallel, the snorer's bed-partner will&#xD;
      be asked to complete baseline questionnaires: ESS, PSQI, Spouse/Bed-partner Survey (SBPS),&#xD;
      and supplement, SSS, and snore assessment according to Visual Analog Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Week: Snorers and bed-partners will be asked to wear Actigraphy watches for&#xD;
      approximately one-week prior to the initiation of treatment at home with the study device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home-Trial: At the end of the baseline week, snoring participants will be asked to use the&#xD;
      device at home for 4 weeks. Usage data will be recorded by a power logger and read when&#xD;
      returned to the study site at the end of study. Snoring participants will receive a study&#xD;
      coordinator call on the day after night 1 of the home trial. Additionally, snoring&#xD;
      participants will receive a coordinator call weekly thereafter, to assess the user experience&#xD;
      with the device. Snorers and bed-partners will continue to wear Actigraphy monitors&#xD;
      throughout the home-trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Visit: At the end of the 4 weeks of home use, participants will return all study&#xD;
      equipment to the sleep lab. Usage data from the data logger will be read for compliance&#xD;
      rates. Snoring participants and their bed partners will also complete a final set of&#xD;
      questionnaires as before (ESS, PSQI, SOS, SBPS and supplement. Bed partners will rate snoring&#xD;
      using VAS. Snorers will also be asked to complete a Comfort and Acceptability Survey and the&#xD;
      Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI) Treatment related questions.&#xD;
