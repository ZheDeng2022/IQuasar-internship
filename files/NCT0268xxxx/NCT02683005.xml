  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (LDV/SOF) are new directly acting antiviral drugs for the treatment&#xD;
      of hepatitis C (HCV) that are highly effective, orally administered, well tolerated and&#xD;
      preclinical evaluations in animal models indicate safe administration during pregnancy. This&#xD;
      project will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of antenatal LDV/SOF treatment for 12&#xD;
      weeks during the second and third trimester. If proven to be effective, antenatal treatment&#xD;
      of HCV with LDV/SOF will prevent maternal HCV-related liver disease, perinatal transmission&#xD;
      of HCV, and community transmission of HCV.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 3.2 million persons in the United States chronically infected with hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus (HCV) with a 1-2.4% prevalence during pregnancy. The recent October 2014 approval of&#xD;
      the fixed dose combination, containing the NS5B polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (SOF) 90 mg&#xD;
      and the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir (LDV) 400mg, marked a new era of IFN and ribavirin free,&#xD;
      directly acting antiviral treatment for HCV. A 12 week treatment course of LDV/SOF resulted&#xD;
      in a 99% cure rate when given as a once-a-day oral pill. Based on the animal model data&#xD;
      submitted to the FDA, this drug combination was given a pregnancy category B designation,&#xD;
      even though there is currently no experience with LDV/SOF in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy is a time when women are uniquely motivated to engage in activities which are&#xD;
      geared toward improvement of their own health and ensuring the health of their unborn child.&#xD;
      As such, pregnant women have frequent prenatal care visits; and health care interventions,&#xD;
      such as antiviral therapy and monitoring, can be easily integrated into the existing&#xD;
      healthcare infrastructure of prenatal care. The benefits of HCV treatment are numerous,&#xD;
      including prevention of severe liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver&#xD;
      transplantation, as well as improvements physical, emotional and social health. The most&#xD;
      recent guidelines by the Infectious Disease Society of America recommend that all&#xD;
      HCV-infected persons receive treatment. The antenatal period represents an ideal window of&#xD;
      opportunity for treatment of HCV in pregnancy due to increased antenatal health care&#xD;
      utilization and prevention of perinatal transmission of HCV to the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safe administration of drugs in pregnancy may require dose adjustment due to the&#xD;
      pregnancy-induced physiologic alternations. Therefore, careful pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      evaluation is a critical first step to ensure safe administration of drugs to both the mother&#xD;
      and the developing fetus. This is a single-arm, single-center, open label Phase 1 evaluation&#xD;
      of the PK and safety of treating HCV with a 12 week course of LDV/SOF in 15 HCV-infected&#xD;
      pregnant women. Therapy will be initiated at approximately 24 weeks of gestation. In this&#xD;
      study we will determine: 1) if the PK of the LDV and SOF are similar in pregnancy as compared&#xD;
      to those in nonpregnant women, 2) if the viral response to LDV/SOF treatment in pregnancy is&#xD;
      similar to that observed in nonpregnant women, and 3) if there are any initial maternal or&#xD;
      neonatal safety concerns detected with antenatal LDV/SOF administration compared with&#xD;
      HCV-infected historical controls delivered at our institution. From the findings of this&#xD;
      study, future studies will seek to optimize the dose, gestational age timing and treatment&#xD;
      duration of LDV/SOF during pregnancy. Antenatal HCV treatment will improve maternal health,&#xD;
      prevent further HCV transmission in the community and perinatal HCV transmission to the&#xD;
      child, and thus enhance the long-term health of two generations.&#xD;
