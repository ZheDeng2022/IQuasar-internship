      A Randomized controlled Clinical trial which aim is to investigate the clinical outcome of&#xD;
      dental implants in titanium-zirconium alloy compared to traditional titan-4 implants. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is set to no difference in the clinical outcome for the two types of implants.&#xD;
      Preliminary estimation of 96 patients needed. A pilot study will provide us with further data&#xD;
      in order to more accurately specify the sample number.&quot;&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implants have been used for the purpose of replacing lost teeth since the 1960s. Since then,&#xD;
      the treatment of edentulism with dental implants has been implemented in a large scale. The&#xD;
      main reason for this is that research has shown that treatment with implants are very&#xD;
      predictable in terms of implant survival. The accumulated knowledge, as seen from 15 and 20&#xD;
      year follow-ups, has been based on prerequisites that are not always followed today. One of&#xD;
      them is that the implants used in the aforementioned studies are manufactured in titanium&#xD;
      that has good rigidity and is used as the main implant material today. In addition, the&#xD;
      studies have examined implants with a turned surface. This standard revised in the mid 1990s&#xD;
      when a series of studies showed increased and accelerated osseous ingrowth of implants with a&#xD;
      moderate raw surface that had been achieved by blasting. The related biological events&#xD;
      describing this process have been described in detail in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, other materials are being explored as an alternative to the well documented implant&#xD;
      material titanium with a focus on finding a material with higher stiffness combined with&#xD;
      equivalent biological characteristics. A stiffer material theoretically gives possibilities&#xD;
      for implants installations without bone augmentation in cases with reduced bone volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative implant material which has reached the clinic is titanium-zirconium alloy. It&#xD;
      has been shown to have an increased rigidity in comparison with titanium and comparable&#xD;
      biological characteristics but the documentation consists mainly of animal studies and short&#xD;
      term clinical follow-up in the form of case-series. Since it has been demonstrated that the&#xD;
      choice of implant material may influence osseointegration, it is necessary to evaluate the&#xD;
      implants made of titanium-zirconium in a clinical controlled study with long-term follow-up&#xD;
      in which the emphasis is put on the clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the clinical outcome of implants made of&#xD;
      titanium-zirconium with a proven implants made of titanium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific question in this project is if there are differences in the clinical outcomes&#xD;
      of an implant made of titanium and a corresponding implants in titanium-zirconium alloy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred for implant treatment at the Department of Prosthodontics,&#xD;
      Specialisttandvården Borås will be asked to participate in the study and provide written&#xD;
      consent after review of delivered information sheet. Implants will be installed by two well&#xD;
      experienced surgeons at Oral Maxillofacial Surgery att Borås Regional Hospital according to&#xD;
      the protocol used for dental implant surgery and recommended by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups, matched for age and gender, will be defined after block randomisation for&#xD;
      smoking. The test group will receive titanium-zirconium implants and the control group&#xD;
      titanium implants. For a power of 80% and for p &lt; 0.05, (SD = 1.66 according to previous&#xD;
      studies, estimates made from 1 mm difference in margin bone level between the groups), the&#xD;
      size of the groups has been defined as 44 patients per group. The investigators anticipate a&#xD;
      loss of approximately 10% and therefore, the investigators have increased each patient group&#xD;
      to 48 individuals. The data collection is completed when the number of patients has been&#xD;
      reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will involve no additional clinical or radiological examinations as compared&#xD;
      to the usual procedures. Normally, this means examination and therapy planning, surgical&#xD;
      examination, implant installation, impression, placement of prosthetic restoration, baseline&#xD;
      X-ray, control/follow-up tightening of prosthetic screw/hygiene monitoring. No additional&#xD;
      time or costs arises in connection with participation in the study, the cost of both groups&#xD;
      are equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National guidelines will be followed regarding possible need of antibiotic prophylaxis.&#xD;
      Registration will be done with regard to history of periodontal disease, smoking, medication,&#xD;
      and implant position in the jaw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will take place at four different times: in connection with the placement&#xD;
      of the prosthetic construction (baseline) and after 1.3 and 5 years. Standard x-ray&#xD;
      examinations will be carried out to check the marginal bone level which will take place&#xD;
      through individualized x-ray holders that will be produced by impression material (Putty).&#xD;
      Registration of pocket depth, bleeding on probing, amount of keratinized mucosa and&#xD;
      measurements on x-ray will be done by the same person. Prosthetic complications and possible&#xD;
      total implant loss will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The marginal bone level for each implant will be presented as the average of the mesial and&#xD;
      distal bone level (primary outcome). The mean value of pocket depth will be recorded for each&#xD;
      implant at a 4-point measurement. The hypothesis is to be tested with the independent samples&#xD;
      t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of restoration distance from the bone level, the effect of implant type, margin&#xD;
      bone level, bleeding on probing and pocket depth will be controlled using regression&#xD;
      analysis. SPSS is used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that there are no differences in the clinical outcomes between the two&#xD;
      types of implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefits of the Project&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators can conclude that the materials are equivalent if there is no difference&#xD;
      between implant types available. Since, titanium-zirconium alloy has a higher stiffness than&#xD;
      titan, the investigators will be able to provide patients with thinner implant and thus&#xD;
      costly and painful treatments to optimize the width of the bone in the installation area&#xD;
      should be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a social perspective, if it turns out that titan-zirconium have equal or better clinical&#xD;
      performance than titanium, can unnecessary healthcare costs for surgery for modulation of the&#xD;
      surgical site in the form of augmentation or sinus elevation associated with implant&#xD;
      treatment should be avoided. If optimizing surgery can be avoided, this means even shorter&#xD;
      therapy times and increased availability by the released health time which can be used to&#xD;
      more quickly treat other patients as possible had standing in line for their treatment.&#xD;
      Limits can be found in the study's applicability in general dentistry because all operations&#xD;
      are carried out at specialist clinic in which case the patient clientele and the processor's&#xD;
      level of expertise is not fully comparable with the general dentist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with dental implants in titanium is a known treatment that has helped to restore&#xD;
      good chewing function for many patients and years all over the world and can be thought of as&#xD;
      a safe treatment with high success rates. The study protocol calls for no difference in the&#xD;
      x-ray examination or the surgical protocol as compared to the procedures followed in regular&#xD;
      treatment basis. In previous studies, there is no listing of suspected allergy to&#xD;
      titanium-zirconium alloy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information and storage of personal data in accordance with the recommendations of&#xD;
      the Board of ethical review.&#xD;
