    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate parental attitudes towards their child who has a&#xD;
      mobility impairment, to using a modified electric toy car, and to evaluate from their&#xD;
      perspective, if it facilitated social interaction for their child with mobility impairment.&#xD;

      Project Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the project is to investigate parental perspectives on the impact of using&#xD;
      a modified electric toy car on social interactions of pre-school children with mobility&#xD;
      impairments, over an 8 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim is to understand from the parent's perspective, features of the toy car they&#xD;
      valued and features they feel could be changed to improve the experience for their child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited via a charity in Northern Ireland who supports parents of&#xD;
      children with Spina Bifida who have mobility impairments (SHINE). Once participants are&#xD;
      confirmed, they will attend clinic appointments at Musgrave Park Hospital, Belfast. At&#xD;
      clinic, the principle investigator will complete an assessment of the child to determine what&#xD;
      modifications are required to support the child in the toy car as well as modifications to&#xD;
      access drive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be shown 3 possible toy car options and the child will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to try driving the cars. Parents will then select the toy car they wish to use&#xD;
      allowing them to consider aesthetic features. Giving the parents the option of selecting the&#xD;
      car enhances patient and public involvement in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this, the car will be ordered and modifications completed. The rehabilitation&#xD;
      engineer will complete a medical device risk assessment on each car to ensure safety. A&#xD;
      second appointment will then evaluate modifications, complete final adjustments and a safety&#xD;
      handover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be asked to use the toy car during social interactions with the child over an 8&#xD;
      week period. They will be asked to keep a log of their experiences over this time. Following&#xD;
      this, the principle investigator will complete semi-structured interviews with the parents to&#xD;
      determine their experiences of using the toy car.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 5 child participants aged between 12 months and 47 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Semi structured interviews will be completed with parents after 8 week&#xD;
      trial intervention. In addition the PIADS will be completed before and after the trial to see&#xD;
      if this can predict the likelihood for the parents to use the modified toy car, and what&#xD;
      impact it has on their quality of life.&#xD;
