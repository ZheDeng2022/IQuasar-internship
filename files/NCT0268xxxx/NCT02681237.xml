  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept study (a study to initially assess the benefit a new drug&#xD;
      indication) of the combination of two investigational drugs cediranib and olaparib in&#xD;
      patients with ovarian cancer whose cancer worsened despite previously receiving a poly&#xD;
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (such as olaparib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether taking cediranib and olaparib at the same&#xD;
      time will be able to stop tumors from growing further or shrink it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cediranib works by blocking (inhibiting) several specific proteins in cancer cells called the&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors. These proteins are important in the&#xD;
      formation of blood vessels to the tumor. It is believed that many tumors survive because the&#xD;
      blood vessels on the tumors bring oxygen and nutrients to the cancer cells which enable them&#xD;
      to grow. If the formation of the blood vessels is blocked, the tumor cells may die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaparib, works by blocking a protein called poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] polymerase&#xD;
      (PARP). PARP is an important protein which tries to fix damaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA,&#xD;
      molecules that contain important instructions for the development of cells). Many cancers are&#xD;
      thought to develop from damaged DNA. By blocking PARP from fixing damaged DNA, the tumor&#xD;
      cells may die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adding cediranib to olaparib, and therefore blocking several different mechanisms for cancer&#xD;
      growth, may stop tumor growth.&#xD;
