  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the long-term surgical success, quality of life,&#xD;
      prevalence of depression, fertility rates, and pregnancy outcomes of patients who have&#xD;
      undergone obstetric fistula repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a study involving up to 300 women 1-3 years after they have undergone obstetric&#xD;
      fistula repair at the Fistula Care Center in Lilongwe, Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who underwent obstetric fistula repair between January 1, 2012 and July 31, 2014&#xD;
      will be identified from an existing database of fistula patients. They will then be contacted&#xD;
      and invited to participate in the study. Consented patients will complete a 1-hour pad weight&#xD;
      to evaluate urinary continence, a demographic questionnaire, an incontinence-related quality&#xD;
      of life metric, and a depression metric. The data will be analyzed and then disseminated to&#xD;
      stakeholders.&#xD;

      Eligible participants will be identified from an existing, secure database. Participants will&#xD;
      be contacted and traced. They will then be invited to participate in the study. If a&#xD;
      participant agrees to participate in the study, they will undergo informed consent by trained&#xD;
      study staff, using IRB-approved informed consent forms. They will then undergo a 1-hour pad&#xD;
      weight, complete demographic data, complete an incontinence-related quality of life metric,&#xD;
      and complete a depression metric.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-hour pad weight: Use of the 1-hour pad weights have been recommended as an objective&#xD;
      measure of treatment outcome for anti-incontinence procedures. After a woman has agreed to&#xD;
      enroll in the study and has given written consent, she will be asked to complete a 1-hour pad&#xD;
      weight. Pad weights will be measured through having participants sit on a pre-weighed pad for&#xD;
      exactly one hour and re-weighing the same pad. The weight of the pad before and after will be&#xD;
      recorded and the difference between the two will be used as the pad weight. The pad weight&#xD;
      represents the degree of urinary leakage a woman is experiencing. In continent populations,&#xD;
      this weight is &lt;1.5 grams. The research assistant will use a calibrated portable scale and&#xD;
      stopwatch to ensure accurate recording of these weights. During this time, the remainder of&#xD;
      the survey will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic Data: Demographic data for each participant will be collected at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment and after a written consent has been obtained. This includes information about the&#xD;
      patient's age, place of residence, HIV status, education attainment, living arrangement,&#xD;
      number of pregnancies and living children, and symptoms of urinary or fecal leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incontinence-related Quality of Life Metric: To assess OF repair success and continence,&#xD;
      participants will be asked about any leakage symptoms with the Kings' Health Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression Metric:The 9-question Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) will be used to assess&#xD;
      repaired OF participants for depression.&#xD;
