  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Admission into a care home for people with dementia has been linked with both positive and&#xD;
      negative psychological outcomes for both the resident and their carers. Whilst some people&#xD;
      with dementia adjust quickly, many never adjust at all or adjustment is complex and linked to&#xD;
      cognitive and behavioural decline (Wilson et al, 2007). Therefore, support for healthy&#xD;
      adjustment is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research (Aminzadeh et al., 2013; Sury, Burns and Brodaty, 2013, Sussman and Dupuis,&#xD;
      2013) has identified factors that influence different relocation outcomes and prevent adverse&#xD;
      reactions. There are currently no interventions that support successful adjustment by&#xD;
      emphasising the positive factors found to influence relocation outcomes while mitigating the&#xD;
      effects of negative influences and addressing any missed pre-admission procedures, reported&#xD;
      in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project seeks to design an intervention that predominantly builds on the work of&#xD;
      Sury et al (2013) and focuses on promoting healthy adjustment through an enhanced best&#xD;
      practice based admission process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be developed through systematic review of the literature and&#xD;
      consultation with professional experts, service users, care home staff and carers. The&#xD;
      current study will serve as a feasibility (pilot) study and test the acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention design, examine recruitment and dropout and establish sample size for future,&#xD;
      larger studies. It also aims to examine whether the intervention indicates an improvement in&#xD;
      residents' quality of life, mood, overall adjustment and carer satisfaction with care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a subset of the same intervention, specifically tailored to&#xD;
      their needs and with elements delivered by staff, carer or psychologist. Staff and&#xD;
      researchers will assess the improvement indicators mentioned above using relevant&#xD;
      psychometric measures at baseline, post intervention completion and at one-month follow up.&#xD;
      Indirect measures (interviews and staff field notes) will also be used to indicate&#xD;
      intervention fidelity and feasibility.&#xD;
