      Our study addresses a previously selected population or by physical activity but not for&#xD;
      semen quality semen donor candidates donation program within the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total physical activity was analyzed according to the universally accepted international&#xD;
      physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) The existence of confounding factors associated She&#xD;
      purge age, snuff, weight, BMI, alcohol, drugs, type of sport and associated blood parameters&#xD;
      determinations will be made to exercise.&#xD;

      The level of physical activity recommended great unknown and its influence from the&#xD;
      therapeutic point of view to improve semen quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For it will be held:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 groups of physical activity are established, according to their score in the IPAQ:&#xD;
           High, minimum of physical activity between &gt; 1500 MET week Moderate: minimum of physical&#xD;
           activity of between 600- 1500 MET week Low : until &lt; 600 MET week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implementation of a double analysis: Seminal and hormonal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardization of confounding factors associated with the individual&#xD;

    <measure>Ascertain the influence of physical activity in sperm quality to candidates for sperm donors in the donation program according to the universally accepted questionnaire International physical activity (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Semen parameters will be evaluated according to WHO criteria blinded on clinical and data analyst.&#xD;
International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) offers before sperm donation quantifying the activity &quot;walk&quot;, &quot;activities of moderate intensity&quot; and &quot;vigorous intensity activities&quot; assigned to each activity about energy requirements defined in METs, being multiples of the rate of metabolic rate equivalent to kilocalories for a 60 kg.&#xD;
The median and interquartile range (between Q1 and Q3) is calculated for walking (W), activities of moderate intensity (M), activities of vigorous intensity (V) and a combined result of total physical activity. All results must be expressed as continuous METminutos / week.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Existence of confounding factors associated with physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The existence of confounding factors such as age, tobacco, weight, BMI, alcohol, drugs, type of sport will be cleaned and blood parameters associated with physical activity will be defined.&#xD;
A data tab/sheet for each donor was made . The existence of related factors such as age, tobacco, weight, BMI, alcohol, drug and the type of sport exercised were been analysed.&#xD;
It categorizes the population into quartiles depending on their activity and determine which is which is associated with a better seminal quality the same debugging is made confounding previously mentioned.&#xD;

This will be self-completed questionnaire beforeSperm donation. (Appendix 1) Age, snuff, weight, BMI, alcohol, drug use and the type of sport that practices will be analyzed: Additionally a tab for each donor collecting the existence of associated factors be drawn.
