      Our central hypothesis is that screening newborn infants who either fail their newborn&#xD;
      hearing test or have a diagnosis of small for gestational age (SGA) will lead to better&#xD;
      identification of infants with congenital CMV infection and enhanced rates of therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention. This has the potential to significantly improve outcomes for infants with this&#xD;
      common viral infection. This particular cohort of patients have not been well studied locally&#xD;
      or regionally. In addition, in view of current legislation that will be effective in January,&#xD;
      2016 this is a timely project that will provide preliminary data for future statewide&#xD;
      recommendations around CMV testing of newborn infants. This will be a pilot/feasibility study&#xD;
      to obtain preliminary data for an Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) Title V grant.&#xD;
      Although not guaranteed, preliminary discussions with the IDPH are highly encouraging giving&#xD;
      the statewide interest in this topic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the leading non-genetic cause of sensorineural&#xD;
      hearing loss (SNHL) in children in the United States, and is the most frequent known viral&#xD;
      cause of mental disability. Approximately one percent of all newborn infants in the United&#xD;
      States are infected with CMV. Of those infected, approximately 10% have involvement that is&#xD;
      evident at birth (symptomatic congenital CMV disease) with manifestations including&#xD;
      microcephaly, central nervous system abnormalities, chorioretinitis, hepatosplenomegaly, and&#xD;
      SNHL. The most common sequelae following congenital CMV infection is SNHL and it occurs in up&#xD;
      to 50% of infants with symptomatic congenital CMV infection and in 15% of asymptomatic&#xD;
      infants. Overall, congenital CMV infection accounts for one-third of all cases of SNHL. Among&#xD;
      newborn infants who fail hearing screening, the prevalence of congenital CMV infection is&#xD;
      much higher (six to 10%) than the general newborn population (&lt;1%). Since early therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention for infants with symptomatic congenital CMV infections improves audiological and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes early diagnosis is essential for early treatment and maximizing&#xD;
      infant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Illinois Legislature passed a bill that was signed into law in August 2015 by Governor&#xD;
      Rauner regarding congenital CMV. The main objectives of this law are public education&#xD;
      regarding CMV infection and efforts to raise awareness of this infection amongst healthcare&#xD;
      providers caring for expectant mothers. This Public Act mandates parents receive information&#xD;
      regarding testing opportunities and early intervention services for CMV infection when their&#xD;
      newborn infant fails his or her hearing screen. Although this bill does not mandate CMV&#xD;
      screening, it does state that the hospitals have to provide information about testing&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our central hypothesis is that screening newborn infants who either fail their newborn&#xD;
      hearing test or have a diagnosis of small for gestational age (SGA) will lead to better&#xD;
      identification of infants with congenital CMV infection and enhanced rates of therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention. This has the potential to significantly improve outcomes for infants with this&#xD;
      common viral infection. This particular cohort of patients have not been well studied locally&#xD;
      or regionally. In addition, in view of current legislation that will be effective in January,&#xD;
      2016 this is a timely project that will provide preliminary data for future statewide&#xD;
      recommendations around CMV testing of newborn infants. This will be a pilot/feasibility study&#xD;
