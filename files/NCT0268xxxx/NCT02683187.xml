  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine the role of a hormone, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1),&#xD;
      on insulin secretion and to study how GLP-1 works in in diabetic individuals as compared to&#xD;
      non-diabetic individuals, under fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 is a naturally occurring hormone made in the intestines. It is released into the&#xD;
      circulating blood after eating and helps to control the blood glucose levels by increasing&#xD;
      insulin secretion by cells in the pancreas. However, the exact method by which GLP-1 causes&#xD;
      insulin secretion and how GLP-1 activity is changed in diabetic persons remain unclear. This&#xD;
      research is being done to address these questions and better understand the function of&#xD;
      GLP-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research, the investigators will use a synthetic form of Exendin-9 to determine the&#xD;
      effects of GLP-1 on insulin secretion in diabetic and non-diabetic persons. Exendin-9 acts as&#xD;
      a blocker of GLP-1 action, allowing us to study the specific effects of the GLP-1 hormone.&#xD;
      Exendin-9 is an investigational compound, which means it is still being tested in research&#xD;
      studies and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will also use the drug Sitagliptin, which is an FDA-approved&#xD;
      drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, use of Sitagliptin is&#xD;
      considered investigational since it is not being used for treatment of diabetes but is&#xD;
      instead being used to understand how GLP-1 works and to better understand how medications&#xD;
      like Sitagliptin work in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
