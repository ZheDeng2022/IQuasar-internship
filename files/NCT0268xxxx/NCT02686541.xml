      The aim of this study is to study the effects of athrectomy followed by percutaneous&#xD;
      transluminal angioplasty using Paclitaxel coated Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB) in treating de&#xD;
      novo or re-stenotic lesions in the femoral-popliteal artery in patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      peripheral vascular disease in an Asian population. The intention is to study the effects of&#xD;
      debulking athrectomy followed by application of DEBs to prevent restenosis, resulting in&#xD;
      improved patency rates The study will prospectively recruit 8 cases treated with athrectomy&#xD;
      followed by DEB. This project is a pilot to investigate the effects of athrectomy and DEB in&#xD;
      reducing re-stenosis rates. It will be a primer for a larger scale randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) involving multiple institutions to demonstrate the benefit of athrectomy and DEB&#xD;
      technology to treat de novo versus plain balloon angioplasty with bail-out stenting, which is&#xD;
      currently the most commonly used modality to treat femoral-popliteal lesions. There are no&#xD;
      studies combining the effect of rotational athrectomy and DEBs.&#xD;

      Patient will undergo an intervention under anaesthesia. After common femoral artery sheath&#xD;
      access, a diagnostic angiogram will be performed. After pre-arthrectomy Intravascular&#xD;
      ultrasound (IVUS) of the affected arterial segment, patient will undergo treatment of the&#xD;
      lesion with arthrectomy, followed by post-arthrectomy IVUS analysis. Following arthrectomy,&#xD;
      the affected vessel will be treated by supplementary Ranger Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB).&#xD;
      During post-procedure, patients will be started on dual antiplatelets for 3 months followed&#xD;
      by Aspirin for life unless contraindicated. Clinical follow-up, duplex ultrasound (to assess&#xD;
      for re-stenosis) and Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) will be performed at 1-month,&#xD;
      6-month and 12-month post intervention. Assessment of the symptoms, pulse, and clinical&#xD;
      patency will be performed at each visit.&#xD;
