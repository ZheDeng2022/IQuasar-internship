  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether the addition of&#xD;
      financial incentives to a high-quality, online behavioral weight loss intervention produces&#xD;
      better weight losses than the online treatment alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obese but otherwise healthy participants (N=416) will be recruited in&#xD;
      approximately equal numbers at two clinical centers, the University of South Carolina and the&#xD;
      University of Vermont. Eligible participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1)&#xD;
      an 18-month, 36-session group Internet behavioral weight control treatment (Internet Only)&#xD;
      which replicates the intervention the investigators have implemented previously; or 2) the&#xD;
      same 18-month, 36-session group Internet treatment plus financial incentives for performance&#xD;
      of 3 key self-management behaviors (Internet+ Incentive). Both conditions will have access to&#xD;
      the same web-based intervention platform and the same counselor-delivered intervention&#xD;
      elements; the presence of economic incentives for behavioral and weight goals is the only&#xD;
      difference between the conditions. Assessments will be conducted at Baseline, 2, 6, 12 and 18&#xD;
      months. Cost data will be collected to inform cost effectiveness evaluations.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be required to attend a weekly Internet chat session with your group members and one of the behavioral weight control therapists. Participants will learn the principles of managing eating and exercise behaviors in weekly, hour-long chat sessions and by completing weekly lessons. Participants are asked to self-monitor foods and exercise through the use of a smartphone ap. Participants will wear a tracking device that monitors steps. All participants will be contacted via e-mail individually, by their group leader who will monitor their progress and offer advice and encouragement. Meetings are weekly for 24 weeks and monthly for 12 months.</description>
