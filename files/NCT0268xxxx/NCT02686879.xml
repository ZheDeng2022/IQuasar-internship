    <textblock>
      Hyperopia, also known as farsightedness, is a common type of refractive error where distant&#xD;
      objects may be seen more clearly than objects that are near.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperopia is a known risk factor for amblyopia, (lazy eye), which may occur as a result of a&#xD;
      squint (turn), or due to different levels of hyperopia between each eye (anisohyperopia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperopia and anisohyperopia often persist into adulthood resulting in impairment to&#xD;
      binocular vision. Current management involves prescribing spectacles or contact lenses to&#xD;
      correct the hyperopia in each eye, usually as a lifelong intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in delaying progression of myopia&#xD;
      (short-sightedness) by slowing down the growth of the eye using a particular type of contact&#xD;
      lens termed a centre-distance multifocal design. There have been some encouraging results in&#xD;
      this area to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study here would explore the use of centre-near multifocal design contact lenses&#xD;
      to encourage growth of the eye, thereby reducing hyperopia. There are three elements to the&#xD;
      programme of research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The natural progression of axial growth and refractive error will be measured in&#xD;
           hyperopic and anisohyperopic subjects aged between 5 and 19. In other words, the natural&#xD;
           growth of the eye will be followed without any intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. As a paired eye control study anisohyperopes aged between 8 and 15 will be fitted with a&#xD;
           centre-near multifocal design contact lens in their more hyperopic eye and a single&#xD;
           vision contact lens in the fellow eye, if required. The progression of axial growth and&#xD;
           refractive error will be measured and compared in each eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects' aged between 8 and 15 with similar levels of hyperopia in each eye will be&#xD;
           fitted with centre-near multifocal design contact lenses in each eye. The progression of&#xD;
           axial growth and refractive error will be measured and compared to subjects in the&#xD;
           natural progression study&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, hyperopia receives much less research attention than myopia even though the impact&#xD;
      of moderate to high levels of hyperopia especially in one eye (anisohyperopia) can lead to&#xD;
      amblyopia if not corrected fully at a young age. Hyperopia occurs as a consequence of&#xD;
      insufficient ocular growth and a failure to emmetropise (reach the expected normal level) in&#xD;
      childhood with the majority of hyperopic refractive errors resulting from an eye that is too&#xD;
      short for its refractive power. In anisohyperopia it is unclear why one eye may remain&#xD;
      hyperopic while the fellow eye grows towards an emmetropic state. Studies on animals have&#xD;
      suggested that manipulating peripheral defocus through optical means while simultaneously&#xD;
      providing correct axial focus can either discourage or encourage axial growth to effectively&#xD;
      treat myopia or hyperopia respectively. Recent research has established that progression of&#xD;
      myopia and axial growth can be significantly reduced in children and adolescents through the&#xD;
      use of bifocal or multifocal contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optometrist has a central role in the clinical management of refractive error in children&#xD;
      and in the application of future modalities that may modify the development of ametropia. The&#xD;
      following proposal, therefore, presents a programme of work that is both relevant to the&#xD;
      optometrist and novel in hyperopia research. By combining assessment of ocular biometry,&#xD;
      monitoring of normal growth rates, an intervention study using bifocal contact lenses in&#xD;
      children will be the first to provide new data on whether human eyes can be stimulated to&#xD;
      grow in response to a specific type of defocus. Consequently the research will offer a new&#xD;
      perspective on the management of hyperopia and anisohyperopia. The findings will offer a&#xD;
      potential new approach towards amblyopia treatment in children and insight into a strategy&#xD;
      for optimal correction to encourage axial growth in hyperopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three elements to the proposed programme of research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refractive error and axial growth will be followed over a three year period in hyperopic&#xD;
           and anisohyperopic subjects aged between 5 and 19 years old to gain understanding of&#xD;
           natural progression of these parameters in the specified cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simultaneous vision bifocal/mulitfocal soft contact lenses will be used to encourage&#xD;
           axial growth in hyperopic children and adolescents with axial hyperopia in an effort to&#xD;
           reduce hyperopia. The bifocal centre near design contact lenses will be prescribed to&#xD;
           provide for clear central vision at both distance and near thus exposing the retina to&#xD;
           peripheral hyperopic defocus from the distance zone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This concept will also be applied to anisometropes as they represent a unique example of&#xD;
           ocular development, where the two eyes of an individual, with an identical genetic&#xD;
           background and seemingly subject to identical environmental influences, can grow&#xD;
           asymmetrically to produce significantly different refractive errors. This correction and&#xD;
           manipulation strategy has the potential to be applied to the more hyperopic eye to&#xD;
           encourage eye growth and reduction of hyperopia with associated benefits of improved&#xD;
           binocular vision and stereopsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the natural progression study healthy hyperopic children and adolescents aged between 5&#xD;
      and 19 years of age will be recruited via the researcher's optometry practices and Aston&#xD;
      University optometry clinic. The growth and visual characteristics of the eyes will be&#xD;
      followed over time without any intervention by the research team. Following consent, at the&#xD;
      initial visit, all participants will undergo a number of visual assessments including&#xD;
      measurement of the axial length of the eye, focusing ability over a range of distances, eye&#xD;
      muscle balance, vision at a range of different contrasts, pupil size and quality of&#xD;
      stereovision and objective assessment of the crystalline lens parameters. Measures of the&#xD;
      participant's spectacle prescription by objective and subjective means will also be&#xD;
      undertaken following the instillation of eye drops to relax the muscles of the eye and to&#xD;
      dilate the pupils. The eye drops will take around 40 minutes to work with the pupils&#xD;
      returning to normal size after approximately 24 hours. The majority of these assessments are&#xD;
      similar to those undertaken during a routine eye examination. The height of the subjects will&#xD;
      also be taken at baseline and at six monthly intervals throughout the study. Parents and&#xD;
      children will also be asked to complete a background questionnaire at this visit. The first&#xD;
      visit is expected to last around 90 minutes. Participants will be reviewed every six months&#xD;
      over a period of three years where the measures taken at baseline will be repeated.&#xD;
      Instillation of eye drops to dilate the pupils and relax the eye muscles will be used on&#xD;
      alternate visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intervention study, at the initial visit all participants will undergo a number of&#xD;
      visual assessments including measurement of the shape and length of the eye, focusing ability&#xD;
      over a range of distances, eye muscle balance, vision at a range of different contrasts,&#xD;
      pupil size and quality of stereovision. Measures of the participant's spectacle prescription&#xD;
      by objective and subjective means will also be undertaken following the instillation of eye&#xD;
      drops to relax the muscles of the eye and to dilate the pupils. Subjects in the intervention&#xD;
      groups will be reassessed after a period of six months to establish a measure of natural eye&#xD;
      growth prior to being fitted with contact lenses. Parents and children will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete a background questionnaire at this visit. The first visit is expected to last around&#xD;
      90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second visit for the intervention group will be to assess the individual's suitability&#xD;
      for contact lens wear using a microscope. The participant and parent will be instructed on&#xD;
      how to insert, remove and care for their contact lenses. The fitting of the contact lenses&#xD;
      and level of vision will be assessed. For the anisohyperopes, the more hyperopic eye will be&#xD;
      fitted with a commercially available soft multifocal contact lens and the less hyperopic eye&#xD;
      will be fitted with a soft single vision contact lens. Subjects with similar levels of&#xD;
      hyperopia in each eye will be fitted with commercially available soft multifocal contact&#xD;
      lenses in both eyes. The participant will then be issued with a supply of contact lenses&#xD;
      along with commercially produced instruction guides on caring for their contact lenses. The&#xD;
      second visit is expected to last around 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child may need to attend for unscheduled visits if any problems arise during the early&#xD;
      stages of contact lens wear. Otherwise they will be reviewed at one to two weeks after the&#xD;
      dispensing visit and also one month later for routine contact lens aftercare appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention groups will be reviewed at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the&#xD;
      dispensing visit. During these visits the majority of measurements undertaken during the&#xD;
      initial assessment will be repeated along with routine contact lens aftercare. Eye drops to&#xD;
      relax the eye muscles and dilate the pupils will be instilled at the 12 and 24 month visits.&#xD;
      For the anisohyperopic subjects, if the level of hyperopia in the more hyperopic eye reduces&#xD;
      to a level that matches the less hyperopic eye then the intervention will be stopped. For the&#xD;
      non-anisohyperopic subjects, the intervention will be stopped when the refractive error has&#xD;
      reached a mean spherical error of +0.50D. At the end of an intervention period of 24 months&#xD;
      the participants will be assessed after a period of 6 months to assess the growth of their&#xD;
      eyes post-intervention.&#xD;
