    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the clinical results of patella resurfacing or not under subvastus&#xD;
      approach in total knee arthroplasty. Even though the excellent results of total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty(TKA), there is persistent controversy over whether or not to replace the&#xD;
      patella. Anterior knee pain continued to be a unsolved problem of TKA patients. Some surgeons&#xD;
      always performed patella resurfacing during total knee arthroplasty but the others didn't do&#xD;
      that. It's up to surgeon's preference. There were several studies of patellar resurfacing or&#xD;
      not in TKA. But previous studies almost have been done under other approach, not a subvastus&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study prospectively randomized patients receiving bilateral TKA with patellar&#xD;
      resurfacing or not in each knee. Patients preference and clinical results was investigated in&#xD;
      both knee of same patients who received patellar resurfacing or not during minimum 2 year&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this work was to compare pain, stiffness and function between groups&#xD;
      at minimum 2 year postoperatively. Secondarily, we compared pain, patient preference at&#xD;
      minimum 2 year postoperatively. The investigators hypothesized that there would be no&#xD;
      difference between the two groups of subjects in the measured outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving TKA were prospectively enrolled before surgery and randomized&#xD;
      intraoperatively to either receive patella replacement or not in both knee of same patients.&#xD;
      Subjects were assessed pre-operatively and at 6 months, 1, 2 years postoperatively for pain,&#xD;
      function, and stiffness using a disease-specific (Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis&#xD;
      Index [WOMAC]) . Other measurements like Knee Society score, Feller's score, Patient&#xD;
      satisfaction (VAS) also checked pre-operatively and at 6 months, 1, 2 years postoperatively.&#xD;
