  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood clots that form in the extremities (deep venous thrombosis) and lungs (pulmonary&#xD;
      embolus) are feared complications of reconstructive surgery. One in ten patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic pulmonary embolus will be dead in 60 minutes. Patients with deep venous&#xD;
      thrombosis can develop the post-thrombotic syndrome, known to be a major driver of poor&#xD;
      quality of life. These phenomena, broadly known as venous thromboembolism (VTE), have&#xD;
      substantial downstream ramifications, and the US Surgeon General and the American Society of&#xD;
      Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), among others, have underscored the importance of VTE prevention in&#xD;
      surgical patients. Reconstructive surgery, most commonly performed to fix traumatic injuries&#xD;
      or defects after cancer excision, often involves borrowing tissue from adjacent or distant&#xD;
      areas on the body; reconstructive surgery patients can routinely have surgical injury&#xD;
      involving 20% or more of their total body surface area. Injury and resultant inflammation are&#xD;
      known to increase metabolism of certain drugs, including those used to prevent VTE after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enoxaparin is a blood-thinning medication that decreases likelihood of blood clot formation.&#xD;
      Previous research has shown that reconstructive surgery patients who are given enoxaparin&#xD;
      after surgery are less likely to develop VTE. However, despite receiving of a standard dose&#xD;
      of enoxaparin, many patients still develop this life-threatening complication. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that patients metabolize enoxaparin differently based on the degree of&#xD;
      surgical injury created during reconstruction, and seek to critically examine enoxaparin&#xD;
      metabolism in reconstructive surgery patients. The proposed research will evaluate how&#xD;
      enoxaparin affects the blood based on standard, ASPS-recommended dosing after reconstructive&#xD;
      surgeries; the investigators will also examine whether the extent of surgical injury alters&#xD;
      metabolism as well. Enoxaparin effectiveness will be tracked using anti-Factor Xa (aFXa)&#xD;
      levels. If subtherapeutic aFXa levels are observed, the study will also design, implement and&#xD;
      test a clinical enoxaparin dose-adjustment protocol to achieve appropriate post-operative&#xD;
      aFXa levels. Further research based on these data will examine reduction in VTE risk when&#xD;
      aFXa-driven enoxaparin dosing is used.&#xD;

      The ultimate goal of the investigators research is to better understand the interplay between&#xD;
      enoxaparin dosing, degree of surgical injury, and blood clots after major reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery. Ultimately, this research will expand medicine's understanding of why post-operative&#xD;
      VTE occurs, will allow the investigators to individualize a patient's VTE prophylaxis&#xD;
      strategy based on their unique characteristics, and will further improve patient safety after&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
