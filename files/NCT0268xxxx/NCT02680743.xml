      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) is the most common non-genetic cause of pediatric&#xD;
      sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and an important cause of neurodevelopmental delay. Infants&#xD;
      with cCMV can be symptomatic, asymptomatic, or asymptomatic except for hearing loss.&#xD;
      Symptomatic infants may be more readily identified and quickly referred for intervention&#xD;
      because they may present with classic common clinical findings, but the majority of infants&#xD;
      (85-90%) with cCMV are asymptomatic at birth and do not have the classic clinical,&#xD;
      laboratory, or radiologic findings and therefore often have delayed identification and&#xD;
      intervention. Often, these otherwise asymptomatic infants with cCMV may have early congenital&#xD;
      hearing loss and therefore fail the newborn hearing screen but because they are not&#xD;
      specifically identified as having cCMV there is a delay in seeking further audiology exam and&#xD;
      treatment of the CMV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this proposed research is to investigate how testing newborns for&#xD;
      congenital cytomegalovirus infection (cCMV) after a failed newborn hearing screens can&#xD;
      improve early identification of cCMV infection and therefore reduce the delay in referral of&#xD;
      the newborn to appropriate specialists for intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will include newborns in the NBN or NICU who are less than 14 days of&#xD;
      life who fail the standard hearing screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and Evaluations Saliva samples will be obtained from participating infants with&#xD;
      a mouth swab according to an established protocol. The saliva will then be tested for CMV by&#xD;
      qualitative polymerase chain reaction by ARUP Laboratories. Infants who test positive for CMV&#xD;
      infection will then be referred for repeat audiology exam to confirm hearing loss and to&#xD;
      Pediatric Infectious Diseases for evaluation and treatment if necessary. Parents or guardians&#xD;
      of infants who test positive for cCMV will receive counseling on the importance of following&#xD;
      up with these specialists. The primary outcomes measured will be cCMV prevalence data and&#xD;
      time to referral and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be as clinically indicated and determined by the infant's primary care&#xD;
      provider, pediatric infectious disease physician, and audiologist. It will not be determined&#xD;
      by the study, referral to these services will be the study endpoint.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1: Establish a cCMV testing protocol and demonstrate that this protocol is&#xD;
      successful at identifying infants with cCMV who present with hearing abnormality as the first&#xD;
      sign of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate that a majority of infants who test positive for cCMV at the time&#xD;
      of failed hearing screen are referred within 14 days for appropriate confirmatory testing and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Improve cCMV prevalence data estimates for the State of Nebraska.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) affects 20,000-40,000 infants in the United States annually&#xD;
      and is the most common congenital viral infection in newborns1. cCMV is the most common&#xD;
      non-genetic cause of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in children and it is estimated that&#xD;
      the 1 in 10 children with SNHL have cCMV related hearing loss. SNHL is the most common&#xD;
      sequela of cCMV infection but the overall disease burden is much greater as cCMV is an&#xD;
      important contributor to neurodevelopmental delay2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common physical exam findings for identification of cCMV include petechiae,&#xD;
      hepatosplenomegaly, microcephaly, hypotonia, hearing loss, purpura, chorioretinitis, and&#xD;
      seizure activity and the most common laboratory findings include elevated AST and ALT,&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated CSF protein3,4. Infants may&#xD;
      also be identified based on radiologic abnormalities including abnormal cranial ultrasound,&#xD;
      head CT, and brain MRI that may show cerebral calcifications and ventriculomegaly4. Infants&#xD;
      with cCMV infections are categorized as either symptomatic or asymptomatic based on the&#xD;
      physical exam, laboratory, and radiologic findings that are present at birth3. Approximately&#xD;
      10%-15% of cCMV cases are classified as symptomatic due to the any of these clinical findings&#xD;
      and the outcomes for these infants are poor with approximately half suffering from severe&#xD;
      neurologic sequelae including SNHL, mental retardation with IQs &lt; 70, and microcephaly2,3.&#xD;
      Approximately 85-90% of children with cCMV do not have these clinical findings at birth and&#xD;
      are therefore considered asymptomatic3.However, some cases of otherwise asymptomatic cCMV do&#xD;
      have hearing loss as detected during newborn hearing test screening and these patients fall&#xD;
      into a sub-categorization of asymptomatic with a failed hearing screening.The hearing loss of&#xD;
      cCMV is significant as it is often severe to profound in both the symptomatic and&#xD;
      asymptomatic cases. In the asymptomatic children who had hearing impairment, 42% required&#xD;
      amplification and rehabilitation2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no universal systematic screening of newborns for cCMV and while&#xD;
      symptomatic infants may be tested for CMV due to clinical suspicion, asymptomatic infants&#xD;
      present a greater challenge to early identification. Screening techniques are available and&#xD;
      these include urine or saliva cultures with and without PCR, as well as blood PCR that can be&#xD;
      run on dried blood samples (i.e. blood obtained as part of statewide newborn screening&#xD;
      exams)2. Recent studies have shown that CMV PCR assays of liquid and dried saliva samples&#xD;
      have a high sensitivity and specificity as compared to saliva cultures5. Although these tests&#xD;
      are available, they are not routinely used for neonatal universal screening either before or&#xD;
      after failed hearing screens even though it is known that detecting hearing loss early leads&#xD;
      to earlier intervention and therefore better long term hearing and developmental outcomes,&#xD;
      especially when the infants are treated with antiviral therapy such as ganciclovir or&#xD;
      valgancyclovir2,6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Birth data collected from Nebraska Medicine (including Bellevue) for 2014 show 2,660 births&#xD;
      with 2,592 infants passing the hearing screen and 43 (1.6%) infants being referred There is&#xD;
      no system in place to track how many of these children then failed further testing, how many&#xD;
      were tested for cCMV, or how many were diagnosed with cCMV. The Nebraska Birth Defects&#xD;
      Registry, maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), has sparse data&#xD;
      on the number of babies identified with cCMV going back to 2007 and the data is as follows: 2&#xD;
      cases in 2007, 2 in 2009, 1 in 2011, and 1 in 2013. The mechanism by which the registry&#xD;
      receives the data is through birth certificate clerk entry and the data is most certainly not&#xD;
      complete.In order to be treated for cCMV with valgancyclovir diagnosis of cCMV must be made&#xD;
      within 14 days of birth and treatment initiated by 30 days of life; a timeframe currently not&#xD;
      feasible for the majority of infants currently identified by the current status quo with&#xD;
      follow-up hearing evaluation performed weeks and sometimes months after initial referral on&#xD;
      newborn hearing screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project we intend to institute testing for CMV in infants who fail their newborn&#xD;
      hearing screen in order to quickly identify those with cCMV. After identification, they will&#xD;
      be referred for further audiology testing and referred to Pediatric Infectious Diseases for&#xD;
      further diagnostic and confirmatory testing and treatment if indicated. Additionally, by&#xD;
      having a confirmed positive cCMV test, the parents and PCP can receive additional counseling&#xD;
      on the importance of proper follow up with early intervention specialists in order to improve&#xD;
      the infants long-term outcome. A secondary benefit will be improved data on cCMV prevalence&#xD;
      in Nebraska.&#xD;
