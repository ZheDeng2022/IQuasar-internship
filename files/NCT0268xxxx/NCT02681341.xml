      The primary objective of this study is to confirm that properties of CardioCel provide&#xD;
      operative benefit to surgeons when compared to Dacron, CorMatrix, and all other bovine&#xD;
      pericardium not treated with proprietary ADAPT engineering.&#xD;

&#xD;
      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CardioCel's unique strength, pliability, resistance to degradation and calcification make it&#xD;
      a promising alternative to synthetic fabrics or other xenographic materials incompletely&#xD;
      decellularized or detoxified (aldehyde removal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue-engineered CardioCel pericardium is manufactured from bovine spongiform&#xD;
      encephalopathy-free pericardium (37). Manufacturing consists of several tissue-engineering&#xD;
      processes, which include steps to remove lipids, cells and cell remnants, nucleic acids (DNA,&#xD;
      RNA) and Gal epitopes. In addition, cross-linking is achieved with an ultra-low engineered&#xD;
      glutaraldehyde concentration to minimise glutaraldehyde cytotoxicity levels (Admedus Ltd.&#xD;
      proprietary). Cytotoxicity is further reduced by the ADAPTÂ® anti-calcification process and a&#xD;
      non-glutaraldehyde sterilisation and storage solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CardioCel is US FDA cleared for the repair of cardiac and vascular defects, including&#xD;
      intra-cardiac defects; septal defects, valve and annulus repair, great vessel reconstruction,&#xD;
      peripheral vascular reconstruction, suture line buttressing and pericardial closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective, non-randomized, single arm study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENTS/DATA COLLECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENROLLMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 subjects to be enrolled per site&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF ENROLLMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 6 months after CEA procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING A pre-screening procedure may be performed to determine whether the patient meets&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion eligibility selection criteria. A pre-screened patient will be asked&#xD;
      to sign the informed consent form before any study-specific tests or procedures are&#xD;
      performed. Subject screening numbers will be assigned at this visit and subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated for eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects who are potential trial&#xD;
      candidates prior to commencement of any study related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following baseline data will be collected for all subjects prior to procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard of care Physical Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital Signs (Blood pressure and heart rate only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history (for cardiovascular risk factors)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard of care Clinical Lab tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final confirmation of Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPLANT PROCEDURE Patients will undergo a CEA with patch arterioplasty. Patients will be&#xD;
      managed according to standard pre-operative, operative, and postoperative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following OR Experience data will be collected for all subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suturability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemostasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compliance to recipient vessel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OR time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-hospital survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MAE (Stroke, MI, death)&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP VISITS Patients will return for follow-up visits that will include a carotid duplex&#xD;
      ultrasound at 1 and 6 months. Follow-up visits may also include a physical examination and&#xD;
      adverse event review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following follow-up data will be collected for all subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard of care physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 Month duplex US scan- Duplex US scanning for velocity, calibre, occlusion/lesion&#xD;
           status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 month duplex US scan- Duplex US scanning for velocity, calibre, occlusion/lesion&#xD;
           status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MAE (Stroke, MI, death) and AE review at each visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS &amp; DATA MANAGEMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Investigator plans to follow patients for 6 months and create report (white paper)&#xD;
      on OR experiences and 6 month follow-up. The study is a direct observation of 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up for patients undergoing CEA with patch arterioplasty. No control group is included&#xD;
      in the study, and no comparative analysis is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MONITORING Internal monitoring will be conducted periodically. CRF's, source documents,&#xD;
      informed consent forms, and study deviations will be included; these findings will be&#xD;
      reported to the PI. Deviations will be documented and reported according to IRB policy.&#xD;
      Regulatory documents will be audited by the Baylor Research Institute Department of Research&#xD;
      Compliance upon request.&#xD;
