      The main objective is to demonstrate the effects of early dopaminergic activation on the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system in subjects with newly diagnosed vs. established type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the effect of Bromocriptine QR on changes in autonomic function&#xD;
      measured by assessing sympathetic and parasympathetic function using conventional measures of&#xD;
      autonomic function, including power spectral analysis of heart rate as well as peripheral&#xD;
      autonomic function using sudorimetry and laser scanning of peripheral microvascular autonomic&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, twenty-four week, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial with bromocriptine QR in subjects with newly diagnosed and established type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (T2DM) to evaluate its effects on the cardiovascular and peripheral autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system, as well as on inflammatory markers, the leptin/adiponectin system, hormonal&#xD;
      levels of RAS and HPA axis, indices of insulin resistance, and measures of oxidative and&#xD;
      nitrosative stress. Forty newly diagnosed diabetes subjects and 40 subjects with established&#xD;
      diabetes will be enrolled in the study and each randomized to treatment with bromocriptine-QR&#xD;
      or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will demonstrate the effects of dopaminergic activation with&#xD;
      Bromocriptine-QR on the regulation of Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Axis (HPA) axis hormones, on the&#xD;
      plasma levels of markers of inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      vs. established type 2 diabetes subjects. The study will evaluate treatment effects on&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, the Leptin/Adiponectin system, and hormonal levels of&#xD;
      rennin-angiotensin system (RAS), aldosterone and cortisol. Specifically, the following&#xD;
      markers of inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress: 1) C reactive protein (CRP), 2)&#xD;
      interleukin-6, 12, and 10, 3) tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha), 4) plasminogen activator&#xD;
      inhibitor (PAI1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)&#xD;
      and Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) will be evaluated. A co-secondary objective of the&#xD;
      study will be to assess the impact of Bromocriptine-QR vs Placebo on measures of insulin&#xD;
      resistance and glycemic control (e.g., oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose and&#xD;
      insulin, Matsuda index, Homeostasis Model Assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), Hemoglobin&#xD;
      A1c (HbA1c).&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive UDT (usual diabetes therapy) plus bromocriptine-QR. Following randomization subjects will be titrated to the maximum tolerated dose of the study drug over a four-week period. During these first 4 weeks, the daily dose of the study drug will be titrated up by one tablet (0.8 mg bromocriptine-QR) per day on a weekly basis until a maximal tolerated dose of at least two tablets (1.6 mg/day bromocriptine-QR) and no more than four tablets (3.2 mg/per day b-QR) is achieved. Subjects will be maintained at their maximum tolerated dose of between two to four tablets per day (1.6 to 3.2 mg bromocriptine-QR per day) for the duration of the study. Subjects will be seen at 4 weeks after randomization, at 12 weeks after randomization, and then at study end (week 24 or early termination).</description>
