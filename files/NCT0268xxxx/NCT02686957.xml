  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstetric fistula, also called vaginal fistula, is a serious medical condition which affects&#xD;
      women in low income countries. Despite the strengthening of research on fistula, there is&#xD;
      little data on the follow-up after fistula repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to analyse the factors associated with the recurrence of&#xD;
      fistula and the outcomes of pregnancy following fistula repair in Guinea. It will target&#xD;
      women who got a closed fistula at discharge after repair in 2012/2015 at three fistula repair&#xD;
      sites supported by the Fistula Care Project in Guinea (Kissidougou Prefectoral Hospital, Labé&#xD;
      Regional Hospital and Jean Paul II Hospital of Conakry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of interest are fistula recurrence and pregnancy. The predictors of interest&#xD;
      will include patient characteristics, fistula characteristics, the context of repair and the&#xD;
      context of reintegration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants giving an informed consent after a home visit by the Fistula Counsellors who&#xD;
      managed women during surgery will be interview at enrolment and every six month from&#xD;
      inclusion. The study duration is estimated at 48 months (January 2012 to March 2016)&#xD;
      including the retrospective part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 364 women will estimate the recurrence of fistula with a plus/minus 2%&#xD;
      margin of error (width of confidence interval is 4%) and 95% confidence interval and is&#xD;
      sufficient to estimate the rate of pregnancy with a two-sided 95% confidence interval and 10%&#xD;
      precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cumulative incidence rate of fistula recurrence will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      methods and the risk factor analysis will be performed using adjusted cox regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the outcomes of pregnancy, Pearson's Chi Square (χ2) will be used to compare proportions&#xD;
      of pregnancy outcomes between potential predictors and logistic regression models will be&#xD;
      used and associations will be reported as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be done using STATA version 13 (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA)&#xD;
      with a level of significance set at P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
