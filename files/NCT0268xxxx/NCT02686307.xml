      During tachyarrhythmias, central venous pressures increases while arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP) decreases. The result is mixed messages to the central nervous system. On one hand, the&#xD;
      unloading of the arterial baroreceptors results in reflex tachycardia and an increase in&#xD;
      sympathetic nerve activity (SNA). On the other hand, the increase in filling pressure and&#xD;
      thus the activation of the cardiopulmonary baroreceptors result in reflex bradycardia and&#xD;
      sympathoinhibition. The investigators have previously shown that during supraventricular and&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardia, arterial baroreflex gain (BRG) predominates with minimal&#xD;
      contribution from the cardiopulmonary BRG. In addition, the investigators found that arterial&#xD;
      BRG directly correlates with BP recovery following tachycardia termination. The roles of the&#xD;
      arterial and cardiopulmonary BRGs during ventricular fibrillation (VF) however, remain&#xD;
      unknown. Furthermore, the role of the arterial BRG in determining 1) BP recovery following VF&#xD;
      induction and 2) the frequency of ventricular tachycardia (VT)/VF events in patients&#xD;
      undergoing implantation of an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) remain unknown.&#xD;
      Analysis of the changes in sinus node cycle length during VF inductions in patients&#xD;
      undergoing the implantation of a dual chamber or triple chamber ICD, provide a unique&#xD;
      opportunity at looking at the autonomic changes that accompany VF.&#xD;

      Design: This is a prospective, non-randomized study. The purpose of the present study is 1)&#xD;
      to assess whether the changes in sinus node cycle length during VF induction following ICD&#xD;
      implant correlate with arterial BRG, and 2) to determine whether these changes, and thus&#xD;
      arterial BRG, predict BP recovery post-defibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSSIBLE BENEFITS: There are no specific potential benefits for subjects participating in&#xD;
      this study. Results from this study should greatly improve investigator's knowledge of VF and&#xD;
      BP control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSSIBLE RISKS &amp; DISCOMFORTS: The potential risks or discomforts are associated with the&#xD;
      assessment of arterial baroreflex gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitroprusside (NTP) infusion may result in significant drop in blood pressure, heart attack,&#xD;
      rhythm disturbances and stroke. The risks associated with phenylephrine (PE) infusion include&#xD;
      blood pressure elevation, heart attack, rhythm disturbances and stroke. The likelihood of&#xD;
      this is very small since the medications will be given in small, gradual doses with close&#xD;
      monitoring by study personnel and physicians. If significant blood pressure changes occur,&#xD;
      the medication will be stopped immediately. Stopping the medication will quickly reverse any&#xD;
      blood pressure changes since the drugs have a very short half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures: Arterial baroreflex gain measurements will be performed either at the&#xD;
      patient's bedside or in the electrophysiology laboratory as described below. BP will be&#xD;
      monitored using a non-invasive arterial tonometer (Colin, San Antonio, TX) if performed at&#xD;
      bedside, or a preexisting arterial line if performed in the laboratory. Logistical&#xD;
      considerations, such as timing, would be a reason for performing the assessment at the&#xD;
      bedside. The majority of the studies will be performed in the laboratory. This procedure will&#xD;
      take approximately 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTP will be injected into a peripheral vein as bolus infusion starting with 50mcg and&#xD;
      increasing in 50mcg increments. NTP administration will be stopped when a 20-30mmHg drop in&#xD;
      systolic or diastolic blood pressure is elicited. This will be followed by PE administration&#xD;
      as a bolus infusion starting with 50mcg and increasing in 50mcg increments. PE administration&#xD;
      will be stopped when an increase in systolic or diastolic BP of 10-20 mmHg above baseline is&#xD;
      elicited. If, at any time during drug infusion, systolic blood pressure decreases below&#xD;
      90mmHg or increases above 160mmHg, or if the subject complains of discomfort that could be&#xD;
      associated with blood pressure changes, the infusion will stop immediately. Specific&#xD;
      conditions will result in arterial BRG being assessed using only NTP or PE: 1) allergy to&#xD;
      NTP, or a systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;100 will exclude the use of NTP; 2) hypersensitivity&#xD;
      to phenylephrine products, narrow angle glaucoma or a SBP &gt;140mmHg will exclude the use of&#xD;
      PE. Drugs will be infused through existing venous access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial BRG will be determined as change in heart rate (HR)/change in diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (DBP) during drug infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following assessment of baroreflex gain, (patients will be moved to the laboratory if the&#xD;
      assessment was performed at bedside) patients will undergo their scheduled procedure. After&#xD;
      the implantation of their ICD, VF induction is performed for the assessment of the&#xD;
      defibrillation thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the VF episodes, changes in sinus node CL measured from the stored atrial electrogram&#xD;
      (EGM) from the implanted device will be recorded. Specifically, investigators will be&#xD;
      measuring the average CL over the last 5 seconds before defibrillation (VF-SNCL) and will be&#xD;
      comparing it with the average sinus node CL during the 5 seconds prior to VF induction&#xD;
      (Baseline-SNCL). In addition, continuous BP monitoring from an existing arterial line during&#xD;
      and following defibrillation will be stored onto a data recording system. BP recovery will be&#xD;
      defined as the difference in mean BP during the 5 seconds before defibrillation compared with&#xD;
      the first 30 seconds after successful defibrillation. Post-shock pacing will always be set at&#xD;
      40bpm in a VVI mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes in sinus node CL and BP recovery measurements will only be derived from the first&#xD;
      successful VF induction followed by successful VF termination. The induction of non-sustained&#xD;
      VF or VT will be considered grounds for withdrawal. On the other hand, the failure to induce&#xD;
      VF will not be considered grounds for withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 Month Follow-Up: Data will be gathered from scheduled and unscheduled ICD related hospital&#xD;
      visits for 12 months. All ICD related events will be monitored and recorded. Appropriate ICD&#xD;
      events will be defined as all events that required anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) or&#xD;
      defibrillation, and which were diagnosed by 2 independent electrophysiologists as being&#xD;
      ventricular in origin.&#xD;
