  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata is a medical condition, in which the hair falls out in patches. The hair can&#xD;
      fall out on the scalp or elsewhere on the face and body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alopecia areata is an autoimmune skin disease, which means that the immune system is&#xD;
      recognizing the hair follicles as foreign and attacking them, causing round patches of hair&#xD;
      loss. It can progress to total scalp hair loss (alopecia totalis) or complete body hair loss&#xD;
      (alopecia universalis). The scalp is the most commonly affected area, but the beard or any&#xD;
      hair-bearing site can be affected alone or together with the scalp. Alopecia areata occurs in&#xD;
      males and females of all ages, and is a highly unpredictable condition that tends to recur.&#xD;
      Alopecia areata can cause significant distress to both patients and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the aim to assess the effects of a new treatment called apremilast in patients&#xD;
      with alopecia areata. A total of 30 patients will be included in the study, which will run&#xD;
      for a total of 52 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study consisting of two phases.&#xD;
      A total of 30 subjects with moderate to severe alopecia areata (including universalis and&#xD;
      totalis) involving 50-100% of the scalp will be enrolled. A possible maximum of 15 patients&#xD;
      (approximately 7 patients each) with current episodes of AA totalis / universalis may be&#xD;
      included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, subjects will be randomized (2:1) to either receive apremilast or placebo for 24&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, eligible subjects will receive apremilast from Week 24 through Week 48. The&#xD;
      following subjects will be eligible to enter into Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects who received placebo in Phase 1 of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects who received apremilast in Phase 1 of the study, and who achieved a minimum of&#xD;
           50% regrowth (SALT50) at Week 24, compared to Baseline.&#xD;
