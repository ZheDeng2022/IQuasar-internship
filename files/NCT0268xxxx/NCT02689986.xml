      Prospective, non-randomized multicenter study on the safety and efficacy of combination&#xD;
      therapy with bendamustine and rituximab for chronic cold agglutinin disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is mediated by monoclonal cold-reactive autoantibodies&#xD;
      that bind to erythrocyte surface antigens, causing hemagglutination and complement-mediated&#xD;
      hemolysis. Anemia is severe in one-third of patients (hemoglobin level 8.0 g/dL or lower).&#xD;
      Cold-induced circulatory symptoms are present in more than 90% of patients and may be&#xD;
      disabling. CAD not associated with overt lymphoma or other disease has traditionally been&#xD;
      classified as primary or idiopathic. A monoclonal lymphoproliferative bone marrow disorder&#xD;
      can, however, be demonstrated by flow cytometry in 90% and by histology in approximately 75%&#xD;
      of these patients, characterized by clonal proliferation of CD20+, kappa+ B-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately two-thirds of the patients experience exacerbation during febrile illnesses.&#xD;
      During steady-state CAD, a majority of patients have low levels of complement proteins C3 and&#xD;
      C4 because of a continuous consumption. These low levels, in particular low C4 availability,&#xD;
      seem to be rate-limiting for hemolysis and prevent full-blown activation of the complement&#xD;
      cascade with C5 cleavage and intravascular hemolysis. During acute phase reaction, C3 and C4&#xD;
      levels increase due to an enhanced production, resulting in exacerbation of hemolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counseling on cold avoidance has been recommended as the treatment of choice for most&#xD;
      patients with primary CAD. A systematic review showed, however, that in more than 70% of&#xD;
      cases, the physician and/or the patient did not perceive such measures as sufficient). Many&#xD;
      standard therapies used in other autoimmune diseases or indolent lymphomas are inefficient,&#xD;
      e.g. corticosteroids, alkylating agents, interferon-α and, probably, purine analogue single&#xD;
      agent therapy. Treatment with the chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab has been&#xD;
      shown in prospective studies to induce remission in more than half of patients. Almost all&#xD;
      responses were partial, and the median response duration was less than one year. In a&#xD;
      subsequent, prospective non-randomized trial of fludarabine and rituximab combination therapy&#xD;
      in 29 patients, 22 patients (76%) responded, 6 (21%) achieving CR and 16 (55%) achieving PR.&#xD;
      Among 10 patients non-responsive to rituximab monotherapy, CR was observed after the&#xD;
      combination therapy in one patient and PR in six. Median increase in Hb level was 3.1 g/dL in&#xD;
      the responders and 4.0 g/dL among those who achieved CR. Median time to response was 4.0&#xD;
      months. Lower quartile of response duration was not reached after 33 months, and estimated&#xD;
      median response duration was more than 66 months. Targeting the pathogenic B-cell clone&#xD;
      efficiently seems important for the achievement of remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though the rituximab-based therapies have been a first major achievement in therapy for CAD,&#xD;
      some problems remain to be solved. First, a considerable number of patients do not respond to&#xD;
      rituximab monotherapy. Second, although the use of fludarabine and rituximab in combination&#xD;
      has resulted in high response rates and prolonged response duration, toxicity is significant&#xD;
      and there are still some non-responders. Third, the therapeutic approaches should probably be&#xD;
      individualized; e.g., fludarabine therapy may bring about problems in the younger patients&#xD;
      because of late-occurring adverse events and in the older ones because of short-term&#xD;
      hematologic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antineoplastic drug, bendamustine hydrochloride, combines the 2-chlorethylamine group of&#xD;
      the nitrogen mustard derived alkylating agents with the benzimidazole ring structures of the&#xD;
      purine analogue. Bendamustine has been shown to be highly active in a variety of&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorders. The combination of bendamustine and rituximab has produced&#xD;
      high overall and complete response rates and prolonged remissions with only moderate and&#xD;
      manageable toxicity in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, which is closely related to primary&#xD;
      CAD. In an attempt to improve on the therapeutic efficacy achieved with the rituximab-based&#xD;
      regimens and the toxicity profile of the fludarabine-rituximab combination, the investigators&#xD;
      want to study the safety and efficacy of bendamustine and rituximab combination therapy in&#xD;
      patients with primary CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, non-randomized multicenter trial designed to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of bendamustine and rituximab combination therapy in patients with CAD&#xD;
      requiring treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the low prevalence of CAD, it will be unrealistic to undertake a statistically&#xD;
      robust randomized study. The investigators aim to include 50 patients during a study period&#xD;
      of three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Study objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to assess safety and efficacy of combination therapy with bendamustine and&#xD;
      rituximab in patients with CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints: Rate of complete and partial responses, respectively. Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
      Time to response; time to best response; hematological toxicity grade 4; frequency of dose&#xD;
      reduction; response duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and the current&#xD;
      statutory requirements and legislation in the participating countries. The study has been&#xD;
      approved by the relevant Medical Research Ethics Committees, the Norwegian Medicines Agency&#xD;
      and the relevant regulatory authorities of each participating country. Data will be recorded&#xD;
      anonymously, but a numeric code will be assigned in order to be able to track the data. All&#xD;
      investigators as well as the ethics committees and relevant health authorities, however, will&#xD;
      have access to the source data. The principal investigator in each country will establish&#xD;
      monitoring of the study by an independent monitor as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, non-randomized international multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      In principle, individuals aged at least 18 years can be included, although enrollment of&#xD;
      patients younger than 40 years is unlikely due to the age-specific prevalence of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 The drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Rituximab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab is a humanized, chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody. Treatment with rituximab is&#xD;
      considered an established, not experimental therapy for CAD, and involved physicians and&#xD;
      nurses should be familiar with its administration, therapeutic and adverse effects and safety&#xD;
      issues. In particular, they should be able to identify and manage any infusion-related side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Bendamustine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bendamustine is the experimental drug of this trial, marketed by Mundipharma/Norpharma. The&#xD;
      drug is approved in the participating countries for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,&#xD;
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. It is a cytotoxic agent combining the&#xD;
      2-chlorethylamine group of the nitrogen mustard derived alkylating agents with the&#xD;
      benzimidazole ring structures of the purine nucleoside analogues. Precautions and warnings&#xD;
      include the possibility of myelosuppression, infections, skin reactions, caution in patients&#xD;
      with cardiac disorders, nausea, vomiting, tumor lysis syndrome (very unlikely in primary&#xD;
      CAD), anaphylaxis and extravasation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Inclusion of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination at inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 History.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and radiological examination Year of first occurrence of clinical symptoms is&#xD;
      registered along with data on hemolytic anemia, circulatory symptoms, cold- or fever-induced&#xD;
      exacerbation, previous therapies, lymph node enlargement and spleen enlargement (clinical&#xD;
      assessment). Chest radiograph and abdominal ultrasonography should be done if not already&#xD;
      performed during the last four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemolysis is detected and quantified based on Hb, MCV, reticulocyte count (x 109/L), LDH,&#xD;
      bilirubin and haptoglobin. These measurements should be done twice during the last two months&#xD;
      before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematological, biochemical and immunological assessments should be done once at inclusion + 2&#xD;
      weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WBC, leukocyte differential count, platelet count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Iron, transferrin (or TIBC), ferritin, cobalamine and folate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantification of IgM, IgG and IgA Serum electrophoresis for detection and&#xD;
           identification of monoclonal immunoglobulins (including immunofixation when appropriate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cold agglutinin titer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific direct antiglobulin test (DAT, direct Coombs' test), i.e. using polyspecific&#xD;
           antiserum, anti-C3d and anti-IgG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complement assessments (C3 and C4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CMV and VZV antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serological tests for hepatitis B and C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Freezing of 5 ml EDTA-blood for possible later DNA-based studies&#xD;
&#xD;
           5 Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment schedule Day 1: Rituximab; 375 mg/m2 Day 1-2: Bendamustine; dosage: see Section 5.2&#xD;
      Day 29: Rituximab; 375 mg/m2 Day 29-30: Bendamustine; dosage: see Section 5.2 and 5.4 Day 57:&#xD;
      Rituximab; 375 mg/m2 Day 57-58: Bendamustine; dosage: see Section 5.2 and 5.4 Day 85:&#xD;
      Rituximab; 375 mg/m2 Day 85-86: Bendamustine; dosage: see Section 5.2 and 5.4 5.2 Initial&#xD;
      bendamustine dose Patients with no previous cytotoxic therapy and no history of&#xD;
      myelosuppression receive bendamustin at an initial dose of 90 mg/m2 day 1 and 2 (dose level&#xD;
      A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients who have been previously treated with a fludarabine-containing regimen, the&#xD;
      initial bendamustine dose is 70 mg/m2 day 1 and 2 (dose level B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients who have previously received myelosuppressive agents other than purine analogues,&#xD;
      the choice of initial dose level A or B is based on an individualized assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bendamustine solution for infusion should be prepared according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations. The solution should be administered by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes.&#xD;
      Antiemetic prophylaxis is given according to local routines or based on an individualized&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab should be administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations and the&#xD;
      routines of the participating hospital. Rapid (90 minutes) infusion is allowed during cycle&#xD;
      2-4 provided there has been no infusion-related adverse event during the preceding rituximab&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For drug stability reasons, an in-line blood warmer should not be used for the infusion of&#xD;
      bendamustine or rituximab. The infusion solution should have room temperature; and the&#xD;
      patient, in particular the extremity chosen for infusion, should be kept warm during the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose adjustments&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of significant toxicity, the dose of bendamustine should be reduced as specified by&#xD;
      protocol. Any adverse event should be recorded in the appropriate CRF. For reporting of SAEs&#xD;
      and SUSARs, see Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Follow-up first 6 months after therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) The following measurements must be done monthly during the first six months after the last&#xD;
      cycle of any combination therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) All measurements listed in Paragraph 6.1.B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) In case of reduction of a previously elevated IgM level to the normal range, serum&#xD;
      electrophoresis and immunofixation should be performed at the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III) Number of blood transfusions after the previous monthly visit. B.) At the fourth monthly&#xD;
      visit after completion of the last combination therapy cycle, bone marrow biopsy and flow&#xD;
      cytometric immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate are performed.&#xD;
