  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many behavioral interventions designed to improve dietary patterns for ethnic and&#xD;
      racial/minority preschoolers have produced modest outcomes. A limitation of these&#xD;
      interventions include a failure to address key factors associated with dietary patterns for&#xD;
      these children, such as parental stress levels. Therefore, the identification of intervention&#xD;
      models that target these factors and are effective, acceptable, and feasible among parents of&#xD;
      young minority children is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to take part in this study because they are the parents of a child&#xD;
      that receives care at a Texas Children's Pediatrics (TCP) clinic where the study is being&#xD;
      done and their child's body mass index has been at or above the 85th percentile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the ease and acceptance of providing an&#xD;
      intervention for parents of children ages 2-5 years in the pediatric primary care clinic. The&#xD;
      purpose is to also assess how well the intervention works in improving the child's dietary&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty (30) subjects will be enrolled across three (3) TCP clinics where the study will take&#xD;
      place. Two types of participants will be recruited for this study: parent participants who&#xD;
      will receive the intervention and interventionist participants who will deliver the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected for this study includes 4 types: parent-report questionnaires, parent saliva&#xD;
      samples, parent-report of children's 24-hour food recall, and audio-recordings of&#xD;
      intervention sessions. Parent-report questionnaires will assess family demographic&#xD;
      information, parental stress, depression, and well-being as well as parental feeding&#xD;
      practices and child dietary food patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for Parent Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be randomized to the intervention (Group A-15 parents) or control condition&#xD;
      (Group B-15 parents). Parents who are randomized to the intervention group will then&#xD;
      participate in the 10-session SSC program that is co-led by a trained parent interventionist.&#xD;
      Sessions will be audio-recorded to allow intervention fidelity checks. Parents who are&#xD;
      randomized to the control condition will receive the SSC written handouts, which is enhanced&#xD;
      standard of care for parents who are seen in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects are assigned to Group A, they will participate in ten intervention sessions that&#xD;
      are conducted in the TCP clinic. During each session, subjects will be provided with&#xD;
      information about specific skills to improve their child's emotional health and dietary&#xD;
      patterns and their own stress levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects are assigned to Group B, they will receive written handouts about children's&#xD;
      dietary patterns and parent stress levels. They will be instructed to write goals and&#xD;
      document goal progress. This care plan is the standard practice and is presently implemented&#xD;
      in the site's TCP clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ten weeks, regardless of the group the subjects were assigned to, they will again&#xD;
      complete an interview about their child's dietary food patterns and questionnaires about&#xD;
      their own emotions/opinions of their parenting and child feeding practices. The subjects will&#xD;
      also be asked to collect their saliva at four time points on a single day at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for Interventionist Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six interventionist participants will be recruited. Those who indicate interest will meet&#xD;
      with the PI or a research staff member to obtain consent. They will then receive 40-hours of&#xD;
      training in the intervention provided by study staff. Intervention participants will deliver&#xD;
      one or more group intervention, which has 10 sessions.&#xD;

    <description>The Smart and Secure Children (SSC) program is a 10-week manualized intervention that uses a written validated curriculum. The program is group-based and co-led by peer leaders (Parent Leaders). Sessions are 90 minutes. Groups consist of a maximum of five parents. Parent Leaders facilitate conversations on the SSC program content by sharing real life application, experiences, and solutions. Parent Leaders receive a week-long leadership training to deliver the program and will be supervised by the PI who is a licensed clinical psychologist.</description>
