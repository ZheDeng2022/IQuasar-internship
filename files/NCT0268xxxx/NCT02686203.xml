      evaluating The Investigational Therapy effects on quality of life, pain and patient's&#xD;
      clinical status in adult cancer patients with solid tumors who are no longer candidates for&#xD;
      active oncological therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and receive at least two 20-min treatment&#xD;
      sessions, 2 to 12 weeks apart, with the Investigational Therapy on healthy body tissue (i.e.&#xD;
      non-tumor region) of back of the hand and/or foot. Number of treatment sessions and treatment&#xD;
      frequency will be individualized per patient depending on patient's status as well as per the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating therapist, who is specialized and experienced with using the&#xD;
      Investigational Therapy. Patients will be assessed for quality of life, pain and patient's&#xD;
      clinical status according to acceptable clinical evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any time after the start of this study, it will be decided to initiate active&#xD;
      oncological treatment, the principal investigator or designee will inform the Sponsor. The&#xD;
      Sponsor will decide if the patient will stay or be discontinued from the study.&#xD;
