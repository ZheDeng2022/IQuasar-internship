    <textblock>
      Background: In 2010, approximately 39000 Canadians had end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and&#xD;
      the prevalence rate of dialysis has increased by 189% over the past 2 decades. The annual&#xD;
      mortality rate remains high at ~15%, and cardiovascular events are the leading cause of&#xD;
      death. Intensification of conventional dialysis schedules has been the major focus in recent&#xD;
      years. Currently, most Canadian dialysis patients receive conventional in-center hemodialysis&#xD;
      (CHD), which is administered as a 3-4 hour session 3/week. Recent research has focused on&#xD;
      home nocturnal hemodialysis (8 hours of hemodialysis at home for 5-6 nights/week), which may&#xD;
      have substantial cardiovascular benefits, including regression of left ventricular (LV)&#xD;
      hypertrophy, improved LV ejection fraction and enhanced blood pressure control. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      this dialysis modality is only feasible in a highly selected minority of ESRD patients who&#xD;
      can self-manage their dialysis treatment at home. In-center nocturnal hemodialysis (INHD),&#xD;
      administered as 7-8 hours of hemodialysis in hospital for 3nights/week, represents a&#xD;
      promising and practical alternative for many dialysis patients. In a Canadian Institutes for&#xD;
      Health Research (CIHR) supported cohort study, the investigators have recruited 67 patients&#xD;
      and have completed 1-year follow-up. There is a compelling need for longer-term follow-up,&#xD;
      since all the published randomized controlled trials are of short duration (6-12 months),&#xD;
      while renal replacement therapy is a life-long treatment. Furthermore, the observed large&#xD;
      variability of cardiac remodeling in individual ESRD patients remains poorly understood.&#xD;
      Therefore, the current study is an extended follow-up phase (5 years from enrollment) on the&#xD;
      completed 1-year follow-up period and the purpose of this study is to objectively evaluate&#xD;
      the long-term effects of more intensified hemodialysis treatment which the INHD modality&#xD;
      offers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for Long-term and Generalizable Data: In contrast to the seminal Alberta trial which&#xD;
      showed a significant LV mass reduction with home nocturnal hemodialysis, the recently&#xD;
      reported Frequent Hemodialysis Network Nocturnal Trial demonstrated only a trend toward&#xD;
      reduction in LV mass. It is likely that the highly selected participants, inadequate trial&#xD;
      power and duration (12 months) account for the observed results. Currently, it is unknown&#xD;
      whether INHD, which is less intensive but more feasible for most ESRD patients, is associated&#xD;
      with similar cardiovascular benefits in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the long-term effects of INHD on (i) LV mass; (ii) global and regional LV&#xD;
           systolic and diastolic function; (iii) myocardial tissue characteristics; (iv) left&#xD;
           atrial structure and function; (v) selected cardiovascular biomarkers in ESRD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the determinants and mechanisms of cardiac remodeling in ESRD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Conversion to INHD is associated with sustained improvements in cardiovascular&#xD;
      structure and function, as compared to conventional hemodialysis (CHD) in patients with&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Population: This will be a 2-centre, prospective, longitudinal cohort study&#xD;
      of 67 adult ESRD patients (INHD subjects and CHD controls) enrolled in the original study.&#xD;
      All eligible participants who provide consent will undergo cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) examination and bloodwork at 5 years since enrollment in the study. Other follow-up&#xD;
      procedures include the following -electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiogram, ambulatory&#xD;
      blood pressure monitoring, lateral x-ray of the aorta, and completion of questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: The primary endpoint is the change in LV mass over 5 years, as measured by cardiac&#xD;
      MRI. Secondary endpoints include LV size, global and regional diastolic and systolic&#xD;
      function, left atrial size and function, changes in myocardial tissue characteristics, blood&#xD;
      pressure, serum troponin, norepinephrine, Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), high sensitivity&#xD;
      C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6, matrix metalloproteinases, fibroblast growth&#xD;
      factor-23, fetuin-A, transforming growth factor-beta, connective tissue growth factor,&#xD;
      clinical events, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The provision of an enhanced dialysis regimen has emerged as the most promising&#xD;
      avenue through which to modify the dismal cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving&#xD;
      chronic hemodialysis. INHD represents a means of administering such therapy to a broad&#xD;
      spectrum of dialysis patients for whom home therapies would not be feasible. This study will&#xD;
      be the first to precisely define the long-term cardiac effects of intensified dialysis and to&#xD;
      elucidate the mechanisms of cardiac remodeling in ESRD, using cardiac MRI and other novel&#xD;
      biomarkers. These important observational findings may have a major impact on the optimal&#xD;
      management and outcome of ESRD patients in the real world.&#xD;
