    <textblock>
      From 1999 onwards, Deep Brain Stimulation [DBS] has been proposed as an alternative to&#xD;
      capsulotomy in refractory cases of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder [OCD]. More recently,&#xD;
      several studies with DBS in patients with major depression have been initiated. In Belgium,&#xD;
      there is currently a reimbursement for devices for DBS for OCD, but not for rechargeable&#xD;
      neurostimulators, in these OCD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although rechargeable neurostimulators are widely used in spinal cord stimulation for pain&#xD;
      and DBS for movement disorders, they have not yet been used in DBS for psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      population. Several possible problems might arise with the use of rechargeable&#xD;
      neurostimulators in this highly specific population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study with a before-after design, we would like to determine if the use&#xD;
      of rechargeable neurostimulators is effective, applicable and safe and capable of diminishing&#xD;
      the need for neurostimulator replacement procedures.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder [OCD] is a psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of&#xD;
      2% which is mainly characterized by obsessional ideas and compulsive behaviours and rituals.&#xD;
      Many patients show improvement under cognitive behavioural and/or pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
      A minority of patients is refractory to all available therapy and may benefit from&#xD;
      capsulotomy1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 1999 onwards, Deep Brain Stimulation [DBS] has been proposed as an alternative to&#xD;
      capsulotomy in refractory cases of OCD (2,3). In Belgium, there is currently a reimbursement&#xD;
      for devices for DBS for OCD, but not for rechargeable neurostimulators, in these OCD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with DBS for OCD need very frequent replacements of their neurostimulators&#xD;
      (Medtronic Synergy 7427 ® [Synergy], Medtronic Kinetra 7428 ® [Kinetra] , Medtronic Activa PC&#xD;
      37601 ® [Activa PC] ), due to end-of-life of the batteries. This results in frequent&#xD;
      re-interventions, probably causing discomfort for the patient, wound problems and infections&#xD;
      due to revision surgery scar tissue, hardware problems and increasing costs for the public&#xD;
      health system (consultations, hardware devices, surgery and its complications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new type of neurostimulators with an externally rechargeable battery has been developed&#xD;
      recently. The manufacturer estimates the longevity of these devices to be 9 years. These&#xD;
      products are in conformity with the essential requirements of Directive 1999/5/EC on Radio&#xD;
      and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment and Directive 90/385/EEC on Active Implantable&#xD;
      Medical Devices. Currently they have a CE mark only for the indication of DBS for Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease and Essential Tremor, but not for DBS for psychiatric disorders such as OCD.&#xD;
      Therefore, up till now they cannot be used in patients treated with DBS for OCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this physician-initiated study is trying to investigate whether the use of this&#xD;
      new rechargeable neurostimulator is effective and safe in DBS treated OCD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the present study is that the implantation and use of rechargeable&#xD;
      neurostimulators in OCD patients treated with DBS is (1) effective, (2) applicable, (3) safe&#xD;
      and (4) decreases the need of neurostimulator replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prove the hypothesis, the following objectives are aimed in our study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           -To test whether DBS using rechargeable neurostimulators is effective on psychiatric&#xD;
           symptoms as compared to DBS using non-rechargeable neurostimulators in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Applicability:&#xD;
&#xD;
           -To investigate whether this specific patient population is capable of recharging the&#xD;
           rechargeable neurostimulators properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
           -To document possible side effects of DBS for OCD using rechargeable neurostimulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Capability of diminishing the need of neurostimulator replacement:&#xD;
&#xD;
           -To investigate whether discomfort and risks of the frequent neurostimulator&#xD;
           replacements due to battery end-of-life can be diminished by the use of the rechargeable&#xD;
           neurostimulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the Neurosurgery and Psychiatry consultation, eligible patients are informed about&#xD;
           the present study. As soon as informed consent is obtained, the next time the battery of&#xD;
           the non-rechargeable neurostimulator reaches its end-of-life and elective replacement is&#xD;
           planned, a rechargeable neurostimulator and (if needed) the extension leads adaptors&#xD;
           necessary to connect these neurostimulators with the existing extension leads will be&#xD;
           implanted instead of a new non-rechargeable neurostimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After informed consent is obtained, at every consultation before and after implantation&#xD;
           of the rechargeable neurostimulator the parameters as stated in the primary and&#xD;
           secondary endpoints' sections will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           TRIAL INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main trial intervention of this study will be the implantation of one rechargeable&#xD;
           neurostimulator instead of the currently used non-rechargeable neurostimulator(s) and&#xD;
           surgical closure of one of the existing abdominal wall cavities (the so-called&#xD;
           &quot;pockets&quot;). It may be necessary to tunnel the extension cable from one side to another&#xD;
           within the thoracic or abdominal wall. Thereby, we may provoke extension cable loops&#xD;
           which may provoke undesirable stimulation when passing through a magnetic field. However&#xD;
           this risk seems smaller than the risk of dissecting the electrode and replacing the&#xD;
           extension cable to the other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This intervention can be done under general or local anaesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING&#xD;
&#xD;
           All adverse events are noted before and after implantation of the rechargeable&#xD;
           neurostimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Below is a list of possible adverse events with both non-rechargeable and rechargeable&#xD;
           neurostimulators for DBS in OCD:&#xD;

           Below is a list of possible adverse events with rechargeable but not with&#xD;
           nonrechargeable neurostimulators for DBS in OCD:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A heating sensation over the neurostimulator during recharging&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Local skin irritation over the neurostimulator during or after recharging&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hardware failure of the recharger including breakage of the recharger fixation&#xD;
                belt.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Insufficient quality of the connection for energy transfer between the rechargeable&#xD;
                neurostimulator and the recharger.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The battery of the rechargeable stimulator always needs to be recharged before it&#xD;
                is totally empty. After more than one episode of a totally empty battery further&#xD;
                proper functioning of the neurostimulator nor replacement within the proposed study&#xD;
                design cannot be guaranteed by the constructor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A committee consisting of the principle investigators will decide whether an adverse&#xD;
           event is definitely, probably, possibly or not an adverse event due to the system for&#xD;
           DBS for OCD. All expected and unexpected adverse events will be noted and published.&#xD;
&#xD;
           BIOSTATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Paired statistical tests for continuous data (A, f, PW, number of consultations,) and&#xD;
           for ordinal data (Y-BOCS, GAF, HAM-A, HAM-D, BDI) pre- and post-implantation, as well as&#xD;
           descriptive statistics for continuous data (number of recharging sessions, number of&#xD;
           battery status controls, battery longevity, preferred stimulator type at replacement),&#xD;
           will be used. No power calculation is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ETHICS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Approval of the UZ/KU Leuven Ethics Committee, working after the ICH-GCP principles,&#xD;
           will be asked for. All data will be collected in an objective, careful and precise&#xD;
           manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All risks will be kept as low as possible with a meticulous implantation procedure and a&#xD;
           careful clinical evaluation before and after implantation. Participation in the study is&#xD;
           completely voluntary.&#xD;
