    <description>The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) was used for patients between the ages of 6 months and 2 years. The FLACC scale is a validated scale that measures pain in patients who are awake or asleep based on a composite score of observations of facial expression, tonicity in legs, activity scores, the presence of crying, and whether the participant is consolable. Each category is scored on a 0 to 2 scale, which results in a total possible score of 0-10. Assessment of the behavioral score are relaxed and comfortable (0), mild discomfort (1-3), moderate pain (4-6), and severe discomfort/pain (7-10). The Neonatal Infant Pain range from 0-7 The NIPS was used for patients 0 to &lt; 6 months.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Is male or female &lt;2 years of age at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must weigh at least 3 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Is scheduled to have a surgical procedure for which opioid analgesia will be needed to&#xD;
             manage postoperative pain for at least 18 hours following intraoperative and/or&#xD;
             postoperative IV analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Is generally healthy as documented by medical history; physical examination&#xD;
             (including, but not limited to, the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and&#xD;
             central nervous systems); vital sign assessments; 12-lead electrocardiograms (EKGs);&#xD;
             clinical laboratory assessments; and general observations. Any abnormalities or&#xD;
             deviations from the acceptable range that might be considered clinically relevant by&#xD;
             the study physician or investigator will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, agreed&#xD;
             upon by the Principal Investigator (or sub-investigator), and documented in study&#xD;
             files before enrolling the subject in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject's parent or guardian has been informed of the nature of the study and has&#xD;
             provided written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Postoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is anticipated to require an analgesic regimen using a short-acting opioid&#xD;
             (non-oxycodone or non-oxymorphone) analgesic after surgery (according to standard of&#xD;
             care (SOC) as defined in the protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Is an inpatient expected to be hospitalized for 24 hours after dosing with study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has an indwelling access catheter for blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For Groups A and B: Has demonstrated signs of tolerating oral intake. All infants and&#xD;
             children should be able to demonstrate strong suck and swallow reflexes and neurologic&#xD;
             alertness and stability sufficient to handle oral secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Prior to administration of oxymorphone HCl oral solution, for Groups A and B, had&#xD;
             demonstrated the ability to tolerate clear liquids, following surgery according to the&#xD;
             SOC at each institution. All infants and children should be able to demonstrate strong&#xD;
             suck and swallow reflexes and neurologic alertness and stability sufficient to handle&#xD;
             oral secretions. The ability to tolerate small amounts (1 to 2 oz.) of clear liquids&#xD;
             without emesis (over 30 to 60 minutes) would support readiness for study participation&#xD;
             and oral intake once the physician has ordered the diet advanced to clear liquids and&#xD;
             the subject has ingested fluids by mouth without nausea or vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will not be eligible to participate in the&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has the presence or history of a clinically significant disorder involving the&#xD;
             cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, immunologic, hematologic,&#xD;
             endocrine, or nervous system(s) or psychiatric disease that would contraindicate&#xD;
             participation, as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has any clinical laboratory test result outside the accepted range that has been&#xD;
             confirmed upon re-examination and deemed to be clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has a clinically significant illness or condition any time before dosing with study&#xD;
             drug that would contraindicate participation, as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has a life expectancy &lt;8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For age groups A and B: Has a malabsorption, gastroenterologic, or abdominal condition&#xD;
             that would interfere with the absorption of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has evidence of increased intracranial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has a respiratory condition requiring intubation or resulting in active bronchiolitis,&#xD;
             asthma, stridor, or difficulty breathing due to congestion and increased nasal&#xD;
             secretions, including oxygen (O2) saturation ≤92%.&#xD;

             until enrollment into the study but will be restricted during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject (and/or mother if subject is nursing) has received preoperative opioids for&#xD;
             more than 72 consecutive hours.&#xD;

        <title>Assessment of Pain Using the Age Appropriate Scale, Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) or the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS).</title>
        <description>The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) was used for patients between the ages of 6 months and 2 years. The FLACC scale is a validated scale that measures pain in patients who are awake or asleep based on a composite score of observations of facial expression, tonicity in legs, activity scores, the presence of crying, and whether the participant is consolable. Each category is scored on a 0 to 2 scale, which results in a total possible score of 0-10. Assessment of the behavioral score are relaxed and comfortable (0), mild discomfort (1-3), moderate pain (4-6), and severe discomfort/pain (7-10). The Neonatal Infant Pain range from 0-7 The NIPS was used for patients 0 to &lt; 6 months.</description>
        <time_frame>Single Dose Phase: at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6 and 8 hours post dose. Multiple Dose Phase: every 0.5 hours up to 24 hours post first dose.</time_frame>
        <population>Single Dose Phase: Evaluable population =all subjects who received at least 1 dose of drug and provided at least 4 hrs of post-dose assessments and at least 3 PK assessments. Multiple dose Phase: Intent to-treat (ITT) population =all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and completed at least 1 post-dose pain intensity assessment. Due to safety concerns, raised by the IDMC, efficacy analyses were not conducted.</population>

          <title>Assessment of Pain Using the Age Appropriate Scale, Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) or the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS).</title>
          <description>The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) was used for patients between the ages of 6 months and 2 years. The FLACC scale is a validated scale that measures pain in patients who are awake or asleep based on a composite score of observations of facial expression, tonicity in legs, activity scores, the presence of crying, and whether the participant is consolable. Each category is scored on a 0 to 2 scale, which results in a total possible score of 0-10. Assessment of the behavioral score are relaxed and comfortable (0), mild discomfort (1-3), moderate pain (4-6), and severe discomfort/pain (7-10). The Neonatal Infant Pain range from 0-7 The NIPS was used for patients 0 to &lt; 6 months.</description>
          <population>Single Dose Phase: Evaluable population =all subjects who received at least 1 dose of drug and provided at least 4 hrs of post-dose assessments and at least 3 PK assessments. Multiple dose Phase: Intent to-treat (ITT) population =all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and completed at least 1 post-dose pain intensity assessment. Due to safety concerns, raised by the IDMC, efficacy analyses were not conducted.</population>
