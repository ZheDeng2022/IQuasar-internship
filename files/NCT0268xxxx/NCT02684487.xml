      Sepsis is a clinical entity that complicates infection. Without early recognition and timely&#xD;
      management, it can rapidly progress to severe sepsis, septic shock, and culminate in multiple&#xD;

      little is known about the impact of vitamin D3 (vitD3) supplementation in this patient&#xD;
      population. As such, the investigators propose a randomized, double-blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that early, rapid correction of low vitamin D&#xD;
      status, as an adjunct to established treatment guidelines, will improve clinical outcomes and&#xD;

      Sepsis is a clinical entity that complicates infections [1]. Without early recognition and&#xD;
      timely management, it can rapidly progress to severe sepsis, septic shock, and culminate in&#xD;
      multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The incidence of severe sepsis is between 300 to 1000&#xD;
      cases per 100,000 persons [2] and is projected to increase annually due to an aging&#xD;
      population, increasing burden of chronic disease, and greater use of invasive procedures,&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and immunosuppressive agents [3]. Severe sepsis is the leading cause of&#xD;
      mortality in critically ill patients, with healthcare costs exceeding $16 billion annually&#xD;
      [4]. Despite evolving clinical guidelines for sepsis [5-7], and intense research, only a&#xD;
      modest reduction in case fatality rates has been documented over the last two decades [8].&#xD;
      Aside from early administration of antibiotics, there is no effective stand-alone or adjuvant&#xD;
      pharmacological intervention to improve survival in patients with severe sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of immune dysfunction precipitated by an inciting infection is thought to&#xD;
      correlate with the severity of sepsis. Recently, key cells of the immune system were shown to&#xD;
      express the vitamin D receptor (VDR) [9]. Additionally, macrophages and neutrophils activated&#xD;
      through VDR up-regulate expression of endogenous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are&#xD;
      active against a broad spectrum of infectious agents [10]. AMPs, influenced by vitamin D&#xD;
      status, likely represent an important first-line of defense against microbial invasion. While&#xD;
      circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) is the most abundant vitamin D metabolite [11], under&#xD;
      normal circumstances, 85-90% of 25OHD is tightly bound to vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and&#xD;
      is unavailable to activate innate immune responses during acute stress [12]. The remaining&#xD;
      10-15% is more readily bioavailable (b25OHD), and is composed of the free and albumin-bound&#xD;
      components of 25OHD. Fluid loading, albumin wasting, and increased DBP expression during&#xD;
      critical illness may affect 25OHD homeostasis [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low vitamin D status (25OHD &lt;20ng/mL) is associated with increased mortality in critical&#xD;
      illness [14]. Forty to 70% of septic patients have low vitamin D status [15-17], yet little&#xD;
      is known about the impact of vitamin D3 (vitD3) supplementation in this patient population.&#xD;
      As such, the investigators propose a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that early, rapid correction of low vitamin D status, as an adjunct to&#xD;
      established treatment guidelines, will improve clinical outcomes and measurably alter immune&#xD;
      profile in patients with severe sepsis. Patients will be assigned to a single dose of vitD3&#xD;
      (400,000 IU) or placebo (n=300/arm) within 24 hours of new-onset severe sepsis, followed by&#xD;
      weekly doses of vitD3 (25,000 IU) or placebo, respectively, up to 90 days to assess clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and key biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: To determine if early administration of vitD3 (vs placebo) improves clinical outcomes&#xD;
      in patients with low vitamin D status and severe sepsis. Hypothesis 1a: Early vitD3 decreases&#xD;
      90-day mortality after onset of severe sepsis (Primary Outcome). Hypothesis 1b: Early vitD3&#xD;
      decreases sequential organ failure assessment scores in the first 5 days after onset of&#xD;
      severe sepsis. Hypothesis 1c: Early vitD3 decreases non-home discharge rate in those who&#xD;
      survive severe sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To determine if early administration of vitD3 (vs placebo) modulates b25OHD, AMPs, and&#xD;
      key cytokines in patients with low vitamin D status and severe sepsis. Hypothesis 2a: Early&#xD;
      vitD3 increases b25OHD in the first 5 days after the onset of severe sepsis. Hypothesis 2b:&#xD;
      Early vitD3 increases expression of AMPs, cathelicidin (LL-37) and β-defensin (hBD-2).&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2c: Early vitD3 decreases pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6) and increases&#xD;
      anti-immunoparalytic cytokine (IL-10, IFN-γ) expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe sepsis is a significant public health problem with limited treatment options. A 2010&#xD;
      NIH workshop on sepsis identified deep gaps in understanding innate host immune responses in&#xD;
      sepsis and emphasized the need for novel therapies [18]. The proposed trial is well powered&#xD;
      to investigate whether immunomodulation with vitD3 improves survival after severe sepsis. By&#xD;
      optimizing endogenous host responses to infection, the investigators anticipate that vitD3&#xD;
      supplementation will augment the life-saving impact of current therapies for severe sepsis.&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators will investigate several vitamin D-related biomarkers, which may&#xD;
      identify future therapeutic targets. The trial will be performed by a highly-experienced team&#xD;
      that includes experts in vitamin D, sepsis, critical care, and clinical trials; they have&#xD;
      successfully carried out several clinical studies of vitamin D in critically ill patients.&#xD;
