      This is a proof of concept study. The aim of this study is to assess a device measuring&#xD;
      rheological properties of human sputum of four populations :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 patients with Broncho Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 patients with asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 patients with cystic fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 healthy volunteers.&#xD;

      This study includes two visits to 48 hours apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with COPD or cystic fibrosis will have a spontaneous expectoration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then all study participants will have an induced expectoration with hypertonic salin&#xD;
           solution (4.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second visit :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with COPD or cystic fibrosis will have a spontaneous expectoration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then, patients with COPD, asthma and healthy volunteers will have an induced&#xD;
           expectoration with hypertonic salin solution (4.5%). Patients with cystic fibrosis will&#xD;
           have a spontaneous expectoration 1 hour after an RhDNAse nebulization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control spirometry will be perform before each expectoration and during induced&#xD;
      expectoration if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sputum sample collected will be homogenized and then divided into two equal volumes in&#xD;
      order to perform two separate rheological measurements of 15 minutes.&#xD;
