  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment selection for breast cancer is still largely empiric and guided by large randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials on populations of patients. This approach is inadequate for the selection of&#xD;
      individualized chemotherapy regimens. Estimates of benefits for individuals are&#xD;
      extrapolations from the effects seen in these large trials, and do not necessarily apply to&#xD;
      individual patients. The revolution in genomics promises to transform oncology care. By&#xD;
      better defining cancer subtypes, a better understanding of breast cancer biology should help&#xD;
      to guide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The up-front phase we have decide to adopt play a pivotal role as it is useful for testing a&#xD;
      targeted therapeutic drug such as olaparib wich also requires development of new biomarkers&#xD;
      which may be useful for future studies. With this approach it could be possible to&#xD;
      demonstrate drug target or biomarker effect in clinical setting and models the relationship&#xD;
      between the pharmacodynamics and the pharmacokinetics. Additional benefits of this approach&#xD;
      include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It could facilitate rational drug selection, identify therapeutic failures early, and&#xD;
           compress timelines for anticancer drug development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It could provide initial rationale and guiding principles for further drug development&#xD;
           based on studies in humans (rather than xenografts, where tissues of one species are&#xD;
           transplanted to another species).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As it focuses on extensively characterizing how a drug works and whether it hits its&#xD;
           intended target (including molecular imaging studies) in a limited number of patients it&#xD;
           could yield results that would optimally inform and expedite the subsequent development&#xD;
           of molecularly-targeted agents&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Clinically or radiologically measurable or evaluable disease defined as: presence of&#xD;
             bidimensionally or unidimensionally measurable breast lesion by physical or&#xD;
             radiological examination.&#xD;

          5. Progesterone receptor = 0 for ARM A only&#xD;
