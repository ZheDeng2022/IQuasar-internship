  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amblyopia is an impairment in spatial vision caused by asymmetry in the quality of visual&#xD;
      input across the two eyes during childhood. It is difficult to treat in adulthood because the&#xD;
      visual system becomes less &quot;plastic&quot; (able to learn) with age. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to determine whether five to ten days of visual deprivation--living in complete darkness--can&#xD;
      enhance plasticity in the visual cortex and thereby facilitate the learning that is needed to&#xD;
      recover visual function in amblyopic adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An asymmetry in the visual input across the eyes early in postnatal life causes amblyopia,&#xD;
      the most common basis of uni-ocular blindness in humans. If uncorrected, amblyopia results in&#xD;
      the unaffected eye controlling the binocular visual cortex, while the ability of the affected&#xD;
      eye to stimulate cortical neurons may weaken to the point of functional blindness. Previous&#xD;
      attempts to recover vision in adult amblyopes have had limited success, and the investigators&#xD;
      propose this is due in large part to the significant reduction of synaptic plasticity that&#xD;
      occurs during cortical development. The investigators propose that optimal recovery from&#xD;
      amblyopia in adulthood is a two stage process that requires 1) the reactivation of plasticity&#xD;
      in the adult amblyopic cortex (permissive step) and 2) focused visual experience to stimulate&#xD;
      perceptual learning (instructive step).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Elizabeth Quinlan lab at the University of Maryland has recently shown that binocular&#xD;
      visual deprivation in adulthood enhances synaptic plasticity in the adult cortex of&#xD;
      experimental animals in as little as three days. In addition, binocular visual deprivation&#xD;
      prior to repetitive visual experience stimulates the recovery of spatial acuity in an animal&#xD;
      model of deep amblyopia. Here the investigators propose to translate this finding to the&#xD;
      treatment of amblyopia in humans. The investigators propose to use binocular visual&#xD;
      deprivation to promote synaptic plasticity in the amblyopic visual cortex, followed by visual&#xD;
      perceptual learning through vision therapy homework, to stimulate the recovery of visual&#xD;
      function. While visual perceptual learning has been previously shown to enhance visual&#xD;
      function in amblyopic adults, the gains are slow and modest. The investigators predict that&#xD;
      &quot;pre-treatment&quot; of the amblyopic visual system with binocular visual deprivation will enhance&#xD;
      the magnitude and/or time course of learning-induced recovery from amblyopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four adult amblyopes, age 18 or older, will be recruited for the study. The&#xD;
      investigators will exclude amblyopes with strabismus history because the treatment has not&#xD;
      been designed to improve binocular alignment (motor fusion). Thus, amblyopes will be form&#xD;
      deprivation amblyopes, especially form deprivation due to anisometropia, with moderate (20/30&#xD;
      to 20/80) or severe (20/100 to 20/400) acuity in the affected eye. Screening will include an&#xD;
      extensive application, telephone interview of two personal references, comprehensive visual&#xD;
      examination, and in-person interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be fitted with new ophthalmics if indicated and followed for several weeks&#xD;
      to allow their amblyopia to stabilize. Their visual function will be assessed behaviorally&#xD;
      and also by direct measurement of neural activity using visually evoked potentials (VEPs).&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to one of three groups. One group will be sequestered for zero&#xD;
      days, one for five continuous days, and one for ten continuous days. Participants in the five&#xD;
      or ten day sequestration groups will undergo sequestration in groups of two, three, or four.&#xD;
      After sequestration visual function will again be assessed, both behaviorally and with VEP.&#xD;
      All participants will then undergo 8 weeks (3 weeks before, 5 weeks after) of vision&#xD;
      treatment for amblyopia, based on video game play. Vision testing will occur regularly during&#xD;
      this period and for 10 months thereafter. A third VEP scan will be done at the end of the 8&#xD;
      week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this work would transform therapy for adult amblyopia, and focus attention on&#xD;
      the importance of incorporating methods to enhance synaptic plasticity as an adjunct to&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, the insight gained from this work could be extended to strabismus,&#xD;
      eye movement control disorders, and the restoration of optimal neural function after damage&#xD;
      from stroke or other traumatic brain injury. The proposed experiment will also pioneer the&#xD;
      use of binocular visual deprivation in human amblyopes, and develop standards for&#xD;
      implementation, participant sequestration and care.&#xD;
