  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite surgical and medical innovation have reduced mortality rates in cardiac surgery, the&#xD;
      disease severity and operative procedural complexity have increased and morbidity rate is&#xD;
      still high. Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, redefined in cardiac surgery&#xD;
      &quot;post-cardioplegic injury&quot; (2) as a whole of ischemia-reperfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass and&#xD;
      surgical trauma, has been recognized as a significant contributor to mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      I/R injury is classified as reversible or irreversible. Reversible injury includes&#xD;
      arrhythmias, edema, vascular dysfunction and contractile stunning expressed as low output&#xD;
      syndrome without cell death and without apparent signs of infarction or other serum injury&#xD;
      markers. Irreversible reperfusion injury includes apoptosis and necrosis. I/R injury is a&#xD;
      complex process associated with increase of radical, oxidant and cytokines production,&#xD;
      complement and neutrophil activation and endothelial activation leading to microvascular&#xD;
      dysfunction and deterioration of coronary flow reserve. In the hypoxic heart increase&#xD;
      anaerobic lactate production, K+ efflux and membrane depolarization. The intracellular Na+&#xD;
      concentration rises as a consequence of slow Na+ channels inactivation and the induction of&#xD;
      voltage-gated Na+ channel late current component (late INA). Intracellular Na++ accumulation&#xD;
      enhanced activity of reversed-mode Na+-Ca++ exchanger causing intracellular Ca++ overload and&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction. Therefore inhibition of late INA has been shown to be&#xD;
      cardioprotective. Ranolazine, an FDA-approval antianginal and anti-ischemic agent, high&#xD;
      selective blocker of late INA, inhibits the late sodium current in myocardial ischemia,&#xD;
      decreases Na+ and Ca2+ overload and improves left ventricular function in experimental animal&#xD;
      models. For this reason it was also adjuncted to cardioplegia improving diastolic function in&#xD;
      isolate Langerdoff-perfused rat hearts. The authors test the hypothesis that ranolazine&#xD;
      improve myocardical protection in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery with&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB).&#xD;

      We aim to perform a prospective, single-center, investigator-initiated, randomized (1:1),&#xD;
      blinded, placebo-controlled study. The patients undergoing elective and complete CABG&#xD;
      revascularization performed by the same surgeon, will be randomized in two different groups&#xD;
      to receive, in the three days before surgery, Ranolazine at a dose of 375 mg twice daily or&#xD;
      placebo. After the enrollement in the research according the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, the randomization list will be computer-generated. The study participants, the&#xD;
      reserchers responsible for data reporting and analysis and the ecocardiographers will be&#xD;
      blinded to the treatment that each patient will receive. In a previous phase all data for the&#xD;
      recruitment will be considered and registered before surgery: basic clinical parameters (age,&#xD;
      gender, height, weight, body surface, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure,&#xD;
      mean heart rate); medical history (diabetes mellitus type I or II, smoking status, chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary desease, systemic arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, family history&#xD;
      of cardiovascular events, angina, percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (AMI), previous cardiac surgery, chronic peripheral arterial disease, cerebral&#xD;
      ischemia, bleeding and chronic renal failure); basic hematologic parameters (creatinine,&#xD;
      glucose, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell counts and equation, platelets number,&#xD;
      aPTT, INR); baseline transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) parameters (left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection function (LVEF), left ventricular volumes, left ventricular regional wall motion,&#xD;
      diastolic function (mitral inflow velocities as Early diastolic velocity (E), late diastolic&#xD;
      velocity with atrial contraction (A), and deceleration time (DT), early diastolic velocity&#xD;
      (e') and late diastolic velocity with atrial contraction (a') using tissue Doppler imaging,&#xD;
      pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), valvulopathy and aortic desease); assestment of&#xD;
      risk stratification according to different scores (New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes,&#xD;
      Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Angina grading scale, EUROSCORE II, American Society og&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system); preoperative patient therapy.&#xD;
      In a following phase laboratory, hemodynamic and imaging evaluation will be carried out&#xD;
      during and subsequent to CABG surgery. Through a coronary sinus inserted catheter will be&#xD;
      dosed Troponine I (TnI) immediately before CPB and after the release of aortic cross clamp,&#xD;
      about 10 minutes after the end of reperfusion. TnI will be also dosed at arrival on intensive&#xD;
      care unit and 6, 12, 24, 48 h after unclamping of the aorta. Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      simultaneously from the radial artery and the coronary sinus before starting CPB and after&#xD;
      removal of aortic cross clamp to evaluate lactates extraction, oxygen consumption (VO2) and&#xD;
      oxygen extraction (O2ER), and C-reactive protein (CRP) pre and post-CPB. Hemodynamic&#xD;
      measurements will be obtained by an arterial and a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) inserted&#xD;
      before surgery, and will include arterial pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean pressure),&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary artery wedge pressure&#xD;
      (PAWP), cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), left&#xD;
      ventricular stroke work (LVSW), left stroke volume variaton (LSVV) and coronary artery&#xD;
      perfusion pressure (CPP); these measurements will be conducted 30 min after intubation, after&#xD;
      sternotomy, 10 min after protamin, after sternosynthesis, at arrival in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 h after CPB. Lastly a transesophageal echocardiographic study will be&#xD;
      performed by two expert echocardiographers following the protocols of the Society of&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (21) and American Society of Echocardiography (22). Left&#xD;
      ventricle myocardial performance index, LVEF, left ventricular regional wall motion, E/A&#xD;
      ratio, E', E/E' and deceleration time (DT) of mitral inflow velocity will be measured; these&#xD;
      measurements will be obteined 30 minute after intubation before sternotomy and ten minute&#xD;
      after protamin. All collected data will be entered into a database in Excel format.&#xD;
