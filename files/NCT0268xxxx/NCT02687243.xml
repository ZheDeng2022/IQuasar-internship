  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anxiety (PA) affects up to 5 million children in North America each year and is&#xD;
      associated with adverse medical, psychological, and behavioral effects. Children who are&#xD;
      highly anxious often require more medications during surgical procedures and take longer to&#xD;
      recover. While many attempts have been made to reduce PA in children, existing interventions&#xD;
      are limited by their expense and time intensive nature. Thus, the current lack of effective&#xD;
      and efficient methods of reducing anxiety in children before and after surgery has prompted&#xD;
      us to develop and propose to test a new intervention. The investigators have developed a&#xD;
      novel,interactive tablet based Virtual Reality program, StoryTelling Medicine (STM), to help&#xD;
      reduce anxiety in children undergoing elective surgery, and its associated negative effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STM is an age appropriate, customizable program to prepare children for complex surgical&#xD;
      procedures by guiding them through the hospital settings. The investigators will examine if&#xD;
      STM is effective in reducing PA and its adverse effects in children undergoing surgery. If&#xD;
      effective, STM has the potential to improve children's and families' surgical experiences,&#xD;
      and reduce health problems in the hospital setting and beyond.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with PA not only suffer physically and emotionally, but some of them will develop&#xD;
      fear of physicians and healthcare providers. These children tend to avoid future medical care&#xD;
      and can lead to increased suffering for the child and their family, as well as higher rates&#xD;
      of morbidity and health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of research evaluating the effects of AudioVisual interventions in&#xD;
      reducing perioperative anxiety in children undergoing surgery. To date, no one has examined&#xD;
      the physiological effects of PA or interventions designed to reduce it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past 2 years, the investigators have conducted 3 pilot studies that have examined the&#xD;
      stability of perioperative anxiety in children (n=90) and parents, as well as the feasibility&#xD;
      of our recruitment and testing protocol, and to pilot test the interactive tablet-based&#xD;
      application. The investigators have established that PA can be reliably and validly measured&#xD;
      in children and that the rate of participant recruitment, data collection, website adherence&#xD;
      and follow-up protocols for the proposed study are feasible and acceptable. The investigators&#xD;
      will now progress to conduct the randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT will be the first to examine the effects of STM in reducing PA and perioperative&#xD;
      outcomes in children undergoing elective surgery. Therefore, the investigators will include&#xD;
      both behavioral (i.e., observer- and self-rated) and biological measures of stress (i.e.,&#xD;
      heart rate, salivary cortisol) to further our understanding of the impact of STM on PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike existing interventions, the customizable STM program provides a simulated hospital&#xD;
      environment that can not only educate, but also increase children's coping abilities to&#xD;
      better prepare them for surgery. In addition to reducing children's PA, it can also play an&#xD;
      important role in reducing parental anxiety by preparing parents with a knowledge tool to&#xD;
      support their child throughout the surgical process.The investigators believe that STM is a&#xD;
      promising tool to improve children's health and ease the familial and societal costs of PA in&#xD;
      an easy and cost-effective way. Given that many children in other hospitals do not receive&#xD;
      adequate preoperative preparation, STM has the potential to provide proper perioperative care&#xD;
      for every child in need.&#xD;
