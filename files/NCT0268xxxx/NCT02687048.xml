    <textblock>
      Falls have significant consequences for older adults, including fracture, disability, and&#xD;
      death (1). Risk factors for falls include both impaired physical and cognitive function (1).&#xD;
      Thus, older adults with chronic stroke are at significant risk for falls (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise is an evidence-based approach for reducing falls risk, even among those who are&#xD;
      living with stroke-related impairments (3,4). More recently, mindfulness based meditation is&#xD;
      gaining recognition for its positive impact on both physical and cognitive health (6,7).&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators hypothesize that combining exercise with mindful meditation may be&#xD;
      greater impact on falls risk reduction as compared with exercise alone. To begin exploring&#xD;
      our hypothesis, we will conduct a 12-week proof-of-concept study among 20 older adults with&#xD;
      chronic stroke (i.e., suffered their first clinical stroke &gt; or = 12 months prior to study&#xD;
      entry). Participants will be randomly allocated to either: 1) exercise; or 2) exercise +&#xD;
      mindfulness based meditation. Outcomes will include measures of mobility, balance, and&#xD;
      cognitive function.&#xD;

      Purpose: The intent of this study is to investigate whether, in stroke survivors, the&#xD;
      combination of the Otago exercise program (OEP) and mindfulness based meditation (MBM) may be&#xD;
      more efficacious than OEP alone with respect to balance, mobility, and executive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the exercise home program combined with MBM&#xD;
      will be more efficacious than exercise alone in improving balance, mobility, and executive&#xD;
      functions for stroke survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year, over 40 000 Canadians experience a stroke and approximately 40% of stroke&#xD;
      survivors are left with moderate to severe impairment (1). Balance problems are common for&#xD;
      stroke survivors and have been implicated with diminished function in activities of daily&#xD;
      living (ADLs) and mobility and associated with an increased risk of falls(2). Stroke&#xD;
      survivors have been shown to have greater postural sway and altered weight distribution&#xD;
      patterns, especially when moving their weight in the direction of the affected lower&#xD;
      extremity(3). These patterns have been seen in static and dynamic balance and at all levels&#xD;
      of function(2, 3). Falls are commonly seen after stroke and even less serious falls may lead&#xD;
      to stroke survivors developing a fear of falling and limiting activity(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Executive function is also commonly negatively affected by stroke. Executive functions refer&#xD;
      to high-level cognitive processes including initiation, planning, sequencing, monitoring,&#xD;
      solving novel problems, modifying behaviour in light of new information, performing two tasks&#xD;
      concurrently, generating strategies, inhibition and working memory(5, 6). Between 19-75% of&#xD;
      stroke survivors show impaired executive function skills (6, 7). Persistent deficits in&#xD;
      executive function of stroke survivors negatively impact recovery with an elevated risk of&#xD;
      functional dependence, failure to return to work, and poor social participation (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to conduct a 12-week proof-of-concept study to examine whether&#xD;
      mindfulness based meditation (MBM) combined with a home-based exercise program is more&#xD;
      efficacious than exercise alone on improving mobility, balance and executive function&#xD;
      outcomes for stroke survivors. Should the results find MBM to enhance outcomes for CVA&#xD;
      survivors, MBM could be considered more broadly for applications within physical therapy. It&#xD;
      is a low cost and low risk intervention option. All participants in the study will benefit&#xD;
      from receiving instruction in the home exercise routine. Half of the participants will&#xD;
      further benefit from learning about MBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Otago exercise program (OEP) is an evidence-based falls prevention home-based program.&#xD;
      The original OEP randomized controlled trials (4 in total) reduced falls among of OEP&#xD;
      community dwelling adults aged 65 to 96 years by 35% (8,9,10). The OEP consists of muscle&#xD;
      strengthening and balance exercises (to be done 3x/week) and a walking plan (to be done&#xD;
      2x/week) (9). The OEP has been found to improve both falls and executive function in older&#xD;
      adults at risk of falls(11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research suggests that mindfulness based meditation (MBM) positively impacts cognitive&#xD;
      functions including attention, memory and executive function (12). MBM is a process of&#xD;
      &quot;training the mind to function in a nonjudgmental minute to minute mode&quot; (13). MBM aims to&#xD;
      reorient the individual to the present and broaden self awareness(14). MBM has many forms&#xD;
      including Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy&#xD;
      (MBCT), Mantra-based meditation and Buddhist-based mindfulness practices(12). All forms of&#xD;
      MBM promote attention to internal experiences such as bodily sensations, thoughts, emotions,&#xD;
      sights or sounds(15). There is emerging evidence that MBM may increase hippocampal volume and&#xD;
      functional brain connectivity as well as promoting cognitive function(16, 17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies involving a variety of meditation techniques have reported preliminary&#xD;
      positive effects on attention, memory, executive function, processing speed and&#xD;
      cognition(12). The majority of the studies have been small and did not contain control&#xD;
      groups(14). Randomized controlled trials (RCT) of meditation techniques reported low dropout&#xD;
      rates and high compliance rates(12). Three RCTs with outcome measures for executive function&#xD;
      have demonstrated significant improvement(18,19,20) but other studies were not able to&#xD;
      demonstrate significant findings(12). A systematic review of the benefits of&#xD;
      mindfulness-based interventions following transient ischemic attack and stroke included four&#xD;
      studies with results demonstrating a positive trend in favor of the benefits across a range&#xD;
      of outcomes including anxiety, depression, mental fatigue, blood pressure, perceived health&#xD;
      and quality of life(21). An unexpected finding in a PhD thesis investigating Mindfulness&#xD;
      Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) was an improvement in mobility and upper extremity outcome&#xD;
      measures(22). There is a need for further RCTs investigating the potential benefits of&#xD;
      meditation techniques and the proposed study will be novel in terms of the combined potential&#xD;
      of an exercise program with meditation for stroke survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should this research project reveal that MBM in combination with OEP has improved outcomes&#xD;
      with respect to balance, mobility and executive function, physiotherapists and other medical&#xD;
      clinicians may wish to prescribe this therapeutic combination to optimize the effectiveness&#xD;
      of balance retraining for stroke survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess whether the participants who participate in 12 weeks of both OEP and MBM show&#xD;
           more significant improvements in the following measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Timed up and Go and dual task Timed up and Go&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Short Physical Performance battery (SPPB) testing for balance&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 4 metre walk test for mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Stroop colour word test for response inhibition&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Trail making tests for set shifting&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Digit symbol substitution test for cognition&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore whether mindful attention is impacted by either or both interventions as&#xD;
           measured by the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale(23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty community-dwelling stroke survivor participants who have expressed interest in future&#xD;
      studies will be recruited by mail. Individuals unable to walk 6 metres independently, are&#xD;
      unable to follow simple instruction, have a chronic medical condition that would limit&#xD;
      exercise participant or have a concurrent condition such as dementia will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study. Individuals will also be excluded if they are unable to read or speak English or&#xD;
      are aphasic. Participants will be randomized to either: 1) OEP only (EX protocol); or 2) OEP&#xD;
      + MBM (EX Plus protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the EX protocol, all participants will receive a revised version of the Otago&#xD;
      individualized home-based exercise program; a trained physiotherapist will make 5 home visits&#xD;
      throughout the 12-week intervention. The participants will be expected to complete the home&#xD;
      exercises as prescribed three times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants selected to the EX Plus group will receive MBM coaching via 6 one-hour small&#xD;
      group sessions with an experienced meditation instructor. These participants will be expected&#xD;
      to practice at home following online audio recordings and written instructions a minimum of&#xD;
      five times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures for physiological falls risk, mobility, cognitive function and mindfulness&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measures between groups will be conducted using the independent samples T-test.&#xD;
      Between-group differences at 12 weeks will be compared by multiple linear regression&#xD;
      analysis. Experimental group and baseline scores will be included as covariates; alpha will&#xD;
      be set at &lt; 0.05. For between group comparisons, a percentage change score will be assigned&#xD;
      for variables that are significantly different at baseline.&#xD;
