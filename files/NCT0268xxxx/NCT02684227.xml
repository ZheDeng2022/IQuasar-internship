    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well enzalutamide, carboplatin, and paclitaxel work in&#xD;
      treating patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer that is stage III-IV or has come back.&#xD;
      Androgens can cause the growth of endometrioid endometrial cancer. Antihormone therapy, such&#xD;
      as enzalutamide may lessen the amount of androgen made by the body. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading. Giving enzalutamide, carboplatin, and paclitaxel may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the clinical activity of combination enzalutamide, carboplatin and paclitaxel&#xD;
      represented as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Objective tumor response (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]). Ib. The&#xD;
      proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months after initiating&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To quantify protein and phosphoprotein expression of androgen receptor (AR) and&#xD;
      AR-response genes following enzalutamide treatment in match-paired pre and post treatment&#xD;
      tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety and feasibility of daily enzalutamide given in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in women with advanced stage or recurrent endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine median response duration. II. Estimate progression free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival. III. Evaluate for presence of pharmacokinetic interaction between enzalutamide and&#xD;
      paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Correlate molecular results, including AR receptor expression and activation, to clinical&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Identify potential agents to synergize with enzalutamide based on pathways activated&#xD;
      after enzalutamide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) alone on days 1-28. Patients then&#xD;
      receive enzalutamide PO QD on days 1-21, paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1,&#xD;
      and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6-9 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

    <description>Summary statistics and boxplots will be used to describe the distributions of expression of AR and its downstream signaling effectors. We will similarly describe the change from baseline for AR and its downstream signaling effectors. If the usual normality assumptions hold we will use a paired t-test to test for significant changes in expression from baseline to follow-up assessment, otherwise we will test for changes with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For those variables measured on a nominal scale we will cross-tabulate values at baseline and follow-up assessments, and we will test for differences between baseline and follow-up assessments with a Fisher's exact test. A time dependent covariate analysis may be conducted to assess the impact of changes in biomarker expression on progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have symptomatic, uncontrolled spinal cord compression and/or brain&#xD;
             metastases; a scan to confirm absence of brain metastasis is not required; patients&#xD;
             can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before/ during study if these were&#xD;
             started at least 28 days prior to entry&#xD;

          -  As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic&#xD;
             diseases (e.g., severe hepatic impairment, interstitial lung disease [bilateral,&#xD;
             diffuse, parenchymal lung disease], uncontrolled chronic renal diseases&#xD;
             [glomerulonephritis, nephritic syndrome, Fanconi syndrome or renal tubular acidosis]),&#xD;
