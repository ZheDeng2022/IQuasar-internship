  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a registry study. This is an observational, non-randomized, open, long-term project&#xD;
      to collect biological samples (e.g. tissue and blood samples) in addition to clinical&#xD;
      information and laboratory test results, from end-stage patients who undergo LVAD&#xD;
      implantation and/or heart transplantation. There are no investigational treatments, drug or&#xD;
      procedures associated with participation in registry activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will not immediately influence the course of treatment for any patient.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After informed consent is obtained from the patient, the blood samples will be obtained&#xD;
      either during a procedure from access lines inserted for the procedure or they will be drawn&#xD;
      when other ordered lab work is done at specific time points. While blood samples collection&#xD;
      is preferred, it is not required, and the decision to collect blood samples will be left to&#xD;
      the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue samples will be obtained at the time of LVAD implantation by keeping the part of&#xD;
           the left ventricular apex that the surgeon is removing in order to place the inflow&#xD;
           cannula of the LVAD. No extra tissue sample other than the tissue that has to be removed&#xD;
           as a part of a standard LVAD operation needs to be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue samples will be acquired from the failing heart at the time of heart&#xD;
           transplantation, after it has been excised and a donor heart has been implanted in its&#xD;
           place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control tissue samples will be acquired intraoperatively during cardiac surgery wherein&#xD;
           any amount of excised tissue is routinely discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some cases, when a patient has an existing LVAD implant for destination therapy, and is&#xD;
      not eligible for cardiac transplant, and is not scheduled for cardiac surgery in the&#xD;
      foreseeable future, the patient will be approached for consent for blood samples. In&#xD;
      addition, consent to obtain intraoperative tissue samples is requested in the event cardiac&#xD;
      surgery occurs and/or the device is explanted for any reason in the future.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be in one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.1. Patients must be eligible for a -&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  LVAD implantation or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Heart transplantation 1.2. Patients must be scheduled for another type of cardiac&#xD;
                  surgery during which tissue is excised that would normally be discarded after&#xD;
                  surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.3. Patients must have a VAD already implanted as destination therapy with no cardiac&#xD;
             surgery scheduled at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must agree to one or more blood and/or cardiac tissue sample donation(s), and&#xD;
             longterm storage of these biological samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be &gt; 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
