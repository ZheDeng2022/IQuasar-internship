      This study for a six-month trials, Randomized, open, and parallel comparison before and after&#xD;
      its own, Stage test includes screening stage, treatment period and follow-up period. In&#xD;
      accordance with chronic wound criteria for the patient, By producing the principle of random&#xD;
      number, Were randomly divided into UC-MSCs Gel group or Gel group, The researchers according&#xD;
      to the situation of wound healing time and decided to use the secondary treatment, To observe&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy and safety.&#xD;
