      The investigators evaluate if there are radiation dosimetric parameters for the prediction of&#xD;
      biochemical and clinical hypothyroidism after intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)&#xD;
      for non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients include those with previously untreated non-metastatic nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma (NPC) who will receive only one course of radical IMRT with or without adjunct&#xD;
      chemotherapy for their NPC as curative treatment. Patients who have a history of any thyroid&#xD;
      disorders, pituitary disorders, prior thyroid surgery or a drug history of thyroxine (T4) or&#xD;
      triiodothyronine (T3) are excluded. Patients who have a history of radiation therapy to other&#xD;
      areas are also excluded. Pretreatment investigations and workup include serum hematology,&#xD;
      biochemistry, antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen (VCA) and&#xD;
      early antigen (EA), fabrication of customized head and neck thermoplastic cast for subsequent&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck region down to&#xD;
      mid-thoracic region in IMRT treatment position with 3mm thickness, as well as T1-sequence,&#xD;
      T2-sequence and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck&#xD;
      region by a 3-tesla scanner with the images co-registered with the planning head and neck CT&#xD;
      images for detailed target and organ-at-risk (OAR) delineation and IMRT planning. A separate&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced CT scan of the thorax and abdomen will also be performed to rule out&#xD;
      distant metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gross tumour volumes of both the primary tumour (GTV-P) and the radiologically involved&#xD;
      cervical nodes (GTV-N) are outlined on the planning CT images with the aid of co-registered&#xD;
      MRI images. Subsequently clinical target volume (CTV-70) and planning target volume&#xD;
      containing CTV-70 with a 3mm margin (PTV-70) are generated to take into account the&#xD;
      microscopic disease spread, physiological body motions and set-up errors respectively.&#xD;
      Another CTV-66 encompassing the high risk areas including the posterior half of the maxillary&#xD;
      sinuses, nasal cavities, parapharyngeal spaces, styloid processes, basi-occiput,&#xD;
      basi-sphenoid, clivus, foramina rotunda and ovale, pterygopalatine fossae, pterygomaxillary&#xD;
      fissures, infra-orbital fissures, cavernous sinuses and level Ib and level V nodal stations&#xD;
      is also contoured. A corresponding PTV-66 with a 3mm margin encompassing CTV-66 is created by&#xD;
      boolean operations of the treatment planning system which is also used for IMRT optimization&#xD;
      and planning. All OARs including brainstem, spinal cord, globes, optic nerves, optic chiasm,&#xD;
      lenses, temporomandibular joints, temporal lobes, auditory nerves, cochleae, mandible, oral&#xD;
      cavity, larynx, parotid glands, vestibules, pituitary and thyroid are to be contoured&#xD;
      manually. During IMRT optimization, the maximum dose of brainstem, optic nerves and chiasm&#xD;
      must be &lt;=54 Gy (allowing 0.1cc brainstem &lt;60 Gy) and spinal cord &lt;=45 Gy (allowing 0.1cc&#xD;
      spinal cord &lt;48 Gy). Efforts will also made to limit mean dose of parotid glands to 26 Gy&#xD;
      whenever possible and dose to the lenses and temporal lobes as low as reasonably achieved&#xD;
      without compromising dose coverage to the PTVs. No dose constraint is to be given to the&#xD;
      thyroid and pituitary during optimization of all IMRT plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 7 to 9 field IMRT plan delivered by step-and-shoot technique with a 6-megavoltage linear&#xD;
      accelerator will be generated by Eclipse Treatment Planning System. A total dose of 70 Gy and&#xD;
      66 Gy was prescribed to PTV-70 and PTV-66 respectively, all in 33 to 35 fractions over 6.5 to&#xD;
      7 weeks by simultaneous accelerated radiation therapy technique (SMART). The whole neck was&#xD;
      irradiated with IMRT and no matching anterior field to the lower neck was noted. This has&#xD;
      been the standard prescription and practice in our institution for the past 10 years.&#xD;
      Positional verification with on-board imaging was performed before IMRT commencement. It was&#xD;
      repeated again daily immediately before the first 3 fractions of IMRT and then weekly&#xD;
      afterwards during the whole course of IMRT, to track any anteroposterior and lateral body&#xD;
      displacements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients had routine 6-site nasopharyngeal biopsies at 8 weeks after IMRT to confirm&#xD;
      local clinical remission. Repeated nasopharyngeal biopsies were performed at 10 weeks and 12&#xD;
      weeks after IMRT if residual tumour cells were still observed in previous post-IMRT&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal biopsies. Additional radiation therapy in the form of intracavitary&#xD;
      brachytherapy, stereotactic radiation therapy or IMRT would be given if patients developed&#xD;
      local persistence at 12 weeks after IMRT. For patients confirmed to be local clinical&#xD;
      remission, they received regular clinical follow up and imaging surveillance every 3 to 4&#xD;
      months for the 1st year after IMRT, then every 4 to 6 months for the 2nd and 3rd year and&#xD;
      yearly afterwards to monitor for any treatment-related chronic complications and relapse.&#xD;
      Blood tests for thyroid function tests including free T4 and thyroid stimulating hormone&#xD;
      (TSH) will be arranged at least once yearly to monitor post-IMRT hypothyroidism. Biochemical&#xD;
      hypothyroidism is defined as either elevation of TSH above the upper normal limit or reduced&#xD;
      free T4 below the lower normal limit or both, without the presence of clinical symptoms of&#xD;
      hypothyroidism. Clinical hypothyroidism is defined as the presence of biochemical&#xD;
      abnormalities of thyroid function same as that defined for biochemical hypothyroidism&#xD;
      together with the presence of clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism. Those who are found to&#xD;
      have clinical hypothyroidism will receive thyroxine supplement starting with 50 micrograms&#xD;
      daily with repeated serum thyroid function tests 2 to 3 months later followed by dose&#xD;
      titration if necessary, then every 6 to 12 months thereafter when therapeutic dosage was&#xD;
      reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression will be performed for dosimetric&#xD;
      predictors of biochemical and clinical hypothyroidism. All statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      performed by Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and statistical significance is&#xD;
      defined as p-value &lt;0.05 (two-sided).&#xD;
