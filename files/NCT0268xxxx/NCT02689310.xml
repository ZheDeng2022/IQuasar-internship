  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of leptospermum scoparium honey as a type of&#xD;
      dressing and/or debridement agent on stage III or IV pressure ulcers has an increased&#xD;
      efficacy and safety compared to the current treatment protocol that includes the use of&#xD;
      hydrogel/Vaseline, collagenase, and silver alginate dressings as the standard of care.&#xD;
      Utilizing a non-inferiority trial, it is expected that the use of leptospermum scoparium as a&#xD;
      treatment for Stage III and Stage IV pressure ulcers will not be inferior to the comparison&#xD;
      treatment of standard of care wound dressings. Moreover, this research design will enable the&#xD;
      research team to determine if the honey based dressings are equivalent to or superior to the&#xD;
      comparison treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators specific study objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Objectives: Determine if the use of honey as an alternative treatment will&#xD;
           reduce site inflammation/irritation and pain associated with pressure ulcers compared to&#xD;
           the standard treatment options. Specifically, the investigators will monitor patient&#xD;
           PUSH scores, Braden Risk Scale scores, granulation and/or epithelial tissue progression,&#xD;
           length of time to heal, patient pain assessments via the Wong Baker Face or Numeric&#xD;
           Scale, wound odors, and incidence of adverse events (measured by allergies, stinging&#xD;
           sensations, bacterial infections that warrant antibiotic intervention, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objective: Patients in the honey treatment group will have lower costs per&#xD;
           healed ulcer than patients in the standard collagenase treatment group.&#xD;

      Design: Non-inferiority Trial. This design is intended to demonstrate that Leptospermum&#xD;
      scoparium Honey treatment is no worse than the standard treatment for pressure ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the research team will administer all wound care treatments on all of the patients&#xD;
      in this research project. After initial evaluation and documentation of the presence of&#xD;
      pressure ulcers, patients with Stage III and Stage IV ulcers are randomized into the two&#xD;
      groups; treatment and control. Patients that develop nosocomial Stage III and Stage IV&#xD;
      pressure ulcers will also be included in this study and randomly placed into one of the&#xD;
      groups. The following protocol will be followed.&#xD;
