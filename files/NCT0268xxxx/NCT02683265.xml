  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel group study is&#xD;
      designed to evaluate Aptensio XR® compared to placebo in preschool age children with ADHD.&#xD;
      Male and female children ages 4 years, 0 months to 5 years, 8 months with a diagnosis of ADHD&#xD;
      (combined, inattentive or hyperactive/impulsive) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 6 phases in this study: a screening phase of up to 4 weeks, which will include&#xD;
      washout if applicable, an enrollment &amp; parent training phase lasting 2-4 weeks, an&#xD;
      eligibility phase of up to 2 weeks to determine eligibility for the open-label phase, a&#xD;
      6-week open-label dose titration phase, a 2 week double-blind phase for Aptensio XR®&#xD;
      responders, and a two-week follow-up call after study completion or early discontinuation to&#xD;
      assess for ongoing adverse events and concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 150 subjects will be enrolled in this trial to allow for subjects who improve&#xD;
      significantly during the behavior training phase and drop-outs. Once 74 subjects have&#xD;
      completed the double-blind phase, no additional subjects will be enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
      Subjects who are already enrolled at that time will be allowed to complete the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to establish that an optimal dose of Aptensio XR® will&#xD;
      result in a significant reduction in ADHD symptoms compared with placebo in children ages 4&#xD;
      to under 6 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale - 4th Edition (ADHD-RS-IV) Preschool Version Total Score change from end of open label phase (baseline) to end of double blind.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks: End of open label phase (Baseline) at study day 84 to end of double blind treatment at study day 98.</time_frame>
    <description>ADHD-RS-IV is 18-item scale incorporates each of the ADHD symptoms listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) regardless of assigned subtype. Scoring was based on the universally accepted symptom severity as recommended in the DSM-IV-TR manual on a 4-point scale: 0 = never or rarely, 1 = sometimes, 2 = often, and 3 = very often. The total score is the sum of the scores for all 18 items and could range from 0 (no impairment) to 54 (maximal impairment) for each administration per subject. Higher score means higher frequency and severity of symptoms.&#xD;
Trained clinicians administered the questionnaire to parents. The ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version was used to determine eligibility, optimal dosing and the efficacy of double blind treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks: End of open label phase (Baseline) at study day 84 to end of double blind treatment at study day 98.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale provides a global rating of illness severity during the trial. The subject is rated relative to the clinician's past experience with other subjects who have the same diagnosis. The CGI-S scale is 1 question and rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill subjects). A lower value a better the outcome.</description>

    <description>The scale provides a global rating of illness improvement during the trial. The subject is rated relative to the clinician's past experience with other subjects who have the same diagnosis. The CGI-I scale is 1 question, and rates improvement compared with a baseline visit using a 7-point scale. The range of responses are from 1 (very much improved) through 7 (very much worse).&#xD;

    <measure>Conners Early Childhood Behavior - Parent (Short) (EC BEH-P(S)) change in T-score from end of open label phase (baseline) to end of double blind</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks: End of open label phase (Baseline) at study day 84 to end of double blind treatment at study day 98.</time_frame>
    <description>Conners EC BEH-P(S) is an assessment tool used to obtain a parent's observations about his/her child's behavior. This tool is designed to assess a range of behavioral, emotional, &amp; social issues in young children. The tool consists of 47 items, responses to which are summarized in 6 behavioral scales &amp; 2 validity scales.&#xD;
Items on Conners assessment are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0-3. The ratings were converted to raw item scores in one of four ways: (1) score=rating, (2) reverse-scoring, (3) categorical scoring, &amp; (4) weighted scoring.&#xD;
Raw item scores were grouped, standardized, and/or compared to lookup tables for interpretation. Assessments were presented as T-scores &amp; percentiles: item raw scores for a given scale are added together; this raw sum is compared to age- and gender-matched normative data and converted to a T-score (&amp; percentile score). Higher scores indicate higher concerns</description>
