    <textblock>
      This is a 24-week, prospective, multi-center, open-label, randomized, investigator-initiated&#xD;
      pilot study to explore the effects of RBZ (0.5 mg) plus DEX implant (0.7 mg) PRN combination&#xD;
      therapy (n = 30) vs. DEX implant PRN monotherapy (n = 30) in pseudophakic eyes with&#xD;
      center-involved DME that have demonstrated prior incomplete response to 3-6 anti-VEGF&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

      1. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pseudophakic center-involved DME eyes with incomplete response to 3-6 anti-VEGF&#xD;
           injections (i.e., RBZ, BCZ or IAI) will have similar visual acuity gains, as assessed&#xD;
           with AUC analysis (change from baseline randomization (Time 0) BCVA letters through 24&#xD;
           weeks ± 1 week), with a combination treatment regimen consisting of RBZ (0.5 mg) and DEX&#xD;
           implant (0.7 mg) vs. a monotherapy treatment regimen with DEX implant (0.7 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Description of Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening (Visit 1): At this initial visit, the study doctor or delegate will explain&#xD;
           the study to the patient, answer all of their questions, and will ask them to sign an&#xD;
           informed consent form. If the patient agrees to participate in the study, the study&#xD;
           doctor or delegate will perform routine examinations; ask them questions about their&#xD;
           past medical history, current medical conditions, and all medication or treatments they&#xD;
           are receiving. If the patient is female, they may have a urine pregnancy test performed.&#xD;
           Patients will undergo your regular eye evaluations. If their glycosylated hemoglobin&#xD;
           (HbA1a) level is not available within 12-15 weeks of Visit 1 an HbA1c test will be&#xD;
           performed at screening. Patients will be assigned to one of two possible treatment&#xD;
           regimens (1.) combination consists of LUCENTIS® (0.5 mg) followed by OZURDEX® (0.7 mg)&#xD;
           0-8 days later or (2.) OZURDEX® (0.7 mg) monotherapy. This visit will last approximately&#xD;
           1-2 hours. Patients will always have the choice of receiving both medications at the&#xD;
           same time or split between 2 shorter visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline/Randomization (Visit 2): If patients are eligible to receive study treatment(s)&#xD;
           they will be scheduled for a baseline randomization study visit to allow collection of&#xD;
           eye exam data (intraocular pressure, inflammatory cells, abnormal blood vessels) and&#xD;
           ocular coherence tomography OCT. This is the same type of eye exam and OCT patients&#xD;
           typically undergo at a retina specialist's office. Additionally, patients will undergo a&#xD;
           special vision test and an intravenous fluorescein angiogram to assess retinal&#xD;
           circulation. This visit will last approximately 2 hours. The next study visit (Visit 3)&#xD;
           will be scheduled in 4-5 weeks. Someone from your study doctor's office will contact the&#xD;
           patient prior to the baseline visit to remind you of this next visit&#xD;
&#xD;
           Week 4 (Visit 3): This study visit will allow collection of eye exam data, vision, eye&#xD;
           pressure, and OCT. This visit will last approximately 1 hour. The next study visit&#xD;
           (Visit 4) will be scheduled in 4-5 weeks. Someone from the study doctor's office will&#xD;
           contact the patient prior to the visit to remind them of this next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Week 8 (Visit 4): This study visit will allow collection of eye exam data, vision, eye&#xD;
           pressure, and OCT. This visit will last approximately 1 hour. The next study visit&#xD;
           (Visit 5) will be scheduled in 4-5 weeks. Someone from the study doctor's office will&#xD;
           contact the patient prior to the visit to remind them of this next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Week 12 (Visit 5): This study visit will allow collection of eye exam data, vision, eye&#xD;
           pressure, and OCT. This visit will last approximately 1 hour. The next study visit&#xD;
           (Visit 6) will be scheduled in 4-5 weeks. Someone from the study doctor's office will&#xD;
           contact the patient prior to the visit to remind them of this next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Week 16 (Visit 6): This study visit will allow collection of eye exam data, vision, eye&#xD;
           pressure, and OCT. This visit will last approximately 1-2 hours. At this visit, the&#xD;
           study doctor will determine the need for retreatment with the patient's assigned study&#xD;
           treatment regimen. If they do not receive treatment, it is because the initial&#xD;
           treatments administered at the baseline (visit 2) are still working and patients will be&#xD;
           re-assessed for retreatment at study visit 7. The next study visit (Visit 7) will be&#xD;
           scheduled in 4-5 weeks. Someone from the study doctor's office will contact the patient&#xD;
           prior to their visit to remind them of this next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Week 20 (Visit 7): This study visit will allow collection of eye exam data, vision, eye&#xD;
           pressure, and OCT. This visit will last approximately 1-2 hours. At this visit, the&#xD;
           study doctor will determine the need for retreatment with the patient's assigned study&#xD;
           treatment regimen. If they do not receive treatment, it is because the initial&#xD;
           treatments administered at the baseline (visit 2) are still working and patients will be&#xD;
           re-assessed for retreatment at study visit 8. The next study visit (Visit 8) will be&#xD;
           scheduled in 4-5 weeks. Someone from the study doctor's office will contact the patient&#xD;
           prior to their visit to remind them of this next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Week 24 (Visit 8): This study visit will allow collection of eye exam data, vision, eye&#xD;
           pressure, and OCT. Additionally; patients will undergo intravenous fluorescein angiogram&#xD;
           to assess any changes in your retinal circulation status. This visit will last&#xD;
           approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-Randomization Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study eyes will be evaluated for retreatment at the week 16 and or week 20 study visits&#xD;
           based on BCVA and CST. If an eye experiences a prior treatment-related AE, retreatment&#xD;
           is at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Retreatments will be deferred if:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • BCVA letter score is ≥ 84 (20/20 or better) and the SD-OCT CST is &lt; the sex-specific&#xD;
           SD-OCT cut-offs below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Zeiss Cirrus: 290 µm in women and 305 µm in men&#xD;
&#xD;
           Retreatments will be administered if:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • VA letter score is &lt; 84 (worse than 20/20) and the SD-OCT CST is ≥ the sex-specific&#xD;
           SD-OCT cut-offs below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Zeiss Cirrus: 290 µm in women and 305 µm in men If at any time the investigators&#xD;
                wish to treat the study eye(s) with a DME treatment that is different from the&#xD;
                protocol treatment due to perceived failure or futility communication must be made&#xD;
                with the other study investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PATIENT WITHDRAWAL &amp; LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
           A study participant has the right to withdrawal from the study at any time. If a study&#xD;
           participant is considering withdrawal from the study, the lead investigator at each&#xD;
           respective site should personally discuss with the subject the reasons for&#xD;
           discontinuation and every effort should be made to accommodate the patient. Study&#xD;
           participants who withdraw will be asked to have a final closeout visit at which time the&#xD;
           testing described for the protocol visits will be performed. Study participants who have&#xD;
           an AE related to a study treatment or procedure will be asked to continue in follow-up&#xD;
           until the AE has resolved or stabilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Procedures to avoid perception undue influence&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lead investigator and co-investigators for each site will make initial contact in person&#xD;
      with the patient. In the informed consent process, the study will be explained to the&#xD;
      patients by a study coordinator and all questions of the patients will be answered. A consent&#xD;
      form will be given and patients will be given as much time as they need. If needed, the&#xD;
      patient may take home the consent form and decide later if they want to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Additionally, if the patient cannot read and understand English, a consent form will&#xD;
      be provided to them in a language that is understandable to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be assured that the standard of care will be given should the patients&#xD;
      choose not to participate in the study. This information is included in the informed consent&#xD;
      form and will help patients in their decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be instructed to contact the investigation if they have questions or&#xD;
      concerns regarding the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Statistic Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using SPSS Statistics software, with the level of statistical&#xD;
      significance set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single center, 12 month pilot study randomizing 40 DME eyes from 30 subjects 1:1 to BCZ&#xD;
      plus adjunctive DEX implant (i.e., BCZ (1.25 mg) at baseline and then monthly when&#xD;
      retreatment criteria was met except at months 5 and 10 when DEX implant (0.7 mg) was&#xD;
      administered 0.7 mg) or BCZ (1.25 mg monthly) demonstrated similar mean vision gains (+4.9 ±&#xD;
      12.3 ETDRS letters vs. +5.4 ± 10.7 ETDRS letters) but more effective resolution of central&#xD;
      subfield thickness (30 ± 100 µm vs. 45 ± 107 µm) with the combination regimen (Maturi RK,&#xD;
      2013; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01309451&#xD;
      http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT01309451). We estimate that a final sample size&#xD;
      of at least 20 eyes per study arm is required. Assuming a third of the study eyes may be lost&#xD;
      to follow-up we will require enrolment of 30 eyes per study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Safety Reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be documented and appropriately described. The severity of the&#xD;
      adverse event will be coded as mild, moderate, or severe; the association with the&#xD;
      intervention will be coded as not related, possibly related or related. The determination of&#xD;
      the severity and association will be decided by the principal investigator (PI). The PI for&#xD;
      this study will also be acting as the safety monitor, reviewing all adverse events. All&#xD;
      serious adverse events that are unexpected and potentially related to the research will be&#xD;
      reported in an expedited manner to the research ethical board, the other participating centre&#xD;
      and Health Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Confidentiality 10.1 Data Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      All documents relating to the study, including the protocol and data collected during the&#xD;
      trial, are the confidential property of the principal investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Patient Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will preserve the confidentiality of patients participating in the study by&#xD;
      identifying them at all times by their study number and will not use patients' names on CRFs&#xD;
      or other documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will only be identified on the study database and trial documentation by their&#xD;
      assigned study number. All data will be handled in accordance with the Federal Personal&#xD;
      Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (effective January 1, 2004) and all&#xD;
      applicable provincial privacy legislation.&#xD;
