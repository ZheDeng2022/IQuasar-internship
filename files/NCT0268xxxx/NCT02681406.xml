      Investigators will recruit 280 alcohol dependent patients in treatment programs in the&#xD;
      Philadelphia area to test the efficacy and cost efficiency of a smartphone based application&#xD;
      for treating alcohol addiction (ACHESS) with telephone monitoring and counseling (TMAC).&#xD;
      Participation in the study lasts for 18 months with research visits at baseline, 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months, 9 months, 12 months, and 18 months. The intervention lasts 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuing care is believed to be important in the effective management of patients with&#xD;
      alcohol use disorders. New smartphone technology provides a novel way to provide personalized&#xD;
      continuing care support. Dr. Gustafson and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin have&#xD;
      developed an addiction version of CHESS (ACHESS), an automated smart phone system that&#xD;
      provides a range of functions designed to directly support patients. In a recently completed&#xD;
      NIAAA-funded continuing care study, ACHESS produced better drinking outcomes with alcoholics&#xD;
      than treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator of the current study, Dr. Jim McKay, and his colleagues at the&#xD;
      Center of Continuum of Care in the Addictions have also developed a telephone-based approach&#xD;
      to continuing care, Telephone Monitoring and Counseling (TMC), which has demonstrated&#xD;
      efficacy in two randomized trials with alcohol-dependent patients. The TMC intervention is&#xD;
      delivered through telephone contacts between patients and counselors, and makes use of&#xD;
      information obtained in a brief assessment at the beginning of each call to determine the&#xD;
      content of the session and to trigger adaptive changes in level of care over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although both ACHESS and TMC use telephone technology, they have complementary strengths.&#xD;
      ACHESS provides a range of automated 24/7 recovery support services, but does not include&#xD;
      contact with a counselor. TMC, on the other hand, provides regular and sustained contact with&#xD;
      the same counselor, but does not provide support between calls. The future of continuing care&#xD;
      for alcohol use disorders is likely to involve both automated mobile technology and counselor&#xD;
      contact, but little is known about how best to integrate these services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this question, the study will feature a 2 x 2 design [ACHESS for 12 months&#xD;
      (yes/no) x TMC for 12 months (yes/no)]. With this design, we will determine whether adding&#xD;
      TMC to ACHESS produces superior outcomes to those obtained with TMC or ACHESS alone. This&#xD;
      design will also enable replication of prior findings, and will provide the first direct&#xD;
      comparison of TMC only vs. ACHESS only. In addition, economic analyses will be completed to&#xD;
      determine the cost and cost-effectiveness of each intervention and their combination. The&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned into one of the four conditions and followed for 18&#xD;
      months. The follow-ups will be at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months post-baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be 280 patients diagnosed with alcohol abuse who are in a substance abuse&#xD;
      treatment center in the Philadelphia area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks of the research are conceived to be minimal (e.g., possible embarrassment) and&#xD;
      consist of those incurred in providing self-report data on alcohol and drug-related history&#xD;
      and social and psychiatric problems. There are minimal medical risks associated with research&#xD;
      participation. There will be some risk of loss of confidentiality since the name, addresses&#xD;
      and phone numbers of three contact people will be recorded by the staff for subject tracking&#xD;
      purposes. However, all identifiable information will remain in a locked filling cabinet only&#xD;
      accessible by the principle investigator and study staff. No identifying information will be&#xD;
      programmed into the phone by the counselor. Although the participant is able to program&#xD;
      numbers into the smartphone once they receive one, the counselor will review several measures&#xD;
      for protecting the subjects' privacy, including password and pattern locks. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive at a minimum treatment as usual in the programs from which they will be recruited.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be percent days of heavy alcohol use (i.e., &gt; 5 drinks/day for men, &gt; 4 drinks/day for women) within each follow-up period. Studies have consistently supported the reliability and validity of the TLFB with alcohol dependent individuals. Frequency of heavy alcohol use was selected because alcohol-related problems are correlated with the frequency of heavy drinking days. This outcome is also sensitive to reductions in problematic or high risk use, which are particularly important in a disease management model.</description>
