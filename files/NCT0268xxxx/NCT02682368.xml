  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute gallbladder pathology and acute diverticulitis are common conditions met in emergency&#xD;
      departments and comprise the bulk of admissions throughout general surgical calls. Both&#xD;
      entities need imagistic description to tailor further management, which may be not readily&#xD;
      available at the moment of patient's presentation. These delays may lose the window of&#xD;
      opportunity for timed, quality decision making and may induce increased length of stay and&#xD;
      subsequent increased costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound scanning has become very popular over the last half century and the equipment has&#xD;
      become more compact, of a higher quality and less expensive, which has facilitated the growth&#xD;
      of point-of-care ultrasonography - POCUS - that is, ultrasound performed and interpreted by&#xD;
      the clinician at the bedside. The concept of an 'ultrasound stethoscope' is rapidly moving&#xD;
      from theory to reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of studies and case reports that are highlighting the advantages of POCUS,&#xD;
      but still common grounds need to be sought after. Some countries, like USA and Germany,&#xD;
      incorporate basic ultrasound in their resident's curriculum among different specialties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the author's knowledge and based on the literature, there are a few-second-to-none studies&#xD;
      regarding POCUS involving strictly the surgeons. The hypothesis of this study is that,&#xD;
      surgeon performed ultrasound can be as accurate as the radiologists' findings for basic&#xD;
      diagnostics in the aforementioned pathology, leading to real time decision making in the&#xD;
      benefit of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The closing remark is that by learning and doing these procedures the surgeon performing&#xD;
      POCUS doesn't undermine his/her radiologist colleague's authority and skill. The big picture&#xD;
      is that some basic tasks are transferrable and if used in an appropriate and methodical&#xD;
      manner the final common goal - the benefit of the patient - is readily achieved.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was accepted as a Master of Surgery Thesis by Research (MCh) at the Royal College&#xD;
      of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two parallel studies done at the same time:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. POCUSS-1 for acute biliary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. POCUSS-2 for suspected diverticulitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with suspected acute biliary disease or acute diverticulitis will undergo POCUS&#xD;
           performed by the surgeons enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These patients are recruited from either&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. emergency department&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. outpatients clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. ward consults&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will have the procedure explained to them and then will receive a leaflet with&#xD;
           the same information will be handed over. Consent will be obtained (verbal and written)&#xD;
           from the patients that wish to be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. POCUS is performed and data recorded on REDCap®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4a. The same patients will have a departmental imagistic investigation (ultrasound, CT)&#xD;
      reported by qualified radiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4b. In the event of emergency surgery without prior departmental imaging, POCUS will be&#xD;
      compared to the intra-operative findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Data will be collected and stored anonymously and processed with REDCap, Microsoft Excel,&#xD;
      IMB SPSS, R-studio&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCLAIMER:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific for this study, patient data will be anonymous and in line with General Data&#xD;
      Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 law. Data protection is designed by default. There&#xD;
      will be NO patients' personal name, surname, home address or date of birth needed or&#xD;
      uploaded. Each patient will be represented by an unique identification number provided by the&#xD;
      hospital. Only gender and age will be recorded as these will be necessary for the final data&#xD;
      analysis and results. Once the study has finished, the data will be erased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same rules will be applied in hospitals from other countries that will get involved in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
