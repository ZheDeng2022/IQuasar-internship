      Shoulder pain is very common. People receive injections in their shoulder for their painful&#xD;
      shoulder. However, investigators do not know which patient with shoulder pain responds best&#xD;
      to an injection in the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to use a &quot;Pull Test&quot; where the researcher will pull on the arm and resist&#xD;
      shoulder movement to investigate if it helps to determine which patients have better pain&#xD;
      relief with the shoulder injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in Anchorage, Alaska. There will be two phases in the study. For&#xD;
      each phase, the subjects will complete some questionnaires. Phase I &quot;Reliability Testing&quot;&#xD;
      will test how consistent two licensed physical therapists are giving shoulder examination&#xD;
      tests and the Pull Test. Phase II &quot;Pull Test&quot; will comprise shoulder examination findings,&#xD;
      including the Pull Test, done before and after one shoulder injection performed as normal&#xD;
      standard of care by a licensed physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase I of the study, up to 20 patients treated for shoulder pain will be recruited from&#xD;
      Advanced Physical Therapy. For Phase II of the study, up to 100 patients with shoulder pain&#xD;
      scheduled to have a shoulder injection will be asked by an investigator if they wish to&#xD;
      participate in the study until a number of 30 subjects qualify for the study. Phase II of the&#xD;
      study will include shoulder tests before and about 20 minutes after the injection and a 4- to&#xD;
      7-day, as well as a 6-week, phone follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics will be used to analyze the data.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS) is one of the most common causes of&#xD;
      shoulder pain. The subacromial-subdeltoid (SAD) bursa is regarded as a common potential&#xD;
      shoulder pain generator. Differentiating the specific acromio-humeral interval (AHI) tissues&#xD;
      responsible for pain generation is challenging and no specific clinical examination testing&#xD;
      exists to differentiate SAD bursa from the rotator cuff tendons as pain generators.&#xD;
      Corticosteroid injection (CSI) within the AHI is a mainstay of treatment for SAD bursitis and&#xD;
      rotator cuff tendinopathy. No study to date has examined a specific test associated with&#xD;
      successful responsiveness from a CSI targeting the SAD bursa in the AHI in subjects with&#xD;
      shoulder pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To investigate (1) Phase I: the reliability of the shoulder examination tests and of&#xD;
      the Pull Test; and (2) Phase II: if a positive shoulder traction test during resistive&#xD;
      shoulder abduction, the &quot;Pull Test&quot;, correlates with a successful outcome of an AHI CSI&#xD;
      targeting the SAD bursa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To evaluate: (1) the reliability of the Pull Test; (2) if a positive Pull Test&#xD;
      correlates with successful pain and satisfaction outcomes immediately following, 4 to 7 days&#xD;
      following, and 6 weeks following an AHI CSI targeting the SAD bursa in subjects with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal shoulder pain (3) if a positive Pull Test correlates with a successful&#xD;
      functional outcome 6 weeks following an AHI CSI targeting the SAD bursa in subjects with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal shoulder pain and (4) the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and&#xD;
      negative predictive values of the Pull Test to identify subjects with shoulder pain likely to&#xD;
      successfully respond to an AHI CSI targeting the SAD bursa&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Methodological and exploratory correlational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Phase I (reliability testing): A sample of convenience of up to 20 subjects treated&#xD;
      at Advanced Physical Therapy of Alaska for shoulder pain will be recruited to participate.&#xD;
      Two licensed physical therapists will test the reliability of the shoulder examination tests&#xD;
      and of the Pull Test. Phase II (Pull Test): A consecutive sample of convenience of subjects&#xD;
      treated by physicians from Advanced Pain Centers of Alaska for musculoskeletal shoulder pain&#xD;
      and scheduled for a subacromial CSI as part of their care will be asked to participate in the&#xD;
      study. The study will end when a minimum of 30 subjects qualify for the research study. Those&#xD;
      subjects agreeing to participate will then be evaluated using shoulder clinical examination&#xD;
      including resistive shoulder abduction with and without a humeral traction (Pull Test).&#xD;
      Functional status will be measured using the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI).&#xD;
      Following the CSI, one investigator blinded to the results of the pre-injection clinical&#xD;
      examination will administer the clinical examination tests performed prior to the AHI CSI and&#xD;
      record shoulder pain (NPRS) and subject satisfaction about the change in pain following the&#xD;
      CSI. Subjects will then receive standardized home instructions. A 4- to 7-day follow-up phone&#xD;
      call to determine shoulder pain (NPRS) and satisfaction and 6-week follow-up phone call to&#xD;
      determine satisfaction and subjects' compliance to the home instructions, shoulder pain&#xD;
      (NPRS) at rest and during arm elevation, SPADI score and subject satisfaction will be&#xD;
      initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Reliability testing will be assessed using kappa and intraclass&#xD;
      correlation coefficients. Validity testing of the Pull Test will be performed to determine&#xD;
      the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative and positive predictive values for the&#xD;
      comparison of Pull Test outcome and the pain and functional changes observed following&#xD;
      administration of the AHI CSI. Chi-square (2x2 contingency tables) and odds ratios will then&#xD;
      be calculated to evaluate if the outcomes of the Pull Test (binary: positive versus negative)&#xD;
      are correlated with successful pain and functional outcome changes following the AHI CSI&#xD;
      (successful outcome, Yes versus No) immediately following, at 4- to 7-days following, and at&#xD;
      6-weeks following the AHI CSI.&#xD;
