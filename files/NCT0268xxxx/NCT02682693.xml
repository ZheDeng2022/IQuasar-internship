      Pharmacologic inhibition of RANKL attenuates the development of mammary carcinoma and&#xD;
      inhibits metastatic progression in multiple mouse models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a retrospective analysis it could be demonstrated that elevated expression of RANK was&#xD;
      found in 14.5% of patients overall, with a significant predominance in patients with&#xD;
      hormone-receptor-negative disease. Expression of RANK was associated with a higher&#xD;
      pathological complete response rate but with a shorter disease-free and overall survival. The&#xD;
      ABCSG-18 study showed that adjuvant denosumab reduces clinical fractures, improves bone&#xD;
      health, and can be administered without added toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It appears therefore reasonable to test denosumab, a clinically available antibody against&#xD;
      RANKL in patients with hormone-receptor-negative primary breast cancer as an adjunct to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for its ability to increase pCR rate and improve outcome in relation&#xD;
      to the expression of RANK.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RANK ligand (RANKL), a key factor for bone remodeling and metastasis, is crucial for the&#xD;
      development of mouse mammary glands during pregnancy. RANKL functions as a major paracrine&#xD;
      effector of the mitogenic action of progesterone in mouse and human mammary epithelium via&#xD;
      its receptor RANK and has a role in ovarian hormone-dependent expansion and regenerative&#xD;
      potential of mammary stem cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of RANKL attenuates the development&#xD;
      of mammary carcinoma and inhibits metastatic progression in multiple mouse models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a retrospective analysis of 601 patients treated in the GeparTrio study with chemotherapy&#xD;
      (TAC) it could be demonstrated that elevated expression of RANK (immunohistochemical score &gt;&#xD;
      8.5 using the N-1H8 antibody by Amgen) was found in 14.5% of patients overall, with a&#xD;
      significant predominance in patients with hormone-receptor-negative disease (33.7% vs 6.4%&#xD;
      tumors positive for RANK). Expression of RANK was associated with a higher pathological&#xD;
      complete response rate (pCR) (23.0% vs 12.6%) but with a shorter disease-free and overall&#xD;
      survival. The ABCSG-18 study showed that adjuvant denosumab reduces clinical fractures,&#xD;
      improves bone health, and can be administered without added toxicity. Moreover denosumab&#xD;
      improves disease-free survival in postmenopausal woman with hormone receptor positive breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It appears therefore reasonable to test denosumab, a clinically available antibody against&#xD;
      RANKL in patients with hormone-receptor-negative primary breast cancer as an adjunct to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for its ability to increase pCR rate and improve outcome in relation&#xD;
      to the expression of RANK.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by&#xD;
             core biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration from the breast lesion alone is not sufficient.&#xD;
             Incisional biopsy or axillary clearance is not allowed. In case of bilateral cancer,&#xD;
             the investigator has to decide prospectively which side will be evaluated for the&#xD;
             primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor lesion in the breast with a palpable size of 2 cm or a sonographical size of 1&#xD;
             cm in maximum diameter. The lesion has to be measurable in two dimensions, preferably&#xD;
             by sonography. In case tumor isn't measurable by sonography, then MRI or mammography&#xD;
             is sufficient. In case of inflammatory disease, the extent of inflammation can be used&#xD;
             as measurable lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have stage cT1c - cT4a-d disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion should&#xD;
             be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Centrally confirmed ER-negative and PR-negative status. Central pathology includes&#xD;
             also assessment of HER2, Ki-67, TIL and RANK status on core biopsy. ER/PR negative is&#xD;
             defined as ≤1% stained cells and HER2-positive is defined as IHC 3+ or in-situ&#xD;
             hybridization (ISH) and according to ASCO-CAP guidelines as of 2013. LPBC (lymphocyte&#xD;
             predominant breast cancer) is defined as more than 50% stromal tumour infiltrating&#xD;
             lymphocytes. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tissue from core biopsy&#xD;
             has therefore to be sent to the GBG central pathology laboratory prior to&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with stages cT1a, cT1b, or any M1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy for any malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of disease with influence on bone metabolism, such as osteoporosis, Paget's&#xD;
             disease of bone, primary hyperparathyroidism requiring treatment at the time of&#xD;
             randomization or considered likely to become necessary within the subsequent six&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of bisphosphonates or denosumab within the past 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant dental/oral disease, including prior history or current evidence of&#xD;
             osteonecrosis/ osteomyelitis of the jaw, active dental or jaw condition which requires&#xD;
             oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, planned invasive dental procedure for&#xD;
             the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous malignant disease being disease-free for less than 5 years (except CIS of the&#xD;
             cervix and non-melanomatous skin cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected congestive heart failure (&gt;NYHA I) and / or coronary heart disease,&#xD;
             angina pectoris requiring antianginal medication, previous history of myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, uncontrolled or poorly&#xD;
             controlled arterial hypertension (i.e. BP &gt;140 / 90 mm Hg under treatment with two&#xD;
             antihypertensive drugs), rhythm abnormalities requiring permanent treatment,&#xD;
             clinically significant valvular heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Incomplete wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Definite contraindications for the use of corticosteroids.&#xD;
