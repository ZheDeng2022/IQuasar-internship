    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label trial with blinded endpoint&#xD;
      (PROBE) assessment. Adult patients with the diagnosis of non-traumatic SAH, as proven by&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) within 24 hours after the onset of headache, will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the treatment group or the control group. Patients in the treatment group will&#xD;
      receive standard treatment with the addition of a bolus of TXA (1 g intravenously)&#xD;
      immediately after randomization, followed by continuous infusion of 1 g per 8 hours until the&#xD;
      start of aneurysm treatment, or a maximum of 24 hours after the start of medication. Patients&#xD;
      in the control group will receive standard treatment without TXA. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      is favorable functional outcome, defined as a score of 0 to 3 on the modified Rankin Scale&#xD;
      (mRS), at 6 months after SAH. Primary outcome will be determined by a trial nurse blinded for&#xD;
      treatment allocation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of all patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) die due to the&#xD;
      hemorrhage or subsequent complications. There are several major causes for this course, such&#xD;
      as in-hospital rebleed in 21.5% which most frequently occurs within the first 6 hours after&#xD;
      the primary hemorrhage (&quot;ultra-early rebleed&quot;). A major part of the patients with a rebleed&#xD;
      die during hospital admission and when they survive, they develop more severe cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunctions. Reducing the rebleeds by ultra-early administration of tranexamic acid (TXA)&#xD;
      could be a major factor in improving the functional outcome after SAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether SAH patients treated by state-of-the-art SAH management with additional&#xD;
      ultra-early and short term TXA administration have a significantly higher percentage of&#xD;
      favourable outcome after six months (score 0-3 on the Modified Rankin Scale) compared to the&#xD;
      group treated by up-to-date SAH management without additional TXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether: 1) TXA reduces in-hospital rebleeds and case fatalities; 2) TXA causes&#xD;
      more ischemic stroke 3) TXA causes more complications (such as thromboembolic events,&#xD;
      hydrocephalus, extracranial thrombosis or hemorrhagic complications) during treatment,&#xD;
      admission and follow-up; 4) there is a difference in causes of poor outcome between groups;&#xD;
      5) there is a difference in discharge locations between groups; 6) there is an association&#xD;
      between the time between hemorrhage and TXA administration and outcome; 7) TXA increases&#xD;
      (micro)infarctions after endovascular treatment; 8) TXA reduces health-care costs between&#xD;
      discharge and six months after hemorrhage; 9) TXA improves quality of life at six months&#xD;
      after hemorrhage; 10) there are differences in rebleed rates and outcome between genders or&#xD;
      groups with different WFNS scores at admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter, prospective, randomized, open label treatment with blind endpoint assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients (18 years and older) included within 24 hours after SAH. Group one: standard&#xD;
      treatment with additional administration of 1 g TXA intravenously in ten minutes, immediately&#xD;
      after the diagnosis SAH, succeeded by continuous infusion of 1 g per 8 hours until a maximum&#xD;
      of 24 hours. Group two: standard treatment with no TXA administration. Both groups undergo a&#xD;
      standardized and validated interview at discharge and six months after hemorrhage to assess&#xD;
      the modified Rankin Scale score, and both groups receive a questionnaire to evaluate&#xD;
      health-care costs and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: modified Rankin Scale score after six months, dichotomized into favourable and&#xD;
      unfavourable outcome. Secondary: rebleed and case fatality rate, complications during the&#xD;
      first six months after hemorrhage, (micro)infarctions at MR imaging after endovascular&#xD;
      treatment, health-care costs from discharge until six months, quality of life at six months&#xD;
      and differences in rebleed rates and outcome between genders or WFNS score at admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Subjects are randomly allocated to ultra-early TXA therapy or standard&#xD;
      treatment. Complications are minor and the expected benefit is large compared with separate&#xD;
      studies done with antifibrinolytic medications. In these studies, the safety of the use of&#xD;
      these medications in this study population is confirmed. In this patient group there are&#xD;
      adequate, disoriented and comatose patients on admission, so a part of the studied patients&#xD;
      are incapacitated when undergoing the study. To extrapolate the conclusions of this study to&#xD;
      clinical protocols it is necessary to include patients with a SAH in all different severity&#xD;
      grades. Weighing carefully the benefits versus the burden and risks, it is assumed that&#xD;
      patients will benefit from ultra-early TXA administration with minimal burden during therapy.&#xD;
