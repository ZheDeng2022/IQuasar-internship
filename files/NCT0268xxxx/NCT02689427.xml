  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IIB trial studies how well enzalutamide and paclitaxel before surgery works in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage I-III androgen receptor-positive triple-negative breast cancer.&#xD;
      Androgens can cause the growth of triple-negative breast cancer. Anti-hormone therapy, such&#xD;
      as enzalutamide, prevent androgen from binding to the androgen receptor, thereby decreasing&#xD;
      cell growth and causing tumor cell death. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving enzalutamide and&#xD;
      paclitaxel before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue&#xD;
      that needs to be removed. This treatment study is part of the MD Anderson Moonshot&#xD;
      initiative.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pathologic complete response (pCR) and residual cancer burden-index&#xD;
      (RCB-I) rates of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who were non-responders&#xD;
      to initial anthracycline and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy and who were treated with&#xD;
      enzalutamide in combination with weekly paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate progression free survival (PFS) distribution of androgen receptor&#xD;
      (AR)-positive TNBC patients who were nonresponders to initial anthracycline and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, treated with enzalutamide in combination with weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety of administering enzalutamide in combination with weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the association between biomarkers in the peripheral blood and tumor tissue&#xD;
      with safety and efficacy for TNBC patients who were treated with enzalutamide and treatment&#xD;
      in combination with weekly paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate the correlation between circulating tumor cells (CTC) characteristics&#xD;
      and/or gene profiles and treatment response of enzalutamide and taxane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) daily on days 1-7 and paclitaxel intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 2 hours on day 1. Cycles repeat every 7 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGERY: After 12 cycles of therapy, patients undergo surgical resection of primary tumor&#xD;
      with or without lymph node biopsy or complete axillary dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days after surgery.&#xD;
