    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will test the hypothesis that acute in vivo exposure to&#xD;
      hyperglycemia increases mitochondrial network fragmentation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species production (ROS) production in human arterial endothelial cells.&#xD;

      Subjects will be recruited according to our inclusion/exclusion criteria. The investigators&#xD;
      employ a multifaceted approach to recruitment, including flyers, community newspaper ads,&#xD;
      internet ad postings, and direct recruitment from the Internal Medicine Clinics of Froedtert&#xD;
      Memorial Lutheran Hospital/Medical College of Wisconsin which saw approximately 50,000 unique&#xD;
      outpatient visits over last year. The electronic health record is leveraged to identify&#xD;
      potential subjects by HIPAA guidelines and Medical College of Wisconsin policies. Potential&#xD;
      subjects will undergo phenotyping that includes a detailed medical history, anthropomorphic&#xD;
      measurements, blood pressure and heart rate measurements, and a blood draw for measurements&#xD;
      that include fasting lipids, glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin, creatinine, and liver&#xD;
      function tests. Healthy, non-DM subjects who pass the screening as per the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria in Table 2 will be enrolled in the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an overnight fast (12 hours), subjects will come in the morning to our Adult&#xD;
      Translational Research Unit (A-TRU) which is part of the Clinical Translational Research&#xD;
      Initiative of Southeast Wisconsin (8UL1TR000055). An antecubital intravenous line will be&#xD;
      placed to facilitate blood glucose sampling during the hyperglycemic challenge. An&#xD;
      antecubital intravenous catheter will be placed to facilitate obtaining endothelial cells&#xD;
      from the vein by J-wire biopsy for of mitochondrial testing. The principal investigator has&#xD;
      published experience with the J-wire endothelial cell biopsy technique, and the technique has&#xD;
      been extensively validated technique. An initial venous glucose sample will be taken from the&#xD;
      antecubital vein and an initial J-wire biopsy of the radial artery endothelium will be&#xD;
      performed through the radial arterial line. Subjects will then be asked to drink a&#xD;
      standardized 75 g glucose drink created by the A-TRU nutritionist- a standard oral glucose&#xD;
      challenge as used clinically. Blood glucose samples will be taken hourly after that until 4&#xD;
      hours post drink ingestion. At one and 4 hours post-ingestion, J-wire endothelial biopsies of&#xD;
      the radial artery will be repeated. Four separate J wires will be passed into the radial&#xD;
      artery for each measurement time point (0,1, and 4 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In non-diabetic subjects, the 75 g oral challenge induces a peak increase in systemic glucose&#xD;
      at 1-hour post-administration at which time endothelial dysfunction is concomitantly&#xD;
      detectable. Endothelial cells will be obtained via J-wire capture technique. A portion of the&#xD;
      endothelial cells isolated from the J-wires will be used to measure mitochondrial network&#xD;
      complexity prior hyperglycemic challenge, 1-hour post challenge, and 4 hours post challenge.&#xD;
      The investigators will visualize the mitochondrial networks in these cells using our&#xD;
      previously reported and validated immunofluorescence method using cytochrome c antibodies to&#xD;
      tag the mitochondria. Network fragmentation (high number=greater fragmentation and fission)&#xD;
      will be quantified by network fragmentation count calculated with ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda)&#xD;
      using a validated protocol.&#xD;
