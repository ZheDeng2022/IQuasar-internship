  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many chemotherapy and radiation-containing regimens for cancer or prior to bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation can cause sterility in children and young adults. In addition, some human&#xD;
      disease conditions (e.g., Klinefelter's) are associated with infertility. Semen&#xD;
      cryopreservation is available as a fertility-preserving option for post pubertal boys and&#xD;
      adult men, but many do not take advantage of this option due in part to lack of information,&#xD;
      illness, and/or time constraints relative to their treatment plan. Currently, no&#xD;
      fertility-preserving options are available for prepubescent boys who are not yet producing&#xD;
      sperm. The primary objective of the proposed study is to 1) Optimize techniques for&#xD;
      cryopreserving testicular tissue, 2) Assess malignant contamination in testicular tissues and&#xD;
      3) develop methods to enrich spermatogonial stem cells and remove malignant contamination&#xD;
      from testicular tissue. In addition, this study will process and cryopreserve tissue and/or&#xD;
      cells for participating patients as a resource for future elective procedures to attempt&#xD;
      fertility restoration.&#xD;

      This study will provide a pool of research tissue that will be used to develop and test&#xD;
      methods for manipulation and cryopreservation of testicular tissue. Progress in these&#xD;
      investigations may open up a range of new fertility preservation techniques to patients that&#xD;
      currently have no options. At the same time, a substantial portion of the patient's tissue&#xD;
      will be cryopreserved and reserved for his own future use.&#xD;

        Males scheduled to undergo surgery, chemotherapy, drug treatment and/or radiation for the&#xD;
        treatment or prevention of a medical condition or malignancy with risk of causing permanent&#xD;
        and complete loss of subsequent testicular function.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male age 30 days (non-inclusive) to 39 years (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Scheduled to undergo surgery, chemotherapy, drug treatment and/or radiation for the&#xD;
             treatment or prevention of a medical condition or malignancy with risk of causing&#xD;
             permanent and complete loss of subsequent testicular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a medical condition or malignancy that requires removal of all or part of one or&#xD;
             both testicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have newly diagnosed or recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a) Those who were not enrolled at the time of initial diagnosis (i.e., patients with&#xD;
             recurrent disease) are eligible if they have not previously received therapy that is&#xD;
             viewed as likely to result in complete and permanent loss of testicular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have two testicles if undergoing elective removal of a testicle for fertility&#xD;
             preservation only.&#xD;
&#xD;
             b) Note: removal of both testicles will limit fertility preservation options.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Fully executed approved informed consent and authorization permitting the release of&#xD;
             personal health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
             c) The patient and/or the patient's legally authorized guardian must acknowledge in&#xD;
             writing that consent for specimen collection has been obtained, in accordance with&#xD;
             institutional policies approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Consent for serum screening tests for infectious diseases [HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis B,&#xD;
             hepatitis C, RDR (syphilis), CMV, HLTV-1, and HTLV-2], to be performed at the time of&#xD;
             testicular tissue harvesting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Undergo a full history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Obtain standard pre-operative clearance (based on the most recent ACC/AHA Guideline&#xD;
             for Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation for Noncardiac Surgery) as determined by&#xD;
             their primary surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosed with psychological, psychiatric, or other conditions which prevent giving&#xD;
             fully informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosed with an underlying medical condition that significantly increases their risk&#xD;
             of complications from anesthesia and surgery.&#xD;
