  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to treat patients with the combination of erlotinib and temozolomide.&#xD;
      Patients with relapsed, recurrent, refractory, or high risk malignancies whose tumors possess&#xD;
      a non-synonymous mutation in EGFR, ERBB2, or JAK2V617F (JAK2) will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
      Very few phase 2 clinical trials have been performed in pediatrics using targeted agents in&#xD;
      combination with conventional chemotherapy agents. Furthermore, since some combinations such&#xD;
      as the combination of this study (erlotinib and temozolomide) have shown additive/synergistic&#xD;
      effects in preclinical studies, therapy selecting for those patients who possess mutations&#xD;
      targeted by the TKI of the study, may unveil activity that has not been previously observed.&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators hope to determine whether the addition of additive/synergistic&#xD;
      chemotherapy will increase efficacy of target agent and/or increase tumor susceptibility to&#xD;
      targeted agent resulting in increased anti-tumor activity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One to 21 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed, recurrent, or refractory malignancy. All solid tumor diagnoses will be&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis either at original diagnosis or&#xD;

             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with CT or MRI scan, as ≥ 20 mm&#xD;
             by chest x-ray, or ≥ 10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.&#xD;

             potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of the study drug(s). The use of&#xD;
             the following medications should be discontinued prior to initiation of protocol&#xD;
             therapy and should be avoided during protocol therapy if reasonable alternatives&#xD;
             exist.&#xD;

             serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry.&#xD;

             for pharmacokinetic interactions with erlotinib or temozolomide. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
