      Rationale and Aim: The standard treatment for acute appendicitis in children is appendectomy.&#xD;
      An increasing body of evidence from the adult literature suggests that acute appendicitis may&#xD;
      be treated effectively with antibiotics alone, avoiding the need for surgery. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the effectiveness of non-operative treatment of acute appendicitis in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Pragmatic, parallel-group, unmasked, non-inferiority multicentre randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient allocation: Children will be randomly allocated (age 5-16 years) with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      acute appendicitis to either laparoscopic appendectomy or treatment with antibiotics.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed using stratification to ensure equal distribution between&#xD;
      groups of presenting clinical and demographic features that may influence outcome including&#xD;
      gender, duration of symptoms and center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: One group of children will undergo laparoscopic appendectomy that is the&#xD;
      current standard treatment for children with acute appendicitis. The other group will be&#xD;
      treated with intravenous antibiotics. A treatment pathway specifically designed for this&#xD;
      study will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: To be meaningful to parents of, and clinicians treating, children with acute&#xD;
      appendicitis, the primary outcome is treatment failure defined as: (i) any additional&#xD;
      intervention related to appendicitis requiring general anesthesia within 1 year of&#xD;
      randomization (including recurrence of appendicitis after non-operative treatment, which we&#xD;
      will treat with appendectomy) or (ii) negative appendectomy. Secondary outcomes are: (i)&#xD;
      complications; (ii) time to discharge following randomization; (iii) number and duration of&#xD;
      hospital admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and data analysis: The proposed RCT has a 20% non-inferiority margin to test the&#xD;
      null hypothesis that treatment with antibiotics is inferior to appendectomy. Based on data&#xD;
      from collaborating centers and a pilot study that we have performed, we expect recruitment of&#xD;
      978 children in total (90% power) over 19 months allowing for drop out. Follow-up will be for&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;

      Background Acute appendicitis is the commonest surgical emergency in children. The lifetime&#xD;
      risk of developing appendicitis is 7-8%, with a peak incidence in the teenage years.The&#xD;
      associated financial burden of treating appendicitis is very large.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For over 100 years, surgical removal of the appendix has been deemed necessary to effectively&#xD;
      treat acute appendicitis. Appendectomy remains the cornerstone of treatment for acute&#xD;
      appendicitis, with the exception of phlegmon or appendix mass. However, in recent years this&#xD;
      surgical dogma has been challenged and there is a growing literature to suggest that&#xD;
      antibiotics without surgery may be an effective treatment for acute appendicitis in adults&#xD;
      and more recently in children. However this non-operative management of acute appendicitis&#xD;
      remains controversial and unproven due to the lack of large prospective randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although appendectomy is generally a simple procedure, it requires general anesthesia and is&#xD;
      an abdominal operation with inherent risks and potential complications. Complications related&#xD;
      to surgery or anesthesia events occur in over 10% of children within 30 days of appendectomy.&#xD;
      Although a non-operative approach may avoid these risks and reduce complication rate, this&#xD;
      would not be a viable alternative to surgery unless it is equally effective at curing acute&#xD;
      appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing literature relating to the efficacy of non-operative treatment of acute&#xD;
      appendicitis in predominantly from adult patients. Several trials and systematic reviews have&#xD;
      been reported. A most recent meta-analysis concluded that there were benefits to&#xD;
      non-operative treatment including fewer complications, better pain control, and shorter sick&#xD;
      leave but that the combined failure and recurrence rate in patients treated non-operatively&#xD;
      made this approach less effective overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children, the literature is limited. The most significant studies are: Abes et al [6] who&#xD;
      described successful, non-operative treatment in 15 of 16 children who had a very short&#xD;
      duration of illness, and minimal diagnostic criteria on imaging; Armstrong et al [7] who&#xD;
      reported a 75% success rate in 12 children treated non-operatively along with a matched&#xD;
      comparison group undergoing surgery; two RCTs from the USA that compared appendectomy with&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment for children with perforated appendicitis [8,9] (a different patient&#xD;
      group from the one which we intend to study); a single centre, preference-based,&#xD;
      non-randomized study comparing laparoscopic appendectomy with antibiotic treatment [10] that&#xD;
      reported interim results only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for this multi center RCT, investigators have performed a pilot RCT at one of&#xD;
      the participating centers (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm) [11]. Successfully demonstrated&#xD;
      feasibility of recruitment to a RCT and safety of non-operative treatment of children with&#xD;
      acute appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these observations, and in response to parents who are now asking whether their&#xD;
      child with acute appendicitis really needs an operation, this randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing appendectomy with non-operative treatment in children with acute appendicitis will&#xD;
      be done. The principal research question is: Can children with acute uncomplicated&#xD;
      (non-perforated) appendicitis be treated without appendectomy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the Trial This trial has the potential to significantly alter clinical practice&#xD;
      for one of the most common acute health conditions in children. A finding of non-inferiority&#xD;
      of treatment with antibiotics compared to appendectomy would be transformative for the&#xD;
      healthcare of children with acute appendicitis in Canada and abroad, including low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries. Reducing the need for surgery in the treatment of childhood&#xD;
      appendicitis represents the potential for cost savings for the healthcare system, and will&#xD;
      enable improved access for children with non-emergent conditions who are awaiting surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design Research question Can children with acute non-perforated appendicitis be&#xD;
      treated with antibiotics, rather than appendectomy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design The APPY trial has been designed as a pragmatic, parallel-group, unmasked,&#xD;
      non-inferiority multicentre, international randomized controlled trial. The protocol has been&#xD;
      developed in accordance with the SPIRIT guideline and the trial will be conducted and&#xD;
      reported according to the CONSORT statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Children (5-16 years of age) with suspected acute uncomplicated appendicitis&#xD;
      will be enrolled from up to 16 hospitals across Europe and North America. All centers are&#xD;
      specialist Pediatric Surgery Referral Centers with trained Specialist Pediatric Surgeons and&#xD;
      Pediatric Surgery Training Programs. All children with suspected acute non-perforated&#xD;
      appendicitis will be assessed by the on-call surgeon who will determine eligibility for the&#xD;
      study. This will be based on a clinical and/or ultrasound diagnosis of acute non-perforated&#xD;
      appendicitis. The patient and child will be informed of the trial and invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization After signed informed consent, a standardized data set will be collected from&#xD;
      all participants at all participating institutions. Patients enrolled in the study will be&#xD;
      randomized to groups (1:1 ratio) using an online stratified randomization tool, allowing&#xD;
      instant assignment to treatment group 24 hours per day with concealment of allocation.&#xD;
      Allocation to groups will be stratified taking into account factors that may affect outcome&#xD;
      of treatment: 1) Sex: Male; Female; 2) Duration of symptoms &lt;48hrs; &gt;48hrs; and 3) Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Patients will be allocated to non-operative antibiotic treatment or&#xD;
      appendectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-operative treatment group: Participants allocated to non-operative treatment will be&#xD;
      treated according to a treatment pathway standardized across all centers comprising&#xD;
      intravenous fluid treatment, a minimum of 12 hours of intravenous antibiotics, a minimum&#xD;
      period of 12 hours taking clear fluid only, and regular clinical review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the next clinical rounds, or alternatively approximately 12 hours after randomization,&#xD;
      a review of clinical symptoms will be conducted to detect symptoms and signs of significant&#xD;
      clinical deterioration including, but not limited to, increased fever, increased tachycardia,&#xD;
      and increased pain or tenderness. If the patient is doing well, they may be advanced to&#xD;
      regular diet and be assessed for discharge during the same work day, depending on their&#xD;
      clinical progression. If they are stable without deterioration but not improved to the point&#xD;
      of discharge they will continue with non-operative management. A patient who has not improved&#xD;
      after 48 hours of non-operative management will undergo appendectomy. All decisions will be&#xD;
      made by the treating physicians and care team with consideration of the input of parents and&#xD;
      child where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children in whom non-operative treatment is successful will receive a minimum of 12 hours&#xD;
      intravenous antibiotics and then be switched to oral antibiotics once they have shown&#xD;
      clinical improvement. They will be discharged home once they meet a standardized set of&#xD;
      criteria to be used in all centers: vital signs (including temperature) within normal limits,&#xD;
      tolerating a light diet orally, adequate oral pain relief and mobile. They will receive a&#xD;
      total course of 10 days of antibiotics (intravenous and oral) following randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children within the non-operative treatment group will remain under the care of an attending&#xD;
      pediatric surgeon who retains overall responsibility for their care. If a child's clinical&#xD;
      condition deteriorates at any time, they will undergo laparoscopic appendectomy, and will&#xD;
      receive post-operative care identical to that of children in the appendectomy treatment group&#xD;
      (see below), and any other care that might be dictated by sound clinical judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of antibiotics will vary between center and will be the antibiotic regimen that is&#xD;
      current standard of care in that center. This is due to (i) varying antibiotic regimes among&#xD;
      participating centers at present influenced by local factors, including antimicrobial&#xD;
      stewardship and drug cost (26) and (ii) a lack of evidence to support a specific antibiotic&#xD;
      regimen for childhood appendicitis. Allowing each center to maintain current antibiotic&#xD;
      protocols will improve study feasibility and increase generalizability of the results.&#xD;
      However, the duration of combined intravenous and oral therapy will be standardized to 10&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following discharge, children who receive non-operative treatment will not be offered&#xD;
      elective appendectomy. They will be counselled about the risk of recurrence as part of the&#xD;
      permission process for the trial using best available current data. Recurrence of&#xD;
      appendicitis within the 1 year follow-up period will be treated with appendectomy; these&#xD;
      children will not be eligible for re-enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appendectomy group: Children allocated to appendectomy will undergo laparoscopic appendectomy&#xD;
      within approximately 18 hours of randomization which is the current standard of care in all&#xD;
      centers participating in this study. Participants will receive intravenous antibiotics from&#xD;
      the time of randomization and be treated post-operatively with intravenous antibiotics&#xD;
      according to a defined and standardized treatment regime based on consensus for this trial.&#xD;
      Specifically, children with a macroscopically normal appendix or non-perforated acute&#xD;
      appendicitis will receive no further antibiotics. Children with perforated appendicitis will&#xD;
      continue to receive intravenous antibiotics for a minimum of 3 days, and may receive&#xD;
      additional antibiotics per local practice. The type of antibiotics used in each center will&#xD;
      be identical to those used in the non-operative treatment group. Following cessation of&#xD;
      intravenous antibiotics, criteria for discharge home will be identical to those in the&#xD;
      non-operative treatment group.&#xD;
