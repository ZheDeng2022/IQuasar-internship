  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether, in patients with first-ever&#xD;
      atherothrombotic or lacunar stroke without any previous history of atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      (AF)/atrial flutter (AFL)/atrial tachycardia (AT), the detection of AF/AFL/AT (silent or&#xD;
      symptomatic) by using a continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring with implantable loop recorder&#xD;
      (ILR) during the first 12 months of observation is higher than the detection by using a&#xD;
      standard cardiac monitoring (physical exam, 12-lead electrocardiogram [ECG] at baseline, 3,&#xD;
      6, and 12 months and Holter ECG at 3 months) in the same period of time.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a high risk of stroke and its prevalence&#xD;
      increases in subjects aged â‰¥65 years. After an ischemic stroke, the use of standard&#xD;
      monitoring methods may underestimate the detection rate of AF. Recent studies demonstrated a&#xD;
      fourfold to sixfold increase in the detection of AF with prolonged ECG monitoring as compared&#xD;
      to standard cardiac monitoring in patients with cryptogenic stroke. Hence, it is very likely&#xD;
      that even patients having a first atherothrombotic or lacunar stroke with high burden of&#xD;
      vascular risk factors are exposed to increased risk of developing AF in the subsequent years&#xD;
      and AF may be the cause underlying possible recurrent strokes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFFO trial has the objective to evaluate the detection of AF or atrial flutter (AFL) as&#xD;
      first diagnosis by implantable loop recorder (ILR) in patients with first-ever&#xD;
      atherothrombotic or lacunar stroke. Patients with recent (30-60 days after symptom onset)&#xD;
      diagnosis of first-ever atherothrombotic or lacunar ischemic stroke who fulfill inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be randomized to either continuous cardiac monitoring using an ILR plus&#xD;
      standard cardiac monitoring (intervention arm) or standard cardiac monitoring alone (control&#xD;
      arm) with a ratio of 1:1. The hypothesis is that the detection of of AF/AFL by using ILR will&#xD;
      be higher than that observed by using standard cardiac monitoring. Secondary and tertiary&#xD;
      objectives of the study include exploratory analyses on the incidence of recurrent strokes&#xD;
      and different stroke subtypes and on the reduction of stroke risk and death from all causes&#xD;
      in all study patients, in the two randomization groups and, in particular, in patients&#xD;
      treated with antiplatelet therapy versus those treated with oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy,&#xD;
      the latter being implemented and guided by the detection of clinically meaningful episodes of&#xD;
      AF/AFL/AT using ILR compared with standard cardiac monitoring. Moreover, this study has the&#xD;
      objective to evaluate a clinical, neuroimaging, and echocardiographic profile predictive of&#xD;
      AF/AFL/AT first diagnosis and stroke recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFFO is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trial with blinded&#xD;
      assessment of outcome measures. Diagnosis of atherothrombotic and lacunar etiology will be&#xD;
      defined according to TOAST (trial of ORG 10172 in acute stroke treatment) / CCS (Causative&#xD;
      Classification System for ischemic stroke) classification criteria and standard diagnostic&#xD;
      protocols that have to be fulfilled before randomization (medical history; risk factors;&#xD;
      symptoms; cerebral magnetic resonance [MR] and/or CT; 12-lead ECG and/or Holter ECG and/or&#xD;
      other standard heart rhythm monitoring procedure; transthoracic and/or transoesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiogram; intra- and extracranial vessel ultrasonography and/or CT-Angiography and/or&#xD;
      MR- Angiography, also in order to rule out non-atherosclerotic vasculopathies;&#xD;
      thrombophilic/hematologic screening if hypercoagulability states or other hematologic&#xD;
      disorders are suspected).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ILR (Medtronic Reveal LINQTM- LNQ11REVEAL LinQ) implantation will be performed within 8 days&#xD;
      after randomization and will allow a continuous monitoring by single-lead ECG registration&#xD;
      for 3 years. Standard cardiac rhythm monitoring includes: detailed data collection on any&#xD;
      possible patient's symptom suggestive of AF/AFL/AT, physical exam including cardiovascular&#xD;
      examination, 12-lead ECG, and 24-hour Holter ECG performed at 3-month follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If positive, SAFFO trial could have important clinical implications in terms of changing the&#xD;
      standard diagnostic protocol in patients with atherothrombotic and lacunar stroke, and of&#xD;
      increasing the shift of secondary prevention treatment from antiplatelet to anticoagulant&#xD;
      therapy when indicated.&#xD;
