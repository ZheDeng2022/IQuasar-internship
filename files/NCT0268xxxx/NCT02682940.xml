      A single center pilot study assessing the Vigilant Diabetes Management System for the&#xD;
      prevention of recurrent mild to moderate hypoglycemia in type I diabetes patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center 12-week Pilot trial with one arm. Subjects will serve as their own&#xD;
      controls. The study will include usual care patients on MDI (multiple daily injections) or&#xD;
      CSII (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) with the additional use of the Vigilant ™&#xD;
      Diabetes Management System. There will be a 4-week baseline period prior to the 12-week&#xD;
      intervention. Subject participation for the 4-week baseline period will last for 2-4 hours&#xD;
      during two visits. Subjects participating in the intervention phase of 12 weeks will require&#xD;
      one additional visit (2-3 hours) at 3 months, which is routine for this population.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with a wireless blood glucose meter for the duration of the&#xD;
      study and will download the Vigilant mobile application to their mobile phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vigilant™ system stores blood glucose test results, pattern events, and user settings. In&#xD;
      addition to receiving blood glucose measurements entered from the user, storing and&#xD;
      displaying them, Vigilant™ provides the following features and tools for the user:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Glucose Reading review and editing: The user will be able to review data logs and&#xD;
           manually edit blood glucose results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pattern Messages: Alerts the user that one or more patterns were found in the results&#xD;
           that were entered, including patterns that are indicative of risk of severe hypoglycemia&#xD;
           in the next 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long Term Control Summary: Identifies the current and retrospective blood glucose&#xD;
           averages and variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following blood glucose patterns will be identified by the Vigilant application:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly and monthly glucose averages overall and within daily time periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily periods of infrequent testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily periods of high, low or variable blood glucose (&quot;Daily Pattern Messaging System&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patterns of blood glucose indicative of increased risk of low blood glucose levels in&#xD;
           the next 24 hours (&quot;Hypo Risk Indicator&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly and monthly blood glucose variability (&quot;Average Daily Risk Range or ADDR&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vigilant™ incorporates a &quot;Tutorial Mode&quot; which offers detailed feedback on the meaning of&#xD;
      pattern analyses performed by the software. In addition, two separate training videos have&#xD;
      been developed for patients and clinicians to initiate them on use and understanding of the&#xD;
      device and its features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers will have access to the information outlined above, as well as summary screens&#xD;
      that highlight glycemic control metrics and patients and risk notifications for all of their&#xD;
      patients on Vigilant, subject to patient approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from one diabetes clinic. Patients with type I diabetes and a&#xD;
      history of mild to moderate hypoglycemia will be assessed to see if they are eligible for the&#xD;
      study. All those who are considered eligible will be approached to give their written,&#xD;
      informed consent before attending a screening visit where the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Screening Visit the following procedures will be performed / criteria will be checked&#xD;
      and documented:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed and dated informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assignment of subject number&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics (date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes history (subjects only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Professional history (diabetes clinicians only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SMBG training with study meter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of study hypoglycemia diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of study questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent, participants will participate in the 4-week run in/baseline period before the&#xD;
      12 week pilot intervention to collect baseline data on glycemic control and hypoglycemia and&#xD;
      to assess adherence with testing criteria. All participants will be asked to conduct&#xD;
      SMBG(self-monitoring of blood glucose) three or more times a day and asked to record the&#xD;
      clinical details of any hypoglycemia events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 4-week baseline period, participants will return for a study visit where&#xD;
      the investigator will complete the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Download the SMBG and hypoglycemia diary and data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain A1C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Affirmation of participant commitment to test and record&#xD;
&#xD;
      To continue in the study, subjects will need to have obtained at least three blood glucose&#xD;
      values per day and have recorded hypoglycemia symptoms and episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the 12-week intervention period, all study participants will complete validated&#xD;
      study questionnaires (Hypoglycemia Fear, Diabetes Empowerment Survey etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 2, the subjects will complete training with the Vigilant™ program. They will watch a&#xD;
      video demonstration on an iPhone , Android or iPod Touch that explains the use of the&#xD;
      Vigilant™ device. Study participants will be provided a wireless blood glucose monitor and&#xD;
      asked to follow their normal diabetes management program for the subsequent 12 weeks. They&#xD;
      will be asked to use the Vigilant™ program at home in conjunction with the provided wireless&#xD;
      meter for the subsequent 12 weeks, according to the following instructions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will follow their typical blood glucose-testing regimen, with the exception that&#xD;
      they must perform an average of at least 3 fingerstick blood glucose measurements daily&#xD;
      during that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to keep a log of HRI (hypoglycemia risk indicator) pattern&#xD;
           messages received, with any entered glucose reading if delivered at that time, and what&#xD;
           diabetes management action they chose to perform when the message is received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to log 1) whether or not they understand the feedback given, and&#xD;
           2) what action is taken to address the pattern, if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will not be required to perform any specific diabetes management action to&#xD;
           address identified patterns. Worksheets will be provided to patients to facilitate&#xD;
           record keeping for pattern message feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is preferred that the subject use predominantly the study supplied meter during the&#xD;
           course of the 12 weeks of home use (two glucometers maximum).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be instructed to change the date / time of their meter in the event of any&#xD;
           changes for 1) daylight savings time, or 2) travel to different time zones, so that it&#xD;
           matches the iPod touch or Phone clock time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  S/he will be instructed on proper SMBG technique including using water and dry towel&#xD;
           prior to testing, avoiding alternate site testing, and using the second hanging blood&#xD;
           drop. The subject will be asked to demonstrate an SMBG test at the visit to document&#xD;
           proper technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up at three months during the 12-week intervention period.&#xD;
      Subjects will also receive a telephone or email communication from the study manager within&#xD;
      several days of the beginning of the home use portion of the study to ensure the patient&#xD;
      understands the protocol and is entering data according to instructions. At this time they&#xD;
      will also be asked to send several screen shots of their application with a log of their data&#xD;
      and patterns that have been identified, to ensure the device is working according to the&#xD;
      intended use and data is being entered. Another follow up will occur 4 weeks into the study&#xD;
      where the patients will be asked the same questions and given the same instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects involved in this study should also allow their Vigilant-using clinician to see their&#xD;
      Vigilant patterns, and also plan to see their Vigilant-using clinician at least once for a&#xD;
      regular check up during their Vigilant use period (this can be done at Visit 3, if desired).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up and final visit (3) will occur at the three-month end of the 12 week intervention&#xD;
      period, which is the typical routine schedule for usual care. Additional visits may be&#xD;
      scheduled by provider as indicated for diabetes management. The following procedures will be&#xD;
      performed in at the follow-up visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Download SMBG data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of patient diaries and data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection of hypoglycemia and other events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of Vigilant pattern messages and patient log&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of study questionnaires and surveys&#xD;
