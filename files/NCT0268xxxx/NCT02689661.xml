  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to discover modifiable risk factors for the development&#xD;
      of neuropathy, specifically looking at the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to follow obese individuals and determine the impact of the aspects&#xD;
      of the metabolic syndrome on the incidence of neuropathy compared to lean individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there are many well established relationships between obesity and disease, the&#xD;
      association of obesity and the metabolic syndrome with peripheral neuropathy is less clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be following a population of 300 adult individuals age 18 years or&#xD;
      older with obesity and 300 adult individuals without obesity or any aspect of the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome (hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, obesity). Obese&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited through the Investigational Weight Management Clinic. A proportion&#xD;
      of the subjects will be recruited through Blue Care Network of Michigan (BCN) as part of&#xD;
      their Healthy Blue Living campaign which is supporting clinical care of up to 400 individuals&#xD;
      in the clinic. The individuals not recruited directly through the clinic will be identified&#xD;
      via flyer, word of mouth, and umclinicalstudies.org.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phenotyping information for the obese subjects will be already completed as part of the&#xD;
      initial project. Lean subjects will undergo screening for eligibility, which includes taking&#xD;
      height, weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, and glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropathy measures completed at baseline and 2 years (obese subjects only) include: definite&#xD;
      clinical neuropathy will be established using Toronto consensus guidelines based upon&#xD;
      neurologic exam, nerve conduction studies, Michigan Neuropathy-Specific Instrument, Utah&#xD;
      Early Neuropathy Scale, balance and hip strength measures, cognitive testing (computerized&#xD;
      cognitive screening to determine how obesity affects the central nervous system) (also done&#xD;
      at time 12 +/- 4 weeks and 52 +/- 4 weeks post-baseline visit), neurothesiometer testing,&#xD;
      skin biopsy to determine nerve fiber density, Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (QSART)&#xD;
      to measures the autonomic nerves that control sweating, heart rate variability/cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic neuropathy testing to assess for autonomic neuropathy, quantitative sensory testing&#xD;
      to assess for small fiber neuropathy, Sudoscan to assess sweat gland function, and the&#xD;
      following questionnaires: Neuropathy Quality of Life, McGill Pain, Autonomic symptoms&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to demonstrate that obesity and other aspects of the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome have a direct impact on the incidence of peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
