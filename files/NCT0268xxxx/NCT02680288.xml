      This is a randomized, cross-over, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center,&#xD;
      multiple-panel evaluation of the potential for oral lorcaserin to modify cocaine&#xD;
      self-administration in a laboratory setting. To prevent unauthorized drug use, study&#xD;
      medications will be administered as participants are confined during overnight stays at the&#xD;
      Medical Center. Non-treatment-seeking, regular cocaine users will receive oral treatment with&#xD;
      single doses of placebo, lorcaserin 10 mg (Panel 1), or lorcaserin 20 mg (Panel 2).&#xD;
      Afterwards, the subjective and reinforcing effects of intravenous cocaine will be measured in&#xD;
      a laboratory setting.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serotonin (5-HT) is one of three brain monoamines that are widely distributed in the brain&#xD;
      and play important roles in affect and goal-directed behaviors. Limbic structures that&#xD;
      underlie behavior motivated by palatable food and drugs of abuse receive dense projections&#xD;
      from brainstem serotonergic nuclei. In rats, light and sound cues associated with access to&#xD;
      cocaine strongly stimulate drug-seeking behavior. Agonists for the type 2C serotonergic&#xD;
      receptor (5-HT₂cR) attenuate this responding.8 Drug taking (cocaine self-administration) is&#xD;
      also attenuated at 5-HT₂cR agonist doses similar to those that decrease food-reinforced&#xD;
      responding and cause reductions in locomotor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lorcaserin is a novel and selective agonist of the 5-HT₂cR recently approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      weight loss therapy. It acts selectively at this receptor subtype with minimal activation of&#xD;
      5-HT₂ᴀR or 5-HT₂ᴃR receptors. Based on initial clinical studies leading to its approval,&#xD;
      lorcaserin is well tolerated and probably does not cause cardiac valve disease or other&#xD;
      serious side effects. Even so, given the potential for serious adverse events, the FDA has&#xD;
      limited its use to patients who are either obese or overweight with a medical complication&#xD;
      such as hypertension. Whether or not lorcaserin will become generally accepted as a long-term&#xD;
      treatment for obesity will depend on the results of ongoing post-marketing studies of&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale In preclinical studies, agonists for the 5-HT₂cR potently attenuate cocaine-seeking&#xD;
      behavior. Lorcaserin is a recently approved selective 5-HT₂cR agonist with an acceptable&#xD;
      safety profile in humans. No published studies have reported its effects on cocaine-induced&#xD;
      craving or drug-reinforced responding in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate whether lorcaserin treatment attenuates the positive subjective effects of&#xD;
           cocaine and drug-reinforced behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether active treatment modifies cocaine- or script- induced craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This is a randomized, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center,&#xD;
      multiple-panel evaluation of the potential for oral lorcaserin to modify cocaine&#xD;
      self-administration in a laboratory setting. Up to 32 non-treatment-seeking, regular cocaine&#xD;
      users will receive treatment with single doses of oral placebo, lorcaserin 10 mg (Panel 1),&#xD;
      or lorcaserin 20 mg (Panel 2). Script-guided imagery of autobiographical memories will be&#xD;
      developed based on experiences related to cocaine use, anger, and a neutral event. Following&#xD;
      treatment with lorcaserin, script-induced emotional states will be assayed. Sampling doses of&#xD;
      cocaine (0.0, 0.23, and 0.46 mg/kg) will be administered, and participants will choose&#xD;
      between self-administering additional intravenous doses or receiving monetary alternatives.&#xD;
      Detailed measures of the negative and positive subjective effects of intravenous infusions&#xD;
      will also be made. As noncontingent infusions of cocaine are administered, the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of cocaine and lorcaserin will be determined.&#xD;
