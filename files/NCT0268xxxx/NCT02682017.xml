  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Red meat makes a significant contribution to the human diet. The most widely consumed meat&#xD;
      globally is pork which accounts for 36% of overall meat intake with beef and poultry&#xD;
      contributing 22% and 35%, respectively. Pork meat provides a range of important nutrients&#xD;
      including protein, zinc, B-vitamins and a range of important minerals however there is&#xD;
      accumulating evidence to suggest that consuming red meat and processed meat increases the&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colon cancer. Despite these reports of a negative&#xD;
      impact on health, global pork consumption continues to increase and there are increasing&#xD;
      efforts to improve the nutritional profile of pork meat through the development of novel&#xD;
      porcine feed regimens. The manipulation of pig feed to produce 'healthier' meat and meat&#xD;
      products offers a feasible approach to reduce the risk of preventable disease. Furthermore,&#xD;
      recent projections of an increased global demand for pork and poultry, particularly in China,&#xD;
      have highlighted the increasing strain that will be placed on the supply of grains and the&#xD;
      need to find alternative and sustainable feed ingredients. Macroalgae is emerging as a&#xD;
      potential sustainable source of novel bioactive ingredients for the animal feed industry with&#xD;
      some species known to be a good source of protein, minerals, polyunsaturated fatty acids and&#xD;
      a range of fibre components including fucoidan and laminarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polysaccharides, laminarin and fucoidan, which are found in abundance in brown seaweed,&#xD;
      are gaining increasing attention as a potential bioactive feed ingredients with putative&#xD;
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Incorporation of a&#xD;
      laminarin/fucioidan mix (LAM/FUC) into the porcine diet was shown to result in lower levels&#xD;
      of lipid oxidation in fresh pork steaks. Numerous studies to date have also investigated the&#xD;
      health promoting effects of LAM/FUC through modulation of the porcine gut microbiota which&#xD;
      was shown to enhance inflammatory cytokine expression in response to pathogen recognition and&#xD;
      also to increase piglet performance post weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uptake and fate of fucoidan in humans remains unknown albeit after consumption, unaltered&#xD;
      fucoidan has been detected in human plasma after ingestion suggesting at least partial&#xD;
      bioavailability of this compound. A study by Moroney et al. (2015) using an in vitro&#xD;
      bioavailability Caco-2 model provided indications that fucoidan was bioavailable and that it&#xD;
      may have potent antioxidant potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this randomised parallel placebo controlled human intervention trial was&#xD;
      to investigate if consuming pork meat from pigs supplemented with a LAM/FUC mix, in addition&#xD;
      to their normal diet, would impact on blood oxidant and inflammatory status of healthy&#xD;
      adults. The secondary aim was to determine the effect of consuming LAM/FUC fed pork meat on&#xD;
      lymphocyte DNA damage, lipid status and immune function in healthy adults.&#xD;
