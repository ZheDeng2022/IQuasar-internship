  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study comparing venous Doppler flow in the lower&#xD;
      extremities of pregnant women. Pregnant women with a BMI &gt;/= 30 will be compared to those&#xD;
      with a BMI &lt; 30.&#xD;

      Study Outcome Measurement and Ascertainment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from data in EPIC and UTMB electronic medical records. This&#xD;
      information will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maternal demographic data, medical, family, personal, social and surgical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Maternal pre-pregnancy weight and height&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Maternal weight at time of delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Maternal weight on post-operative day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Gestational age at delivery, infant gender, birth weight, placental weight, delivery&#xD;
           method, and complications through 6 weeks postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous hemodynamics will be obtained using venous duplex ultrasound. 1. Peak, mean, and&#xD;
      minimum flow velocities and diameter will be obtained. Calculations of venous velocity&#xD;
      amplitude, cross-sectional area, and shear stress will be made from the data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study using duplex ultrasound techniques to characterize venous flow in&#xD;
      obese and non-obese pregnant patients. Women will be consented to participate and then&#xD;
      separated into a study group of obese women (BMI &gt;/= 30) and a control group of non-obese&#xD;
      women (BMI &lt;30). These women will be admitted to Labor and Delivery for management of&#xD;
      pregnancy. The Doppler US will then be performed by trained staff on the lower extremity. The&#xD;
      flow data described above will be measured and compared between the two groups. Additional&#xD;
      measurements will be collected during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Inclusion of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Age &gt;/= 18 years of age, planned delivery at John Sealy Hospital (JSH)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Exclusion of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal history of VTE, regardless of etiology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of VTE during this pregnancy -History of thrombophilia, bleeding disorder&#xD;
           marked varicosities, history of recurrent stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any indication for emergency delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known major fetal abnormality or genetic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sources of Research Material:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sources of data to be used include maternal medical records from EPIC as well as the data&#xD;
      obtained from the venous ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be pregnant women who plan a delivery at JSH. Subjects will be consented by&#xD;
      study personnel. Patients will not receive any monetary gain. They will understand that this&#xD;
      is voluntary and will not affect their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Doppler velocimetry is the modality that has been used in pregnancy to assess for the&#xD;
      presence of DVT, thus, the safety has been assessed and widely studied. This poses minimum&#xD;
      risk to the mother or to the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Safety and Data Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not place subjects at risk of their safety. This modality is well studied to&#xD;
      be safe in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring will be performed only by study personnel. Data may be assessed prior to the&#xD;
      study being completed to assess to see if statistical analysis reveals any difference and if&#xD;
      the study can be stopped early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will only be viewed by study personnel. The data will then be de-identified and a study&#xD;
      number will be assigned to each patient. The patient's identity will then be secured on an&#xD;
      UTMB encrypted laptop device and a hard copy stored in the locked file cabinet in the locked&#xD;
      office of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no benefits to subjects participating in the study. By gathering the information of&#xD;
      duplex velocimetry in both the obese and non-obese population we can determine if there is a&#xD;
      change in the velocimetry in this at risk population.&#xD;
