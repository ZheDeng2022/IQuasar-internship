      A prospective, open-label, multicentre phase-II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      a sequential regimen of bendamustine followed by ofatumumab and ibrutinib followed by&#xD;
      ibrutinib and ofatumumab maintenance in CLL patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the CLL2-BIO trial an allcomer CLL population with indication for treatment will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will receive 2 cycles of debulking treatment with bendamustin unless&#xD;
      contraindications are existing or debulking is not indicated. Afterwards 6 cycles of&#xD;
      induction therapy with ofatumumab and ibrutinib will be applied, each with a duration of 28&#xD;
      days. Primary endpoint overall Response rate will be assessed at final restaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients benefitting from BIO treatment will enter the maintenance phase of the trial.&#xD;
      Maintenance treatment will be continued if no unacceptable toxicity occurs until three months&#xD;
      after negativity of minimal residual disease (MRD) is achieved in peripheral blood in&#xD;
      patients with (clinical) complete response (CR) or (clinical) incomplete complete response&#xD;
      (CRi) confirmed by 2 consecutive testings of MRD within 3 months, progression of CLL, start&#xD;
      of a subsequent therapy or up to 8 cycles of maintenance (each cycle with a duration of 84&#xD;
      calendar days = 3 months), whichever occurs first.&#xD;
