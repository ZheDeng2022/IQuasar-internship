      Cisplatin and Etoposide is the standard of care in NEC originating from the gastro-intestinal&#xD;
      tract and lung, based on retrospective studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless the prognosis of this group of patients is still poor with median survival of&#xD;
      less than 20 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus is an mammilian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor that has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      be active in patients with well and moderately differentiated primitive neuroectodermal tumor&#xD;
      (pNET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the Investigators demonstrated that the mammilian target of rapamycin (mTOR)&#xD;
      pathway is overexpressed in NEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the activity of Everolimus in the treatment of patients with well and moderately&#xD;
      differentiated p-NET and on the evidence that even poorly differentiated forms express the&#xD;
      pathway of m-TOR is conceivable that Everolimus could be active even in NEC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A platinum based chemotherapy (Cisplatin or Carboplatin) plus Etoposide is the standard of&#xD;
      care in NEC originating from the gastro-intestinal tract and lung, based on retrospective&#xD;
      studies. In these clinical studies and in clinical practice the median number of cycle&#xD;
      administered is six due to dose depending toxicity of platinum and to the concept of maximum&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expression of mTOR pathways was evaluated in gastroenteropancreatic - Neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumor (GEP-NEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator found that 6/9 (67%) of poorly differentiated GEP-NEC evaluated expressed p&#xD;
      mTOR. Interestingly this expression was not observed in small cell carcinoma (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, was demonstrated that the mTOR pathway is overexpressed in NEC (11). Based on the&#xD;
      activity of Everolimus in the treatment of patients with well and moderately differentiated&#xD;
      p-NET and on the evidence that even poorly differentiated forms express the pathway of m-TOR&#xD;
      is conceivable that Everolimus could be active even in NEC. In particular we want to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that a maintenance therapy (or an early second line) with Everolimus 10 mg/daily&#xD;
      in non progressive patients after first line chemotherapy could improve outcome prolonging&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NORDIC NEC study recently published retrospectively analyzed 305 patients with metastatic&#xD;
      GI NEC (or unknown primary predominantly with GI metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this large retrospective study patients with Ki-67 &lt; 55% are less responsive to platinum&#xD;
      based chemotherapy but have a longer survival than patients with Ki-67 &gt; 55%; then Ki-67 &lt;&#xD;
      55% is a positive prognostic factor and a negative predictive factor to platinum based&#xD;
      chemotherapy (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data indicate that GI-NEC might be not consider as a unique entity, even if they are&#xD;
      all classified as G3 according to WHO 2010 classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized Phase 2 trial the investigator want to evaluate the activity of Everolimus&#xD;
      10 mg/daily as maintenance therapy in patients with NEC and Ki-67 &lt; 55%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact this subgroup of NEC patients could benefit mostly from a maintenance treatment with&#xD;
      Everolimus 10 mg/daily since they are less chemo responder and they show better prognosis as&#xD;
      G1-G2 NET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is not a standard second line therapy for NEC patients treated with platinum based&#xD;
      doublet, nevertheless Temozolamide and Capecitabine (TX) represent a regimen used in this&#xD;
      setting, based on small and retrospective series (8). Therefore in our study we recommend&#xD;
      that all patients at first progression (even if out of the study) will receive TX&#xD;
      (Capecitabine 750 mg/m2 po BID days 1-14 plus Temozolomide 200 mg/m2 po quaque die (QD) days&#xD;
      10-14 q28) in order to homogenize second line treatment. However, second line treatment is&#xD;
      chosen by single investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the activity of a maintenance therapy (or early second&#xD;
      line) with Everolimus 10 mg daily in patients with stable disease, partial response or&#xD;
      complete response after 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy with Cisplatin or Carboplatin plus&#xD;
      Etoposide or alternative first line chemotherapy administered according to clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) defined as the time between&#xD;
      randomization and the first evidence of progressive disease or date of death, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. Documentation of disease progression will be defined as per Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria based on investigator assessment. The&#xD;
      censoring date for a patient who is known to be progression-free would be the date of the&#xD;
      last tumor assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety profile: Safety of the treatment will be evaluated by serious and non serious&#xD;
           adverse events (AEs). AEs will be graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for&#xD;
           Adverse Effects (CTCAE v4.03)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of prognostic/predictive factors on tumoral tissue of patients treated with&#xD;
           maintenance everolimus 10 mg/daily. The expression of mTOR and kinases involved in its&#xD;
           pathway will be assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection and count of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral blood samples by&#xD;
           VERIDEX® and correlation between CTCs number and outcome of patients in terms of PFS and&#xD;
           OS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and correlation between ctDNA levels and and&#xD;
           outcome of patients in terms of PFS and OS. Evaluation of mTOR pathway genes mutations&#xD;
           on ctDNA&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study population will comprise subjects diagnosed with GEP-NEC or large-cells&#xD;
      neuroendocrine carcinoma of the Lung with Ki67&lt; 55% with stable disease, partial of complete&#xD;
      response after 6 cycles of first line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Event: An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may&#xD;
      appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent&#xD;
      illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the&#xD;
      subject's health, including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria below),&#xD;
      regardless of etiology. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in the&#xD;
      frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or&#xD;
      syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the case report form (CRF) rather than the&#xD;
      individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease progression is not to be reported as an AE. An overdose, accidental or intentional,&#xD;
      whether or not it is associated with an AE, or abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to&#xD;
      an investigational product should be reported as an AE. If an overdose is associated with an&#xD;
      AE, the overdose and adverse event should be reported as separate terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may include monitoring&#xD;
      of any or all of the following parameters: the subject's clinical symptoms, laboratory,&#xD;
      pathological, radiological or surgical findings, physical examination findings, or other&#xD;
      appropriate tests and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All AEs will be recorded by the Investigator from the time the subject signs informed consent&#xD;
      to at least 30 days after the last dose of CT or until the last study visit, whichever period&#xD;
      is longer. Adverse Events and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded on the AE page&#xD;
      of the CRF and in the subject's source documents. All SAEs must be reported to PIs within 24&#xD;
      hours of the Investigator's knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method,&#xD;
      using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. All SAEs will be also reported to&#xD;
      Novartis safety desk within 15 days of learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse events will be summarized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analyses: All pats who receive at least 1 dose of study drug will be evaluated for&#xD;
      safety and toxicity. Adverse event (AE) terms and severity grades will be assigned by the&#xD;
      investigator using CTCAE v. 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analyses will include listings and/or summaries of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including seriousness, severity and possible&#xD;
           relationship to study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose adjustments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CTCAE grades for laboratory and non laboratory parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients: Thirty pts (20 in experimental arm and 10 in the control arm) will be&#xD;
      randomized&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical method: This is an open-label study. Patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria for enrollment will be allowed to enroll in the study. Those patients entering the&#xD;
      study during all the trial will be allocated to arm A or arm B. Assignment to treatment will&#xD;
      be determined prior to Cycle 1 d1 using an interactive response system by mail at a central&#xD;
      location. Patients will be sequentially allocated to arm A or arm B with a 1:2 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase II study not powered for statistical comparison between arm A and B. The&#xD;
      number of patients is sufficient for an exploratory analysis of the activity of Everolimus as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy in this setting of patients. Only if the results in this analysis will be&#xD;
      encouraging, a second step of the study will be powered for a comparison between arm A and B.&#xD;
