    <textblock>
      Primary Objective: To assess the relative bioavailability of RBP-7000 formulated with 2&#xD;
      different molecular weights (MW) (low and high MW as test treatments) of poly&#xD;
      (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) with a carboxylic acid end group (PLGH) polymer compared to&#xD;
      intermediate MW PLGH polymer following single subcutaneous (SC) injection of RBP-7000 in&#xD;
      subjects with stable schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single SC injections of RBP-7000 using a PLGH&#xD;
      polymer of 2 different MW (low and high MW as test treatments) compared to intermediate MW&#xD;
      polymer in subjects with stable schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, single-dose, parallel-group study in subjects&#xD;
      with clinically stable schizophrenia who are not currently taking risperidone. A total of&#xD;
      approximately 48 subjects (16 per group) will be randomized to receive a single subcutaneous&#xD;
      (SC) injection of RBP-7000 120 mg formulated with PLGH polymer of either 21 kilodaltons (kDa)&#xD;
      (low MW group), 29 kDa of PLGH polymer (high MW group), or 26 kDa of PLGH polymer&#xD;
      (intermediate MW group).&#xD;
