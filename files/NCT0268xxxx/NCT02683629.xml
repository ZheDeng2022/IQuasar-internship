      To assess the safety of xenotransplantation of NTCELL [immunoprotected&#xD;
      (alginate-encapsulated) choroid plexus cells] in patients with Parkinson's disease, assessed&#xD;
      over the duration of the study, by monitoring the occurrence of adverse events and serious&#xD;
      adverse events, including clinical and laboratory evidence of xenogeneic infection in&#xD;
      transplant recipients and their partners/close contacts. Subsequent safety follow-up will&#xD;
      include lifelong monitoring for clinical and laboratory evidence of xenogeneic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy of xenotransplantation of NTCELL [immunoprotected&#xD;
      (alginate-encapsulated) choroid plexus cells] in patients with Parkinson's disease. This will&#xD;
      be quantified by testing the secondary endpoints of the trial as described below (see&#xD;
      Endpoints/Outcome Measures).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is characterized by widespread neural degeneration, particularly in the&#xD;
      substantia nigra and its projections to the basal ganglia. Current therapy for Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease is purely symptomatic. There is a pressing need for a treatment that reverses or&#xD;
      slows the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous transplant-based therapies have attempted to support, repair or replace the&#xD;
      degenerating nigrostriatal neurons. These have included the transplantation of foetal and&#xD;
      other neuronal stem cells, gene transfers, and the implantation of devices releasing neural&#xD;
      growth factors. All these have been shown to have some effectiveness in animal models, but&#xD;
      have been generally disappointing in human studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracranial choroid plexus cell transplantation has the potential to deliver biological&#xD;
      neural agents for the treatment of Parkinson's disease which cannot be achieved by&#xD;
      conventional treatment. The overall aim of delivering neural proteins and compounds over many&#xD;
      months to the basal ganglia of the brain is to enhance neural repair currently not possible&#xD;
      with antiparkinsonian medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As animal-derived tissues have to be protected from immune rejection when transplanted into&#xD;
      humans, transplants are usually accompanied by immunosuppressive therapy. However, porcine&#xD;
      choroid plexus cells are preferably implanted without the use of immunosuppressive drugs&#xD;
      which cause significant morbidity. To protect them from immune rejection, the cells can be&#xD;
      encapsulated in alginate microcapsules which permit the inward passage of nutrients and the&#xD;
      outward passage of biologic neural proteins and compounds normally secreted by choroid plexus&#xD;
      cells. Alginate-encapsulated porcine choroid plexus cells implanted into the brain without&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs have survived rejection for many months in animal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTCELL comprises neonatal porcine choroid plexus cells encapsulated in alginate&#xD;
      microcapsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bilateral dose that will be administered to the 18 patients (initially 3 groups of 6&#xD;
      patients, randomised 4:2 NTCELL:sham surgery) enrolled in this trial will be up to a total of&#xD;
      twice the human equivalent dose administered unilaterally in LCT's non-human primate study.&#xD;
      Thus up to 240 NTCELL microcapsules (± 5%) administered on each side of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are no significant safety issues after implantation of the first group of patients,&#xD;
      the second group of patients will then be scheduled to receive implants of NTCELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are no significant safety issues after implantation of the second group of patients,&#xD;
      the third group of patients will then be scheduled to receive implants of NTCELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will adopt an adaptive design in respect to the choice of dose of NTCELL for the&#xD;
      fourth group of patients (those patients who originally received sham surgery in Groups 1-3).&#xD;
      Following unblinding of the study after Groups 1-3 have reached 26-week follow-up, an interim&#xD;
      analysis, for safety and efficacy, will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are no significant safety issues, the last group of patients, Group 4, (who&#xD;
      originally received sham surgery) will be scheduled to receive NTCELL implants. The dose of&#xD;
      NTCELL given will be determined by the DSMB following a proposal from the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator, based on the results of the interim analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease patients will be followed up for 26 weeks after receiving either an&#xD;
      implantation of NTCELL or sham surgery.&#xD;
