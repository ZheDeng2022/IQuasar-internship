      GTL001 Vaccine Adjuvanted With Imiquimod Cream in HPV 16- and/or HPV 18-Infected Women Aged&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an outpatient, open-label study. After a screening period of up to 4 weeks, all&#xD;
      eligible subjects will receive 2 doses, 6 weeks apart, of GTL001 Powder reconstituted with&#xD;
      water for injection. GTL001 will be adjuvanted with Aldara, 5% imiquimod cream, applied to&#xD;
      the injection site 15 minutes and 24 hours after each vaccination. The follow-up period is 12&#xD;
      weeks from the first injection. The duration of the study is defined for each subject as the&#xD;
      date that signed, written informed consent is provided through the last follow-up visit.&#xD;
      Total duration of subject participation is approximately 16 weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subject is in generally good health based on medical history and on clinically&#xD;
             acceptable results, in the judgment of the investigator, on the following assessments:&#xD;
             physical examination, vital signs, clinical chemistry, and hematology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Cervical HPV 16 and/or 18 infection confirmed by cobas® HPV Test (Roche Molecular&#xD;
             Systems, Inc) real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) assay at screening.&#xD;

             methods of birth control include those that result in a low failure rate (ie, less&#xD;
             than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectable,&#xD;

             intrauterine system, intrauterine devices, vasectomized partner, and true sexual&#xD;
             abstinence. Subjects not of childbearing potential include those who are surgically&#xD;
