  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine features of MRSA that are associated with chronic MRSA infection&#xD;
      and bacterial persistence despite IV antibiotic therapy. Subjects are asked to expectorate&#xD;
      sputum and complete CF symptom diaries both at beginning and end of IV therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, translational study examined bacterial morphology and function pre-&#xD;
      vs. post antibiotic therapy in patients with CF who experience a pulmonary exacerbation that&#xD;
      requires IV antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical care is dictated by the treating physician(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Male or female with a confirmed diagnosis of CF (by sweat test and/or identification of&#xD;
           2 CF disease causing mutations).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Chronic infection with MRSA defined as having had MRSA positive respiratory cultures for&#xD;
           &gt; 1 year with &gt; 50% of cultures being MRSA positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Being able to expectorate sputum on a consistent basis, i.e. also at the end of IV&#xD;
           therapy 3A: starting April 2017 people with CF who cannot expectorate sputum can also&#xD;
           participate if they will do two orapharyngeal swab cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Having a pulmonary exacerbation defined for this protocol as the decision of the&#xD;
           treating physician to start IV therapy in hospital or at home. Typically this occurs&#xD;
           when there has been a &gt;5% drop in FEV1 % predicted compared to the patient's baseline&#xD;
           and increased respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. NOTE: Patients who had oral or inhaled antibiotics with or without MRSA activity&#xD;
                but failed i.e. are changed to IV antibiotics are allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presence / infection with B. cepacia genomovar III (B. cenocepacia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects who have undergone lung or liver transplant in the past (NOTE: patients listed&#xD;
           for transplant are eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Concomitant participation and/or use of an investigational drug within 30 days of this&#xD;
           study. Concomitant observational studies are allowed with TRI-STAR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be asked to expectorate a sputum into a sterile specimen cup solely for this&#xD;
      study. This may be a second sample after giving one for the clinical laboratory at start of&#xD;
      therapy. The subject will be asked for a repeat sputum sample for the study at end of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point definition: A) Start of therapy sample: up to 3 days prior and up to 36 hours&#xD;
      after the first dose of anti-MRSA antibiotic. B) End of therapy: no earlier than 36 hours&#xD;
      prior to the last dose and up to one week after completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of clinical information: Clinical information to be collected include:&#xD;
      Demographics, age, CF genotype, anthropometrics; FEV1 FVC, FEF 25-75 in liter and % predicted&#xD;
      per site specific reference values; all medications (routine and those started within 2 weeks&#xD;
      and at time of admission/IV therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CF daily Symptom score: Subject will be asked to complete the CF Symptom diary for the first&#xD;
      and last 3 days of IV therapy. For subjects admitted to the hospital this will be&#xD;
      administered by the RC for those at home the RC will call / e-mail them as reminder or do it&#xD;
      with them per phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry at conclusion of therapy: Most patients have a follow-up clinic visit or are still&#xD;
      in the hospital at time of completion of IV therapy and spirometry is part of routine&#xD;
      clinical assessment. NOTE: Patients who would not have a clinic visit at end of therapy may&#xD;
      be asked to return for spirometry and sputum sample solely for this study. If the subject&#xD;
      agrees to this, reimbursement for travel will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Assays:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro assays done on either banked isolates in Aim 1 or sputum samples / MRSA isolates&#xD;
      from sputum include tests on bacterial fitness as growth under different conditions;&#xD;
      antibiotic susceptibility assays; metabolic and virulence activity and genes, and mutator&#xD;
      rates for sputum isolates. More details are provided in the grant application.&#xD;
