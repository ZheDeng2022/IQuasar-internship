    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, proof-of-principle, open-label study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of MN-001 in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and&#xD;
      Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects with hypertriglyceridemia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist a Screening Phase (up to 4 months) followed by a Treatment Phase (12&#xD;
      weeks), and a Follow-up visit (within 1 week after the last dose). A total of 40 male and&#xD;
      female subjects ≥18 years of age are planned to be enrolled. During the Screening Phase,&#xD;
      subjects will be assessed for study eligibility. After signing the informed consent form, the&#xD;
      following assessments will be performed: medical history including review of prior and&#xD;
      current medications, physical examination including height and body weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference, vital signs and an electrocardiogram. Clinical labs, routine chemistries,&#xD;
      hematology, coagulation profile, urinalysis and a serum pregnancy test will be collected as&#xD;
      well as cytokeratin-18 (CK-18), a biomarker for NASH diagnosis. An alcohol consumption&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered and a MRI scan of the liver will be performed. Serum&#xD;
      fibrosis markers, the Fib-4 index (age, AST, ALT, PLT) and NAFLD fibrosis score (age, BMI,&#xD;
      AST/ALT ratio, IFG/DM, PLT, Albumin) will be calculated.&#xD;
