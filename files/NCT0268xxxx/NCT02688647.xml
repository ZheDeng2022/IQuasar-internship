    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study will be conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and activity of&#xD;
      400 mg of KD025 once-daily (QD) compared to Best Supportive Care (BSC) in male and&#xD;
      postmenopausal/surgically sterilized female subjects with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis&#xD;
      (IPF). The primary objectives are to evaluate the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in forced vital capacity (FVC) from Baseline to 24 weeks after dosing with KD025&#xD;
           400 mg QD in subjects with IPF compared to BSC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and tolerability of KD025 400 mg QD when administered for 24 weeks to subjects&#xD;
           with IPF compared to BSC&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, open-label, multicenter study in subjects with IPF who had&#xD;
      either received pirfenidone and/or nintedanib or had been offered both treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 81 eligible subjects with IPF will be randomly enrolled in a 2:1 ratio (KD025&#xD;
      to BSC) to 1 of 2 treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group 1 (Experimental): Receive KD025 400 mg orally QD for 24 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group 2 (Control): Receive BSC, deemed appropriate by the Investigator, for 24&#xD;
           weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Screening Period is up to 29 days prior to entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Screening Visit, subjects will visit the site at Baseline (Week 1 Day 1), and the&#xD;
      end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 (± 3 days). Subjects in Treatment Group 1 will receive&#xD;
      their first dose of KD025 in the clinic on Week 1 Day 1. KD025 will then be dispensed for&#xD;
      home administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Treatment Group 1 who complete 24 weeks of treatment with KD025 400 mg QD will&#xD;
      have the option of continuing therapy with KD025 400 mg QD up to an additional 72 weeks if&#xD;
      there are no safety signals and if clinical progress continues. No subject in Treatment Group&#xD;
      1 is permitted to receive therapy with KD025 greater than a total of 96 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Treatment Group 2 who complete 24 weeks of BSC will have the option of crossing&#xD;
      over to therapy with KD025 400 mg QD for up to 96 weeks if there are no safety signals and if&#xD;
      clinical progress continues. No subject in Treatment Group 2 is permitted to receive KD025&#xD;
      400 mg QD therapy greater than 96 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo the same assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy assessments include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs), which include FVC; residual volume (RV); and diffusing&#xD;
           capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide [DLCO]);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six-minute walking distance (6MWD);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency and severity of IPF exacerbation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to acute exacerbation of IPF;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events (AEs);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse events (SAEs);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examinations (PEs);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital sign (VS) measurements;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiograms (ECGs);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reasons for treatment discontinuation due to toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory assessments include biomarkers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matrix Metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemokine Ligand 18 (CCL18);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surfactant Protein-D (SPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits will occur 30 days (± 3 days) after the last dose of KD025. (A Follow-up&#xD;
      Visit is not necessary for subjects receiving BSC.) Subjects will undergo the following&#xD;
      safety assessments: complete PEs, VS measurements, weight measurements, AE assessments,&#xD;
      concomitant medication and procedures assessments, blood sample collection for hematology&#xD;
      (including coagulation), chemistry and thyroid function (TSH), pulmonary function tests&#xD;
      (PFTs), and urinalysis. If another therapy is started within 30 days after the last dose of&#xD;
      study drug, the Follow-up visit will be conducted before the start of the other therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive KD025 400 mg QD for 24 weeks. After 24 weeks of therapy, subjects will&#xD;
      have the option of continuing therapy with KD025 400 mg QD. Subjects who do not continue&#xD;
      KD025 400 mg QD after 24 weeks will remain on study up to a total of 32 weeks: 4 weeks for&#xD;
      screening, 24 weeks of treatment with KD025 400 mg QD, and 4 weeks of Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who chose to continue therapy with KD025 400 mg QD after 24 weeks will be permitted&#xD;
      to remain on-study up to a total of 104 weeks: a 4-week screening, 96-week treatment period&#xD;
      with KD025 400 mg QD (an initial 24-week period and an additional 72-week period), and a&#xD;
      4-week Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No subject will be permitted to receive more than 96 weeks of treatment with KD025 400 mg QD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive BSC for 24 weeks, after which they will have the option to cross over&#xD;
      to treatment with KD025 400 mg QD. Subjects who do not cross over will remained on-study up&#xD;
      to 32 weeks: 4-week screening, 24-week BSC, and 4-week Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who chose to crossover to KD025 400 mg QD therapy therapy are permitted to remain&#xD;
      on-study up to 128 weeks: 4-week screening, 24-week BSC, 96-week treatment with KD025 400 mg&#xD;
      QD, and 4-week Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No subject will be permitted to receive more than 96 weeks of treatment with KD025 400 mg QD.&#xD;
