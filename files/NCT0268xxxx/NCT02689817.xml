  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs) are a well-established serious complication of&#xD;
      hospitalization that have serious consequences on patient morbidity and mortality as well as&#xD;
      the cost of care. At the core of the problem for patient-centered targeted prevention of&#xD;
      HAPUs is the lack of knowledge surrounding the magnitude and duration of pressure necessary&#xD;
      to cause pressure ulcers, and the lack of immediate feedback on whether these interventions&#xD;
      do anything to substantially offload at risk areas. Previous studies have been inconsistent&#xD;
      in their findings of an association between duration of time and HAPU occurrence. While&#xD;
      retrospectively this has been investigated, there is currently no substantial prospective,&#xD;
      randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to better understand the interface pressures between the patient and his or&#xD;
      her support surface and how this relates to the development of pressure ulcers. The effect of&#xD;
      patient characteristics and the relationship between total length of time on the operating&#xD;
      table and pressure ulcer development will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this study will significantly add to strengthening the body of evidence&#xD;
      regarding pressure ulcer development, specifically the relationship between the magnitude of&#xD;
      interface pressure between the patient and the support surface for what duration of time&#xD;
      leads to the development of a pressure ulcer. The results will provide critical insight into&#xD;
      the physiologic targets healthcare providers should use to develop better pressure ulcer&#xD;
      prevention programs, which could ultimately lead to a reduction in the incidence of pressure&#xD;
      ulcers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs) are a well-established serious complication of&#xD;
      hospitalization that have serious consequences on patient morbidity and mortality as well as&#xD;
      the cost of care. Following CMS's changes to hospital reimbursements and penalization for&#xD;
      hospitals with the highest rate of hospital-acquired complications, numerous quality&#xD;
      improvement initiatives have been implemented. An overall reduction in the reported incidence&#xD;
      of HAPUs from approximately 7 to 4.5% was observed, largely attributed to these&#xD;
      interventions. Though there had been a drop in incidence, the overall number of hospitalized&#xD;
      patients who develop HAPUs remains large and more recently HAPU frequency in hospitals has&#xD;
      not continued to decrease, despite educational pressure ulcer prevention programs and&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the complications and costs associated with the development of a pressure ulcer,&#xD;
      research has suggested that prevention is more effective than standard care. There are many&#xD;
      current solutions for preventative interventions for HAPUs including leadership initiatives,&#xD;
      data tracking, risk scales and many adjuvant pressure-offloading devices such as beds and&#xD;
      mattress pads. Many of these devices have limited data supporting their effectiveness or are&#xD;
      costly to implement in a purely prophylactic manner when current risk stratification methods&#xD;
      fail to capture 60% of patients who go on to develop an ulcer. The vast majority of current&#xD;
      preventative measures for pressure ulcers either seek to reduce the time a patient spends in&#xD;
      one position or to reduce the magnitude of pressure that occurs on the high-risk areas for&#xD;
      pressure ulcers. As such, manual repositioning (turning) is the most frequently used&#xD;
      intervention as it is felt to be low-cost and part of standard care. Repositioning works by&#xD;
      reducing or eliminating the interface pressure between the patient and the contact surface,&#xD;
      but the standard recommendation on the 2 hour frequency were derived from animal studies and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. An expert consensus by Black et al. (2011) recommended the need for&#xD;
      clinical decision-making based on the individual's needs and clinical situation when&#xD;
      establishing a turning schedule, but there are very few objective tools that clinicians can&#xD;
      use to make the decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the core of the problem for patient-centered targeted prevention of HAPUs is the lack of&#xD;
      knowledge surrounding the magnitude and duration of pressure necessary to cause pressure&#xD;
      ulcers, and the lack of immediate feedback on whether these interventions do anything to&#xD;
      substantially offload at risk areas. Previous studies have been inconsistent in their&#xD;
      findings of an association between duration of surgery and HAPU occurrence, with results&#xD;
      ranging from a negative association to a positive association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to better understand the interface pressures between the patient and his or&#xD;
      her support surface and how this relates to the development of pressure ulcers. This data&#xD;
      will provide critical insight into the physiologic targets healthcare providers should use to&#xD;
      develop better pressure ulcer prevention programs and ultimately lead to a reduction in the&#xD;
      incidence of pressure ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the interface pressure trend on the sacrum throughout the&#xD;
      duration of time a patient is on the operating table and how that is correlated with pressure&#xD;
      ulcer development. The effect of Braden scale score and other patient characteristics and the&#xD;
      relationship between total length of time on the operating table and pressure ulcer&#xD;
      development, and healthcare provider intervention in response to the pressure reading if in&#xD;
      the second part of the study healthcare providers are not blinded to the pressure data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will measure the interface pressure between a patient and his or her support&#xD;
      surface in the operating room for prolonged (&gt;2 hour) operative cases. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      receive an adhesive padded bandage (similar to Mepilex Gentle Border) that collects interface&#xD;
      pressure data. When the patient is being positioned in the operating room, this bandage will&#xD;
      be applied to the sacrum. At the completion of the case the bandage will be removed and the&#xD;
      status of the skin will be recorded and a photo of the sacrum will be taken for&#xD;
      documentation. Skin status will be reassessed at 24 hours and at 1 week at regularly&#xD;
      scheduled follow-ups with the surgeon. Pressure ulcer development will then be correlated&#xD;
      with interface pressure characteristics during the operative case, using demographic data to&#xD;
      check homogeneity between the experimental and control groups. If at interim analysis there&#xD;
      is a clear relationship between a pressure threshold and pressure ulcer development, the&#xD;
      second portion of the study will not blind healthcare providers to the live data. They would&#xD;
      be able to see the pressure measurement and reposition the patient to effectively offload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While retrospectively this has been investigated, there is currently no substantial&#xD;
      prospective, randomized study. This study will significantly add to strengthening the body of&#xD;
      evidence regarding pressure ulcer development, specifically the relationship between the&#xD;
      magnitude of interface pressure between the patient and the support surface for what duration&#xD;
      of time leads to the development of a pressure ulcer.&#xD;
