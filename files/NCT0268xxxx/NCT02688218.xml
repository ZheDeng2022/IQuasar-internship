      The risk of hypoglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes increases considerably during&#xD;
      exercise. As a result, many patients with type 1 diabetes experience fear of and reluctance&#xD;
      to pursue physical activity, in order to avoid the discomforting symptoms associated with&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. The bi-hormonal artificial pancreas, a device used for automatic delivery of&#xD;
      insulin and glucagon subcutaneously to subjects with type 1 diabetes, is paving the way to&#xD;
      revolutionize the management of this disease. The investigator's group has recently completed&#xD;
      a study of the bi-hormonal artificial pancreas system during exercise, suggesting reduced&#xD;
      hypoglycemia around the exercise period. In order to prepare for a future home study, the&#xD;
      ability to detect, grade, and classify physical activity so as to appropriately adjust system&#xD;
      parameters is vital in helping to prevent exercise induced hypoglycemia in the home setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to collect 3-axis accelerometry data and heart rate data during a&#xD;
      variety of different home activities, as well as during formal exercise in both healthy&#xD;
      subjects and subjects with type 1 diabetes. Additionally, the investigators will observe the&#xD;
      change in glucose levels before and after exercise in subjects with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

      The artificial pancreas, a device used for automatic delivery of insulin and glucagon&#xD;
      subcutaneously to subjects with type 1 diabetes, is paving the way to revolutionize the&#xD;
      management of this disease. Already, the benefit of improved glycemic control compared to&#xD;
      current open-loop pump therapy has been demonstrated in several trials. The investigator's&#xD;
      group has shown that artificial pancreas algorithm dual hormone system effectively manages&#xD;
      blood glucose in a clinic setting and the investigators have specifically shown great&#xD;
      progress using glucagon to reduce hypoglycemic episodes outside of exercise. The&#xD;
      investigators most recent inpatient study, as yet unpublished, shows that adjusting insulin&#xD;
      and glucagon delivery during closed loop treatment, after announcing exercise, effectively&#xD;
      reduces mean time below a glucose level of 70 mg/dl when compared to closed loop control&#xD;
      without adjustments. The investigators utilized initial open-loop data from this study to&#xD;
      help devise dosing changes for the artificial pancreas algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to prepare for a future home study, the ability to detect, grade, and classify&#xD;
      physical activity so as to appropriately adjust system parameters is vital in helping to&#xD;
      prevent exercise induced hypoglycemia in the home setting. Currently, our closed-loop system&#xD;
      transmits heart rate and accelerometry outputs from a Zephyrlife BioPatch monitoring device&#xD;
      to a Nexus 5 smart phone master controller via Bluetooth. The algorithm then converts the&#xD;
      heart rate and accelerometry data into modified estimated energy expenditure - accounting for&#xD;
      age, weight, height, sex, resting and sitting heart rates - to determine if exercise is&#xD;
      present. However, further data collection is needed to hone the specificity and sensitivity&#xD;
      of the detection algorithm to account for a wide variety of subject characteristics and&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to collect 3-axis accelerometry data and heart rate data during a&#xD;
      variety of different home activities, as well as during formal exercise, which included&#xD;
      aerobic exercise (on a calibrated treadmill) and resistance exercise (straight-leg raises or&#xD;
      equivalent) in healthy subjects as well as subjects with type 1 diabetes. Optionally VO2 data&#xD;
      from a portable VO2 mask will be obtained. The data collected will be used to further enhance&#xD;
      our algorithm that, in future closed-loop studies, will detect exercise and automatically&#xD;
      trigger algorithmic adjustments to reduce exercise-related hypoglycemia during and after&#xD;
      exercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
