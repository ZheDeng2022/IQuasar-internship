    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder associated with&#xD;
      persistent low mood, loss of the capacity to experience pleasure (i.e. anhedonia), reduced&#xD;
      social functioning, and impaired quality of life. MDD is estimated to affect approximately 2%&#xD;
      of Canadian women and 1% of Canadian men at any point in time. The World Health Organization&#xD;
      affirms that depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, with increasing global&#xD;
      economic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatments for depression include basic psychosocial support combined with&#xD;
      antidepressant medication or psychotherapy. It has been observed, however, that only 50% of&#xD;
      individuals respond to psychological treatment, and only 30-40% of patients achieve full&#xD;
      remission after initial treatment with antidepressants. Music- and sound-related therapies&#xD;
      have the potential to serve as adjuncts to, or facilitators of, medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will examine the effectiveness of a new therapeutic tool, known as Rhythmic&#xD;
      Sensory Stimulation, as an adjunctive treatment for Major Depressive Disorder. Rhythmic&#xD;
      Sensory Stimulation is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses periodic pulses&#xD;
      of light, sound, or tactile stimulus, to induce changes in the patterns of brain activity.&#xD;
      Participants in this study will undertake 30 minutes of daily music intervention&#xD;
      self-administered at home, for 5 days per week, for a total of 5 weeks. We will assess&#xD;
      depression symptoms, sleep quality, quality of life, and brain activity pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the present study will help to better understand the effectiveness of Rhythmic&#xD;
      Sensory Stimulation to the treatment of mood disorders, and contribute to the development of&#xD;
      future studies to investigate the neural driving effects of therapies based on Rhythmic&#xD;
      Sensory Stimulation.&#xD;

      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder associated with&#xD;
      persistent low mood, loss of the capacity to experience pleasure (i.e. anhedonia), reduced&#xD;
      social functioning, and impaired quality of life. MDD is estimated to affect approximately 2%&#xD;
      of Canadian women and 1% of Canadian men at any point in time. The World Health Organization&#xD;
      affirms that depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, with increasing global&#xD;
      economic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatments for depression include basic psychosocial support combined with&#xD;
      antidepressant medication or psychotherapy. It has been observed, however, that only 50% of&#xD;
      individuals respond to psychological treatment, and only 30-40% of patients achieve full&#xD;
      remission after initial treatment with antidepressants. Music- and sound-related therapies&#xD;
      have the potential to serve as adjuncts to, or facilitators of, medication. Several recent&#xD;
      systematic reviews have concluded that music is an effective therapeutic tool with&#xD;
      significant results on improving global state, symptoms, and overall functioning, and is also&#xD;
      well-accepted by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of music and rhythmic sensory&#xD;
      stimulation with low-frequency sounds as an adjunctive therapy for depression. Through a&#xD;
      systematic collection of clinical, behavioural and electrophysiological measures, the project&#xD;
      also aims to determine the possible mechanisms that underlie the effects of music- and&#xD;
      sound-based therapies on symptoms of MDD. In addition to measures of depression severity and&#xD;
      symptoms, we are also interested in secondary behavioral measures addressing possible&#xD;
      confounding variables, such as anhedonia, quality of life, and individual differences in how&#xD;
      people experience reward and pleasure associated with music. These assessments will allow an&#xD;
      initial investigation of the neural correlates of the therapeutic effects of music in the&#xD;
      treatment of depression, which is greatly warranted to better understand the efficacy of&#xD;
      music- and sound-based treatments.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in this group will undertake 30 minutes of daily Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation, for 5 day per week, for a total of 5 weeks. The stimulation consists of specially composed relaxing music tracks embedded with gamma frequency sounds of 30-70 Hz range. The intervention is conducted at the participant's home using a portable device called Sound Oasis Vibroacoustic Therapy System (VTS) 1000 unit. This device is a low-voltage consumer product device that has built in low frequency (subwoofer-type) speakers. The low frequency sounds played by the subwoofer speaker is experienced as vibrotactile vibration that is synchronized with the relaxing musical track.</description>

    <description>The stimulation consists of 30 minutes of daily stimulation with specially composed relaxing music tracks embedded with gamma frequency sounds of 30-70 Hz range.&#xD;
In this study, the stimuli will be delivered with a portable sound device called Sound Oasis Vibroacoustic Therapy System (VTS-1000) unit, which is a low-voltage consumer product that has two built in mid to high frequency speakers and one built in low frequency (subwoofer-type) speaker. The low frequency sounds played by the subwoofer speaker is experienced as vibrotactile vibration. Although the Intervention of Interest in this study is the Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation with low-frequency sounds, the efficacy of the Sound Oasis VTS-1000 device to deliver the intervention will also be subject to observation.</description>
