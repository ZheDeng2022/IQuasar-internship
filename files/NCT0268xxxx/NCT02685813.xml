  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neural tube defects cover a group of severe embryo malformations such as anencephaly and&#xD;
      spina bifida. The most severe forms of spina bifida causes numerous disabilities that demand&#xD;
      lifelong treatment by a team consisting of primarily neurosurgeons, pediatricians,&#xD;
      obstetricians, pediatric neurologists, pediatric urologists, gastroenterologists,&#xD;
      psychologists and social workers. The disabilities involve morbidity such as decreased motor&#xD;
      and sensory function caudal to the lesion, hydrocephalus, scoliosis, bladder and bowel&#xD;
      incontinence as well as increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2004, the Danish Health Authorities introduced new guidelines for fetal diagnostics. These&#xD;
      represented a change of paradigm stating that all pregnant women should be offered a prenatal&#xD;
      examination including an ultra sound scan in week 12-13 of gestation (including risk&#xD;
      estimation of chromosomal diseases) as well as in week 19 of gestation (scanning primarily&#xD;
      for malformations). The examination program was not elaborated to eradicate diseases but to&#xD;
      support the reproductive autonomy of the pregnant women, including the possibility to seek&#xD;
      for termination of the pregnancy in the case of severe disease in the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe spina bifida is one of the malformations that can be diagnosed with the ultra sound&#xD;
      scan in week 19, and since the implementation of the new guidelines from the Danish Health&#xD;
      Authority a study by this research group has shown decreased birth incidence at least in the&#xD;
      Western part of Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is still unknown what has caused this decrease as is the exact number of pregnancies and&#xD;
      births complicated by spina bifida in the child; similarly it is unclear whether this decline&#xD;
      is a regional or if it is only a Danish phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By extraction of data from the Danish Fetal Database (&quot;FØTOdatabasen&quot;) which includes&#xD;
      information of all 60.000 pregnancies in Denmark annually, the purpose of this register study&#xD;
      is to investigate the incidence of pregnancies complicated by prenatal diagnosis of spina&#xD;
      bifida in Denmark from 2008 and on, as well as the pregnancy outcome in these cases&#xD;
      (including termination of pregnancy). Furthermore results will be compared to results&#xD;
      obtained by collaborative partners in Sweden and hopefully also in Saudi Arabia.&#xD;

      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of pregnancies in Denmark complicated by spina bifida in the child is constant,&#xD;
      but the number of births in Denmark complicated by spina bifida in the child has declined,&#xD;
      likely because the mother in most cases chooses to terminate the pregnancy in case of the&#xD;
      diagnosis of severe spina bifida at the 19 week ultrasound scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denmark is the only country in the world with a registered decline in the number of newborns&#xD;
      with severe spina bifida.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the incidence of pregnancies complicated by prenatal diagnosis of spina&#xD;
           bifida in Denmark from 2008 and on, as well as the pregnancy outcome in these cases&#xD;
           (including termination of pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In cooperation with international partners compare data from Denmark and Sweden (partner&#xD;
           in Sweden: Eleonor Tiblad, MD, Ph.D, Center for Fetal Medicine, Karolinska University&#xD;
           Hospital) and if possible also Saudi Arabia (partner in the Saudi Arabia collaboration:&#xD;
           Marianne Juhler, MD, DMSc, Professor, Rigshospitalet, Denmark and Daniele Rigamonti, MD,&#xD;
           professor, Chief of Staff, Department of Neurosurgery, John Hopkins University Hospital&#xD;
           Aramco Health Care, Baltimore, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding 1): Extraction of data from the Danish Fetal Database (&quot;FØTOdatabasen&quot;) which&#xD;
      includes information of all 60.000 pregnancies in Denmark annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding 2): Data comparable to those collected in this study are expected to be delivered&#xD;
      from collaborative partners in Sweden and Saudi Arabia. Comparison analysis of the data from&#xD;
      our collaborative partners in Sweden and Saudi Arabia in order to discover differences in&#xD;
      spina bifida pregnancy management on an international level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from Saudi Arabia and Sweden:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will ask their partners in Sweden and Saudi Arabia to provide&#xD;
      institutional, regional or national data comparable to those obtained in Denmark. Data from&#xD;
      each pregnancy will then be compared on the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prenatal diagnosis of spina bifida/MMC (ICD10: Q050-059)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy outcome: live birth, stillbirth, intrauterine death, spontaneous abortion,&#xD;
           termination of pregnancy, fetal reduction in twin pregnancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gestational age at outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidemiological details of the cohort offered prenatal diagnostics (population based,&#xD;
           institution based, population size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consultation guidelines and possibilities when spina bifida is diagnosed prenatally&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish Fetal Database:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FØTOdatabasen is a national fetal medicine database. The database includes information on&#xD;
      maternal characteristics: age, parity, BMI, ethnicity, smoking status, Diabetes status (from&#xD;
      2014), and on the pregnancy: mode of conception, result of first trimester risk assessment&#xD;
      for chromosomal anomalies, biometric data, ICD10-codes for any prenatally diagnosed&#xD;
      malformation. FØTOdatabasen receives this information automatically on a daily basis from all&#xD;
      birth departments' prenatal database (Astraia), and links data regarding each pregnancy with&#xD;
      postnatal outcome from the Danish Cytogenetic Registry, the National Patient Registry and the&#xD;
      National Birth Registry. FØTOdatabasen includes &gt;95% of all pregnancies in Denmark with due&#xD;
      date from 1. January 2008 and onwards. The data completeness is high, with missing data &lt;1%&#xD;
      for pregnancy outcome, &lt;1% for smoking status, and &lt;3% for mode of conception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database thereby provides a unique possibility to analyze population based data from&#xD;
      approximately 55.0000 pregnancies annually with prenatal diagnosis and postnatal outcome. On&#xD;
      an international level FØTOdatabasen thereby provides unique data to analyze pregnancies with&#xD;
      spina bifida in a population and the pregnancy outcome, including live born children,&#xD;
      intrauterine deaths and spontaneous as well as termination of pregnancy. Hereby it can be&#xD;
      estimated how many incidences of spina bifida are isolated or associated with other&#xD;
      malformations.&#xD;
