  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator is examining the use of one airway clearance medical device compared to the&#xD;
      use of two airway clearance medical devices together in patients with amyotrophic lateral&#xD;
      sclerosis (ALS). More specifically, the investigator wants to know how effective the use of&#xD;
      either a mechanical High Frequency Chest Compression (HFCC) device is on its own or the use&#xD;
      of both a mechanical High Frequency Chest Compression (HFCC) device and Cough Assist together&#xD;
      to maintain a healthy airway and clear secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first device is a passive form of mechanical High Frequency Chest Compression (HFCC),&#xD;
      which was designed to help clear the airway of mucus and other secretions through mechanical&#xD;
      knocking of the chest area. The second device, called a Cough Assist, aids patients to clear&#xD;
      mucus and secretions that they would otherwise be unable to clear with coughing. This study&#xD;
      will enroll up to 20 people in total at CSMC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This 180 day (25.7 weeks) pilot study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of airway&#xD;
      clearance devices in adults with ALS. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of&#xD;
      two treatment groups: treatment with a mechanical HCFF device alone or treatment with both a&#xD;
      mechanical HFCC device and a cough assist device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This outpatient study includes a screening/baseline visit followed by a 180 day (25.7 weeks)&#xD;
      treatment period with three scheduled clinic visits (day 30, day 90, day 180). Pulmonary&#xD;
      assessments and ALS outcome measures will be collected at each visit in addition to quality&#xD;
      of life assessments and device usage diaries.&#xD;

    <description>A projection radiograph of the chest used to diagnose conditions affecting the chest. Chest X-Ray performed at each study visit. Investigator looked at clinical impression of Chest X-ray to be normal versus abnormal. If there was presence of atelectasis, this indicated a worsening of subject's respiratory symptoms. If subject's Chest X-Ray impression remained the same and continually normal, this indicated no change in respiratory symptoms.</description>

    <description>A nuclear scanning test commonly used to detect abnormalities in air flow. A radioactive tracer gas or mist is inhaled into the lungs. Pictures from the scan indicate areas of the lungs that are not receiving enough air or that retain too much air. Areas of the lung that retain too much air are brighter spots on the film and areas not receiving enough air are dark. Lung scan performed at each study visit. Investigator looked at clinical impression of lung scan to be normal versus abnormal. If there was indication of decreased ventilation, this indicated a worsening of subject's respiratory symptoms. If subject's lung scan impression remained the same and continually normal, this indicated no change in respiratory symptoms.</description>
