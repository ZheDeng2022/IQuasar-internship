  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of three treatment arms that&#xD;
      are designed to improve survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects could be randomized to four (4) cycles of chemotherapy followed by immunotherapy, or&#xD;
      immunotherapy followed by chemotherapy, or four cycles of chemotherapy plus immunotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, three-arm, non-comparative randomized phase II study is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      three different sequences of double-consolidation with the humanized monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      targeted against cell surface receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), pembrolizumab, and&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced Non small cell lung cancer post induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy. While the goal of each arm is to guarantee exposure to each of these two agents&#xD;
      to patients who have not progressed post induction chemotherapy, they do so with different&#xD;
      sequence. In ARMs A and B, consolidation is sequential, with either pembrolizumab followed by&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel (ARM A), or nab-paclitaxel followed by pembrolizumab (ARM B). In ARM C,&#xD;
      consolidation is concurrent, with the two agents administered concurrently. As of July 24,&#xD;
      ARMs B and C are closed, and no patients will be enrolled on this study. ARM A remains open&#xD;
      to enrollment.&#xD;
