    <textblock>
      Phase II study with a two-stage design to evaluate efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in&#xD;
      combination with rituximab (I+R) in untreated patients with indolent clinical forms of MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extensive biological study will be conducted in order to further characterize this&#xD;
      population of MCL patients and evaluate the response obtained with the mutational profile of&#xD;
      the tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) have a median survival of 3-5 years despite&#xD;
      treatment. Indeed, the best therapeutic approach for different patients with MCL remains to&#xD;
      be established, coexisting different options of immunochemotherapy regimes which may include&#xD;
      autologous transplantation in first-line treatment or rituximab maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, last years MCL starts to be recognized as a heterogeneous disease both from&#xD;
      biological and clinical stand points. For instance, MCL cases with a non-nodal clinical&#xD;
      presentation, usually have distinctive biological features such as SOX-11 negativity,&#xD;
      hypermutated IGHV genes and a low number of genetic lesions associated. The outcome of these&#xD;
      cases is much more favourable compared to conventional MCL, reaching median survivals over 7&#xD;
      to 10 years even receiving less intensive treatments. In addition to that, up to 30% of the&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed MCL can be safely deferred from initial therapy until&#xD;
      progression . Therapeutic abstention may be prolonged for more than one year in 50% of cases.&#xD;
      These patients usually show longer survivals from the start of treatment compared to patients&#xD;
      immediately treated after diagnosis. Therefore, all these observations indicate that there&#xD;
      are indolent clinical forms in MCL, so its clinico-biological identification is crucial to&#xD;
      tailor treatment appropriately. However, at present there is no consensus on the diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria or treatment recommendations in cases of indolent MCL. This results in difficulties&#xD;
      for the identification of these forms in the clinical practice as well as with a certain&#xD;
      therapeutic in definition, as indolent forms of MCL can be treated either with therapeutic&#xD;
      abstention until progression or receive immediate treatment with conventional or more&#xD;
      intensive immuno-chemotherapy regimes, which may even include an autologous hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation. With the emergence of new biological agents in the therapeutic&#xD;
      arsenal of MCL arises the question whether a completely different approach with new drugs and&#xD;
      chemotherapy-free could be more appropriate in selected subsets of patients such as indolent&#xD;
      MCL forms.&#xD;
