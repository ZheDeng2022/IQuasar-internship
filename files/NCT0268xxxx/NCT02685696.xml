      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate if the use of the newly designed Alexis O Retractor leads to improved&#xD;
      intra-operative and post-operative surgical outcomes in the setting of planned elective&#xD;
      Caesarean Sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This ethically approved study is designed as a prospective, randomized controlled trial in&#xD;
      planned, first time Caesarean Sections with 200 patients randomized to either the Alexis-O&#xD;
      Retractor group or the conventional group. Patients with wound healing problems, connective&#xD;
      tissue disorders, insulin dependent diabetes, bleeding disorders, previous major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery and chorioamnionitis are excluded. Outcomes include surgical site infection,&#xD;
      intraoperative parameters such as tissue damage, postoperative analgesia requirements and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction scores.&#xD;

      Main Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the use of the newly designed Alexis O Retractor lead to improved Surgical Site&#xD;
      Infection rates intra-operative and post-operative surgical outcomes in the setting of&#xD;
      planned elective first time Caesarean Sections in patients compared to the traditional&#xD;
      self-retaining metal retractor?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the Alexis O Retractor lead to improved intra-operative and post-operative surgical&#xD;
      outcomes in the setting of planned elective Caesarean Sections?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study is designed as a prospective, randomized controlled trial with 100 patients&#xD;
      randomized to the Alexis O Retractor group and 100 patients to the conventional group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be recruited following a thorough discussion about the purpose and&#xD;
      methodology of the study and full documented consent will be obtained prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with wound healing problems, connective tissue disorders, diabetes, bleeding&#xD;
      disorders, previous abdominal surgery apart from laparoscopy and chorioamnionitis will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgical operators are thoroughly trained in the use and application of the Alexis O&#xD;
      Retractor prior to the start of the study and supported by regular teaching demonstrations.&#xD;
      The Obstetric Theatre Team is informed and trained in use and application of the Alexis O&#xD;
      Retractor within the Study Design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Approval has already been obtained from the Ethics committee at the Charité&#xD;
      University Hospital Committee and in keeping with ethical standards.&#xD;

    <description>A newly developed abdominal wall retractor for Caesarean Section is the Alexis O Ring which is formed of 2 rings and a interconnecting plastic polyurethane sheath where the flexible inner ring is placed into the abdomen and where the rigid outer ring is rolled to create tension on the plastic sheath providing 360° abdominal wound retraction with simultaneously a tamponade effect whilst covering the abdominal wound during the Caesarean Section and delivery of the baby.</description>
