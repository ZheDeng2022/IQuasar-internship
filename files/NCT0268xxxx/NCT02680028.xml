  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In England each year over 65,000 people fracture their hip. Most of these patients are&#xD;
      elderly females with the fracture occurring after a simple trip or stumble. Approximately&#xD;
      half of these fractures are classified from their relationship to the hip joint capsule as&#xD;
      extracapsular. The majority of these fractures are treated surgically by internal fixation&#xD;
      using, either a plate and screws (sliding hip screw) or nail and screws (intramedullary&#xD;
      nail).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent randomised studies from Peterborough involving 1000 patients have indicated that there&#xD;
      are modest benefits for treating this type of fracture with an intramedullary nail in&#xD;
      comparison to a sliding hip screw. This study aims to progress from these earlier studies to&#xD;
      determine if a slightly thinner and shorter intramedullary nail (175mm in length), has any&#xD;
      significant advantages or disadvantages to the standard length (220mm) intramedullary nail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both implants to be used in this study are in routine use around the world and are being used&#xD;
      within their licenced indication. The study is therefore using two different designs of&#xD;
      implant within their recommended area of use, but in which there is uncertainty as to which&#xD;
      is the best design.&#xD;

      The trial will be run as close to the ideal trial methodology for a randomised trial as&#xD;
      specified by the CONSORT statement as possible. This will include secure randomisation,&#xD;
      intention to treat analysis, full reporting of outcomes and clinical follow-up by a person&#xD;
      who is blinded to the prosthesis used. The trial will follow the code of good clinical&#xD;
      practice as specified by the hospital trusts Research and Development Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Peterborough all hip fracture patients are admitted to the acute trauma ward and&#xD;
      transferred to the care of the Chief Investigator (Mr Martyn Parker (MJP)). Those patients&#xD;
      that are willing to participant in this randomised trial are consented prior to surgery.&#xD;
      Treatment follows standard evidence based protocols with follow-up of all patients in a hip&#xD;
      fracture clinic. A comprehensive database is maintained for all patients containing both&#xD;
      audit and research data. Included in this is a standardised assessment of outcome.&#xD;
