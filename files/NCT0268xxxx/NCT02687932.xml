      Functional MR is caused by adverse left ventricular remodeling after myocardial injury and&#xD;
      associated with an increased incidence of heart failure and death. Because secondary&#xD;
      functional MR usually develops as a result of LV dysfunction, diuretics, beta blockers,&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and&#xD;
      aldosterone antagonists are given to patients with functional MR in line with the guidelines&#xD;
      in the management of heart failure. However, functional MR appears to remain common despite&#xD;
      use of these drugs and current medical treatment is usually insufficient for reducing MR or&#xD;
      reversing the adverse LV remodeling. As LCZ696 is a dual-acting inhibitor of the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), LCZ696 has&#xD;
      greater hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects than ARB alone. Investigators try to examine&#xD;
      the hypothesis that LCZ696 is superior to ARB alone in improving functional MR in patients&#xD;
      with LV dysfunction and functional MR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) has been reported to occur in up to 40% of&#xD;
      patients after myocardial infarction, and the prevalence of functional MR is likely to&#xD;
      increase with an aging population and improved survival rates for myocardial infarction. The&#xD;
      presence of functional MR is associated with an increased incidence of heart failure and&#xD;
      death, and patients with significant functional MR incur about a two-fold increase in the&#xD;
      risk of mortality and about a four-fold increase in the risk of heart failure. Functional MR&#xD;
      is caused by adverse left ventricular remodeling after myocardial injury with enlargement of&#xD;
      the left ventricle (LV), apical and lateral displacement of papillary muscles, leaflet&#xD;
      tethering and reduced closing forces. The leaflets are normal in secondary functional MR and&#xD;
      the treatment is considerably different between functional and primary MR. Surgery is the&#xD;
      only definitive therapy for primary severe MR and primary MR can usually be cured by surgical&#xD;
      valve repair. However, surgical indications are unclear in severe functional MR, because&#xD;
      outcomes after surgery for functional MR remain suboptimum. Operative mortality, long-term&#xD;
      mortality and heart failure rates are still high in patients with severe functional MR&#xD;
      despite surgical improvements. According to the current guidelines, mitral valve surgery may&#xD;
      be considered only for severely symptomatic patients with severe secondary functional MR who&#xD;
      have persistent symptoms despite optimal medical therapy for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because secondary functional MR usually develops as a result of LV dysfunction, diuretics,&#xD;
      beta blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor&#xD;
      blockers (ARB), and aldosterone antagonists are given to patients with functional MR in line&#xD;
      with the guidelines in the management of heart failure. However, functional MR appears to&#xD;
      remain common despite use of these drugs and current medical treatment is usually&#xD;
      insufficient for reducing MR or reversing the adverse LV remodeling. Persistence of&#xD;
      functional MR due to the insufficient effectiveness of current medical treatment&#xD;
      significantly increases morbidity and mortality, and compared with surgical or percutaneous&#xD;
      revascularization, significantly higher mortality was observed in patients managed with&#xD;
      medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative assessment of MR is strongly recommended in the guidelines and the regurgitant&#xD;
      volume and the effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) of MR can be measured accurately and&#xD;
      reproducibly by Doppler echocardiography. The EROA of MR has an important prognostic value in&#xD;
      primary and secondary functional MR. Because functional MR carries an adverse prognosis with&#xD;
      a graded relationship between MR severity and reduced survival, therapies that induce&#xD;
      beneficial reverse remodeling of the LV and reduce MR, may improve survival. ACE inhibitors&#xD;
      and ARBs could partially attenuate LV dilatation and remodeling after myocardial injury, but&#xD;
      there are no published data from prospective trials regarding whether attenuation of&#xD;
      remodeling by ACE inhibitors or ARBs reduces functional MR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LCZ696 is a dual-acting inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and&#xD;
      neutral endopeptidase (NEP). As LCZ696 offers the therapeutic advantages of concomitantly&#xD;
      blocking both RAAS and NEP, LCZ696 was more effective in reducing the risk of death from&#xD;
      cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart&#xD;
      failure than ACE inhibitor. Because NEP is involved in the metabolism of a number of&#xD;
      vasoactive peptides such as natriuretic peptides, NEP inhibitor has vasodilating effects,&#xD;
      facilitates sodium excretion and has profound effects on LV remodeling. Trials of&#xD;
      hypertension and heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction also showed that LCZ696 had&#xD;
      greater hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects than ARB alone. To date, there has been no&#xD;
      proven pharmacological therapy to improve functional MR, and the development of medical&#xD;
      therapy should be at the forefront of research considering the limited role of surgery in&#xD;
      managing functional MR. Investigators hypothesize that LCZ696 is superior to ARB alone in&#xD;
      improving functional MR in patients with LV dysfunction and functional MR via synergistic&#xD;
      effects of NEP and RAAS inhibition on LV remodeling, and try to examine this hypothesis in a&#xD;
      multicenter, double-blind, randomized comparison study using echocardiography.&#xD;
