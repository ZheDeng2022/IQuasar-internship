  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients over 18 years of age, admitted to the hospital with HF exacerbation, will be&#xD;
      eligible for randomization to low salt or regular diet. Laboratory tests are routinely&#xD;
      obtained on admission and on the day (or the day before) of discharge (comprehensive&#xD;
      metabolic panel and NT-proBNP) and will be recorded for the study. Daily weights are&#xD;
      routinely recorded, and intake/output will be monitored. At discharge, a Diet Acceptability&#xD;
      Questionnaire will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the discharge, participants will return for follow-up visits as needed for clinical&#xD;
      indications. Our study coordinator will document changes of symptoms, changes in therapies,&#xD;
      and capture clinical events like unscheduled hospital visits or visits to the Emergency Room.&#xD;
      Once during the study patients will be asked about their specific food consumption on a prior&#xD;
      day, and the Sodium content will be estimated. The final visit will occur in a year&#xD;
      (approximately 11-13 months after enrollment). Weight, other vital signs, CMP, BNP, and Diet&#xD;
      Acceptability Questionnaire quality of life questionnaire will be collected at this point, if&#xD;
      clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of study information will be collected from routine care for standard clinical&#xD;
      indications. The only components added for study purpose are Diet Acceptability Questionnaire&#xD;
      and collection of the information on consumed foods.&#xD;
