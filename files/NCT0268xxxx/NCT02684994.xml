      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effectiveness of a client-directed&#xD;
      version of a well-supported psychological therapy, cognitive processing therapy (CPT), for&#xD;
      the treatment of psychological effects of traumatic experiences. Participants in this study&#xD;
      are expected to be women who have experienced one or more interpersonal violence experiences&#xD;
      (i.e. physical or sexual assault).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first assessment, participants will be interviewed by a qualified&#xD;
      investigator/interviewer. The investigator/interviewer will ask participants about life&#xD;
      experiences and reactions, including traumatic experiences and symptoms participants might be&#xD;
      experiencing. This portion of the study will take approximately 2-3 hours. If participant's&#xD;
      assessment reveals that participant is eligible for the study participant will begin the&#xD;
      treatment portion of the study. If eligible, participant will also be given a packet of&#xD;
      questionnaires to complete before participant's first treatment session. If participant is&#xD;
      not eligible for the study, investigator/interviewer will provide participant with a list of&#xD;
      referrals from which participant could seek treatment with other agencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant begins the treatment portion of the study, participant will participate in a&#xD;
      client-directed version of cognitive processing therapy (CPT). CPT is a treatment designed to&#xD;
      help participant understand the ways participant's traumatic experience has affected various&#xD;
      aspects of participant's life (feelings, beliefs, behaviors, etc.). The treatment will&#xD;
      consist of four main components: education about trauma responses, experiencing emotions&#xD;
      related to the assault, development of skills for examining the truth of thoughts, and&#xD;
      examination of beliefs in areas commonly influenced by traumatic experiences. During this&#xD;
      treatment, participant will be exploring the ways in which the assault has affected&#xD;
      participant's beliefs, such as participant's beliefs about participant's own safety, trust,&#xD;
      and ability to have relationships. In the sessions, participant will explore these areas to&#xD;
      discover and change the ways participant believes, since the assault has led to feelings of&#xD;
      distress, fear, anxiety, and depression. Participant will be asked to do activities in&#xD;
      between sessions each week, which will ask participant to think and write about participant's&#xD;
      traumatic experiences. The treatment includes 12 sessions, each for one hour. Sessions will&#xD;
      be held once or twice a week. The current version of CPT will include all the components of&#xD;
      the regular CPT treatment, but may vary in order of sessions. The regular treatment protocol&#xD;
      provides sessions in a set order, but the current study will allow participant some choices&#xD;
      in when participant complete certain activities.&#xD;
