      While venous access is an essential part of caring for the preterm neonate potential severe&#xD;
      adverse events, including contamination of fluids with bacteria, endotoxins and particulates&#xD;
      could occur (Bethune 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infusion therapy carries a risk for catheter-associated septicaemia (Geiss 1992) originated&#xD;
      from the catheter tubing, the ports, at the cannula site or from contaminated infusion fluid.&#xD;
      While not all infections lead to septicaemia, immuno-compromised patients such as neonates&#xD;
      are at greater risk, and infection becomes a major problem (Ng 1989) and a major risk factor&#xD;
      for neurodevelopmental disabilities (Volpe 2008). Indeed, it has been postulated that&#xD;
      endotoxins may be involved in the pathogenesis of a proportion of cases of periventricular&#xD;
      leukomalacia, the most frequent brain damage associated with neurocognitive handicaps in the&#xD;
      human neonate (Volpe 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of calcium in parenteral nutrition mixture leads to precipitation due to its&#xD;
      incompatibility with the other components of the admixtures and leads to high concentration&#xD;
      of particles (Athanasiou 2014). Adverse systemic effects of particulate matter including&#xD;
      phlebitis, granulomata formation in the lung (Marshall 1987) and ischaemic necrosis, are a&#xD;
      common finding in necrotizing enterocolitis another serious complication flowing preterm&#xD;
      birth (Ballance 1990). Particle contamination of infusion solutions exists despite a&#xD;
      stringent infusion regiment. The number and composition of particles depends on the&#xD;
      complexity of the applied admixtures (Jack 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particulate contamination is due to drug incompatibility reactions or their incomplete&#xD;
      reconstitution during the preparation process (Schroder 1994). Various studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the contamination of infusion solutions with glass particles from opening glass&#xD;
      ampoules, particles from rubber stoppers or conglomerates of the parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      components (Ball 2003). Particles have also been shown to be inherent to generic drug&#xD;
      formulation (Oie 2005). In an intensive care setting the particle burden may rise up to one&#xD;
      million infused particles per day, increasing with the complexity and quantity of the&#xD;
      administered infusions (Walpot 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main IV filter pore sizes; the 0.2 micron filter is used for aqueous solutions,&#xD;
      and the 1.2 micron filter is recommended for larger molecule solutions such as lipids. The&#xD;
      0.2 micron filter has also been reported to remove air, microorganisms and particulate&#xD;
      matter. In addition, endotoxin retention is reportedly achieved by using a positively charged&#xD;
      filter membrane; toxic macro-molecules are released by gram-negative bacteria and are claimed&#xD;
      to be effective for up to ninety six hours (Bethune 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-line IV filters are currently claimed to be an effective strategy for the removal of&#xD;
      bacteria, endotoxins and particulates associated with intravenous therapy in adults (Ball&#xD;
      2003) and particularly effective in the removal of particles caused from drug precipitate&#xD;
      such as antibiotics (Chee 2002; Ball 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, evidence of the beneficial effect of in-line IV filters in children and neonates is&#xD;
      much weaker, despite some positive studies (Jack 2012; Boehne 2013; Sasse 2015). In the&#xD;
      population of preterm infants, no study is currently available while particulate&#xD;
      contamination due to infusion therapy carries a higher health risk in this subpopulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of using IV in-line filters in critically-ill preterm neonates remains to be&#xD;
      demonstrated. This intervention in adults has also been challenged by several authors&#xD;
      (Pearson 1996; Newell 1998). Friedland reported that certain drugs such as antibiotics may be&#xD;
      retained in the filters causing a reduction in potency (Friedland 1985). On the other hand,&#xD;
      there are no known adverse effects from the use of IV in-line filters.&#xD;
