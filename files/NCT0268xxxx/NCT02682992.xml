    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of prophylactic low-level laser&#xD;
      therapy (LLLT) to reduce the incidence of oral mucositis and adverse events in patients&#xD;
      receiving combined modality therapy consisting of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for head&#xD;
      and neck cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase II, single-arm trial to examine the efficacy of prophylactic low-level laser therapy&#xD;
      (LLLT) to reduce the incidence of oral mucositis and adverse events in patients receiving&#xD;
      combined modality therapy consisting of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for head and neck&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled to receive prophylactic LLLT in&#xD;
      addition to standard of care measures for oral mucositis or other toxicity of therapy. The&#xD;
      radiation and chemotherapy dose, schedule, modality, technique, and any required adjustments&#xD;
      will not be influenced by this protocol and will follow standard existing institutional&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive LLLT three times per week concurrently with chemoradiotherapy. LLLT may&#xD;
      be delivered either immediately prior to or after the patient's daily fraction of&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Patients will be treated extra-orally with a THOR® LED cluster for one minute&#xD;
      along the buccal mucosa on each side and intraorally for one minute to the tongue and soft&#xD;
      palate. During each LLLT treatment session a thorough oral exam will be performed to identify&#xD;
      any areas of mucositis. If the patient should develop intraoral lesions they will be targeted&#xD;
      directly with the intraoral probe for one minute to each site of mucositis. The laser&#xD;
      settings to be used are as follows: frequency 2.5 Hz; wavelength 660 nm; and power 75 mW, for&#xD;
      an energy of 4.5 J.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated prior to therapy, weekly during therapy, two weeks after the&#xD;
      completion of therapy, and three months after the completion of therapy. During each&#xD;
      assessment, the following toxicities will be assessed: pain, mucositis, dysphagia,&#xD;
      xerostomia, dysgeusia, dermatitis, trismus, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies indicate that approximately 40% of patients will experience severe mucositis&#xD;
      with radiation and concurrent chemotherapy. The hypothesis in this trial is that the addition&#xD;
      of LLLT to this treatment regimen will decrease the rate of severe acute OM to 20%. We plan&#xD;
      to enroll 50 patients at our institution.&#xD;
