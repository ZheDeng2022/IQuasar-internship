    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) transformed a once fatal condition into a&#xD;
      chronic, manageable condition. However, it is estimated that 20-40% of patients on 2nd line&#xD;
      treatment (2 nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] and a boosted protease&#xD;
      inhibitor [PI]) are failing treatment. Figures are thought to be higher in children and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason why patients are failing 2nd line treatment is not exactly known. Failure has been&#xD;
      previously attributed to poor adherence. However, some literature shows that some patients on&#xD;
      boosted PIs achieve and maintain viral suppression despite suboptimal adherence (adherence of&#xD;
      80- 95%). Viral factors, like drug resistance, are also implicated in treatment failure.&#xD;
      However, boosted PIs have high genetic barrier to clinically significant mutations.&#xD;
      Therefore, a virus would have to harbour multiple PI mutations for the virus to have reduced&#xD;
      susceptibility to boosted PI regimens. Pharmacological factors such as suboptimal dosing,&#xD;
      impaired absorption and drug interactions may also be responsible for treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If sub-optimal adherence is the reason why children are failing 2nd line treatment, then&#xD;
      restoring optimal adherence should result in viral suppression, failure of which might mean&#xD;
      that other causes are contributing to failure. If resistance is the cause of treatment&#xD;
      failure, then this study will provide evidence for advocating for resistance testing and the&#xD;
      use of 3rd line antiretroviral drugs. If children with adequate adherence demonstrate&#xD;
      inadequate drug levels in their plasma, then this study will provide evidence to advocate for&#xD;
      studies to examine reasons for inadequate drug exposure amongst HIV-infected children. These&#xD;
      studies are paramount to optimizing dosing algorithms in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study will help elucidate reasons for treatment failure in HIV-infected&#xD;
      children on second line treatment with the aim of ultimately optimizing antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment strategies for this important group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, interventional study, which will be conducted in 2 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of the study will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening for study eligibility (viral loads and administering eligibility screening&#xD;
           form&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomisation to study arms (1:1)- random computer generated numbers, sealed in opaque&#xD;
           envelopes, clinic nurse keeps the envelopes and produces them sequentially when asked&#xD;
           for&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Enrolment- informed consent and assent, 2 questionnaires administered, hair samples&#xD;
           collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Three months of follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post- intervention/control questionnaire administered, viral load and hair samples&#xD;
           collected again&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients with viral load &lt;1 000 copies/ml from both arms exit study here. Those with&#xD;
           viral load &gt; = 1 000 copies/ml from both arms proceed to phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with viral load &gt; = 1 000 copies/ml from both arms have genotyping for drug&#xD;
      resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hair pharmacokinetic (PK) study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may re-suppress after adherence counselling. Hair anti-retroviral (ARV)&#xD;
      levels will show whether the patients have been taking their ARVs or not in the past 3&#xD;
      months. Suboptimal ARV levels in hair may mean that adherence was suboptimal or the dose the&#xD;
      patient is taking is suboptimal. Presence of adequate drug levels while the patient is still&#xD;
      virologically failing treatment may imply that there is resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hair collection is being done according to Women's Interagency HIV Study hair collection&#xD;
      protocol as described below. All hair samples are stored in a cool, dry place in the&#xD;
      department of Clinical Pharmacology in the University of Zimbabwe. Analysis will be done by a&#xD;
      validated method at University of Carlifornia San Francisco (UCSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hair collection procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clean the blades of a pair of scissors with an alcohol pad and allow blades to&#xD;
           completely dry prior to use&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lift up the top layer of hair from the occipital region of the scalp. Isolate a small&#xD;
           thatch of hair (~20 fibres of hair) from underneath this top layer of hair from the&#xD;
           occipital region (can use a hair clip to keep the top layer of hair away)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cut the small hair sample off the patient's head as close to the scalp as possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unfold the piece of aluminium foil and place the cut thatch of hair inside the piece of&#xD;
           foil&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Place a small label with the patient's study identity (ID) over the distal end of the&#xD;
           hair thatch (the side furthest away from the scalp)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Refold the foil over to completely enclose the thatch of hair&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Place a study ID label on the folded piece of foil&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Place the folded piece of foil inside the plastic (e.g. Ziplock®) bag (each Ziplock bag&#xD;
           will have a desiccant bag in it and seal the bag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that black children and adolescents naturally have short hair that is curled or kinky,&#xD;
      hair is being collected regardless of length. However, for those that are shaved bold, the&#xD;
      participant will be enrolled, but study initiation will be deferred in that particular&#xD;
      participant for 1 month to allow hair to grow to a length that can be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Directly administered anti-retroviral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified DAART is being administered to randomly selected participants for 3 months (90&#xD;
      consecutive calendar days including weekends and public holidays). These 90 days will be&#xD;
      divided into 3 months (months 1, 2 and 3), each month being 30 days. Participants will be&#xD;
      visited at home by research assistants who will directly watch them swallow their ARVs and&#xD;
      complete a home visit chart, while the participant completes a pill chart. Home visits will&#xD;
      be scheduled once a day from Monday to Friday, at the time the participants take their ATV/r.&#xD;
      Research assistants will be required to fill in a form when they see the participant&#xD;
      swallowing their ARVs and the time they have seen them swallow. Home visits are scheduled as&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Daily for the first 10 days- Monday to Friday&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Then twice a week for 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Then once a week for 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Then fortnightly for the remainder of the 3 months On Saturdays, Sundays and public&#xD;
           holidays, each participant will be contacted by cell phone (SMS texts) once a day to be&#xD;
           reminded to take their medication. Contacting the participant by cell phone will only be&#xD;
           done by the research assistants and recorded on a chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
           With the exception of ATV/r, all other antiretroviral therapy drugs will be self&#xD;
           administered, and the participant will be asked if they took them when the VLW presents&#xD;
           for mDAART, or retrospectively for weekends and public holidays. A separate form will be&#xD;
           filled in for these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Appropriate time for taking ARVs in this study is within 2 hours of the time that the&#xD;
           participant is supposed to take his/her medication. Therefore, a dose is recorded as&#xD;
           being taken correctly if it was reported taken either within 2 hours before or within 2&#xD;
           hours after the time they are supposed to take that day's particular dose. If more than&#xD;
           2 hours up to &lt;12 hours lapse from the time the participant was supposed to take a dose,&#xD;
           that particular dose will be recorded as delayed. If the participant does not take&#xD;
           his/her medication for 12 or more hours, that particular dose will be reported as&#xD;
           missed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a participant is not found at home, then a direct phone call is made to the&#xD;
           participant or caregiver. On the home visit chart, the research assistant will record&#xD;
           that the participant was absent. However, the research assistant will inquire if the&#xD;
           participant has taken their medication and record appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the end of 90 days allocated to each participant, adherence will be assessed again by&#xD;
           measuring hair atazanavir concentrations and self reported adherence questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research assistants&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research assistants were recruited from a community based organisation called Child&#xD;
           Protection Society (CPS). These research assistants are known as voluntary lay workers&#xD;
           (VLWs), and have been trained in research and ethics. They have also been involved in&#xD;
           research several times. The VLWs were trained on the protocol by the PI. A VLW&#xD;
           assignment form will be filled in when allocating a VLW to a participant. The VLW has to&#xD;
           reside in the same community as the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Posts were advertised openly within CPS and other relevant community-based&#xD;
           organisations. Eligibility criteria included:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Prior research experience&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Valid training in research&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Resident within Harare hospital catchment area&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Demonstration of ability to read and write&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Ability to travel on foot and public transport to households&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Ability to care and nurture for adolescents&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Ability to keep information confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eligible research assistants were trained before visits to homes began, then refresher&#xD;
           courses were done at 2 months after beginning home visits, then after 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CD4 count and viral load testing&#xD;
&#xD;
           CD4 counts, viral loads and PK profiling are done at baseline and repeated after 3&#xD;
           months of DAART and standard care. Patients who were virologically unsuppressed before&#xD;
           DAART are expected to re-suppress. Failure to achieve virological suppression after&#xD;
           DAART may mean that other factors are contributing to treatment failure, for instance&#xD;
           resistance or suboptimal dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CD4 counts and viral load samples are processed at a private laboratory at no cost to&#xD;
           the patient. However, if the patient has had a CD4 count and viral load measured in the&#xD;
           previous 2 months then no repeat CD4 and/or viral load will be done. Results of the&#xD;
           tests done within the past 2 months will be used for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Samples for CD4 counts and viral loads are collected in purple top tubes. At least 10mls&#xD;
           will be collected from each participant, and gently inverted 8-10 times to prevent&#xD;
           clotting. Whole blood in purple top tubes will be stored and transported at temperature&#xD;
           between 15 and 30 degrees celcius. Results are available to the participants and their&#xD;
           health care givers in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Viral loads are measured yearly or when indicated for free to patients registered at&#xD;
           Harare hospital opportunistic clinic (OI) clinic. This has become standard practise in&#xD;
           the country at institutions where a viral load machine is available. CD4 counts are&#xD;
           measured twice per year for each patient who has been on ART for a year or more at a&#xD;
           cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Resistance testing and genotyping&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants who remain unsuppressed despite DAART and adherence counselling proceed to&#xD;
           have resistance testing done. A lot of studies have shown that protease inhibitors have&#xD;
           high genetic barrier to clinically significant mutations. However, this does not rule&#xD;
           out the presence of clinically significant PI mutations. Two 4ml whole blood samples are&#xD;
           collected in purple top tubes, and gently inverted 8-10 times to prevent clotting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Keeping track of samples&#xD;
&#xD;
           A log chart will be available. Each time a sample is taken (hair or blood), the sample&#xD;
           is logged onto the log chart. The date and time the sample leaves the OI clinic will be&#xD;
           recorded. The date and time the laboratory receives the sample will also be recorded on&#xD;
           the same log chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurement of adherence in participants&#xD;
&#xD;
           Self-reported adherence will be measured using AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)&#xD;
           adherence follow-up questionnaire (QLO702) and visual analogue scale (VAS). These tools&#xD;
           were validated, and found to have high sensitivity and specificity in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Defining virological and immunological treatment failure&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment failure will be defined according to modified World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
           2012 criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Virological failure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &lt;1.0 log10 decrease in HIV RNA copy number from baseline after 8-12 weeks of&#xD;
                therapy, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HIV RNA ≥1000 copies/mL after 6 months of therapy Immunological failure Fall of CD4&#xD;
                count to baseline (or below) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
                50% fall from on-treatment peak value OR&#xD;
&#xD;
           Persistent CD4 levels below 100 cells/mm3 (Without concomitant infection to cause&#xD;
           transient CD4 cell decrease).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Please note- All blood samples are labelled with the participants 0I number, study&#xD;
           number and the day the sample was collected. The use of these identity numbers is meant&#xD;
           to keep the participants' identity hidden from the study and laboratory personnel while&#xD;
           preventing sample mix up. All samples will be attached to a laboratory request form.&#xD;

           Study setting&#xD;
&#xD;
           Harare central hospital is arguably the largest referral hospital in Zimbabwe. Because&#xD;
           congestion could occur, patients that are doing well on first line treatment are&#xD;
           decentralised to municipal clinics close to where the patients reside. This move is not&#xD;
           only meant to decongest the hospital, but also to shorten the distance travelled by&#xD;
           patients to seek health care, cut on transport costs and remove technical barriers in&#xD;
           accessing health care. However, patients that remain unwell are on fluconazole&#xD;
           maintenance treatment and all those on second line treatment continue to be monitored at&#xD;
           Harare hospital OI clinic. If decentralised patients develop treatment failure or fall&#xD;
           ill while being seen at municipal clinics, they are referred back to Harare hospital OI&#xD;
           clinic for specialist care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Harare hospital OI clinic is situated within the paediatric hospital in Harare hospital.&#xD;
           It is open to patients from Mondays to Thursdays, excluding public holidays. The clinic&#xD;
           caters for children that are HIV positive up to 18 years of age. Once they turn 19, they&#xD;
           are transferred to the adult opportunistic infections clinic at the same hospital. On&#xD;
           each visit to the clinic, patients that were commenced onto ARVs or cotrimoxazole&#xD;
           prophylaxis receive a maximum of 2 months supply. This means that each patient enrolled&#xD;
           in the clinic has to return to the clinic at least once in 2 months for drug refill.&#xD;
           However, if any patient is taken ill or has any other concern, they are free to visit&#xD;
           the clinic to be seen by the doctors, nurses or counsellors outside their review date.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On presenting to the clinic, each patient is screened by nurses whether they should be&#xD;
           seen by the doctors or just be given a prescription so they can collect medication.&#xD;
           Patients requiring counselling are referred to counsellors in the clinic. All patients&#xD;
           eventually queue up at the pharmacy in the OI clinic with their hand held and hospital&#xD;
           records for drug supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection and storage&#xD;
&#xD;
           Information about patient is collected from 3 sources: the participant and/or guardian,&#xD;
           patients' hand held record and patients' hospital record. This move is meant to ensure&#xD;
           that information gathered is as accurate as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Information is collected using interviewer based questionnaires and kept in accessible&#xD;
           files. The amount of time spent on each interview is minimized as much as possible. This&#xD;
           is to enable many participants to be interviewed and to avoid delaying them&#xD;
           unnecessarily. Each participant will have a file (hard copies) with all his/her&#xD;
           information, including printed questionnaires with their information, kept in a&#xD;
           fireproof, lockable cupboard in the department of clinical pharmacology, in the college&#xD;
           of health sciences of the University of Zimbabwe. Upon completion of the study, data&#xD;
           will be kept for at least 3 years. Only the principal investigator and co-investigators&#xD;
           will have access to soft and hard copies of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data will be entered into research electronic data capture (REDCap) software, for easier&#xD;
           analysis of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Loss to follow-up (LTFU)&#xD;
&#xD;
           A participant is considered lost to follow-up if:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. A participant misses 2 consecutive scheduled hospital visits&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The participant cannot be found at the addresses they provided on the participant&#xD;
                locator form for 30 consecutive days&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The participant cannot be reached on the phone numbers provided on the participant&#xD;
                locator form for 30 consecutive days&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. If at the addresses provided no one knows where the participant relocated to or the&#xD;
                participant cannot be contacted at the new location&#xD;
&#xD;
           When a participant decides to discontinue participating, or when a guardian decides to&#xD;
           discontinue their child's participation from the study, that case is recorded as a&#xD;
           withdrawal. In such a case, a withdrawal form will be filled in and filed in the&#xD;
           participant's folder.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants lost to follow-up will be replaced. A lost to follow-up form will be filled&#xD;
           in and placed into the participant's file.&#xD;
