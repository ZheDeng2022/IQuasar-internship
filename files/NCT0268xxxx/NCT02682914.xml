    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine the risk factors and etiologies of ischemic&#xD;
      stroke in Korean young adults. Both well-documented risk factors and little known life-style&#xD;
      related risk factors such as life-style habits, psychological distress including occupational&#xD;
      distress, perceived stress and depression will be evaluated by comparison with healthy&#xD;
      controls using a structured questionnaire. Secondary objectives are to determine stroke&#xD;
      outcomes such as mortality, recurrent vascular events and post-stroke epilepsy in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All consecutive patients who had their first-ever ischemic stroke symptoms within the&#xD;
      previous month will be asked to enroll in the study. Baseline measurements will be assessed&#xD;
      in all patients. Patients without language problems or life-threatening conditions will be&#xD;
      asked to answer the structured lifestyle questionnaire. Age- and sex-matched controls without&#xD;
      a stroke history will be recruited among patients' friends, relatives and the care-givers of&#xD;
      other patients, and will be requested to complete the same questionnaire. People who visit&#xD;
      hospital for health check-ups may also be included as controls. After the first assessment,&#xD;
      all patients will be followed every 3 months during visits to the outpatient department or by&#xD;
      telephone. Participants will be asked about recurrence of stroke, occurrence of post-stroke&#xD;
      epilepsy, and functional outcomes on the modified Rankin Scale. In the case of patients who&#xD;
      have died, information will be obtained from their last practitioner or care-giver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power calculation. The sample sizes were calculated based on the frequency of&#xD;
      psychological distress, which is the most interesting potential risk factor for ischemic&#xD;
      stroke in the young. According to a previous report comparing psychological distress in&#xD;
      ischemic stroke patients and healthy controls,8 the frequency of stress was 50.3% in the&#xD;
      ischemic stroke patients and 38.6% in the healthy controls; a difference of 11.7%. To detect&#xD;
      such a difference with a power of 90% and alpha of 0.05 with a drop-out rate of 20%, a sample&#xD;
      size of at least 470 patients and 470 controls will be needed (PASS 13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical information. Demographic and clinical information will be collected on admission.The&#xD;
      data include age, gender, traditional risk factors for stroke (hypertension, diabetes,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, smoking and coronary heart disease), medication history (anti-hypertensives,&#xD;
      anti-diabetics, anti-platelets and statins) and other comorbidities. Hypertension is defined&#xD;
      as previous use of antihypertensive medication, systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or&#xD;
      diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg at discharge, diabetes as previous use of antidiabetic medication or&#xD;
      fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL, and hyperlipidemia as previous use of lipid-lowering&#xD;
      agents, fasting serum total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL or low-density lipoprotein ≥160 mg/dL.&#xD;
      With regard to cigarette smoking, subjects will be classified as current, former, or&#xD;
      non-smokers. Number of pack-years will be noted for former and current smokers. History of&#xD;
      coronary heart disease is defined as previous angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients will also be asked about any other comorbid&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke characteristics and laboratory investigations. Data on stroke characteristics will be&#xD;
      collected at admission, including symptoms at time of onset and pre-hospital delay. Severity&#xD;
      of stroke will be measured on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) by&#xD;
      physicians certified by the Clinical Research Center for Stroke in Korea. The course of the&#xD;
      disease during admission will be established, including treatments and complications. On&#xD;
      discharge, each case of ischemic stroke will be classified according to the TOAST&#xD;
      classification. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel index scores will also be obtained at&#xD;
      discharge. Laboratory investigations including complete blood cell count, erythrocyte&#xD;
      sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, urinalysis, urine pregnancy test, serum electrolytes,&#xD;
      liver function test, renal function tests, chest X-ray and electrocardiogram will be checked&#xD;
      in the emergency department. Other specific laboratory investigations such as fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose, hemoglobin A1C, lipid panel test, thyroid function test, rheumatologic panel tests,&#xD;
      hypercoagulable panel tests, heavy metal tests, homocysteine and α-galactosidase will be&#xD;
      checked on the day after admission, following overnight fasting. For the genetic test for&#xD;
      CADASIL, investigators will ask for a further informed consent. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      cardiac evaluation during the admission period, including 24-hour Holter monitoring,&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroimaging. Brain imaging studies will be interpreted by more than one neuro-radiologist at&#xD;
      each center without any knowledge of the clinical information. Standardized magnetic&#xD;
      resonance image (MRI) sequences will be recommended to all participating centers. The minimal&#xD;
      requirements for brain imaging studies are diffusion-weighted images, FLAIR images,&#xD;
      T2-weighted images, and gradient echo images. All participants will undergo additional&#xD;
      vascular imaging studies such as CT angiography, MR angiography or digital subtraction&#xD;
      angiography. Based on the neuroimaging, ischemic stroke location, size and vascular&#xD;
      territories will be noted. The diagnosis and treatment of stroke will follow the standard&#xD;
      guidelines of each coordinating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life style questionnaires. After making the baseline measurements, a standardized life style&#xD;
      questionnaire will be provided to all patients who do not have a language problem. Age- and&#xD;
      sex-matched healthy controls will be asked the same questions. The standardized questionnaire&#xD;
      again requests demographic data such as age, gender, height, weight, abdominal circumference,&#xD;
      traditional risk factors, medication history and other comorbidities. Newly-added demographic&#xD;
      data include family history of risk factors, ABO type, marital status, living status,&#xD;
      economic status, educational status and presence of pain and headache. Marital status is&#xD;
      classified as married, single, divorced or widowed. Living status is classified as alone,&#xD;
      with spouse, with family, or with non-family member. Economic status is classified into five&#xD;
      categories (500 USD/month, 500~1500 USD/month, 1500~3000 USD/month, 3000~5000 USD/month and&#xD;
      &gt;5000 USD/month) and educational status is classified into six categories (none, &lt;6 years,&#xD;
      6-9 years, 9-12 years, 12 years, &gt;12 years). Questions about headaches are mainly focused on&#xD;
      migraine: headache character, location, frequency, duration, aura, aggravating factors,&#xD;
      medication history and family history. Only women will answer questions about obstetric&#xD;
      history in terms of age at menarche and menopause (if participants have experienced them),&#xD;
      use of oral contraceptives, history of hormone replacement therapy, and history of&#xD;
      hysterectomy or oophorectomy. Women who have experienced pregnancy are asked about gravidity,&#xD;
      number of children, years of births, mode of delivery, duration of maternal lactation, and&#xD;
      number of miscarriages or abortions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption, dietary habits, exercise and sleep patterns&#xD;
      are included in the questions. Alcohol consumption is defined as type of alcoholic drink,&#xD;
      amount per day and date when consumption began. Dietary habits include meal frequency and&#xD;
      consumption of salts, meats, vegetables and 7 types of beverages (coffee, black tea, oolong&#xD;
      tea, green tea, ginseng tea, fruit juice and carbonated beverage) during the past year.&#xD;
      Exercise will be calculated according to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire&#xD;
      (IPAQ), which is a standardized instrument for measuring the amount of exercise.9 Duration of&#xD;
      sleep, sleep latency, frequency of waking-up after sleep onset (WASO), snoring severity,&#xD;
      duration of naps, history of using sleeping pills and length of time in bed without sleeping&#xD;
      will be reported to evaluate sleep patterns. Investigators will also add the validated Korean&#xD;
      version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale for measuring daytime sleepiness,10 and questions&#xD;
      about restless leg syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological distress will be analyzed by a composite measure of occupational distress,&#xD;
      perceived stress, and depression. For occupational distress, both occupational status and job&#xD;
      strain will be analyzed. Not only occupation type but also period of service in the current&#xD;
      and previous occupation will be noted to evaluate occupational status. Average daily working&#xD;
      hours, commuting method (car, bus, subway, walk or other) and commuting time (less than 30&#xD;
      minutes, 30 minutes to 1 hour, 1 hour to 2 hours or more than 2 hours) will also be recorded.&#xD;
      Job strain will be investigated by means of a job content questionnaire (JCQ) validated in&#xD;
      the Korean language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived stress and depression will be answered on the basis of premorbid status. The&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D)&#xD;
      Korean version, which have been validated in the relevant fields, will be used to measure the&#xD;
      subjective status of patients and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. The study will comprise 470 case-control pairs. Means with standard&#xD;
      deviations will be calculated for continuous variables, and numbers with percentages will be&#xD;
      obtained for discrete variables. To assess the relationship between characteristics and&#xD;
      ischemic stroke in young adults, investigators will use paired t-tests for continuous&#xD;
      variables and chi-square tests for proportions. For nonparametric variables, the Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditional logistic regression analysis will be employed to assess differences between cases&#xD;
      and matched controls by estimating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).&#xD;
      Adjusted ORs for risk factors will be derived from multivariable logistic regression models.&#xD;
      These will include all collected variables with possible significance. Kaplan-Meier survival&#xD;
      analysis will be used to estimate cumulative risk of mortality, recurrent vascular events and&#xD;
      post-stroke seizure. Hazard ratios for the previously-mentioned secondary objectives will be&#xD;
      calculated by Cox regression analysis, and assumptions of proportionality will be confirmed&#xD;
      by time-dependent covariate analysis. All the statistical analyses will be two-sided and will&#xD;
      use IBM SPSS 21.&#xD;
