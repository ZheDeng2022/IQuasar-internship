  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of PEDs in nAMD, CSR and iPCV can present a diagnostic challenge in the elderly&#xD;
      population; despite detailed diagnostic testing to differentiate these three conditions,&#xD;
      misdiagnosis and mistreatment still occurs. One potential way of differentiating these three&#xD;
      conditions might be to compare cytokine profiles in nAMD versus CSR versus iPCV. This&#xD;
      information may be useful in creating a diagnostic aqueous cytokine and hormone profile to&#xD;
      differentiate between nAMD, CSR and iPCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to compare baseline aqueous cytokine and cortisol levels&#xD;
      between nAMD, CSR, and iPCV patients and age-matched cataract controls. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to assess intra-group changes in visual and anatomical outcomes in nAMD, CSR and&#xD;
      iPCV patients with PED treated with aflibercept and correlate these changes to baseline&#xD;
      cytokines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of Pigment Epithelial Detachments (PEDs) in neovascular Age-related Macular&#xD;
      Degeneration (nAMD), Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR) and idiopathic Poplypoidal&#xD;
      Choroidal Vasculopathy (iPCV) can present a diagnostic challenge in the elderly population;&#xD;
      despite detailed diagnostic testing to differentiate these three conditions, misdiagnosis and&#xD;
      mistreatment still occurs. One potential way of differentiating these three conditions might&#xD;
      be to compare cytokine profiles in nAMD versus CSR versus iPCV. In nAMD, growth factors and&#xD;
      cytokines, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), pigment epithelium derived&#xD;
      factor (PEDF), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and placenta growth factor (PLGF) are known to play an&#xD;
      important role in the development of CNV angiogenesis. Aqueous samples from CSR eyes have&#xD;
      been analyzed for various growth factors and cytokines, where levels of interlukin (IL)-6,&#xD;
      IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 do not differ from healthy controls, and&#xD;
      platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) levels appear to be lower than controls. In addition,&#xD;
      there is evidence to demonstrate that CSR is associated with elevated cortisol serum levels.&#xD;
      Cortisol has been analyzed in the aqueous humor of glaucoma and cataract patients; however,&#xD;
      the presence of cortisol in aqueous humor in CSR patients has not yet been identified. One&#xD;
      study comparing iPCV versus controls found elevated levels of IL-23. Cytokines have also been&#xD;
      compared between nAMD and iPCV showing elevated levels of CRP and IL-10 in eyes with iPCV or&#xD;
      nAMD. However, there have not been any studies yet comparing aqueous cytokine levels,&#xD;
      including PLGF between iPCV, CSR, and nAMD patients. This information may be useful in&#xD;
      creating a diagnostic aqueous cytokine and hormone profile to differentiate between nAMD, CSR&#xD;
      and iPCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If left untreated, PEDs associated with nAMD, CSR, and iPCV may lead to the loss of central&#xD;
      vision. We propose to compare the effectiveness of aflibercept in the treatment of PEDs&#xD;
      associated with nAMD, CSR and iPCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to compare baseline aqueous cytokine and cortisol levels&#xD;
      between nAMD, CSR, and iPCV participants and age-matched cataract controls. We will not be&#xD;
      looking at changes in cytokine levels after treatment. The secondary objective is to assess&#xD;
      intra-group changes in visual and anatomical outcomes in nAMD, CSR and iPCV participants with&#xD;
      PED treated with aflibercept and correlate these changes to baseline cytokines.&#xD;
