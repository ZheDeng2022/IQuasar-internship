      The purpose of this study is analyze the effects, acute and chronic, static and dynamic&#xD;
      stretching on flexibility and neuromuscular and functional performance in active, healthy&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Static stretching program improves flexibility and reduces neuromuscular and functional&#xD;
           performance in active, healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Static stretching program improves flexibility and neuromuscular and functional&#xD;
           performance in active, healthy individuals.&#xD;

      It is a randomized, blinded clinical trial where the first researcher (P1) was responsible&#xD;
      for assessments and reassessments; the second searcher (P2) at randomization and inquiry of&#xD;
      the subjects in the intervention protocol and the third investigator (P3) for the statistical&#xD;
      analyzes.The research was conducted at the Laboratory of therapeutic practices of the&#xD;
      Department of Physical Therapy, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) and started&#xD;
      after the approval of the ethics committee.The sample was recruited by convenience by written&#xD;
      disclosure, electronics and personal contact in academies and higher education institutions&#xD;
      in the city of Natal / RN. The volunteers were randomly distributed through the electronic&#xD;
      site http://www.randomization.com (Code: 21318). Two pieces of information were inserted,&#xD;
      namely: the sample size and the number of groups. With this data, the site has generated a&#xD;
      specific encoding for each group and distributed the subjects randomly into three groups:&#xD;
      static stretching (gAE); dynamic stretching (gAD) and control (gC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the sample size calculation was used G * Power 3.1.0 software and the procedures followed&#xD;
      the recommendations of studies pr√©vios45. Based on a pilot study of four volunteers, it has&#xD;
      adopted a power of 0.95, considering a significance level of 5%, a correlation coefficient of&#xD;
      0.5, and 0.25 effect size for both, It calculated a &quot;n&quot; sample of 15 individuals for each&#xD;
      group (&quot;n&quot; sample = 45). This analysis was performed to reduce the chance of Type II error&#xD;
      and to determine the minimum number of individuals required for this investigation. Thus, the&#xD;
      sample size was sufficient to provide 95.5% statistical power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and evaluation measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first all subjects were recorded in the survey through an evaluation form containing&#xD;
      information on identification, weight, height, injury history and physical activity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the process of randomization and allocation held by P2, the volunteers underwent the&#xD;
      first evaluation (AV1) under the instruction of P1. This evaluation was performed at least 48&#xD;
      hours before the 1st stretching session to prevent possible residual effects of isokinetic&#xD;
      and functional testing. Other evaluations AV2, AV3 and AV4, were made immediately after the&#xD;
      1st (acute response) and 10th sessions (acute post elongation) and 48 hours after the last&#xD;
      (residual chronic response), respectively, for EAG and GAD. Already the subject of gc were&#xD;
      subject only to the four evaluation processes, where the last assessment (AV4) coincided with&#xD;
      the time related to the stretching protocol of the experimental groups. Despite receiving the&#xD;
      same guidelines of the other groups on the importance of stretching activities routines&#xD;
      during the study period the volunteers were told they should not perform stretching in the&#xD;
      day-to-day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All had non-dominant leg (MND) tested for flexibility, neuromuscular performance (muscle&#xD;
      latency time and isokinetic performance) and functional performance (functional tests) in all&#xD;
      four assessments. The MND was used because it is considered less skilled and more trainable,&#xD;
      when compared to the MD46. For their identification was asked which member preferred to kick&#xD;
      a bola15. However, during the interventions in the experimental groups (GAE, GAD), both&#xD;
      members were elongated, evaluating the pain sensation at the end of each session and at the&#xD;
      end of the intervention protocols, sensory perception (pleasure / displeasure) in performing&#xD;
      elongation. The day of the period in which prevailed the assessments and reassessments was on&#xD;
      afternoon shift.&#xD;
