  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date no targeted agents are available to treat TNBC. Therefore chemotherapy is the only&#xD;
      treatment option. TNBC often has a high amount of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes.&#xD;
      Stimulating the immune cells of TNBC might therefore be an option for these patients to&#xD;
      increase the pathological complete response. pCR is highly correlated with outcome in TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the addition of a checkpoint inhibitor in addition to chemotherapy might be an&#xD;
      additional option for these patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Therefore the addition of a checkpoint inhibitor in addition to chemotherapy might be an&#xD;
      additional option for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective therefore is to compare the pathological complete response (pCR= ypT0&#xD;
      ypN0) rates of neoadjuvant treatment of sequential, nab-Paclitaxel followed by EC +/- the&#xD;
      PD-L1 antibody MEDI4736 in patients with early triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent for all study according to local regulatory requirements&#xD;
             prior to beginning specific protocol procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete baseline documentation must be sent to GBG Forschungs GmbH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by&#xD;
             core biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration alone is not sufficient. Incisional biopsy is not&#xD;
             allowed. In case of bilateral cancer, the investigator has to decide prospectively&#xD;
             which side will be evaluated for the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor lesion in the breast or the nodes must be measurable in two dimensions,&#xD;
             preferably by sonography. In case of inflammatory disease, the extent of inflammation&#xD;
             can be used as measurable lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be in the following stages of disease: cT1b - cT4a-d irrespective of&#xD;
             nodal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion should be&#xD;
        measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Triple negative disease with centrally confirmed ER negative/PR negative/HER-2&#xD;
             negative, and centrally confirmed Ki-67 value. ER negative is defined as &lt;1% stained&#xD;
             cells, PR negative is defined as &lt;10% stained and HER2-negative is defined as either&#xD;
             IHC 0/1+ or IHC 2+ and in-situ hybridisation (ISH) of either ratio &lt;2.0 or less than 6&#xD;
             copies of HER2 per tumor cell. Stromal TILs will be evaluated in three groups: low&#xD;
             immune infiltrate (0-10% stromal TILs) intermediate immune infiltrate (11-59% stromal&#xD;
             TILs), LPBC 60-100% stromal TILs. PD-L1 status and other predefined markers will be&#xD;
             prospectively assessed during the study. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)&#xD;
             breast tissue from core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the GBG central pathology&#xD;
             laboratory prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;

             shortening fraction) within 3 months prior to randomization. Results must be above the&#xD;
             normal limit of the institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 14 days prior to randomization for all&#xD;
             women of childbearing potential. Female subjects must either be of non-reproductive&#xD;
             potential (ie, post-menopausal by history: &gt;=60 years old and no menses for &gt;=1 year&#xD;
             without an alternative medical cause; OR history of hysterectomy, OR history of&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation, OR history of bilateral oophorectomy) or must have a&#xD;
             negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete staging work-up within 3 months prior to randomization. All patients must&#xD;
             have had breast imaging by breast ultrasound plus either bilateral mammography or&#xD;
             breast MRI (one of those &lt;= 21 days). All patients must have had chest X-ray (PA and&#xD;
             lateral), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan or MRI, and bone scan (according to&#xD;
             guidelines). In case of positive bone scan, bone X-ray is mandatory. Other tests may&#xD;
             be performed as clinically indicated.&#xD;
