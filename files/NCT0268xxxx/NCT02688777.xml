    <textblock>
      Approximately 15,000 Veterans are hospitalized for stroke each year with new cases costing an&#xD;
      estimated $111 million for acute inpatient, $75 million for post-acute inpatient, and $88&#xD;
      million for follow-up care over 6 months post-stroke. Contributing to these costs is the&#xD;
      incidence of falls. Falls are a costly complication for Veterans with stroke as they lead to&#xD;
      an increased incidence of fractures, depression, and mortality. New strategies are needed to&#xD;
      help Veterans post-stroke regain their ability to safely walk without increasing their risk&#xD;
      of falling as well as readily identify those who are a fall risk. This study addresses both&#xD;
      of these needs as it will 1) investigate a new treatment approach, backward walking training,&#xD;
      to determine if it will decrease fall incidence in the first year post-stroke and 2)&#xD;
      determine if backward walking speed early after a stroke can identify those that are at risk&#xD;
      for future falls.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Approximately 15,000 Veterans are hospitalized for stroke each year. Persistent walking and&#xD;
      balance deficits contribute to long-term disability and a high incidence of falls. Falls are&#xD;
      a common and costly complication of stroke; between 40% and 70% of affected individuals fall&#xD;
      within the first year. Falls lead to fear of falling, limitations in self-care and increased&#xD;
      dependence. Of greater concern, they lead to serious adverse events, including fractures,&#xD;
      depression and mortality. A primary goal of stroke rehabilitation is to improve mobility&#xD;
      despite persistent motor, balance and visual-spatial deficits. However, this goal has a down&#xD;
      side since it increases fall risks. Here, the investigators propose a novel therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy to improve ambulation while decreasing the risk of falls: Backward Walking Training&#xD;
      (BWTraining).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' central hypothesis is that a 6-week BWTraining program at 2-months&#xD;
      post-stroke is superior to standard care in reducing falls within the 1st year post-stroke.&#xD;
      Identification of those at risk for falling is a necessary component of post-stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation to implement pro-active measures to decrease risk once individuals rejoin&#xD;
      community living. Recent research in a cohort of elderly adults determined that maximal&#xD;
      Backward Walking Speed (BWSpeed) (not forward) identified individuals that had experienced a&#xD;
      fall in the previous six months,6 suggesting that BWSpeed could be a simple, inexpensive&#xD;
      screening tool to identify individuals at risk of falling. With a randomized, blinded design,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to prospectively assess the value of BWSpeed as a tool to predict&#xD;
      future falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A notable post-stroke conundrum is that increased mobility may increase fall risk.5 On the&#xD;
      other hand, limiting mobility leads to a multitude of inactivity-associated deficits,&#xD;
      including recurrent stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no intervention has demonstrated efficacy for improving walking while minimizing&#xD;
      fall risk. BWTraining may be a simple and effective intervention to achieve both goals. In&#xD;
      the investigators' recent randomized controlled pilot trial (RCT), individuals with sub-acute&#xD;
      stroke who participated in a BWTraining demonstrated 3-fold improvement in backward and&#xD;
      forward walking speed and fall self-efficacy. Further, BWTraining caused 75% greater&#xD;
      improvement in balance versus those in a dose-matched balance training group. At the 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up assessment, BWSpeed of the BWTraining group averaged 0.63 m/s, exceeding the&#xD;
      threshold for fall risk in elderly adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the success of the investigators' pilot intervention, a larger and more rigorous trial&#xD;
      is needed to demonstrate reduced fall incidence over an extended follow-up period. The&#xD;
      investigators designed this RCT to address three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: Test the hypothesis that 1-year fall incidence is decreased for participants&#xD;
      randomized to BWTraining administered at 2-months post-stroke (versus usual care comparison&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1a: BWTraining at 2-months post-stroke reduces the number of falls over the next&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1b: BWTraining at 2-months post-stroke increases gait speed, improves balance and&#xD;
      increases balance confidence over the next year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: Test the hypothesis that BWTraining at 2 months (immediate) vs. 1-year (delayed)&#xD;
      post-stroke is more effective at improving BWSpeed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2a: BWSpeed improvement from 2- to 14-months post-stroke is greater when&#xD;
      BWTraining is delivered at 2 months versus 1 year post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2b: Improvements in forward gait speed, Functional Gait Assessment and&#xD;
      Activities-Balance Confidence Scale from 2- to 14-months post-stroke are greater when&#xD;
      BWTraining is delivered at 2 months versus 1 year post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #3: This exploratory aim will test the hypothesis that BWSpeed at 2-months post-stroke is&#xD;
      a significant predictor of fall incidence over the next year 1 year period, after adjusting&#xD;
      for other covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #3: BWSpeed at 2-months will be a significant predictor of fall incidence during&#xD;
      the first year post-stroke, after adjusting for other covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is significant since it concerns a novel strategy to improve ambulation while&#xD;
      minimizing the risk of falling after a stroke. BWTraining is highly novel, is easy to&#xD;
      administer and exciting preliminary data suggest that is has major potential as a therapeutic&#xD;
      tool. In addition, the investigators will determine the potential of BWSpeed (a simple,&#xD;
      clinically relevant screening tool) to identify those at risk for future falls.&#xD;

Most often a fall starts while a person is on their feet, but a fall could also start from a chair or bed. If a person ends up on the ground, either on their knees, their belly, their side, their bottom, or their back, they have had a fall.&quot; This explanation will be provided to participants and caregivers and printed on monthly calendars issued at randomization.</description>

    <description>Backward Walking Training will occur both on a treadmill and overground. In brief, BWTraining will consist of 20-30 minutes of step training with a Body Weight Support and Treadmill system (BWST), rest periods provided as warranted, with manual assistance provided by trainers, followed by 15 minutes of overground gait training. A 20-30 min period of actual stepping is the goal for the intervention sessions on the treadmill with rest periods as needed. Each training session may last up to 1 hour and 30 minutes including time for warm-up, stretching, and cool down. Participants will be fitted with a harness around their hips and torso, which will be attached to an overhead support system directly above the treadmill. From a stationary position, the treadmill belt will gradually be increased in speed with intervention trainers assisting participant to step backward with their paretic leg, their non-paretic leg (if needed) and at the hips for weight-shift.</description>
