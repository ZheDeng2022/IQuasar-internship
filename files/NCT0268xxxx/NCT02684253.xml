  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nivolumab is an antibody (a type of human protein) that is designed to boost your body's&#xD;
      immune system. It does this by allowing immune cells to grow and fight the cancer. Nivolumab&#xD;
      has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of melanoma (a form of skin cancer) and lung&#xD;
      cancer. It is currently under study for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell cancer.&#xD;

    <time_frame>96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>as determined by the investigator using RECIST 1.1 criteria between patients receiving Nivolumab and SBRT and those receiving Nivolumab alone. BOR rate is defined as the number of patients randomized to a given arm with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) of non-irradiated lesions divided by the total number of patients randomized to the given arm. In order to ascertain this endpoint, efforts will be made so that patients will be followed for 96 weeks or until progression of disease (and treatment cessation), whichever comes first. At each time-point, subjects should have CT/MR of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent form&#xD;
             in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule,&#xD;
             laboratory testing, and other study obligations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target Population&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed metastatic HNSCC, including nasopharynx WHO Type I-III&#xD;
             histologies; patients can have simultaneous loco-regional disease. Central biopsy&#xD;
             review at MSKCC is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have at least two lesions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least one lesion must be safely amenable to irradiation and likely to meet&#xD;
                  criteria delineated in Section 9.2.1 in the judgment of the treating radiation&#xD;
                  oncologist. This can be a lesion that was previously irradiated as long as prior&#xD;
                  radiation was at least 6 months prior to projected first fraction of SBRT and as&#xD;
                  long as reirradiation dose constraints as outlined in appendix are being met.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A separate, not-to-be-irradiated lesion measurable by CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1&#xD;
