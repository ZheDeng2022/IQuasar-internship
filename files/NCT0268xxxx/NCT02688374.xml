  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, single-dose, three-period, crossover, single-center&#xD;
      comparative bioavailability (BA) study under fasting condition in Chinese healthy male adult&#xD;
      participants with a history of cigarette smoking. The participants will be admitted to the&#xD;
      investigational clinic at least 38 hours before dosing and will remain domiciled until the&#xD;
      completion of all study procedures at approximately 24 hours after dosing. Three toothpastes&#xD;
      (one is commercial non-medicated non-nicotine containing chewing gum and other two are&#xD;
      nicotine containing gums) will be provided across the 3 treatment periods. During each of the&#xD;
      3 treatment periods, participants will be under supervision in a non-smoking area and will&#xD;
      abstain from smoking.There will be a total of at least 7 days and not more than 10 days&#xD;
      (clinical furlough period) between treatment periods. Twenty (20) blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis at baseline and multiple time points following&#xD;
      study drug administration. The trial duration will be approximately 49 days and up to 55 days&#xD;
      from screening to study end including the screening period.&#xD;
