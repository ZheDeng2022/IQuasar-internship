  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a 12 week double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, 120 subjects with obesity&#xD;
      (BMI≥30 kg/m2) and pre-diabetes (HbA1c, 5.7-6.4%) will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive&#xD;
      either placebo or 2 mg of controlled-release melatonin, taken orally every evening 1 hour&#xD;
      before bed. The investigators will assess melatonin's effect on insulin sensitivity by&#xD;
      performing a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp and β-islet cell function measured&#xD;
      using a hyperglycemic clamp, as a primary endpoint. The investigator will also evaluating&#xD;
      melatonin supplementation's effect on mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, nocturnal blood&#xD;
      pressure, and potential intermediates including endothelial function using brachial&#xD;
      ultrasound, catecholamine production using 24-hour epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion,&#xD;
      and renin-angiotensin system activation using measurements of plasma renin activity,&#xD;
      angiotensin II, and urine aldosterone excretion. The final endpoint will be to evaluate&#xD;
      melatonin supplementation's effect on cellular cytokine and CC family chemokine expression as&#xD;
      well as high sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6, and TNF-α.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 24 week cohort phase as an extension of the trial. This will be an open-label&#xD;
      prospective study of 50 subjects recruited from the trial who will take 2 mg of&#xD;
      controlled-release melatonin nightly for 24 weeks after completion of the 12-week trial. At&#xD;
      the end of the cohort-phase (36 weeks after entry in the trial), the investigators will again&#xD;
      assess the extended use of melatonin supplementation on 24-hour BP, and glycemic control&#xD;
      (HbA1, fasting glucose).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will be recruited locally in the Boston area, and all study visits and&#xD;
      procedures will be conducted through Partners and the Harvard Catalyst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, the trial-phase will consist of four visits, two as outpatient, and two as&#xD;
      inpatient. The cohort-phase will consist of two additional outpatient visits. The screening&#xD;
      outpatient visit will involve history taking, physical examinations (when appropriate),&#xD;
      phlebotomy to measure circulating factors and urine pregnancy testing for female subjects.&#xD;
      The 6-week outpatient check-up visit will be with a study coordinator. In addition to&#xD;
      evaluating for adverse effects, the coordinator will perform a pill-count. Phlebotomy will be&#xD;
      performed to measure circulating factors. The two inpatient visits will require two overnight&#xD;
      stays each; the procedures performed for these two inpatient stays will be identical, and&#xD;
      will include: timed urine collection, measurement of brachial artery flow mediated dilation,&#xD;
      phlebotomy (including an IV protocol using low dose heparin), hyperinsulinemic euglycemic&#xD;
      clamp, hyperglycemic clamp, central blood pressure, and placement of an ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor that the participant will wear home for 24 hours and return by pre-paid&#xD;
      FedEx mailer. We will take blood samples at each visit, collecting about 54 tablespoons&#xD;
      (798.5 mL) of blood over the 36-week course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient visits: A screening visit will be scheduled when a participant expresses interest&#xD;
      in the study and is deemed potentially eligible by the study coordinator after a telephone&#xD;
      interview. At the screening visit, a study physician will obtain informed consent.&#xD;
      Thereafter, a study physician will conduct a history and physical examination, and phlebotomy&#xD;
      will be performed. Female subjects will provide urine for pregnancy testing. The purpose of&#xD;
      the screening visit is to evaluate potential volunteers based upon the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria listed above, and to explain the purpose and procedures of the study to&#xD;
      the volunteers. If someone is eligible and willing, a baseline inpatient visit will be&#xD;
      scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 6-week check up will be scheduled after the subject completes the initial inpatient visit.&#xD;
      In addition to evaluating for adverse effects, the coordinator will perform a pill-count.&#xD;
      Phlebotomy will be performed to measure circulating factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the cohort phase, 24- and 36-week check up visits will be scheduled after the subject&#xD;
      completes the final inpatient visit. At these visits, in addition to evaluating for adverse&#xD;
      effects, the coordinator will perform a pill-count. Phlebotomy will be performed to measure&#xD;
      circulating factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient visits: Prior to each inpatient visit, participants will be mailed 9 bouillon&#xD;
      packets (containing 50 mmol of sodium each) and instructed to consume 3 packets each day for&#xD;
      three days prior to admission to the Clinical Trials Center; the purpose of this is to&#xD;
      achieve high sodium balance, which is necessary for our measurements of the renin-angiotensin&#xD;
      system. The high sodium diet will be continued during the inpatient setting. Female subjects&#xD;
      will have a urine pregnancy test done at admission. The following measurements will be&#xD;
      performed during the two inpatient visits, and the changes in these measurements (comparing&#xD;
      the baseline value with the 8-week value) are the endpoints for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp will be performed to measure peripheral insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity. Intravenous catheters are placed within each arm (one for infusion, and one&#xD;
           for blood collection). Then, a compound called insulin (supplied by the Investigational&#xD;
           Drug Service (IDS)) is infused as a loading dose followed by a continuous infusion to&#xD;
           achieve a steady state condition. Blood samples are collected every 5 minutes, and&#xD;
           glucose levels are measured. Blood glucose levels will be controlled by the infusion of&#xD;
           a 20% dextrose solution. The mean dextrose infusion rate (M) over the period between 120&#xD;
           and 180 minutes will be used to measure insulin sensitivity. At 180 minutes, the study&#xD;
           will conclude, and both infusions will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A hyperglycemic clamp will be performed to measure pancreatic β-cell function.&#xD;
           Intravenous catheters are placed within each arm (one for infusion, and one for blood&#xD;
           collection). After a baseline period of 30 minutes, the blood glucose level is increased&#xD;
           with a loading dose of dextrose followed by a continuous infusion to achieve a steady&#xD;
           state condition. Blood samples are collected every 5 minutes, and glucose levels are&#xD;
           measured. Insulin levels are measured at 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120,&#xD;
           140, 160, 180 minutes after the infusion. The 1st-phase insulin release is the sum of&#xD;
           the plasma insulin concentrations at 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10 minutes. The 2nd-phase is the&#xD;
           average plasma insulin concentration during the final hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Endothelial-dependent vasodilation using brachial artery diameter will be measured by&#xD;
           ultrasound. A blood pressure cuff will be inflated on the arm to a supra-systolic&#xD;
           pressure for 5 minutes. This results in vasodilation of the downstream blood vessels.&#xD;
           Following release of the cuff, there is usually a 6 to 10-fold increase in flow through&#xD;
           the brachial artery, i.e., reactive hyperemia. Flow is a physiologic stimulus that&#xD;
           releases nitric oxide and causes dilation of the brachial artery, and hence, an increase&#xD;
           in the diameter of the brachial artery; this can be measured using ultrasound. The&#xD;
           maximal increase in brachial artery diameter occurs at one minute of reactive hyperemia&#xD;
           and this dilation is mediated by nitric oxide. Endothelium-independent vasodilation (as&#xD;
           a positive control) will be assessed by measuring brachial artery diameter under basal&#xD;
           conditions and 3 minutes following the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4&#xD;
           mg). Maximal brachial artery dilation occurs 3 to 4 minutes after the administration of&#xD;
           sublingual nitroglycerin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Central aortic blood pressure measurement: The SphygmoCor XCEL System is a portable&#xD;
           machine that will be used to measure central aortic blood pressure at each of the&#xD;
           inpatient visits (this machine is FDA approved for measurement of central blood&#xD;
           pressure). A thin pillow is placed under the subject's arm to align the arm with the&#xD;
           heart. A blood pressure cuff is placed on the patient's arm, over the brachial artery to&#xD;
           obtain this measurement. The entire procedure will take approximately 10 minutes to&#xD;
           perform. Coded data is automatically stored via the SphygmoCor XCEL System and can be&#xD;
           downloaded onto a secure research computer for storage and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Phlebotomy will be performed to measure circulating melatonin, plasma renin activity,&#xD;
           and angiotensin II. These assays are markers of the systemic renin angiotensin system.&#xD;
           Phlebotomy will also measure adiponectin, leptin, ghrelin, and HbA1c. These assays are&#xD;
           markers of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. In addition, intravenous access&#xD;
           will be placed to permit blood draws every 2 hours from 7 pm until 9 am the following&#xD;
           morning (ie, the morning of day 1). These nocturnal blood draws will be used to measure&#xD;
           nocturnal serum melatonin levels. In order for these blood draws to be completed without&#xD;
           entering the subject's room and possibly waking the subject, a specialized circadian IV&#xD;
           protocol will be used whereby an antecubital IV line will be secured with a kerlix wrap&#xD;
           and connected to a 12 foot IV tubing that will traverse a metal window in the wall that&#xD;
           was constructed especially for such purposes and that is present in patient rooms in the&#xD;
           BWH CCI. Patency of the IV tubing during the night will be ensured by infusing a low&#xD;
           dose of unfractionated heparin (approximately 200 units per hour). The heparin will be&#xD;
           stopped and the IV converted to a standard IV at approximately 9 am on Day 1. This is&#xD;
           standard protocol in the BWH CCI for measuring overnight melatonin concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A 24-urine will be collected to measure excretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and&#xD;
           aldosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Ambulatory blood pressure (for 24 hours) will be measured using a standard technique&#xD;
           employed commonly in clinical practice. An ambulatory blood pressure monitor will be&#xD;
           placed on the participant's arm before the participant is discharged from the inpatient&#xD;
           visit; the participant will also be instructed on its appropriate use, including how to&#xD;
           shut the monitor off after a 24-hour period. The participant will be discharged from the&#xD;
           inpatient visit with the cuff in place and will be given a pre-paid FedEx mailer so that&#xD;
           the monitor can be returned to the study coordinator for data download and re-use.&#xD;
