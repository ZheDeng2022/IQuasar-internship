      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the change of satisfaction with quality of care after an experience on the&#xD;
      Palliative Care Unit (PCU) for both patients and caregivers, as determined by the global&#xD;
      rating survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the change of the quality of care as determined by patients and caregivers&#xD;
           utilizing validated assessment tools and global rating survey assessing different&#xD;
           aspects of care after PCU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine domains of care that are strongly or poorly provided by the PCU, as&#xD;
           reported by patient and caregiver opinions on quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine which demographic features (i.e. cancer diagnosis; time since diagnosis;&#xD;
           reason for transfer to the PCU; gender; caregiver ethnic group; comfort with the idea of&#xD;
           transfer to the PCU; Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS), Edmonton Symptom&#xD;
           Assessment Scale (ESAS) and distress thermometer) may correlate with patient and&#xD;
           caregiver relative satisfaction with PCU care measured by global survey and with the&#xD;
           Family Satisfaction with End-of-Life Care.&#xD;

      Participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete 1 questionnaire about your overall&#xD;
      satisfaction of the care you have received in the hospital, a question about how much&#xD;
      distress you have had before your transfer to the PCU, and a question about your level of&#xD;
      comfort with being transferred to the PCU. You will be asked to answer these questions based&#xD;
      on your experience with the inpatient oncology service. These questionnaires should take&#xD;
      about 10 minutes to complete. Your caregiver will also be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you complete the first set of questionnaires, you will complete the same questionnaires&#xD;
      about your overall satisfaction of the care you have received in the PCU, a question about&#xD;
      how much distress you have had in the past 2 days, and a question about your level of comfort&#xD;
      with being transferred to the PCU. You will be asked to answer these questions based on your&#xD;
      experience in the PCU. One (1) new questionnaire will ask you to compare the care you&#xD;
      received with the palliative care consult service with the care you received in the PCU.&#xD;
      These questionnaires should also take about 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from your medical record (age, gender, educational level, marital status,&#xD;
      religion, ethnicity, cancer diagnosis, stage of cancer, time since diagnosis, and the reasons&#xD;
      you have been transferred to the PCU) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;

      You will complete 1 questionnaire about your overall satisfaction of the care your family&#xD;
      member or friend has received in the hospital, as well as a question about how much distress&#xD;

      have with your family member/friend being transferred to the PCU. You will be asked to answer&#xD;
      these questions based on your experience with the inpatient oncology service. These&#xD;
      questionnaires should take about 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you complete the first set of questionnaires, you will complete the same questionnaires&#xD;
      about your overall satisfaction of the care your family member or friend received in the PCU,&#xD;
      how much distress you have had in the past 2 days, and level of comfort you have with your&#xD;
      family member/friend being transferred to the PCU. You will be asked to answer these&#xD;
      questions based on your experience in the PCU. One (1) new questionnaire will ask you to&#xD;
      compare the care your family member or friend received with the palliative care consult&#xD;
      service to the care your family member/friend received in the PCU. These questionnaires&#xD;
