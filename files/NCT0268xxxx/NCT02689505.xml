  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi-centre, non-randomized, uncontrolled, open-label, dose escalating&#xD;
      study of BI 836880 administered intravenously once a week. The eligible patient population&#xD;
      will be patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      recommended Phase II doses for BI 836880 in patients with solid tumors. Preliminary safety&#xD;
      data will be evaluated as secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, pharmacokinetic profile, pharmacodynamic changes in circulating biomarkers and&#xD;
      Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DCE-MRI), anti-tumor activity and the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of BI 836880 will be explored up to a total of 40 patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model with over dose control&#xD;
      (EWOC) using at least 2 patients per dose cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety criteria will be followed, including adverse events according to Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria (CTCAE version 4.03), incidence of dose limiting toxicities, physical examination,&#xD;
      vital signs, safety laboratory parameters and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG).&#xD;
