  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of the combination of&#xD;
      a cognition enhancing drug, i.e carnosine, with cognitive training in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. All participants will receive the same cognitive training sessions and will be&#xD;
      randomised to either carnosine or placebo for the duration of the combined treatment period&#xD;
      (2 weeks). Before combined training and carnosine/placebo, there is a two-week&#xD;
      carnosine/placebo only phase to examine the effects of carnosine alone on functioning without&#xD;
      training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compromised cognitive functioning is a core feature of schizophrenia, yet it remains a major&#xD;
      unmet need in the treatment of schizophrenia. Current available therapeutic approaches to&#xD;
      enhance cognition in schizophrenia - either pharmacological or non-pharmacological (for a&#xD;
      review) have yielded, at best, only modest results with questionable retention of the&#xD;
      cognitive benefits and generalization of the effects into functional benefit. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a novel approach to enhance cognition in schizophrenia: combining a&#xD;
      food supplement with cognitive training, rather than using each intervention alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim is to test the primary hypothesis that the combination of L-carnosine with cognitive&#xD;
      training will significantly increase the performance of patients with schizophrenia on memory&#xD;
      and learning training tasks compared to pairing cognitive training with placebo. The&#xD;
      investigators will also test the secondary hypotheses that in the group receiving L-carnosine&#xD;
      increased performance is due to a greater learning rate. Carnosine has antioxidant and&#xD;
      antiglycating action and is found in food and the human body. The investigator's choice is&#xD;
      guided by several considerations but, primarily the evidence that L-carnosine has&#xD;
      neuroprotective effects through its antioxidant features. Briefly, the investigators propose&#xD;
      that alterations in metabolism in several neurotransmitter systems (particularly glutamate)&#xD;
      can both contribute to, and be modified by, oxidative stress, and therefore antioxidant&#xD;
      administration could positively affect neurotransmitter role in synaptic plasticity, learning&#xD;
      and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carnosine has shown some improvements in cognitive outcomes in autism (Chez et al, 2002) and&#xD;
      schizophrenia (Chengappa et al; unpublished). Chez used oral doses of 800mg/d for 8 weeks;&#xD;
      while the latter study used oral doses of 2000mg for 4 weeks showing positive effects. Hence&#xD;
      this is the dose and delivery route that will be used. The investigators have opted for 4&#xD;
      weeks course following broadly from these two studies. Carnosine is widely available from&#xD;
      health and food supplement shops in the UK and US retail market in highly pure form; is a&#xD;
      naturally occurring in food and the human body; and is well-tolerated and has a benign&#xD;
      side-effect profile, as shown from previous trials, and is therefore not associated with any&#xD;
      potential risks.&#xD;

    <description>Performance Advantage will test whether performance advantage is retained after cessation of L-carnosine and training, contrary to a state-dependent effect. Compares performance between week 10 and week 8. An advantage (if exists) is a difference between the treatment arm and the placebo arm of the trial on the primary outcome measure. For an advantage the treatment arm should perform better than the placebo arm. If there is no difference between the groups or that the placebo group performs better than the treatment group than the treatment offers no advantage.</description>
