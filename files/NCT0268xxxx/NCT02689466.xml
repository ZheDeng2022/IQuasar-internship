      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dystonia is a movement disorder in which a person s muscles contract on their own. This&#xD;
      causes different parts of the body to twist or turn. The cause of this movement is unknown.&#xD;
      Researchers think it may have to do with a chemical called acetylcholine. They want to learn&#xD;
      more about why acetylcholine in the brain doesn t work properly in people with dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand how certain parts of the brain take up acetylcholine in people with&#xD;
      dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 18 years old who have DYT1 dystonia or cervical dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. The MRI scanner&#xD;
      is a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field that takes pictures of the brain. Participants&#xD;
      will lie on a table that slides in and out of the cylinder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The PET scanner is shaped&#xD;
      like a doughnut. Participants will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the scanner. A&#xD;
      small amount of a radioactive chemical that can be detected by the PET scanner will be given&#xD;
      through an IV line to measure how the brain takes up acetylcholine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dystonia is a heterogeneous group of movement disorders characterized by abnormal muscle&#xD;
      contractions resulting in abnormal postures and movements. The spectrum of dystonia includes&#xD;
      focal, segmental, multifocal, and generalized presentations with a broad range of age of&#xD;
      onset. An example of a focal dystonia is cervical dystonia. The pathophysiology of dystonia&#xD;
      is unclear, but prior neuroimaging and neuropathological studies have identified a role for&#xD;
      the basal ganglia. In neuroimaging studies, microstructural changes in the basal ganglia have&#xD;
      been found in voxel based morphometry (VBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and abnormal&#xD;
      basal ganglia metabolism has been seen in imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (FDG-PET) in various types of dystonia. Basal ganglia pathology has been observed,&#xD;
      including a case series reporting neuronal loss in the striatum. There is further evidence&#xD;
      implicating the basal ganglia in dystonia from studies of animal models. In animal models,&#xD;
      experimental lesions of the basal ganglia induced dystonia. An abnormality in cholinergic&#xD;
      neurotransmission has been has also been suggested because of a clinical response to&#xD;
      antimuscarinic medications. The striatum is a site of acetylcholine synthesis, and expresses&#xD;
      muscarinic receptors. While antimuscarinic medications are useful in the symptomatic&#xD;
      treatment of dystonia, the role of muscarinic acetylcholine neurotransmission in dystonia is&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this application is to determine the role played by a major basal ganglia&#xD;
      neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, in the pathophysiology of primary dystonia. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that cholinergic neurotransmission is deficient in the striatum in dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to examine one group of patients with a form of primary dystonia (cervical dystonia)&#xD;
      to be compared with healthy volunteers without history of neurological or major psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders (stable mild anxiety or stable mild depression are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a case-control study. Using a neuroimaging technique, position emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET), the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing one specific aim: to map M2&#xD;
      muscarinic acetylcholine receptor binding in cervical dystonia as measured with PET using&#xD;
      [18F]FP-TZTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine cholinergic neurotransmitter receptor binding in patients with&#xD;
      cervical dystonia compared with healthy controls. This proposed research study is expected to&#xD;
      advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of dystonia in order to identify possible&#xD;
      targets for potential pharmacological treatments in dystonia and monitor disease progression.&#xD;

             --Cervical dystonia patients must not have had received botulinum toxin injections&#xD;
             into neck muscles for at least about 10 weeks at time of study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Healthy volunteers will be healthy subjects without neurological or psychiatric&#xD;
             disorders (except for stable mild anxiety or stable mild depression) established by&#xD;
             history and physical/neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All participants will be at least 18 years of age. There is no maximum age limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants must be able to abstain from tobacco or nicotine replacement for at least&#xD;
             3 days prior to PET scan if participating in both MRI and PET scanning..&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants must be able to abstain from caffeine for at least 24 hours prior to PET&#xD;
             scan if participating in both MRI and PET scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants must be able to fast for 3 hours before PET scan if participanting in&#xD;
             both MRI and PET scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who are incapable of giving informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Employees of NINDS&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Aside from history obtained at the screening,&#xD;
             pregnancy status in women with childbearing potential is also established by urine&#xD;
             pregnancy testing no more than 24 hours before each MRI and PET scan session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with past or present medical history of (a) neurological disorders, such as&#xD;
             stroke, movement disorders (other than cervical dystonia in the patient group), brain&#xD;
             tumors, traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness lasting more than a few&#xD;
             seconds, ataxias, myopathies, myasthenia gravis, demyelinating diseases, alcoholism,&#xD;
             drug dependence; (b) psychiatric disorders besides stable mild anxiety or stable mild&#xD;
             depression, such as schizophrenia, major depressive and/or bipolar disorder,&#xD;
             obsessive-compulsive disorder; (c) ventricular arrhythmias, renal and hepatic&#xD;
             insufficiency, vascular headache, or carcinoid syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Abnormalities in neurological examination other what is typically associated with&#xD;
             cervical dystonia, or any abnormalities in neurological examination in healthy&#xD;
             volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who are currently taking oral medications known to affect muscarinic&#xD;
             acetylcholine receptor binding in the central nervous system. Of note, some over-the&#xD;
             counter-medications are known to affect muscarinic acetylcholine receptor binding.&#xD;
             Subjects who use medications known to affect muscarinic acetylcholine receptor&#xD;
             binding, such as first generation antihistamines for common cold and allergy symptoms&#xD;
             and sleep aids for insomnia, occasionally on an as needed basis may be enrolled in&#xD;
             this study. Furthermore, these as needed medications should be paused for at least 3&#xD;
             days before PET scanning. This three-day period is equivalent to about 4 to 5 half&#xD;
             lives for these medications. In addition, subjects who use topical antimuscarinic&#xD;
             medications, such as eye drops for glaucoma and inhalers, may be enrolled in this&#xD;
             study because topical antimuscarinic medications have negligible systemic&#xD;
             bioavailability. Subjects who have contraindications to MRI, ferromagnetic objects in&#xD;
             their bodies (e.g., implanted stimulators including deep brain stimulation, aneurysm&#xD;
             clips, prosthesis, artificial heart valves, etc.) that cannot be removed for the&#xD;
             purpose of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who have claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects who are unable to lie comfortably on their back for about one hour for MRI&#xD;
             scanning (and about two hours for PET scanning if participating in both MRI and PET&#xD;
             scanning).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with any radiation exposure in the past year that, together with the research&#xD;
             PET scan, would exceed the NIH Radiation Safety Committee s annual limit (5 rem) if&#xD;
             participating in both MRI and PET scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Cervical dystonia patients who have cervical dystonia associated with trauma&#xD;
