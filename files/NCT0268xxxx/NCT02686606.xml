  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with short bowel intestinal failure are recommended to aim for a diet high in energy&#xD;
      and protein. Some patients have difficulties in achieving recommended intakes and additional&#xD;
      nutrition may be provided by oral nutritional supplements. There is very little research&#xD;
      completed on which is the best oral nutritional supplement for patients. The aim of the study&#xD;
      is to see the effect different oral nutritional supplements have on your stoma or fistula&#xD;
      output and levels of hydration.&#xD;

      After written consent is obtained, patients will be asked to fast from 12.00am on day one. At&#xD;
      08.00am patients will be asked to pass urine and to empty their stoma bag. After this they&#xD;
      will be asked to drink 200ml of the ONS which they have been randomised to test on day one&#xD;
      over a 30 minute period. Urine and intestinal output will be collected into two separate&#xD;
      containers over the next 6 hours. During this time the patient will not be permitted to eat&#xD;
      or drink other fluids. After 6 hours the patient will be able to eat and drink normally. The&#xD;
      urine and intestinal output will be weighed and then an aliquot will be stored in a -20oC&#xD;
      freezer before being sent for analysis. Day two is a washout day when the patient will be&#xD;
      able to eat and drink normally. Day three will be the same as day one but the patient will&#xD;
      have the other ONS that they did not have on day one. No changes will be made to the&#xD;
      patient's usual anti diarrhoeal and/or anti motility agents or parenteral support during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
