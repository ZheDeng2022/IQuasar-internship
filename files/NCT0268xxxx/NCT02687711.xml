    <textblock>
      Study is the first study after commercialization of brivaracetam. It is designed to collect&#xD;
      real world information on the effectiveness of brivaracetam in patients with Partial Onset&#xD;
      Seizure epislepsy who are treated in standard clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EP0077 is a 12 months, multicenter, noninterventional study (NIS) conducted at specialized&#xD;
      sites in approximately 10 European countries. Patients will be treated according to usual&#xD;
      medical diagnostic procedures and therapy; commercially available brivaracetam will be&#xD;
      prescribed according to normal clinical practice and the current Summary of Product&#xD;
      Characteristics (SmPC) in Europe for brivaracetam (BRV). The prescription of BRV is clearly&#xD;
      separated from the decision to include the patient in the study. No additional diagnostic or&#xD;
      monitoring procedures are applied to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine BRV retention over a 12 month period as a&#xD;
      measure of effectiveness in a real world setting. The secondary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      assess seizure control with BRV treatment.&#xD;
