      This study evaluates the perinatal factors influencing body composition at discharge in very&#xD;
      preterm infants and the relationship between fat free mass and further neurocognitive&#xD;
      development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postnatal growth is a crucial in premature infants as it could be correlated with the&#xD;
      long-term cognitive development. Recent data from the literature show that it is possible -&#xD;
      with appropriate nutritional care - to reduce the initial weight loss and to ensure that the&#xD;
      growth deficit accumulated is then less important than was previously observed. The&#xD;
      quantitative objective is to achieve growth that is at least equivalent to that of the fetus&#xD;
      (12-18 g/kg.day according to postconceptional age). Children often grow slowly during the&#xD;
      first 10 days of life, so they accumulate a growth deficit that should be compensated&#xD;
      secondarily. Therefore, optimum postnatal growth is 20 g/kg.day, rather than 15 g/kg.day. It&#xD;
      is also important to assess the quality of growth, particularly fat free mass. The objective&#xD;
      of nutritional care is dual: a sufficient weight gain (close to fetal growth rate) but also a&#xD;
      relevant body composition. However, there is very little data on body composition of&#xD;
      premature babies at discharge. It is now possible to measure quickly (one minute), simply and&#xD;
      noninvasively using pediatric air-displacement plethysmography. Previous studies using more&#xD;
      complex search techniques to implement (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) showed excessive&#xD;
      body fat at discharge in premature babies. Reference values collected using pediatric&#xD;
      air-displacement plethysmography were published in 2011. Nutritional practices and strategies&#xD;
      have significantly evolved in the past years to support such objectives: improvement of early&#xD;
      parenteral nutrient intake, new fortifiers for human milk, new preterm formulas and early&#xD;
      beginning of enteral nutrition. Individualized fortification of human milk helps to provide&#xD;
      preterm infants with sufficient amount of nutrients. The modern nutritionnal care in preterm&#xD;
      infants results in earlier and higher protein and energy intakes than previously performed.&#xD;
      It improves some anthropometric parameters but little is know about body composition at&#xD;
      discharge. Furthermore, exposition to high nutrients intake could lead to metabolic and&#xD;
      hormonal imprinting with an increased risk of diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases in&#xD;
      adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTIPREMA aim to focus the link between nutrient intakes during hospitalization, body&#xD;
      composition at discharge and relationship between fat free mass variations at discharge and&#xD;
      neurodevelopment at 2 years.&#xD;
