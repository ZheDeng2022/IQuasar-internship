      This study will examine the appropriate dose and side effects of dasatinib, when it is given&#xD;
      with the standard of care chemotherapy for children and adolescents with Acute Myeloid&#xD;
      Leukemia (AML).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I study is for children and adolescents who have acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      that has come back (relapsed) or has become resistant (refractory) to standard therapies.&#xD;
      Researchers want to know if a drug called dasatinib is safe when used together with standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy in treating patients who have relapsed or have resistant AML. Their leukemia has&#xD;
      a particular genetic mutation, called core-binding factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of leukemia has an increase of a cancer promoting protein called c-KIT. Dasatinib&#xD;
      can target this protein in laboratory experiments. Laboratory and other studies suggest that&#xD;
      dasatinib may prevent acute myeloid leukemia cells from growing and may lead to the&#xD;
      destruction of leukemia cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is to find a safe dose of dasatinib and to find out the side&#xD;
      effects of dasatinib when it is given in combination with standard chemotherapy to children&#xD;
      and adolescents. Similar studies are currently being done in adult patients. Dasatinib has&#xD;
      been proven safe and effective in the treatment of other types of leukemia, both by itself&#xD;
      and in combination with standard chemotherapy. It is not, however, FDA-approved for use in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three to six participants will receive the starting dose of the drug. If the side effects are&#xD;
      not too severe, the next group of participants will take the study drug at a higher dose&#xD;
      level. Up to two dose levels of the study drug will be tested. Dasatinib is given by mouth&#xD;
      once daily on days 6 to 29 of each 42-day cycle. Participants may receive two cycles in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to dasatinib, participants receive chemotherapy intravenously (IV) with&#xD;
      fludarabine, cytarabine, idarubicin, as well as in the spinal fluid (intrathecal or IT&#xD;
      chemotherapy). Intrathecal chemotherapy includes cytarabine at the start of each cycle. These&#xD;
      drugs are part of standard AML treatment. If at the time of study entry a subject has&#xD;
      leukemia cells in their spinal fluid (CNS leukemia), they may receive additional intrathecal&#xD;
      chemotherapy with cytarabine, methotrexate, and hydrocortisone (IT triples) during each&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Required research tests include pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) blood draws&#xD;
      (about 1 teaspoon each time) during cycle 1. Optional research tests include extra marrow&#xD;
      (about 1 teaspoon each time) for genetic testing and banking of marrow (1 teaspoon) for&#xD;
      future studies about cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of combining dasatinib with reinduction chemotherapy comprised of&#xD;
           idarubicin, fludarabine and cytarabine (Ida - FLU/Ara) in children with relapsed or&#xD;
           refractory core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF AML)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the toxicity profile of this combination in pediatric patients with&#xD;
           relapsed or refractory CBF AML&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the response rates to the combination chemotherapy in the context of a Phase&#xD;
           I study, in children with AML in first or greater relapse or refractory to induction&#xD;
           chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the genotype of c-KIT exons 8 and 17 and correlate with response rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize c-KIT expression of bone marrow blasts at study entry and at the end of&#xD;
           course 1 of therapy and describe any correlation with response to therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate descriptively the pharmacodynamic modulation of c-KIT target, Stat3, in a&#xD;
           cell line by patient-derived plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform RNA sequencing on bone marrow samples at study entry in order to describe the&#xD;
           prevalence of mutations in AML associated genes, including c-KIT, and correlate&#xD;
           descriptively with progression free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect biology specimens at study entry and completion of therapy for future biology&#xD;
           studies&#xD;
