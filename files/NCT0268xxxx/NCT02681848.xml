      Introduction: Smoking is a major avoidable cause of ill-health and premature death.&#xD;
      Treatments that help patients successfully quit smoking have an important effect on health&#xD;
      and life expectancy. Varenicline is a medication that can help smokers successfully quit&#xD;
      smoking. However, there are concerns that it may cause adverse effects, such as increase in&#xD;
      the occurrence of depression, self-harm and suicide and cardiovascular disease. In this study&#xD;
      the investigators aim to examine the effects of varenicline versus other smoking cessation&#xD;
      pharmacotherapies on smoking cessation, health service use, all-cause and cause-specific&#xD;
      mortality and physical and mental health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this project the investigators will investigate the effects of varenicline&#xD;
      compared to nicotine replacement therapies on: (1) long-term smoking cessation and whether&#xD;
      these effects differ by area level deprivation; and (2) the following clinically-important&#xD;
      outcomes: rate of general practice and hospital attendance; all-cause mortality and death due&#xD;
      to diseases of the respiratory system and cardiovascular disease; and a primary care&#xD;
      diagnosis of respiratory illness, myocardial infarction or depression and anxiety. The study&#xD;
      is based on a cohort of patients prescribed these smoking cessation medications from the&#xD;
      Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The investigators will use three methods to&#xD;
      overcome confounding: multivariable adjusted Cox regression, propensity score matched Cox&#xD;
      regression, and instrumental variable regression. The total expected sample size for analysis&#xD;
      will be at least 180 000. Follow-up will end with the earliest of either an 'event' or&#xD;
      censoring due to the end of registration or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was not required for this study. This project has&#xD;
      been approved by the CPRD's Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC). The&#xD;
      investigators will disseminate the findings via publications in international peer-reviewed&#xD;
      journals and presentations at international conferences.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking is the major avoidable cause of preventable morbidity and premature mortality in the&#xD;
      UK and internationally. Smoking is also the principal cause of health inequalities and is&#xD;
      responsible for most of the difference in healthy life-expectancy between the richest and&#xD;
      poorest in our society and those with and without mental health problems. It has been&#xD;
      estimated that smoking-related illnesses cost the NHS approximately Â£5bn per year.&#xD;
      Varenicline has been shown to be the most clinically effective smoking cessation medicine for&#xD;
      short-term abstinence in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, there is very little&#xD;
      evidence for its long-term effectiveness and impact on clinical outcomes which are relevant&#xD;
      to the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although RCTs are considered the gold standard for the evaluation of the intended effects of&#xD;
      medicines, they are less appropriate for determining unintended or unexpected beneficial or&#xD;
      adverse effects for several reasons. Data from RCTs of varenicline typically have less than a&#xD;
      year of follow-up, with relatively low power to detect effects on clinically-relevant&#xD;
      outcomes, and are not informative about the longer-term consequences of varenicline&#xD;
      treatment. Furthermore, these RCTs usually exclude smokers with chronic respiratory or heart&#xD;
      disease and psychiatric illnesses, so their findings may not be generalisable to all&#xD;
      patients. Observational studies using large primary care databases of electronic health&#xD;
      records may be used to address these unanswered questions, as the investigators propose to do&#xD;
      here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently investigated the short-term relationships between smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatment and suicide, self-harm, depression and all-cause mortality using CPRD&#xD;
      data. The investigators found no evidence of an increased risk of suicidal behaviour in&#xD;
      patients prescribed varenicline. The investigators were concerned that the conventional&#xD;
      observational estimates of effects of varenicline were biased by residual confounding by&#xD;
      indication. If patients prescribed varenicline differed from patients prescribed other&#xD;
      smoking cessation treatments prior to their first prescription, then the investigators could&#xD;
      not be certain whether any differences in outcomes were due to the medication the patients&#xD;
      received, or because of the pre-existing differences between the patients. In the&#xD;
      investigators previous study the investigators tried to overcome confounding by indication&#xD;
      using three statistical approaches: conventional multivariable-adjusted regression,&#xD;
      propensity score matched analysis, and an instrumental variable analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators used physicians' prescribing preferences as instrumental variables, as&#xD;
      described in Section 1, for the physicians' prescriptions of varenicline or nicotine&#xD;
      replacement products. In the conventional observational analysis, after adjustment for a wide&#xD;
      range of observable patient characteristics, patients prescribed varenicline had a 51% lower&#xD;
      risk of all-cause mortality than those prescribed other nicotine replacement products in the&#xD;
      nine months after their first prescription, (hazard ratio=0.49, 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      (95%CI): 0.40 to 0.61). However, the investigators found little evidence of a reduction in&#xD;
      all-cause mortality using instrumental variable analysis (risk difference per 1,000&#xD;
      prescriptions=0.7, 95% CI: -3.3 to 4.7). This suggests that the conventional&#xD;
      multivariable-adjusted regression may have suffered from bias due to unmeasured confounding,&#xD;
      as the effect sizes are implausible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking is strongly patterned by socio-economic status in the UK; in the 2011 Government&#xD;
      Health Survey, prevalence of smoking was 31% amongst individuals in routine occupations&#xD;
      compared to 10% amongst individuals in higher managerial and professional occupations (ASH).&#xD;
      A recent systematic review reported that the NHS stop-smoking services may be helping to&#xD;
      reduce inequalities in smoking prevalence by preferentially targeting smokers of lower&#xD;
      socio-economic status (SES). These findings are supported by data from primary care records&#xD;
      (The Health Improvement Network), which show that between 2008 and 2010, smokers in more&#xD;
      deprived groups were more likely to receive smoking cessation interventions. A recent&#xD;
      telephone survey in England found no evidence for differences in rates of self-reported&#xD;
      smoking cessation medication use or type of medication used by category of SES. However, this&#xD;
      survey demonstrated that there were clear differences in success of quit attempts by SES,&#xD;
      with rates being lowest in the lowest SES group. More research is urgently required in this&#xD;
      area using large clinical databases to further understand the differences in smoking&#xD;
      cessation medication effectiveness by SES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence explaining why this research is needed now:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has mandated that varenicline carry a black box&#xD;
      warning (the agency's strongest safety warning) on its labelling highlighting the increased&#xD;
      risk of suicidal ideation and depression in patients prescribed varenicline based on&#xD;
      spontaneous reports to the FDA Adverse Events Reporting (FDA AERS) database. These warnings&#xD;
      are meant to indicate causal effects of pharmaceuticals. However, there is an increasing&#xD;
      number of experimental and observational studies that suggest there is little difference in&#xD;
      risk of adverse neuropsychiatric effects of varenicline compared to nicotine replacement&#xD;
      products. On October 16th 2014, the FDA will hold a joint meeting of the Psychopharmacologic&#xD;
      Drugs Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Discuss safety data from observational studies and a meta-analysis of RCTs since the&#xD;
      emergence of the original signal of serious neuropsychiatric adverse events with varenicline&#xD;
      which led to the black box warning in 2009 and; (ii) Determine whether any changes should be&#xD;
      made to the description of this risk in varenicline's product labelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a significant extension of previous research undertaken by this group as part&#xD;
      of a Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) grant (SDS 33437) on&#xD;
      &quot;Medicines that may promote suicide: pharmacoepidemiological analysis of risk and risk&#xD;
      assessment&quot;. The focus of this earlier grant was to investigate whether varenicline caused&#xD;
      suicide and self-harm. The investigators produced a written report of the findings for the&#xD;
      MHRA and presented these findings orally to the Pharmacovigilance Expert Advisory Group&#xD;
      (PEAG) of the Commission on Human Medicines. This committee deliberates on potential new&#xD;
      signals of risks associated with pharmacotherapies. Two major questions were identified as&#xD;
      future research priorities by the PEAG: how should regulators interpret the results of&#xD;
      instrumental variable studies when they conflict with conventional multivariable-adjusted&#xD;
      observational analysis? Is it possible to give definitive guidance about when instrumental&#xD;
      variable analysis is likely to have lower bias? Currently, the epidemiological literature is&#xD;
      not sufficiently developed to conclusively do this. The investigators will address this gap&#xD;
      in the literature in the methodological components of this proposal. This will significantly&#xD;
      further understanding of when instrumental variable analysis should be used to address&#xD;
      problems of confounding by indication. Additionally, this proposal will provide evidence&#xD;
      regarding the effectiveness of varenicline with respect to long term smoking cessation and&#xD;
      clinically relevant outcomes. This will aid regulators determine whether the benefits of&#xD;
      varenicline treatment outweigh possible risks. The investigators will report the results of&#xD;
      this research to regulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the long-term smoking abstinence of patients prescribed either&#xD;
           varenicline or nicotine replacement products in the CPRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the causal effects of smoking cessation on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. frequency of GP attendance,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. frequency of all-cause and cause-specific hospitalisation,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. all-cause and cause-specific mortality,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. incident diagnosis of respiratory illness,&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. incident diagnosis of myocardial infarction and&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. incident diagnosis of depression or anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate differences in the effectiveness of smoking cessation medications for&#xD;
           long-term smoking abstinence by area level deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Design and theoretical/conceptual framework&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will use the CPRD to conduct a cohort study of all patients prescribed&#xD;
           varenicline or nicotine replacement products. The study type is &quot;Hypothesis testing&quot;.&#xD;
           Exposure will be defined as the first prescription of either varenicline or nicotine&#xD;
           replacement therapy. The investigators will investigate differences in the following&#xD;
           outcomes described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the statistical analysis the investigators will use Cox-regression models adjusted&#xD;
           for a range of baseline confounders, propensity score matched Cox-regression, and&#xD;
           instrumental variable analyses using physicians' prescribing preferences as instruments&#xD;
           for the prescriptions issued.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Power calculations The following power calculations are based on effect sizes and&#xD;
           confidence intervals observed in the investigators previous analyses, which had data on&#xD;
           110,000 individuals prescribed either varenicline or nicotine replacement therapy. Based&#xD;
           on the rate of 18,000 new prescriptions per year observed in the CPRD from 2006 to 2011,&#xD;
           with a further 4 years of follow-up the number of patients prescribed either varenicline&#xD;
           or nicotine replacement therapy will have increased by 72,000. Therefore the total&#xD;
           expected sample size for analysis will be around 180,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the investigators previous analysis using CPRD data the age- and sex-adjusted hazard&#xD;
           ratio for self-harm/suicide for varenicline vs. nicotine replacement therapy at nine&#xD;
           months was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.54 to 0.99); after adjusting for possible confounders this&#xD;
           became: 0.90 (95% CI: 0.66 to 1.22). A 70% increase in sample size would lead to a&#xD;
           reduction of the standard error by a factor of 1.3, reducing the breadth of the&#xD;
           above-adjusted confidence interval from 0.56 to 0.43.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rare outcomes, self-harm and suicide, were used in previous analyses; the investigators&#xD;
           will have greater power to explore more common outcome measures within this project. For&#xD;
           example, in the previous analysis the nine month age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio for&#xD;
           all-cause mortality nine months after first prescription for varenicline vs. nicotine&#xD;
           replacement therapy was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.35 to 0.53); after controlling for possible&#xD;
           confounders this became: 0.49 (95% CI: 0.40 to 0.61). A 70% increase in sample size&#xD;
           would lead to a reduction of the standard error by a factor of 1.3, reducing the breadth&#xD;
           of the above-adjusted confidence interval from 0.21 to 0.16.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the effects of varenicline versus nicotine replacement therapy on all-cause&#xD;
           mortality, instrumental variable analysis found a risk difference of 0.7 (95% CI: -3.3&#xD;
           to 4.7) per 1,000 patients treated after nine months. A 70% increase in sample size&#xD;
           would narrow the confidence intervals from 8.0 to 6.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection and analysis The investigators will use the latest available release of&#xD;
           the CPRD. This is because General Practices enrolled with the CPRD send regular tranches&#xD;
           of data which are released to researchers throughout the year. This will guarantee that&#xD;
           there is the largest possible sample of patients for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data analysis Defining exposures, outcomes and covariates&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exposures First time users of the smoking cessation therapies (varenicline or nicotine&#xD;
           replacement therapy) will be defined as people who received at least one prescription of&#xD;
           the product after the 1st of September 2006 but with no use of a related product during&#xD;
           the 12 months before the index date (the first date on which a prescription was issued).&#xD;
           Langley et al. (2010) found the smoking cessation prescription data in the THIN&#xD;
           database, which is closely related to the CPRD, to be highly comparable to national&#xD;
           dispensing data. The analysis will be limited to the first treatment episode. This will&#xD;
           mimic an intention to treat analysis in a RCT. The prescriptions will be defined by the&#xD;
           therapy file in the CPRD, which contains a list of all prescriptions issued to patients&#xD;
           at the practices. Each therapy record records the date a prescription was issued, the&#xD;
           quantity of drug prescribed and the dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To mimic an intention-to-treat analysis in an RCT in the primary analysis patients who&#xD;
           are initially prescribed nicotine replacement therapy, but later switch to varenicline&#xD;
           will be allocated to nicotine replacement therapy and vice-versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
           Smoking abstinence In the CPRD smoking status is indicated by whether the patient is a&#xD;
           current, former or never smoker. As GPs are paid to record smoking status smoking&#xD;
           behaviour is robustly recorded in the CPRD. Marston et al. (2014) found that 84% of&#xD;
           patients had smoking status recorded within a year of registering at a practice, and&#xD;
           that smoking prevalence rates by age were similar in CPRD and the Health Survey of&#xD;
           England. Booth et al. (2013) found that the difference in prevalence of smoking estimate&#xD;
           between the CPRD and the Health Survey for England was less than 1%, and the mean&#xD;
           difference was 0.1% (95% CI: -1.5% to 1.7%). Using unpublished data from CPRD sampled as&#xD;
           part of the research reported in Thomas et al. (2013) the investigators found that 74%&#xD;
           of patients prescribed smoking cessation medication had a subsequent record indicating&#xD;
           smoking status. Of these 66% were indicated as current smokers and 33% as ex-smokers.&#xD;
           The investigators will initially define a patient as relapsed if they have any record&#xD;
           indicating that the patient is a current smoker after their first prescription of a&#xD;
           smoking cessation therapy. The investigators will not be able to determine the smoking&#xD;
           status of patients who do not return to the GP. Therefore, the investigators will&#xD;
           perform sensitivity analyses to examine whether the assumptions made about the smoking&#xD;
           status of individuals who are not observed affect the results. For example, the&#xD;
           investigators will conduct a sensitivity analysis to see if the results are altered by&#xD;
           assuming that patients with missing data have relapsed, or by assuming that patients&#xD;
           with missing outcomes have achieved abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Service use&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will define service use as the number of visits to GP and hospitals in&#xD;
           the 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 48 months after first prescription. The investigators will&#xD;
           define the GP appointments using the clinical data file of the CPRD. This includes all&#xD;
           the diagnoses and symptoms that GPs record about all of their patients. As with the&#xD;
           other outcomes, the vast majority of diagnoses and symptoms include the date on which&#xD;
           the data were added to the database. The investigators will use these dates to define&#xD;
           visits to primary care. The investigators will define the hospital visits outcome using&#xD;
           the linked Hospital Episodes Statistics data. This is available for approximately half&#xD;
           of the sample. Again these data contain the date on which the event occurred, which the&#xD;
           investigators will use to define attendance to secondary care within 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and&#xD;
           48 months after first prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All-cause and cause-specific mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will define all-cause and cause-specific mortality using the linked&#xD;
           Office of National Statistics mortality dataset. These include the date of death and&#xD;
           cause of death using ICD-9 codes. The investigators will investigate three specific&#xD;
           causes of mortality, 1) diseases of respiratory system (ICD-9=460-519), 2)&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease (ICD-9=390-459) and 3) mental disorders (ICD-9=290-319).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will define the adverse event outcomes using the diagnosis records&#xD;
           from the Clinical and Referral files in the CPRD. These files record all the diagnoses&#xD;
           that the GPs input into their computer system. Each record in the table is given a&#xD;
           diagnosis code based on the Read code categorisation. The investigators will use&#xD;
           validated Read code lists, for the three adverse event outcomes, respiratory illnesses,&#xD;
           myocardial infarction or depression and anxiety. For eligible patients the investigators&#xD;
           will extract all records from the Clinical and Referral Tables that indicate the patient&#xD;
           either received a specific diagnosis or were referred for a specific diagnosis. As with&#xD;
           the therapy records for prescriptions described above, each Clinical and Referral Record&#xD;
           indicates the date the information was inputted into the system. The investigators will&#xD;
           use this date to define the date that the diagnosis was made.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Covariates&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will include gender, age in years at time of first prescription,&#xD;
           previous psychiatric illness/consultation, previous use of psychotropic medications such&#xD;
           as hypnotics, antipsychotics and antidepressants, previous self-harm, measures of&#xD;
           alcohol consumption where appropriate mean/median number of GP visits per year, body&#xD;
           mass index, socioeconomic position (deprivation score for area or residence) and major&#xD;
           chronic illness (including diabetes, cancer, arthritis) using the Charlson index.&#xD;
           Relevant Read codes will be identified either by validated code lists or by searching&#xD;
           for each of these events in the Read code dictionaries to identify any missing Read&#xD;
           codes. Collider bias could occur if the investigators conditioned on events which&#xD;
           happened as a result of the prescription the patient was issued. To prevent this bias&#xD;
           from affecting the results, the investigators will define each covariate using data&#xD;
           inputted prior to the first prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical Analysis For investigating the effects of varenicline use on each outcome&#xD;
           (long-term smoking cessation, frequency of GP and hospital attendance, all-cause and&#xD;
           cause-specific mortality, primary care diagnosis of respiratory illness, myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, depression or anxiety), the investigators will report a conventional&#xD;
           multivariable-adjusted regression, propensity score regression and instrumental variable&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Conventional Cox-regression In the first analysis, a conventional observational analysis,&#xD;
      the investigators will estimate hazard ratios of the outcomes using Cox-proportional hazards&#xD;
      models and the actual prescriptions issued to the patients. Each patient's date of entry into&#xD;
      the cohort will be the date they were first prescribed a smoking cessation therapy. The date&#xD;
      of exit for each outcome will be the date on which they first have an event, or are censored&#xD;
      due to end of follow-up or death or leaving the practice. The investigators will report these&#xD;
      associations adjusted for basic confounders (age and gender), and results adjusted for all&#xD;
      measured covariates described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Propensity score regression In the second analysis the investigators will construct a&#xD;
      sample of patients balanced on covariates and risk factors using a propensity score. The&#xD;
      investigators will construct propensity scores using a logistic regression of the actual&#xD;
      treatment received on the covariates described above. Therefore, each participant's&#xD;
      propensity score will be their conditional probability (odds) of receiving varenicline versus&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy. The investigators will match each patient receiving varenicline&#xD;
      to another patient receiving nicotine replacement therapy with the closest propensity score&#xD;
      on a ratio of 1:1 using a nearest neighbour algorithm with no replacement, and matching will&#xD;
      be restricted to the common support region. Patients outside the common support region are&#xD;
      those prescribed varenicline with propensity scores higher than any patient prescribed&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy and vice versa. The investigators will estimate hazard ratios of&#xD;
      the outcomes using the propensity score matched sample using Cox-regressions using the same&#xD;
      entry and exit information as the conventional Cox-regression analysis described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Instrumental variable analysis In the third analysis, the investigators will estimate the&#xD;
      effects of smoking cessation therapies on the outcomes using physicians' prescribing&#xD;
      preferences as instruments for the prescriptions the GPs issue to their patients. The&#xD;
      investigators cannot directly measure the physicians' preferences, therefore the&#xD;
      investigators will use the prescriptions they issued to their previous patients as a proxy&#xD;
      for their preferences. For example, if the instrument was based on just one previous&#xD;
      prescription, physicians who previously prescribed varenicline would categorised as a&#xD;
      varenicline prescriber. See Section 2 for further details. As with the investigators'&#xD;
      previous studies the investigators will use seven prior prescriptions to improve the strength&#xD;
      of the instruments. Using multiple prior prescriptions will maximise power; as with previous&#xD;
      studies, the investigators will include multiple prior prescriptions to improve the&#xD;
      efficiency of the estimators. The investigators will report risk differences in the outcomes&#xD;
      using additive structural mean models estimated via the generalised method of moments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will categorise each of the adverse event outcomes as occurring within 3,&#xD;
      6, 9, 12, 24 and 48 months of first prescription. The investigators will do this because&#xD;
      methods for conducting survival analysis using instrumental variables are not well developed.&#xD;
      The investigators will use Stata 13.1 SE to generate all results. The instrumental variable&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted using the ivreg2 command and psmatch2 will be used to construct&#xD;
      the propensity score. All standard errors will be estimated using cluster robust standard&#xD;
      errors which accounts for clustering of patients within practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Socio-economic variation in effectiveness of smoking cessation treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Area level deprivation will be assigned to each patient using their home address postcode and&#xD;
      to each GP practice using the practice postcode. Deprivation levels will be based on the&#xD;
      Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) which are available from the Office of National&#xD;
      Statistics. IMD statistics are updated every two years. The investigators will use the most&#xD;
      recent IMD statistics preceding the date of entry into the study for each patient. Although&#xD;
      area level deprivation statistics will only be a proxy for individual level deprivation,&#xD;
      these demonstrate the expected associations with smoking prevalence. By using both individual&#xD;
      and GP level IMD codes, the investigators will investigate whether the effects of smoking&#xD;
      cessation therapies differ by IMD at both the level of GP practice and at the individual&#xD;
      level. For each patient, the investigators will investigate treatment compliance by reporting&#xD;
      the total number of prescriptions issued after the initial prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will estimate the effects of smoking cessation therapies within sub-groups&#xD;
      defined by IMD level both at the individual and practice level using the three methods&#xD;
      described above, multivariable-adjusted Cox regression, propensity score regression and&#xD;
      instrumental variable analysis. The cohort of patients will be defined as described above.&#xD;
      The investigators will report these associations adjusted for basic confounders (age and&#xD;
      gender), and results adjusted for all measured covariates described above. Analyses will&#xD;
      account for clustering of patients by GP practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Sensitivity analyses The investigators will perform sensitivity analyses to examine&#xD;
      whether the assumptions made about the smoking status of individuals who are not observed&#xD;
      affect the results. For example, the investigators will conduct a sensitivity analysis to see&#xD;
      if the results are altered by assuming that patients with missing data have relapsed, or by&#xD;
      assuming that patients with missing outcome data have achieved abstinence.&#xD;

        The investigators will use the CPRD to conduct a cohort study of all patients prescribed&#xD;
        varenicline or nicotine replacement products. The study type is &quot;Hypothesis testing&quot;.&#xD;
        Exposure will be defined as the first prescription of either varenicline or nicotine&#xD;
        replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Setting/Context:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prescriptions of smoking cessation medications issued in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Target population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All smokers aged over 18 prescribed smoking cessation treatment in eligible primary care&#xD;
        centres contributing to the CPRD after the 1st of September 2006.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sampling method:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The investigators will sample all individuals prescribed smoking cessation medication at&#xD;
        any point after 1st of September 2006 to the most recent release of the CPRD data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study population:&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With CPRD records aged 18 and over.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Who were prescribed medicines in BNF category 4.10.2 from 1st September 2006, when&#xD;
             varenicline was introduced to the UK, to the present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With records that were classified as 'acceptable' by the CPRD from all up to standard&#xD;
             practices at least 18 months prior to date of entry of each cohort (1st March 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Who have data defined as &quot;acceptable&quot; by the CPRD if they meet minimum quality control&#xD;
             standards, for example their registration period with their GP is valid. &quot;Up to&#xD;
             standard&quot; practices are GP practices defined by the CPRD to be providing data of&#xD;
             sufficient quality for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who registered at a practice less than 365 days before the first recorded&#xD;
             prescription to allow for high quality assessment of baseline data and possible&#xD;
             confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients prescribed bupropion in the year before their index prescription will be&#xD;
             excluded from the analysis. It is relatively rare for patients to be prescribed both&#xD;
             NRT and varenicline on the same day. In the investigators' previous study this only&#xD;
             occurred for 0.248% of all prescription events. In the primary analysis for this study&#xD;
             the investigators will exclude patients initially prescribed both NRT and varenicline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        * Follow-up will end with the earliest of either an &quot;event&quot; or censoring due to the end of&#xD;
        registration or death.&#xD;
