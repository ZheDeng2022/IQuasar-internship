      Through a series of sequential analyses, retrospective database exploration looking for&#xD;
      linkages and associations between the use of processed electroencephalogram (EEG) and/or&#xD;
      cerebral saturation monitoring and patient outcomes post-cardiothoracic surgery will be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to mine the Premier Healthcare Database to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. define the incidence of post-operative cognitive complications, acute kidney injury and&#xD;
           stroke after specific cardiac surgical procedures (defined as: coronary artery bypass&#xD;
           graft [CABG], Aortic Valve Replacement, Mitral valve repair, Mitral valve replacement,&#xD;
           thoracic aortic operation, combined CABG and Valve replacement or repair ; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the incremental increase in the length of hospitalization and cost of&#xD;
           hospitalization among cardiac surgical patients who suffer postoperative cognitive&#xD;
           complications, acute kidney injury and stroke; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the effectiveness of intraoperative neuromonitoring with cerebral saturation&#xD;
           and/or processed electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring on the incidence of&#xD;
           post-operative cognitive complications, acute kidney injury and stroke as a consequence&#xD;
           of specific cardiac surgery procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Premier Healthcare Database is a privately owned database that represents approximately&#xD;
      1/5th of all United States hospitalizations annually. It includes all International&#xD;
      Classification of Diseases-9th Revision (ICD-9) and International Classification of&#xD;
      Diseases-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis and procedure codes recorded by the&#xD;
      hospital, as well as a limited set of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)-4 codes. Within&#xD;
      the database, discharge-level data include information on patient and provider&#xD;
      characteristics, diagnoses and procedures, hospital resource utilization, and charges/cost&#xD;
      data for all entries, including pharmacy charges.&#xD;
