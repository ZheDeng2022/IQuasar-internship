    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the potential contribution of lidocaine&#xD;
      hydrochloride or hydrocortisone acetate, alone or in combination, in topical cream&#xD;
      preparations in the treatment of Grade I or II hemorrhoids and to demonstrate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the test articles when applied twice daily for 14 days in subjects with Grade I&#xD;
      or II hemorrhoids. These products reflect common drug combinations of lidocaine hydrochloride&#xD;
      or hydrocortisone acetate found in many prescription hemorrhoid products.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group comparison study in&#xD;
      approximately 196 enrolled subjects (~28 subjects/test article) at approximately eight (8)&#xD;
      sites. A minimum of 147 patients will be enrolled. Up to an additional 56 subjects (up to 196&#xD;
      subjects) may be enrolled based on enrollment rates and availability of patients. Enrollment&#xD;
      status reports will be periodically generated, and based on enrollment experience, additional&#xD;
      randomization blocks will be assigned to sites with the potential to enroll additional&#xD;
      subjects over a reasonable period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female subjects, ages 18 years and older, with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic&#xD;
      Grade I or Grade II hemorrhoids will be randomized to treatment with one of seven (7) test&#xD;
      articles (1:1 for all groups):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vehicle Cream&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 3% Hydrocortisone Acetate Cream&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 0.5% Hydrocortisone Acetate Cream&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 5% Lidocaine Hydrochloride Cream&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride Cream&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 3% Hydrocortisone Acetate Cream and 5% Lidocaine Hydrochloride Cream&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 0.5% Hydrocortisone Acetate Cream and 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride Cream&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test articles will be applied twice daily for two (2) weeks (14 days) to the peri-rectal&#xD;
      area as well as the distal aspect of the anal canal using the product applicator tip.&#xD;
