  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with dengue viruses is the leading cause of hospitalization and death in children&#xD;
      in many tropical Asian countries, and the development of a dengue vaccine is a top health&#xD;
      priority. This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated&#xD;
      monovalent dengue virus vaccine (rDEN3Δ30) in healthy adults with no history of previous&#xD;
      flavivirus infection.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated&#xD;
      monovalent dengue virus vaccine (rDEN3Δ30) in healthy flavivirus-naive adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the rDEN3Δ30 vaccine or placebo at Day 0.&#xD;
      Study visits will occur on Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, and 180. Visits&#xD;
      will include physical examinations and blood collection. All participants will record their&#xD;
      temperature 3 times a day from Day 0 through Day 16. Some participants may be admitted to the&#xD;
      clinic for an inpatient (overnight) stay during the first 16 days of the study.&#xD;

             review of medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Available for the duration of the study, approximately 26 weeks post-vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and availability for potential inpatient admission in the inpatient unit&#xD;
             following receipt of rDEN3Δ30.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to participate in the study as evidenced by signing the informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females Only: Female subjects of childbearing potential willing to use effective&#xD;
             contraception beginning long enough before dosing to ensure method specific efficacy&#xD;
             for the duration of the trial. Reliable methods of contraception include hormonal&#xD;
             birth control, condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, surgical&#xD;
             sterilization, intrauterine device, and abstinence (greater than or equal to 6 months&#xD;
             since last sexual encounter). All female subjects will be considered having&#xD;
             childbearing potential except for those with hysterectomy, tubal ligation, tubal coil&#xD;
             (at least 3 months prior to vaccination), or post-menopausal status documented as at&#xD;
             least 1 year since last menstrual period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females Only: Currently pregnant, as determined by positive beta-human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (HCG) test, or breastfeeding.&#xD;

             rheumatologic, autoimmune, or renal disease by history, physical examination, and/or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Behavioral, cognitive, or psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;

             value was not due to aberrancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the&#xD;
             safety or rights of a subject participating in the trial or would render the subject&#xD;
