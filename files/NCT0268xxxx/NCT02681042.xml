      The study cohort will consist of up to 50 patients who are candidates for Left Atrial&#xD;
      Appendage (LAA) closure in whom oral anticoagulation is contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects evaluated for left atrial appendage closure will be screened for inclusion and&#xD;
      consented prior to their procedure. If the anatomy is favorable for placement of the Lariat®&#xD;
      device, the procedure will be performed at one of the participating centers. If anatomy is&#xD;
      not favorable, the patient will be excluded from the study and managed using best care&#xD;
      practices by his or her physician.&#xD;

      The study cohort will consist of up to 50 patients who are candidates for LAA closure in whom&#xD;
      oral anticoagulation is contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects evaluated for left atrial appendage closure will be screened for inclusion and&#xD;
      consented prior to their procedure. If the anatomy is favorable for placement of the Lariat®&#xD;
      device, the procedure will be performed at one of the participating centers. If anatomy is&#xD;
      not favorable, the patient will be excluded from the study and managed using best care&#xD;
      practices by his or her physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects consented will be tracked by the study team and will be considered enrolled in this&#xD;
      study at the time of the start of their left atrial appendage closure procedure. All subjects&#xD;
      that are consented who do not undergo left atrial appendage closure with SentreHeart Lariat®&#xD;
      will be considered screen failures. Any patients that have a failed attempt at left atrial&#xD;
      appendage closure with SentreHeart Lariat® will be tracked through their index&#xD;
      hospitalization for safety; their study follow up will be complete at the time of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The invasive procedure for placement of the study devices will proceed according to standard&#xD;
      interventional techniques, as already in place at the participating centers. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing the Lariat® procedure will be administered colchicine 0.6 mg po twice daily for a&#xD;
      minimum of three days preoperatively, and 30 days postoperatively. (This dose may be adjusted&#xD;
      for renal function or intolerance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo follow-up visits at 7 days, 90 days, and 180 days post procedure.&#xD;
