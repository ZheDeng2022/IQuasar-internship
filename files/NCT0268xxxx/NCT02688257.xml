  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with large primary operable breast cancers are offered chemotherapy prior to surgery&#xD;
      to shrink the tumour and enable breast conserving surgery. Conventional assessment of&#xD;
      response to chemotherapy relies on a change in tumour size which does not always correlate&#xD;
      with the change in amount of viable tumour. Newer techniques such as functional MRI,&#xD;
      microbubble and optoacoustic ultrasound offer the potential to detect responses to&#xD;
      chemotherapy by evaluating functional changes in tumour vascularity and oxygenation. Neither&#xD;
      modality utilises ionising radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although MRI is widely used for detecting breast cancer, its ability in assessing functional&#xD;
      responses to chemotherapy prior to surgery has not been fully exploited. Dynamic contrast&#xD;
      enhanced (DCE) MRI has a sensitivity around 90% and provides quantitative measurements of&#xD;
      blood volume and flow. Other functional techniques detect variation in tissue oxygenation:&#xD;
      this is called the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) mechanism. The BOLD technique uses a&#xD;
      special magnetic resonance (MR) sequence called T2* to measure the weakly magnetic effect of&#xD;
      deoxygenated haemoglobin. The investigators wish to develop and validate T2* measurements&#xD;
      which relate to oxygenation of a tumour. The investigators also want to validate other MR&#xD;
      sequences including diffusion weighted (DW) MRI, which quantifies microcirculation of blood&#xD;
      in the capillary network and the diffusion of water within tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbubble ultrasound is an established technique that utilises an intravenous contrast&#xD;
      agent comprising tiny microbubbles of gas that can increase the reflectivity of blood and&#xD;
      enhance spectral and colour Doppler signals obtained from routine ultrasound imaging.&#xD;
      Optoacoustic imaging is new technique where the output signal depends on the oxygenation of&#xD;
      the tissues under study. It utilises a light signal input and measures ultrasound signal&#xD;
      output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to correlate our imaging findings with histopathology after surgical&#xD;
      resection of the tumour.&#xD;
