  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sequential administration of MSCs obtained from adipose tissue is an effective and safe&#xD;
      treatment for acute graft versus host disease refractory to first-line treatment. Furthermore&#xD;
      the infusion of these cells produces a biological pattern in patients that relates to the&#xD;
      clinical response.&#xD;

      Multicenter, open, non -controlled clinical trial. It is a phase I-II trial to assess the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of sequential infusion of allogeneic MSCs from adipose tissue, expanded&#xD;
      &quot;in vitro&quot; platelet lysate in the treatment of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      trasplantation, who have developed a refractory graft versus host disease to first line of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open to patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation in&#xD;
      Spanish hospitals, with one cohort of patients who receive four sequential doses of MSC.&#xD;
