  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research study is to better understand patterns of recovery after Total&#xD;
      Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). The study will evaluate how pain, activity and cognitive (i.e.,&#xD;
      thinking style) responses determine patterns of recovery, and the study will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of gabapentin versus placebo for improving recovery after surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a two-site, longitudinal, double-blind, randomized clinical&#xD;
      intervention study to examine three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Characterize the dynamic pain experience, activity, and cognitive response after TKA&#xD;
      and determine patterns of recovery in these domains&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Test whether gabapentin alters time course of recovery after TKA in a manner dependent&#xD;
      on its interaction with pre-drug pupil diameter and preferred style in the&#xD;
      catastrophizing-optimism dimension&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Test whether gabapentin increases pupil diameter in patients undergoing TKA who are on&#xD;
      high dose opioids preoperatively and to examine whether opioid use moderates the associations&#xD;
      in Aim 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Novel variance beyond established associations in recovery from pain&#xD;
      following TKA surgery is accounted for by the interaction between pupil diameter and&#xD;
      Cognitive-Affective (C-A) state, and this interaction predicts efficacy of gabapentin to&#xD;
      speed recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key secondary hypotheses: Disability, impulsivity, and attentional deficits recover after TKA&#xD;
      surgery follow a log of time pattern, and are predicted by C-A state and its interaction with&#xD;
      pupil diameter. Gabapentin increases resting pupil diameter in patients scheduled for TKA who&#xD;
      are receiving high doses of opioids.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Stress Inventory (DSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, month 2, month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Daily Stress Inventory (DSI) is a self-report measure of minor stressors which is administered daily. One test of the validity of a measure of daily stress is its sensitivity to the difference between the stressors of workdays and those of weekends.&#xD;
Score Range: 0-406 The lower the scores the least amount of stressors occurred. (0=Did not occur, 1= Occurred, but not stressful, 2= Caused very little stress, 3= Caused a little stress, 4= Caused some stress, 5= Caused much stress, 6=Caused very much stress, 7= Caused me to panic)&#xD;
Meaning: 58 item self-report measure that allows a person to indicate events that they have experienced in the past 24 hours. Three daily scores are derived for each individual:&#xD;
the number of events that are endorsed as having occurred (FREQ)&#xD;
the sum of the total of the impact rating of these events (SUM)&#xD;
the average impact rating of the events (AIR; SUM divided by FREQ).</description>

    <measure>Pain Locus of Control (PLOC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, month 2, month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Locus of Control Scale is a 36 item questionnaire that measures an individual's level of internal versus external control of reinforcement. Each of the three subscales/domains: internality; chance; and powerful others consists of 12 items assessing beliefs pertaining to pain. The minimum and maximum possible scores for each of the subscales are 12 and 72.&#xD;
The scale is scored by adding item responses for each of the domains, with the highest domain score representing the dominant PLOC. The subscale categories of powerful others and chance fall under the broad category of external PLOC. An individual has an internal PLOC if they believe their own actions and behaviors have the greatest impact and influence over pain control.</description>

    <measure>Iowa Gambling Task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, month 2, month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Iowa Gambling Task measures risky decision making tendencies or individuals' sensitivity to reward and loss. Net scores for the gambling task are calculated by subtracting the number of disadvantageous choices (decks A and B) from the number of advantageous choices (decks C and D). Higher net scores therefore signify better performance on the task. Possible net score ranges from -100 to 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, month 2, month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task is used to assess perseveration and abstract thinking. The WCST is also considered a measure of executive function because of its reported sensitivity to frontal lobe dysfunction. As such, the WCST allows you to assess strategic planning; organized searching; and ability to utilize environmental feedback to shift cognitive sets, direct behavior toward achieving a goal, and modulate impulsive responding. Score ranges from 0-100% for errors, perseverative responses, perseverative errors nonperseverative errors, and conceptual level responses.</description>
