  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence provided by many observational studies has established a strong link between&#xD;
      decreased sleep duration and poor glucoregulation. Sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality&#xD;
      induce insulin resistance and decrease glucose tolerance in healthy individuals. However, the&#xD;
      influence of poor sleep quality on glycemic control of patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (T1DM) is unknown. Persistent sleep deprivation among patients with T1DM has been reported,&#xD;
      and this sleep loss can be attributed in part to nocturnal hypoglycemia. Nocturnal iatrogenic&#xD;
      hypoglycemia is a limitation of current intensive insulin therapies. Although severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemia is associated with adverse events such as seizures and death, less severe&#xD;
      nocturnal hypoglycemia has been linked to broad range of adverse consequences, both acutely&#xD;
      and long term. Hypoglycemia stimulates the sympathetic nervous system as a stress response,&#xD;
      leading to the stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). This results in&#xD;
      a counter regulatory hormone cascade, which elicits an excessive cortisol secretion, which is&#xD;
      known to cause sleep disturbance and could impair glucose homeostasis after the hypoglycemic&#xD;
      event. The hyperinsulinemia in T1DM patients promotes HPA hyperactivity as well, which is&#xD;
      also associated with impaired sleep quality by leading to sleep fragmentation, decreased slow&#xD;
      wave sleep and shortened sleep duration. Sleep disturbances due to nocturnal hypoglycemia can&#xD;
      exacerbate HPA axis dysfunction, adversely affecting the sleep-wake cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to understand the impact of nocturnal hypoglycemia on sleep.&#xD;

      The study duration is 4 weeks long, during which subjects will undergo a 1 week run-in period&#xD;
      followed by 3 randomized weeks of observational study. During the 1 week run-in period,&#xD;
      subjects will familiarize themselves with the CGM and the other data collection procedures.&#xD;
      Following the run-in week, the subject will be randomized to a specific order of observation&#xD;
      weeks. The three observation weeks are a resistance training week, an aerobic exercise week&#xD;
      and a control week with no explicit exercise. During the observation weeks, there will be 4&#xD;
      interventions planned, two during both the aerobic exercise and the resistance training week.&#xD;
      See Schematic below for details. During both the aerobic exercise week intervention visits,&#xD;
      subjects will exercise for ~45 minutes on a treadmill and during the resistance training&#xD;
      week, subjects will perform strength training exercises for 1-3 sets per exercise at a weight&#xD;
      that can be lifted for 8-12 repetitions (~60-80% of 1-repetition max). The duration of the&#xD;
      resistance training period is expected to be ~45min. Subjects will continue to perform daily&#xD;
      activities during each of the weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each week, the subject will wear one subcutaneous DexcomTM G4 or DexcomTM G4 Share&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, one activity monitor- ActiGraph wGT3X-BT or&#xD;
      ActiGraph GT9X, one insulin pump (subject's own pump) and one Samsung Galaxy S4 phone loaded&#xD;
      with two applications- meal memory and moves. The CGM system will provide sensed glucose data&#xD;
      every 5 minutes. The CGM data will be blinded to the patient to prevent any abrupt changes in&#xD;
      behavior. The accuracy of the sensed data will be obtained by reference measurements of&#xD;
      capillary blood glucose. The activity monitor will be secured on the dominant wrist and uses&#xD;
      an accelerometer to collect movement data at a high frequency (80Hz). The activity monitor&#xD;
      measures both motion and ambient light, this data would be used to determine the various&#xD;
      sleep quality measures. The subject's insulin dosage information from the pump will be&#xD;
      downloaded for data analysis purposes. The subject's daily meal intake (photographic log and&#xD;
      note diary) and daily movement pattern information will be downloaded from the phone. During&#xD;
      the 4 exercise intervention visits, subject's heart rate, accelerometry information from the&#xD;
      torso and oxygen consumption measured breath by breath may be collected for data analysis&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
