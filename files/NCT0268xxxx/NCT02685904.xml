  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENIA11 in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. The study&#xD;
      period for each patient will be 27 weeks, during which the patient will undergo screening for&#xD;
      up to 21 days, and followed by treatment of 24 weeks and follow up period of 2 weeks. Each&#xD;
      patient will be required to make a total of 9 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After re-confirming the eligibility of patients at Visit 2, eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either treatment group or control group in a 2:1 ratio. In addition,&#xD;
      patients in the treatment group will receive ENIA11 25 mg twice weekly by subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection while patients in the control group will receive placebo solution twice weekly by&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection from Day 0 to week 12 and then switch to active drug from week 12 to&#xD;
      week 24 and follow up period of 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy analysis, including ASAS response measures, ASAS5/6, ASDAS, BASDAS, BASFI, BASMI&#xD;
      and individual measures of disease activity, such as numbers of swollen and tender joints,&#xD;
      ESR and CRP, will be evaluated at each visit from Visit 2 (baseline) to Visit 9. Safety will&#xD;
      be evaluated according to the frequency of adverse events, vital signs, physical examination,&#xD;
      laboratory abnormalities, and ENIA11 antibody formation.&#xD;
