  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is common and particularly outpatients may experience unsatisfactory pain&#xD;
      relief. This randomized, double-blind, crossover study of postoperative pain in outpatients&#xD;
      undergoing split-mouth, third lower molar extraction aims to examine whether or not the&#xD;
      combination of metamizole and ibuprofen is superior to either drug alone.&#xD;
