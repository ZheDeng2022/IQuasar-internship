      Clinical and genetic assessment of treatment response in patients with age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration using intravitreal aflibercept injection. This study seeks to determine if&#xD;
      different genetic polymorphisms of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and HtrA&#xD;
      serine peptidase 1(HTRA1) and other genes correlate to the response to intravitreal&#xD;
      aflibercept injection therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint in the study is the correlation of CFH, HTRA1, VEGFA, C3, TIMP3, APOE, CETP, LIPC, TGFBR1, CFI, and CFB allele frequencies and VEGA expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines with response to intravitreal aflibercept injection treatment, based on anatomic outcomes:&#xD;
Early response (at Month 3) - o On optical coherence tomography(SD-OCT)&#xD;
Reduction in central retinal thickness by ≥ 50%, OR&#xD;
Central retinal thickness &lt;300 um, OR&#xD;
Absence of retinal fluid&#xD;
Later response (at Month 12) -&#xD;
o On SD-OCT&#xD;
Reduction in central retinal thickness by ≥ 50%, OR&#xD;
Central retinal thickness &lt; 300 um, OR&#xD;
Absence of retinal fluid&#xD;
Poor response, defined as no reduction of fluid or central retinal thickness at Month 12.</description>

With visual outcomes -&#xD;
Early response, defined as a gain ≥ 0 letters at Month 3&#xD;
Later response, defined as a gain ≥ 0 letters at Month 12&#xD;

With change in characteristics on fluorescein angiography and fundus photography (lesion size, lesion type, etc)&#xD;
With number of injections through Month 12&#xD;
o Mean number of intravitreal aflibercept injections required through Month 12 will be calculated for the group overall, and separately by response group (early, later, and no response to treatment).</description>

          4. Provide signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous therapy in study eye for AMD or other retinal disease which may be used in&#xD;
             the treatment of AMD&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previous subfoveal focal laser photocoagulation involving the foveal center in the&#xD;
             study eye&#xD;

             glaucoma) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could either 4.1 require medical&#xD;
             or surgical intervention during the study period to prevent or treat visual loss that&#xD;
             might result from that condition, or 4.2 if allowed to progress untreated, could&#xD;
             likely contribute to loss of at least 2 Snellen equivalent lines of best corrected&#xD;
             visual acuity over the study period&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to&#xD;
             the patient if the investigational therapy were initiated *Contraception is not&#xD;
             required for men with documented vasectomy. **Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic&#xD;
