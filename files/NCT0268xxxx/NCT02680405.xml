  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is a skin disorder with an itchy, red skin rash. This may be because&#xD;
      certain proteins are increased in the skin of AD patients. The increased expression of these&#xD;
      proteins play an important role in the development of AD and may increase the risk for&#xD;
      persons with AD to get skin infections and allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are very few non-invasive ways to diagnose and monitor the development and progression&#xD;
      of atopic dermatitis. The goal of this study is to develop laboratory tests, done on skin&#xD;
      samples collected by tapy stripping, that can be used for early detection and monitoring the&#xD;
      response to treatment for a variety of skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a highly pruritic, chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects&#xD;
      up to 25% of children and 10% of adults. Atopic skin disease is associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity as well as physical, psychological, and economical quality-of-life impairment. The&#xD;
      economical impact of AD and the requirement for family support can be extraordinary and may&#xD;
      be greater than what is typically found for asthma and type I diabetes, respectively. In many&#xD;
      patients, the early onset of AD is the first clinical manifestation of allergic disease and&#xD;
      often triggers the atopic march, the subsequent development of food allergy, allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis, and asthma. The skin of AD patients is characterized by an increased Th2 axis,&#xD;
      cellular infiltration and significant epithelial inflammation. These factors permit increased&#xD;
      penetration of invading allergens and pathogens that further drive AD pathogenesis and&#xD;
      pruritus (itch). Approximately 90% of AD patients are colonized with S. aureus, while only 5&#xD;
      - 30% of non-atopic individuals are colonized. Novel therapeutic approaches are currently in&#xD;
      clinical trials which provide the opportunity to target pathways integral to AD disease&#xD;
      pathogenesis. In recent years, it has been shown that AD is more heterogeneous than initially&#xD;
      perceived. Since novel therapeutics target different pathways, one therapeutic approach may&#xD;
      not work for all AD patients and each therapy may provide a different level of clinical&#xD;
      benefit. Additionally, since AD manifests primarily in the skin, blood collection and&#xD;
      analysis may not be the most indicative measurement to determine which therapy is best for&#xD;
      each patient. Despite improved understanding of AD, validated methods to non-invasively&#xD;
      diagnose and monitor the development or progression of AD are sorely lacking. Additionally, a&#xD;
      non-invasive method is needed to understand inflammation at the site of disease manifestation&#xD;
      and potentially identify which biological pathways are most relevant for a given patient.&#xD;
      This will allow a more personalized approach to treatment of patients with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator has hypothesized that skin proteins are differentially expressed in the&#xD;
      upper layers of disease versus non-disease skin tissue and that these may be used as&#xD;
      biomarkers for skin changes linked to the development of AD. Previously a method for&#xD;
      comparing expression of skin proteins by extracting proteins from tape strips and evaluating&#xD;
      differences using mass spectrometry-based proteomics was developed. This non-invasive method&#xD;
      is suitable for use in all AD patients and has been used to show an increase in specific skin&#xD;
      proteins in AD patients versus normal controls. Despite this success, additional studies are&#xD;
      needed to compare gene and protein expression obtained from tape strips with genomic and&#xD;
      proteomic profiles from full thickness skin and whole blood. This proposed study will&#xD;
      determine the validity of using non-invasive tape stripping, as a surrogate for skin biopsy&#xD;
      and whole blood collection, to identify the inflammatory pathway most up-regulated in a given&#xD;
      AD patient. This information will be used in defining biomarkers that will facilitate&#xD;
      personalized medicine approaches using emerging novel therapeutics.&#xD;
