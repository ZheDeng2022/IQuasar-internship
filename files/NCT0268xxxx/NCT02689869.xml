      Primary Objectives The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      chemotherapy-free combination of ibrutinib and obinutuzumab (GA 101) in patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) and a high tumor burden. Primary endpoint to be&#xD;
      observed for this is the rate of progression free survival one year after start of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The hypothesis of the study is that ibrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab&#xD;
      will achieve response rates (CR and PR), rates of MRD negativity and PFS which are comparable&#xD;
      to currently used standard rituximab-chemotherapy combinations such as R-CHOP or&#xD;
      R-bendamustine in subjects with previously untreated FL and a high tumor burden.&#xD;

      OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective, multicenter phase 2 study in up to 98&#xD;
      subjects with previously untreated FL and a high tumor burden in advanced stages and in need&#xD;
      of therapy. The study will include a central monitoring of MRD by PCR, a central pathologic&#xD;
      review and complimentary research projects including monitoring of immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study therapy comprises an initial 6 cycles of ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab followed by an&#xD;
      additional 24 months of ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients being MRD negative at 30 months, i.e. at the end of ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab&#xD;
      maintenance, and without clinical progression no further treatment is given while MRD&#xD;
      monitoring is continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRD monitoring will be regularly performed on peripheral blood samples collected before the&#xD;
      start of therapy and at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 30 respectively. Subsequently, MRD&#xD;
      analyses will be performed every 6 months until clinical progression of the disease or for a&#xD;
      maximum of 4 years (until the end of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If MRD assessment on peripheral blood samples turns from positive to negative within the&#xD;
      first 30 months, confirmatory blood and bone marrow samples should be taken 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients remaining MRD positive at 30 months without clinical progression, single agent&#xD;
      ibrutinib therapy is continued for another 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be formed and constituted. The&#xD;
      independent DMC will review the safety of the treatment and make recommendations as to the&#xD;
      further conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data generated by this phase II study should serve as the basis for a subsequent&#xD;
      randomized phase III study comparing the chemotherapy-free combination of ibrutinib plus&#xD;
      obinutuzumab with standard immune-chemotherapy.&#xD;
