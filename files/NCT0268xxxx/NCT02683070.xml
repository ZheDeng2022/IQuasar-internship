  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) is not uncommon in male patients under general&#xD;
      anesthesia, and it may cause patient agitation and exacerbated postoperative pain. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators will enroll male patients undergoing elective prostate surgery with&#xD;
      urinary catheterization after anesthetic induction, and compare the efficacy of pudendal&#xD;
      nerve block (PNB) and intravenous tramadol in prevention of CRBD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PNB trial is an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized controlled trial that&#xD;
      will test the superiority of pudendal nerve block with 0.33% ropivacaine to intravenous&#xD;
      tramadol 1.5mg/kg for CRBD prevention. A total of 94 patients undergoing elective prostate&#xD;
      surgery at lithotomy position with urinary catheterization (16 G Fr Foley catheter) after&#xD;
      anesthetic induction under general anesthesia will be enrolled at West China Hospital of&#xD;
      Sichuan University. Patients will be divided randomly into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PNB group: patients will be given bilateral pudendal nerve block with 30ml of 0.33%&#xD;
      ropivacaine (15ml for each side) after the completion of surgery before extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TRAM group: patients will be given tramadol of 1.5mg/kg after the completion of surgery&#xD;
      before extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated by a research nurse who were blinded to the group assignments&#xD;
      for outcomes at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6h after patients' arrival in PACU, and after extraction of&#xD;
      urinary catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the incidence of postoperative CRBD. The secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      the severity of postoperative CRBD, postoperative tramadol requirement and number of patients&#xD;
      with requiring postoperative tramadol, numeric rating scale (NRS) for postoperative pain,&#xD;
      postoperative sufentanil requirement and number of patients with requiring postoperative&#xD;
      sufentanil, postoperative side effects, and acceptance of indwelling urinary catheter after&#xD;
      extraction of the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Analyses&#xD;
      are performed with the use of SPSS 18.0 software. The Student-t test is used to analyze&#xD;
      demographic data in the two groups. The incidence of CRBD and side effects between groups are&#xD;
      analyzed by Chi-square test, whereas the severity of CRBD (mild, moderate, and severe) is&#xD;
      analyzed by Fisher's exact test. NRS scale is analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;
      Postoperative tramadol and sufentanil requirement is analyzed by Z test, and the number of&#xD;
      patients requiring tramadol for CRBD rescue treatment and sufentanil for postoperative pain&#xD;
      will be analyzed with Fisher's exact test. A P value&lt;0.05 is considered significant.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>It's assessed according to the following scaling system: no CRBD indicates that there are no complaints of CRBD at all; mild indicates that complaints of CRBD exist only if the patient was asked about it; moderate indicates that patients complain of CRBD spontaneously; and severe indicates that CRBD causes a spontaneous behavioral response such as flailing limb, strong vocal response, or attempt to pull out the catheter.</description>

    <measure>Postoperative tramadol requirement</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>When moderate or severe CRBD is reported, intravenous tramadol 1.5mg/kg will be administered as a rescue treatment to reduce the bladder discomfort, and tramadol requirement will be recorded and compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric rating scale (NRS) for postoperative pain.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked for evaluating pain intensity by themselves using this single 11-point numeric scale ranged between 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; [17]. If the patient complains about pain with NRS greater than 4, intravenous sufentanil 5 μg will be administered as rescue analgetic treatment.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to answer the question &quot;Will you worry about urinary catheterization if you undergo another operation next time?&quot;. The answer &quot;No&quot; meant acceptance of indwelling urinary catheter, and the answer &quot;Yes&quot; meant unacceptance of indwelling urinary catheter.</description>
