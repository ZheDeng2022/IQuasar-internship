      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common condition that still lacks a reliable, objective&#xD;
      screening test. Many anatomical aspects of the syndrome have been studied including the&#xD;
      dimensions of the carpal tunnel and shape of the nerve within the tunnel. The investigators&#xD;
      have observed varying amounts of muscle overlying the carpal tunnel in patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery for the condition. Assuming that this muscle may have a dynamic role in the&#xD;
      development of the condition, the investigators attempted to quantify this muscle using&#xD;
      ultrasound (US).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to devise a technique to evaluate the amount of muscle&#xD;
      overlying the carpal tunnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that patients with carpal tunnel syndrome will have significantly more&#xD;
      muscle overlying the carpal tunnel than individuals without carpal tunnel syndrome.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is in all probability multifactorial&#xD;
      including many parameters that ultimately increase the pressure within the carpal tunnel. It&#xD;
      is likely that the increased pressure then causes injury to the median nerve and the signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of CTS. The relationship between the size or dimensions of the hand and the&#xD;
      occurrence of CTS has been evaluated and &quot;square-shaped&quot; hands have also been examined to&#xD;
      determine if there is an increased tendency to develop CTS. The literature remains&#xD;
      inconclusive at this time. Other static anatomical parameters that have been evaluated&#xD;
      include the size of the carpal tunnel and the thickness and biomechanical properties of the&#xD;
      transverse carpal ligament again without absolute consensus in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional studies have evaluated the role of the intrinsic musculature within and&#xD;
      surrounding the carpal tunnel in the etiology of CTS. Most of these studies have evaluated&#xD;
      the muscles as space occupying lesions that add to the pressure within the carpal tunnel. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that some of the muscles described, specifically those that are found&#xD;
      within the transverse carpal ligament and that cross the area of the carpal tunnel, actually&#xD;
      have a dynamic role in the etiology of CTS, especially in manual laborers that use their&#xD;
      hands in a forceful manner in a repetitive fashion. It is also possible that this anatomic&#xD;
      variant (muscles crossing the area of the carpal tunnel) is related to the &quot;square &quot;hand&#xD;
      configuration and that this dynamic contribution to the pressure within the carpal tunnel is&#xD;
      the reason for the increased incidence of CTS in these patients. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to quantify the amount of muscle crossing the area of the carpal tunnel in normal individuals&#xD;
      and to compare it to the amount of muscle in the wrists of patients with CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participants with CTS will have more muscle crossing the carpal tunnel that&#xD;
      normal controls (without CTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To compare the amount of muscle crossing the carpal tunnel in normal controls&#xD;
      (without CTS) and in patients with CTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a system to quantify the amount of muscle crossing the carpal tunnel area&#xD;
           using ultrasound of the wrist area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare this measurement in normal wrists and in wrists with CTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the measurements in the CTS patients to intraoperative evaluation of the&#xD;
           amount of muscle crossing the carpal tunnel area .&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare these measurements to the external measurements of the hand (palm width/palm&#xD;
           length)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty participants will be recruited for the study. Twenty five participants with no CTS- and&#xD;
      twenty five with CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTS group inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of CTS will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Signs and symptoms of CTS: nighttime numbness and tingling or numbness and tingling in a&#xD;
           median nerve distribution with a positive phalen or tinel or forearm compression test&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A nerve conduction test and electromyography (NCT and EMG) that is positive for CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants without CTS inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Individuals that do not have any signs and or symptoms of CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individuals that have a known history of peripheral neuropathy or other condition in the&#xD;
           hand including recent significant trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with incomplete or unclear evaluation and tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Individuals unwilling to sign a consent form to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that meet the inclusion criteria and that are sent for carpal tunnel release surgery&#xD;
      will be consented and examined on the day of surgery. Their US results, external palmar&#xD;
      measurements as well as the amount of overlying muscle will be recorded as well as&#xD;
      demographic data. Demographic information, occupational history, history of hand diagnoses&#xD;
      and procedures as well as history pertinent to CTS (nighttime numbness and tingling, pain,&#xD;
      perceived pinch weakness, and duration of symptoms) will be collected. Results of nerve&#xD;
      conduction testing (NCT) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination findings pertinent to CTS will be collected including pinch strength,&#xD;
      grip strength, 2-point discrimination, and the hand measurements of palm width (PW), palm&#xD;
      length (PL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      External measurements: PL is measured as the vertical length from the midline of the distal&#xD;
      wrist crease to the proximal middle finger. PW is measured as the horizontal length from the&#xD;
      base of the 1st metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint along the proximal palmar crease.&#xD;
