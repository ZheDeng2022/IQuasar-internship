  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, chest clinical study with a single&#xD;
      study site. Forty subjects will receive fractionated CO2 laser resurfacing of the chest. .&#xD;
      Immediately following the procedure (Day 0), postoperative gel randomized to the chest&#xD;
      (TR-987 or placebo), will be applied with a thickness of 1-2 mm by a non-blinded coordinator,&#xD;
      along with a split-chest Silon TSR bandage. Subjects will return for follow up on Day 1, with&#xD;
      the gel and split chest Silon TSR© bandages applied by non-blinded coordinator during visit,&#xD;
      with further follow-up on Days 6, 8, 10, 13 and 28. Both subjects and evaluating investigator&#xD;
      will be blinded to randomization schedule (performed by an unblinded coordinator). Subject&#xD;
      will apply gels and split chest Silon TSR© bandages at home on Days 2, 3 and 4 when not&#xD;
      visiting clinic.&#xD;
