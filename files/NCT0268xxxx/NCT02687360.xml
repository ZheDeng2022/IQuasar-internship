  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is highly prevalent in patients with opioid use disorder on methadone&#xD;
      maintenance therapy, and associated with problems related to psychosocial functioning,&#xD;
      medical and psychiatric health, and substance craving and use. Neuroimaging has strongly&#xD;
      correlated pain processing with the medial prefrontal and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices.&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (rTMS) using the H7 coil targeting these same brain areas for the treatment of chronic pain&#xD;
      in patients on methadone maintenance therapy,and magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy&#xD;
      (MRI/MRS) will be used to evaluate target engagement and mechanism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research aims of this study are to (1) investigate the efficacy of repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex for the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain in participants with opioid use&#xD;
      disorder on methadone-maintenance therapy, and (2) investigate target engagement by measuring&#xD;
      changes in gray matter volume and glutamate-glutamine in these brain regions by magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Given the high incidence of chronic pain in the OUD&#xD;
      population and specifically the methadone-maintained population, there is great need for&#xD;
      effective treatments. Untreated chronic pain contributes to medical and psychiatric problems,&#xD;
      reduced quality of life, and increased risk of substance use and overdose. Non-invasive&#xD;
      neuromodulation like rTMS, which is currently FDA-approved for treatment-resistant depression&#xD;
      and OCD, holds promise as a safe and effective therapeutic. This project will investigate&#xD;
      rTMS of brain regions known to process the affective and cognitive components of chronic&#xD;
      pain, utilizing a treatment protocol modeled after the FDA-approved protocol for&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be randomized in a double-blind manner to 25 sessions (5 weeks) of either&#xD;
      active high-frequency rTMS or sham stimulation. Participants will regularly complete measures&#xD;
      to evaluate changes in pain severity and interference. The primary clinical outcome measures&#xD;
      will be pain severity and interference scores on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will undergo MRI/MRS scans before and after the 5 weeks of rTMS to&#xD;
      evaluate target engagement and help elucidate the potential mechanism of action of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
