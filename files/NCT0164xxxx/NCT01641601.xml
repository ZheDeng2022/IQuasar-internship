  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study evaluating the impact of pre-hospital cervical ripening with a&#xD;
      transcervical Foley balloon before labor induction in full-term pregnancies on the length of&#xD;
      inpatient labor induction and maternal satisfaction with the labor induction process. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that women who receive pre-hospital cervical ripening will have a&#xD;
      shorter duration of inpatient labor induction as compared to women without pre-hospital&#xD;
      cervical ripening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Labor induction is a common procedure among pregnant patients at term. This process involves&#xD;
      a period of cervical preparation (&quot;ripening&quot;) for women who have an &quot;unfavorable&quot; cervical&#xD;
      examination at the time labor induction is scheduled. Cervical ripening may take place with&#xD;
      pharmacologic or mechanical strategies, which at this time are traditionally administered on&#xD;
      an inpatient basis. This process can 24 or more hours, resulting in a lengthy hospitalization&#xD;
      with the associated costs and frustrations for both patients and L&amp;D staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a randomized, controlled trial to explore the following research&#xD;
      question: Among women with full-term pregnancies requiring labor induction, does&#xD;
      pre-hospital, outpatient cervical ripening reduce the amount of inpatient time needed to&#xD;
      achieve delivery as compared to no pre-hospital cervical ripening? As a secondary objective,&#xD;
      we also wish to explore if outpatient cervical ripening is acceptable to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve randomizing eligible and consenting women who have been scheduled for&#xD;
      labor induction by their obstetrical providers into a pre-hospital cervical ripening&#xD;
      (intervention) group or a no pre-hospital ripening (control) group. A trans-cervical Foley&#xD;
      balloon (TCFB) will be used for outpatient pre-hospital cervical ripening in women randomized&#xD;
      to the intervention group. No pre-hospital ripening will be performed for women in the&#xD;
      control group. Both groups will be admitted for induction as scheduled and will undergo labor&#xD;
      induction according to a specified, Bishop-score based induction protocol, which may or may&#xD;
      not include a TCFB. We will compare the duration of inpatient stays from admission until&#xD;
      delivery between the groups as well as satisfaction with the pre-hospital period and labor&#xD;
      and delivery experience. Maternal and neonatal outcomes will also be compared between the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
