  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to find the highest tolerable dose of crizotinib and dasatinib given&#xD;
      in combination to patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and other types of&#xD;
      high grade gliomas (HGG). Participants will receive escalating doses until the highest dose&#xD;
      is determined. Participants will be enrolled in two strata: stratum A for recurrent/&#xD;
      progressive tumors and stratum B for recently diagnosed patients who have completed standard&#xD;
      radiation therapy without progressive disease. Up to 7 dosage levels will be tested. Both&#xD;
      drugs are taken orally daily, once per day. Correlative pharmacokinetic and biology studies&#xD;
      are planned, as well as advanced methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Rolling 6 design will be used to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and determine&#xD;
      the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of the combination of escalating doses of crizotinib and&#xD;
      dasatinib. Our goal is to accrue research participants for both stratum A and B. However, it&#xD;
      is our expectation that the accrual of research participants to stratum B will proceed at a&#xD;
      slower pace. Therefore, initially the strategy of dose escalation will be exclusively based&#xD;
      on research participants treated at stratum A until the MTD of this combination is reached.&#xD;
      Until the MTD of this combination is reached for research participants in stratum A, accrual&#xD;
      of research participants in stratum B will be allowed at the highest dosage level which has&#xD;
      already been deemed to be safe (i.e., no DLTs in three research participants or ≤ 1 DLT in&#xD;
      six research participants). No research participants will be accrued to stratum B until at&#xD;
      least one dosage level has been confirmed to be safe in stratum A. Once the MTD for stratum A&#xD;
      is reached, we will accrue research participants at this same dosage level to stratum B&#xD;
      following the rules of the Rolling 6 design. If the MTD for stratum A is well tolerated among&#xD;
      research participants in stratum B, we will proceed with dose escalation for research&#xD;
      participants in stratum B based on the same rules of the Rolling 6 design. This strategy is&#xD;
      based on the premise that research participants who are more heavily pre-treated (stratum A)&#xD;
      may not tolerate therapy as well as those with minimal previous treatment (stratum B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the MTD of the combination of crizotinib (c-Met and ALK inhibitor) and&#xD;
           dasatinib (bcr-abl, PDGFRA and B, src, lck, yes, and c-kit inhibitor) in pediatric&#xD;
           research participants with recurrent or progressive DIPG and other HGGs (stratum A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the MTD of the combination of crizotinib and dasatinib in research&#xD;
           participants with DIPG or HGG who completed RT within a short interval prior to&#xD;
           enrollment but have not experienced disease progression (stratum B).&#xD;
