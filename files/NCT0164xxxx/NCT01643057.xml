  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore physiological interventions and biomarkers for Apnea&#xD;
      of Prematurity in newborn infants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apnea of prematurity is defined as cessation of breathing that lasts for more than 20 seconds&#xD;
      and/or is accompanied by oxygen desaturation or a decrease in heart rate (bradycardia).&#xD;
      Because apnea presents itself within a variety of diseases in newborns, its diagnosis is&#xD;
      based largely on the exclusion of other findings. The difficulty in relating the&#xD;
      manifestation of apnea to its cause can lead to issues regarding appropriate medical&#xD;
      management and delays in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our exploration of physiological interventions for Apnea of Prematurity begins with&#xD;
      stochastic resonance. Stochastic resonance is the introduction of noise to a system, to alter&#xD;
      the system's behavior. This technology has been examined in previous medical applications.&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this work is that stochastic resonance stimulation, in the form of gentle&#xD;
      vibrations, will stabilize immature breathing patterns in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, we will use an apnea mattress developed by engineers at the Wyss&#xD;
      Institute, Harvard University, which provides gentle vibrations to the infant. We will&#xD;
      closely follow the research protocol from UMass Medical School. Whilst the infant is on the&#xD;
      mattress, clinical care data will be collected to determine effect on breathing patterns. We&#xD;
      also hope to collect enough baseline and intervention data signals to be able to identify&#xD;
      candidate biomarkers for apnea. This will assist in development of predictive algorithms for&#xD;
      apnea in infants.&#xD;
