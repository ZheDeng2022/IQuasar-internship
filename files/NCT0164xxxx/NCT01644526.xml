  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to selectively control blood flow through an arteriovenous (AV) graft only when&#xD;
      it is needed for dialysis may reduce the current repetitive complications such as thrombosis,&#xD;
      venous hypertension post-dialysis bleeding, and blood steal from the extremities. The&#xD;
      Hemoaccess Valve System (HVS) allows an AV graft to be turned on to blood flow when it is&#xD;
      needed for dialysis then when dialysis is concluded, the device shuts off arterial blood flow&#xD;
      and residual blood in the graft is flushed back into the body, using the dialysis blood&#xD;
      lines. Once the graft is cleared of blood, the venous valve is then closed. Heparinized&#xD;
      sterile saline reside in the graft between dialysis sessions. By having only saline in the&#xD;
      graft and restoring normal blood flow to the artery and vein, it is believed that this will&#xD;
      dramatically reduce the current complications associated with now having blood diverted&#xD;
      through the graft 24/7.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Hemoaccess Valve System (HVS) is a subcutaneous valve device that is implanted when a new&#xD;
      AV graft is placed. A saline pump delivers fluid to the arterial balloon valve and closes&#xD;
      that end of the graft off to blood flow. Using the dialysis blood lines, saline flushes&#xD;
      residual blood from the graft back into the body. Then the venous balloon valve closes and&#xD;
      heparinized saline resides in the graft between dialysis sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient returns for dialysis, the dialysis technician deflates the valves and allows&#xD;
      blood to flow to the graft for dialysis. (The saline inside the graft simply enters the blood&#xD;
      stream.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      By only having saline inside the AV graft between dialysis sessions, there is no&#xD;
      post-dialysis bleeding where the dialysis needles were cannulated, and because blood flow is&#xD;
      restored to its normal course in the vein and artery, the traditional turbulent blood flow&#xD;
      through the graft is eliminated, reducing the traditional complications caused when arterial&#xD;
      blood is diverted through the graft then into the vein.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if the ability to limit blood flow to an AV graft only when it is needed for dialysis will increase unassisted patency rate of the test arm by a minimum of 50%. The New England Journal of Medicine study, &quot;Effect of Dipyridamole plus Aspirin on Hemodialysis Graft Patency&quot; (NEJM 360;21, 5/21/09) indicated a 1 year unassisted patency rate of 23% (77% required intervention). Our objective is to determine if the intervention rate can be reduced to 38-39% during the study, a 50% reduction in the expected intervention rate.</description>

    <measure>Eliminate Post-Dialysis Needle Site Bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome measure: Reduce post-dialysis needle site bleeding by 95%.&#xD;
Currently most dialysis patients experience mild to severe post-dialysis bleeding when the large (15 gauge) dialysis needles are removed from their AV graft. The HVS device shuts off blood flow to the graft after dialysis therefore no post-dialysis bleeding should be experienced.</description>
