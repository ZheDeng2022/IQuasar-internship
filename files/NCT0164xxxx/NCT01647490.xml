  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a long-term, prospective, and controlled evaluation of the mechanical&#xD;
      dyssynchrony induced by right ventricular apical pacing, both in acute (spontaneous and&#xD;
      stimulated) and chronic (12 and 24 months); the study also evaluates the benefit of an&#xD;
      alternative pacing site through measures of dyssynchrony in acute and chronic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Permanent cardiac pacing plays an important role in cardiac disease management. Since early&#xD;
      studies on right ventricular pacing, apex has been the preferred implant site for transvenous&#xD;
      endocardial ventricular leads for several reasons: ease of placement, lead stability as well&#xD;
      as the design characteristics of the electrode and the fixation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now also accepted, however, that right ventricle pacing causes a long term&#xD;
      deterioration of left ventricular function through complex effects, both at the structural&#xD;
      level of the heart wall and at the hemodynamic level in left ventricular load conditions. It&#xD;
      is possible that this deterioration is due to a dyssynchrony of contraction induced by pacing&#xD;
      at the right ventricular apex. Some authors suggest to pace the right ventricle at&#xD;
      alternative sites, i.e. the medium septum (RVS) region, to guarantee a more physiological&#xD;
      activation pattern, especially in patients expected to receive high pacing percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, unequivocal evidences that stimulation of the right ventricular septum is more&#xD;
      physiological than the apical pacing are still missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, it should be noted that, although a number of studies refer to RV septum as the&#xD;
      alternative site for pacing , poor attention has been paid to the unambiguous definition of&#xD;
      RV septum region itself. A clear definition and a proper evaluation of the alternative site&#xD;
      is therefore important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, from a procedural point of view, it has been demonstrated that acute and chronic&#xD;
      electrical performances of the leads positioned at alternative sites, in particular in the&#xD;
      region of mid septum, are equivalent to those of the leads positioned at the apical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to perform a comprehensive assessment of the electrical and&#xD;
      mechanical measures obtained by pacing standard RV site (Right ventricular apex, RVA) and&#xD;
      alternative RV site (right ventricular septum, RVS). Specifically, the two pacing sites will&#xD;
      be compared in terms of electrical dyssynchrony, as assessed by ECG criteria, and in terms of&#xD;
      mechanical dyssynchrony, as assessed by echocardiographic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point of the study is defined through the evaluation of dyssynchrony measured&#xD;
      both in spontaneous rhythm (Vs) and paced rhythm (Vp). The delay between the time to peak&#xD;
      systolic velocity of the septum and the LV free wall will be used to define the degree of&#xD;
      dyssynchrony; this measurement will be obtained by TDI echocardiographic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive any commercially available dual-chamber implantable pacemakers,&#xD;
      according to current standard indications. At the end of the implantation and at follow-up&#xD;
      visits (12 and 24 months) device programming will follow the clinical practice of the center.&#xD;
