  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this work will first to characterize in typical childhood, visual&#xD;
      exploratory behavior and pupillary response associated with salience of human social stimuli&#xD;
      (faces and body movements), and then to evaluate these markers in children with autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective of this work will be to achieve in a population of children with autism&#xD;
      a longitudinal evaluation of these markers during development and therapeutics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with autism have significant social difficulties and communication alterations. It&#xD;
      has been shown in these patients difficulties to understand some clues indispensable to&#xD;
      social relations, for example, faces and their emotions and motion of human bodies. The faces&#xD;
      and human movements are an important source of information helping to interact with others.&#xD;
      Understanding the intentions of the others through facial expressions and gestures can help&#xD;
      them to adapt their behavior and their interactions. While in healthy subjects, faces and&#xD;
      human movements receive special attention, autistic patients seem to pay less attention to&#xD;
      this kind of social stimuli. It has already been shown that children and healthy adults spend&#xD;
      more time looking at faces and human movements (relative to objects), whereas the opposite&#xD;
      behavior is observed in patients with autism. Studying gaze behavior seems to be essential&#xD;
      for progress in the understanding of autism pathology. Eye-tracking systems allow to measure&#xD;
      precisely what a subject looks on a picture. Moreover, eye-tracking systems permit the&#xD;
      measurement of the pupil size which variations are correlated with cognitive processes. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to analyze the ocular behavior (ocular scan path and pupil&#xD;
      diameter) of young patients with autism when viewing faces and human movements and to compare&#xD;
      these measurements with those of chronologically age-matched healthy children. This work will&#xD;
      identify attentional problems concerning exploration of human faces and movements that can be&#xD;
      related to their social difficulties. These disorders should be manifested by an atypical&#xD;
      ocular scan path and by changes in pupil variation in response to face and human motion. Then&#xD;
      to follow the evolution of these indices will allow to evaluate the effect of therapies.&#xD;
      These results will highlight new data essential to understanding disorders of social&#xD;
      relations and to better adapt rehabilitative strategies.&#xD;
