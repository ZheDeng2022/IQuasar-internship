      The objective of the trial is to provide regorafenib to subjects diagnosed with metastatic&#xD;
      and / or unresectable GIST who have progressed after standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected additional safety information on regorafenib will be collected and progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) will be estimated.&#xD;
