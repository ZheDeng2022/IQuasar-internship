  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimal anticoagulation is mandatory during CPB in order to avoid hemostatic system&#xD;
      activation. Platelet dysfunction is commonly observed after procedures performed under&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This is associated with a major risk of thrombosis and bleeding&#xD;
      in the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coating of the surface has been shown to diminish these effects.Biocompatible surfaces,&#xD;
      extracorporeal circulation technologies mimic critical characteristics of the vascular&#xD;
      endothelium to provide thromboresistance and enhanced blood compatibility. Recently, a new&#xD;
      physiologic non heparin coating with different functional aspects was developed as an&#xD;
      alternative to heparin based biological coatings. This bio-passive Hydrophilic Polymer&#xD;
      Coating Without Heparin (BalanceTM Bio-Passive surface) and pediatric oxygenation system&#xD;
      (Affinity PixieTM Oxygenation System), is designed to mimic the natural interfaces of blood.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the influence of a Balance - coated CPB system in&#xD;
      pediatric use versus the Carmeda TM heparin-coated system in platelet function preservation&#xD;
      and hemostatic activation.&#xD;

      Platelet dysfunction is commonly observed after procedures performed under cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass (CPB). This is associated with a major risk of thrombosis and bleeding in the&#xD;
      postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coating of the surface has been shown to diminish these effects. Since the coagulation system&#xD;
      and platelets are involved in the blood activation process, a coating might be a valuable&#xD;
      approach to inhibit the different reactions. Improving the biocompatibility of the system by&#xD;
      reduction of contact activation of blood elements is of significant importance, especially&#xD;
      for neonates and infants who are more susceptible to the deleterious effects of&#xD;
      extracorporeal circulation (ECC). Biocompatible surfaces extracorporeal circulation&#xD;
      technologies mimic critical characteristics of the vascular endothelium to provide&#xD;
      thromboresistance and enhanced blood compatibility. These biocompatible surfaces mitigate the&#xD;
      foreign body response that occurs when blood comes in contact with non- endothelial surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new physiologic non heparin coating with different functional aspects was&#xD;
      developed as an alternative to heparin based biological coatings. This bio-passive&#xD;
      Hydrophilic Polymer Coating Without Heparin (BalanceTM Bio-Passive surface) and pediatric&#xD;
      oxygenation system (Affinity PixieTM Oxygenation System), is designed to mimic the natural&#xD;
      interfaces of blood.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint will be the difference in levels of ß thromboglobulin (ß TG) at T2 (15 min after end of bypass) between the two groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Assuming a reduction of 30% of ß TG in infants treated with Balance TM , a total of 64 infants, 32 on each arm, will be needed to detect a Δ = 246 (mean ß TG = 820ng/ml in group Carmeda and mean ß TG =574ng/ml in group Balance; standard deviation=300) , in the level of ß TG at T2 with a two sided p=0.05 and a power of 80%.&#xD;
Taking in to account the use of non parametric test, we estimated an increase of the calculated sample size of 15%, yielding a total sample size of 74 patients.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Platelet mapping by thromboelastography (Hemoscope, Medtronic) will be performed at the following times: T0,T1,T2,T3.</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Flow cytometry will be analysed at T0, T1,T2. Fibrinogen levels, platelet count, prothrombin time, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), F 1+2, PF4 , will be analysed at each time of the study.&#xD;
Differences of bleeding, and transfusion of any blood product, during the first postoperative 24 hours, will be collected.&#xD;
Analysis of differences of activation at different times, for two different temperatures, used for CPB in the two centers.&#xD;
Need of surgical review for bleeding, time of intubation, length of stay in ICU will be analyzed.</description>
