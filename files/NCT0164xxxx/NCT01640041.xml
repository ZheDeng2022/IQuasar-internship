  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an innovative, advanced FNS microstimulator technology&#xD;
      developed by the Alfred Mann Foundation (Santa Clarita, CA) called, the Radio Frequency&#xD;
      Microstimulation (RFM) Gait System that promises to provide FNS training for restoration of&#xD;
      functional gait components in a manner at least as efficacious as current investigational FNS&#xD;
      systems. The design features of the RFM Gait System are intended to address the problems with&#xD;
      the current FNS systems. The RFM implant devices are small enough to be inserted using only a&#xD;
      5 mm incision[3]. Because both the electrode (anode and cathode) are contained within the&#xD;
      microstimulator, there are no lead wires traversing the skin, joints, or torso/limb&#xD;
      junctures. Individual RFMs can be inserted at the motor points and nerves of each of the&#xD;
      paretic muscles in the involved limb and coordinated using radio frequency technology.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective (Aim I) of this study is to evaluate whether the RFM Gait System can&#xD;
      restore the capability to perform the components of gait required for safe, functional&#xD;
      walking, for patients in the chronic phase after stroke (&gt; 12 months). We will assess the&#xD;
      treatment provided by the RFM system at the Cleveland VA compared to the FNS percutaneous&#xD;
      Schreiner electrodes and custom-designed controller previously investigated by the&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The similarities between the RFM-based and percutaneous FNS systems will be assessed using&#xD;
      six gait components required for the execution of functional, safe gait, which are lower limb&#xD;
      strength, coordination, an index of walking endurance, muscle tone, walking speed, and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to test the technological performance and safety of&#xD;
      the RFM Gait System. Measures of technology performance and safety include implantation time;&#xD;
      anchoring capability at the motor point of the muscle; reliability of the RFMs during use;&#xD;
      reliability of electrical performance of the system; comfort of the system (with stimulation&#xD;
      off); comfort of the electrical stimulus.&#xD;
