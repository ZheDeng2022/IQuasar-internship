      The aim of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of the operation of a&#xD;
      prehospital teleconsultation system in the Emergency Medical Service.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six ambulances from five different Emergency Medical Service (EMS) districts are equipped&#xD;
      with a portable telemedicine system. The paramedics can use this system to contact a so&#xD;
      called &quot;tele-EMS physician&quot; after consent of the patient is obtained. The tele-EMS physician&#xD;
      has an audio-connection to the EMS team and receives vital parameters (e.g., ECG, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure) in real-time. Also 12-lead-ECGs can be transmitted to&#xD;
      the tele-EMS physician. The transmission of still pictures - taken with a smartphone - and&#xD;
      video streaming from the inside of the ambulance can be carried out, if meaningful. The&#xD;
      tele-EMS physician supports the EMS team in obtaining all relevant medical history, ECG&#xD;
      diagnosis, general diagnosis and can delegate the application of medications. This can be&#xD;
      carried out to bridge the time to the arrival of an EMS physician or in less severe cases&#xD;
      without an EMS physician on-scene. The safety and efficacy of the introduction and operation&#xD;
      of this system should be evaluated.&#xD;
