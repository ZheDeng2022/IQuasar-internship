    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a computerized version of Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Therapy (CBT) can improve high-risk sexual behaviors in patients attending an outpatient&#xD;
      methadone treatment clinic. This population is at high risk for contracting and spreading&#xD;
      hepatitis and HIV. When added to their treatment as usual (TAU), the CBT session will&#xD;
      increase the total exposure of clients to education about how to reduce risky sexual and&#xD;
      needle use behaviors and provides real world examples. This study seeks to determine if the&#xD;
      use of this CBT program is easily added into the clinical program and if patients are&#xD;
      satisfied with its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that the use of computerized CBT in addition to treatment as usual&#xD;
      will improve knowledge and reduce occurrences of unprotected sexual activity. The study will&#xD;
      also look at patient and clinic costs related to the CBT intervention, drug use and&#xD;
      retention/adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to conduct a randomized pilot trial evaluating the feasibility and promise of&#xD;
      computerized CBT as a single module targeting risky sexual behavior in a HIV/Hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus(HCV) high risk population. In the context of a drug treatment program, we will&#xD;
      randomize 60 methadone maintenance patients to either standard treatment as usual at the&#xD;
      program (TAU) or TAU plus the HIV/HCV/STD risk reduction module of CBT4CBT(&quot;Stay Safe&quot;).&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at baseline, one month and three month time points. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measures will be knowledge regarding risk of infection and transmission of&#xD;
      HIV/HCV/STD,self report assessment of risky sexual practices, retention in the study and&#xD;
      client satisfaction with the module. Our specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the feasibility of integrating CBT4CBT/&quot;Stay Safe&quot; into this setting.&#xD;
           Feasibility will be determined by completion of assessments at 1 and 3 month time points&#xD;
           (retention) and satisfaction ratings by participants randomized to the computer module.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare knowledge of HIV/HCV/STD transmission and its prevention before and after&#xD;
           intervention. This will be assessed by percent correct answers on a quiz administered at&#xD;
           each assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate changes in drug and sex risk behaviors by treatment. The primary outcome&#xD;
           measure will be number of unprotected sexual encounters on self-assessment instruments&#xD;
           for risky sexual behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the single session of computer-based CBT will result in reduced risky&#xD;
      sexual behaviors and increased knowledge of HIV/HCV/STD transmission with differences in&#xD;
      retention by intervention. A successful outcome for this pilot project would result in an&#xD;
      effect size of 0.30 or more on outcomes of risk behavior. This intervention will be compared&#xD;
      to treatment as usual at the participating site, which currently consists of two group&#xD;
      educational sessions on safety regarding risks of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Data- The case for computer-based behavioral treatments Computer-assisted&#xD;
      therapies offer a relatively novel approach to the dissemination of Evidence Based Therapies&#xD;
      (EBT) for behavioral interventions. Existing evidence points to their efficacy and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness. Computer-based interventions offer a number of attractive characteristics&#xD;
      for use in primary care and substance treatment settings. Their low cost coupled with high&#xD;
      consistency, accessibility and standardization are some associated advantages. Ease of&#xD;
      implementation will be critical to reaching patients in remote and rural areas or in small&#xD;
      medical offices as primary care providers become a mainstay of substance abuse treatment.&#xD;
      Risky sexual behaviors can be targeted without the potential negative associations of face to&#xD;
      face behavioral interventions for this highly sensitive domain and thus may be ideally&#xD;
      modulated with computer-based therapies. Equivalency to counselor-based education for&#xD;
      learning new health behaviors, cost-effectiveness, patient satisfaction and accessibility for&#xD;
      illiterate patients are other advantages shown with computer-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer-based CBT: Carroll et al. at Yale have developed an effective computer-based version&#xD;
      of CBT, called &quot;CBT4CBT&quot; and have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing drug use and building&#xD;
      coping skills.(38) The program makes extensive use of 'movies' as teaching tools: In each&#xD;
      module, the user watches an individual confront a difficult situation relevant to that&#xD;
      module's topic; after teaching the key skill through a variety of strategies, the 'movie'&#xD;
      repeats but has a different ending because the characters implement the targeted coping&#xD;
      skills. In developing CBT4CBT, we sought to develop an engaging version of CBT that could&#xD;
      take advantage of the capacity of computer-based learning to convey information via a wide&#xD;
      range of media (e.g., text, video, graphics, audio instruction, interactive exercises). The&#xD;
      CBT4CBT program is highly user-friendly, requiring no previous experience with computers and&#xD;
      minimal use of text-based material (i.e., minimal reading is required), and is highly&#xD;
      interactive. In particular, we capitalize on the use of videotaped examples to allow users to&#xD;
      actually see examples of individuals utilizing skills and strategies in a range of realistic&#xD;
      situations. Viewers are able to watch real-life challenges acted out and safe behaviors&#xD;
      modeled, while addressing negative or detrimental thought processes that predispose to&#xD;
      unhealthy or risky behavior choices (e.g. making a decision to have sex without a condom).&#xD;
      Viewer knowledge base is targeted by didactic portions and role playing is modeled by the&#xD;
      actors. The module includes the opportunity for the client to print out and perform&#xD;
      'homework' worksheets, shown to be predictive for successful outcomes in CBT. The module&#xD;
      allows for considerable control by the viewer, who can choose the speed of progression&#xD;
      through the screens and has the capability to go back to previous screens for reviewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single CBT module application: Our original feasibility, efficacy, durability and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness studies for addictions treatment employed the full version of CBT4CBT,&#xD;
      comprised of 7 modules. One independent module focuses entirely on targeting risky sexual and&#xD;
      drug use practices (titled &quot;Stay Safe&quot;), but has not been evaluated as an independent module&#xD;
      for effects on risk reduction. The &quot;Stay Safe&quot; module was developed by Dr. Kathleen Carroll&#xD;
      and her team at Yale in consultation with the Connecticut AIDS Education and Training Center&#xD;
      director (Karina Danvers) and others. Its development involved the input of the CBT experts&#xD;
      (Dr. Carroll, Dr. Michael Copenhaver), infectious disease specialists and substance abuse&#xD;
      treatment patients who volunteered to review the module. Like the substance abuse targeted&#xD;
      sections, the script was written to be easily recognizable across many socioeconomic and&#xD;
      cultural groups. Professional actors were hired to play the parts of substance users in two&#xD;
      separate high risk situations, one sexual and one Intravenous drug use (IDU). Skills are&#xD;
      taught with multimedia presentation allowing the user to direct the pace of the module, as&#xD;
      well as to view the consequences of various choices during the risky situation. The&#xD;
      intervention for the proposed pilot study is this single targeted module, &quot;Stay Safe&quot;. The&#xD;
      module can be completed on virtually any computer, and thus is ideal for implementation in&#xD;
      this, and a wide range of settings. Its expense for clinical use will also be reduced as a&#xD;
      result of its brevity. These characteristics will make it easily disseminated, with &quot;real&#xD;
      world&quot; applications for settings of substance use treatment and primary care medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview: In order to maximize scientific yield from this project, we intentionally designed&#xD;
      the study to parallel the landmark Calsyn(5) and Tross(6) randomized trials evaluating&#xD;
      effects of the 5-session group CDC behavioral approach for risky sex practices reduction in&#xD;
      substance abuse treatment programs. We seek to compare as closely as possible the variable of&#xD;
      therapy type (computerized CBT in our study versus group therapy for safer sex skills&#xD;
      building in theirs), so we sought to minimize the differences between outcome measures and&#xD;
      methods. Use of parallels in design and outcome measures will allow us to 'benchmark'&#xD;
      outcomes to reported changes in those studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population and Sample: Hartford Dispensary (Hartford, CT) will serve as the site. Drug&#xD;
      treatment and medical services are offered on an outpatient basis there. This study will&#xD;
      enroll clients undergoing IDU treatment with methadone at the site. These clients come in&#xD;
      regularly for scheduled maintenance medication and clinical monitoring as well as standard&#xD;
      counseling. Many (roughly 55%) of these patients are already HCV and/or HIV positive and&#xD;
      therefore pose a significant risk for the transmission of the virus through routes other than&#xD;
      IDU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Clients will be identified through self-presentation response to advertisements&#xD;
      and fliers in the clinic. Drug counseling providers may also ask clients if they are&#xD;
      interested in participating in the study. A sample size of 60 (30 patients per group) is&#xD;
      feasible and would be sufficient to detect a large effect size on risky sexual behavior of&#xD;
      [Cohen's d= 0.3, (alpha.05, power0.8)]. This effect size is smaller than that reported for&#xD;
      behavioral studies in the literature, but should be sufficient to evaluate feasibility and&#xD;
      promise of the proposed intervention in this pilot.&#xD;
