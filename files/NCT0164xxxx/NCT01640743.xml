  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study will be to evaluate the effect of different therapeutic&#xD;
      immunosuppressive strategies currently employed in common clinical practice on regulatory T&#xD;
      lymphocytes and to verify the hypothesis that the association of thymoglobulins - mTOR&#xD;
      inhibitors - small doses of Tacrolimus not only represents a safe anti-rejection therapy but&#xD;
      it can also lead to mid-term formation of a high amount of regulatory T cells and,&#xD;
      consequently, a high grade of tolerance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune response is mediated by the interaction between antigen-presenting cells (APC), CD4+&#xD;
      helper T cells (Th) and regulatory T cells (Treg), a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells which&#xD;
      intensively expresses IL-2 receptor (CD25) and FoxP3 transcription factor. Treg cells&#xD;
      contribute maintaining tolerance by suppressing immune response to normal or tumour&#xD;
      self-antigens. Treg cells originate in the thymus during ontogenesis and represent&#xD;
      approximately 10% of peripheral CD4+ cells. All effector T lymphocytes generate in the thymus&#xD;
      at the early stages of life and evolve through the production of new T lymphocytes as well as&#xD;
      through antigen-induced expansion of virgin (naive) peripheral T lymphocytes which convert to&#xD;
      &quot;memory&quot; T lymphocytes and lie in peripheral lymphoid organs (17). Mature T lymphocytes&#xD;
      constitute 70-80% of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, 30-40% of lymph nodes cells and&#xD;
      20-30% of splenic lymphoid cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T lymphocytes are primary effectors of cell-mediated immunity and differentiate into a&#xD;
      subpopulation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes which are able to lyse foreign cells or virus&#xD;
      infected host-cells and a subpopulation of CD4+ T lymphocytes with a regulating activity on T&#xD;
      and B lymphocytes and monocytes, through the production of cytokines and cell-to-cell&#xD;
      contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treg lymphocytes play a central role among CD4+ cells in balancing tolerance and immunity, as&#xD;
      they are responsible for maintaining peripheral tolerance through the control of&#xD;
      self-reactive T cells which escaped thymic deletion (19). Studies have in fact demonstrated&#xD;
      that whether on one side a defect in their development or activity can lead to serious&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases, an excessive immunosuppression mediated by these cells stimulates, on&#xD;
      the other side, an immunodeficient condition also towards antigens produced by neoplastic&#xD;
      cells favouring, as a consequence, tumour growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treg lymphocytes represent approximately 10% of all CD4+ T cells present in the thymus,&#xD;
      peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues; they consist of various populations which differ in&#xD;
      terms of particular cell-surface molecules expression and the production of diverse&#xD;
      cytokines, but share a common scarce response to antigenic stimulation and an&#xD;
      immunosuppressive activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best characterized Treg lymphocytes are the so called &quot;natural occurring Tregs&quot; (nTregs),&#xD;
      a sub-group of CD4+ T cells which originates and develops in the thymus during T-cellular&#xD;
      maturation process and is afterwards normally present in peripheral blood with the function&#xD;
      of controlling self-antigens and preventing autoimmune diseases. These lymphocytes are&#xD;
      characterized by the constitutive expression of CD-25 (interleukin-2 receptor α chain), Foxp3&#xD;
      transcription factor (specific to these cells and implied in the development control within&#xD;
      the thymus), CTLA-4, GITR and LAG-3 surface molecules as well as TGF-β cytokine, which is&#xD;
      present in great quantity on cellular surface and is fundamental to their functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So called &quot;induced Tregs&quot; (iTregs) build the other Treg lymphocytes category: these are CD4+&#xD;
      T lymphocytes which lack in intrinsic regulatory potential but acquire their suppressive&#xD;
      activity thanks to a specific and cytokine-mediated activation (26). They are produced in&#xD;
      periphery and allow the development of peripheral tolerance to self-antigens, not or scarcely&#xD;
      expressed in the thymus. iTregs consist themselves of two different lymphocytic&#xD;
      subpopulations: Tr1, present in intestinal mucosa and characterized by a high production of&#xD;
      IL-10 and TGF-β but Foxp3 negative; and T helper 3 (Th3), deriving from the induction of&#xD;
      native CD4+ T cells due to the ingestion of alimentary antigens, responsible for oral&#xD;
      tolerance. Th3 are Foxp3 positive and release high levels of TGF-β (27).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While iTregs seem to function only by the production of immunosuppressive cytokines such as&#xD;
      IL-10 and TGF-β, nTregs can exert their activity also through various mechanisms, such as&#xD;
      cytokine-dependent, cell contact-dependent or both, according to the nature and intensity of&#xD;
      the inflammatory response and of the target tissue to which the latter is directed. This&#xD;
      context-dependent regulatory mechanism leads to the elaboration of the model of adaptability&#xD;
      and diversification within the function of these cells: in other words, Tregs would&#xD;
      constitute a functionally homogeneous cellular subgroup in which every single cell can exert&#xD;
      a different mechanism according to the characteristics of inflammatory response. Some authors&#xD;
      believe instead that Tregs consist of several subpopulations, each of these presenting its&#xD;
      own inhibitory mechanisms (27-28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenotypic characterization of Tregs among circulating human lymphocytes has been complicated&#xD;
      by the fact that CD25 is not exclusively expressed by Tregs but also by non-regulatory&#xD;
      lymphocytes after activation, so at present only CD4+ cells expressing the highest CD25&#xD;
      levels (CD4+CD25+bright) can be considered authentic Tregs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2003 the Forkhead Transcription Factor (Foxp3) was identified as major regulator in Tregs&#xD;
      development; its expression is predominantly restricted to CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes and Foxp3&#xD;
      expression in naive T cells supports their conversion into a regulatory T phenotype&#xD;
      functionally similar to nTregs. Foxp3 is therefore considered an extremely specific marker of&#xD;
      Treg cells and is fundamental to the control of their development und functioning.&#xD;
      Particularly, some studies have demonstrated that the lack of Foxp3 at birth in humans and&#xD;
      rats leads to a massive T-cellular hyperproliferation, resulting in multi-organ autoimmunity&#xD;
      and premature death (24), whereas its deletion in adult rats causes hyperproliferation and&#xD;
      expansion of dendritic cells as well as death within two weeks. Based on these results Foxp3&#xD;
      seems to be the ideal marker for tolerance study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tregs production is strictly controlled by signals emanated by various types of cells, such&#xD;
      as epithelial cells, T lymphocytes and APCs. Although the presence of the latter is&#xD;
      fundamental to TCR-mediated activation of Tregs, the real suppressive phase in vitro induced&#xD;
      by nTregs is actually APC-independent. It implies in fact a mechanism of contact between&#xD;
      CD4+CD25- effector T lymphocytes and CD4+CD25+ nTregs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present we dispose of little knowledge regarding functional consequences of suppression&#xD;
      carried out by Tregs on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes which are sensitive to them, beside that&#xD;
      they inhibit IL-2 transcription and, consequently, induce cell cycle interruption. Further&#xD;
      immune suppression mechanisms reported by other studies, but not yet confirmed, are&#xD;
      following: anergy induction in responsive T cells, refractory reaction to the mitogenic&#xD;
      effects of IL-2, release of new iTregs which are likely to suppress Th1s and Th2s by&#xD;
      producing TGFβ1 and/or IL-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTregs require particular cytokines for their development and homeostasis. Moreover, Tregs&#xD;
      result to be hypoproliferative or anergic to TCR activation, probably due to their&#xD;
      incapability of transcribing and actively secreting IL-2. This cytokine is principally&#xD;
      released by activated T lymphocytes but not by nTregs and it exerts its biologic activities&#xD;
      by binding to its receptor, a membrane protein complex formed by three subunits: α (CD25), β&#xD;
      and γ chain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When IL-2 binds to its receptor in T cells it activates Janus kinases (JAKs) which&#xD;
      consequently phosphorylate and release STAT5 proteins (signal transducers and transcription&#xD;
      activators). IL-2 exerts in fact its effects on T cells by regulating several target genes&#xD;
      primarily at transcriptional level; it does not only increase the expression of IL-2R α and β&#xD;
      chains but it also modulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, by&#xD;
      inducing for instance the up-regulation of proto-oncogenes such as c-myc, c-fos and c-jun, as&#xD;
      well as anti-apoptotic genes such as bcl-2 or pro-apoptotic genes like Fas ligand. IL-2 is&#xD;
      essential for nTreg development and maintenance, as some studies have demonstrated: induced&#xD;
      IL-2 depletion in rats causes autoimmune diseases which can be associated to a reduced number&#xD;
      of Foxp3+ nTreg lymphocytes in peripheral compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important cytokine to the functioning of Tregs is TGF-β. Despite its inhibitory&#xD;
      effects on other T cells, this growth factor is likely to support extra-thymic production of&#xD;
      Treg cells and the increase of Foxp3 expression: this action is, however, necessary&#xD;
      exclusively to the initial induction. TGF-β plays therefore a different but complementary&#xD;
      role to IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a further critical cytokine to the functioning of Tr1 lymphocytes is IL-10. Chronic&#xD;
      activation in vitro of CD4+ lymphocytes in the presence of IL-10 leads to their&#xD;
      differentiation in Tr1, high levels of IL-10 and TGF-β, low levels of IL-2 and IL-4 and a&#xD;
      scarce proliferation after restimulation. IL-10 can moreover induce immunosuppression by&#xD;
      supporting the formation of anergic T cells capable of inhibiting the activity of other&#xD;
      activated T lymphocytes through a contact-dependent mechanism, by competing with the latter&#xD;
      for specific APC (Antigen Presenting Cells) receptors and for locally produced IL-2. These&#xD;
      anergic T cells are able to suppress immune response in vivo, as their transfer in rats which&#xD;
      underwent allogeneic skin graft showed a longer transplant survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside the above mentioned cytokines, others seem to be involved in different ways in Treg&#xD;
      generation and induction, such as IL-4 and IL-13, whereas other cytokines have an antagonist&#xD;
      effect on them, such as IL-6 for instance, which contrasts their immunosuppressive activity&#xD;
      without interfering with proliferation. Other studies on Treg function have also showed that&#xD;
      a transfusion of allogeneic Treg lymphocytes and the subsequent skin graft in IL2Rβ-/- rats&#xD;
      (rapidly prone to lethal autoimmune diseases if not treated) not only controlled and&#xD;
      suppressed those diseases although Tregs and self-reactive T cells were MHC-incompatible, but&#xD;
      also consequently allowed to establish a state of tolerance to those transplants presenting&#xD;
      common MHC molecules to donor Tregs. This experiment has then proved that Tregs suppress also&#xD;
      self-reactive T cells deriving from non MHC-correlated donors and so, theoretically, that the&#xD;
      donor pool for Treg-based immune therapy would be potentially very wide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to their essential role in immune tolerance and their immunosuppressive function, Treg&#xD;
      lymphocytes are therefore gaining more and more importance in transplantology, as&#xD;
      experimental models of organ transplants have underlined their capability of modulating CD4+&#xD;
      and CD8+ cell activity, both responsible for rejection, by inhibiting it, and of suppressing&#xD;
      GVHD (Graft-versus-host disease), mediating in this way allotransplant tolerance. There are,&#xD;
      however, controversial results regarding Treg phenotype and their action mechanism, depending&#xD;
      on the experimental model and on the protocol used to induce this tolerance.&#xD;
