    <textblock>
      Biologic therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways&#xD;
      and stop cancer cells from growing. Idelalisib may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. This phase I trial studies the side&#xD;
      effects and the best dose of lenalidomide when giving together with idelalisib in treating&#xD;
      patients with recurrent follicular lymphoma.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and idelalisib twice daily (BID) on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Treatment with lenalidomide and idelalisib repeats every 28 days for up to 12&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary and&#xD;
      secondary objectives of the study include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide when combined with&#xD;
           idelalisib in patients with recurrent follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the toxicity profile of lenalidomide and idelalisib therapy in patients&#xD;
           with recurrent follicular NHL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the efficacy (overall response rate [ORR], complete response rate [CRR], and&#xD;
           progression-free survival [PFS]) of lenalidomide and idelalisib in patients with&#xD;
           recurrent follicular NHL in a preliminary fashion (using a small extension cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether the therapeutic effects of the lenalidomide and idelalisib combination&#xD;
           are sufficiently promising to warrant evaluation in a subsequent (phase II/III)&#xD;
           randomized trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24&#xD;
      months and then annually. Patients are followed once every year for a maximum of 10 years&#xD;
      from study entry.&#xD;

    <description>Lenalidomide:&#xD;
Lenalidomide will be administered orally on days 1-21 followed by 7 days of rest, every 28 days. A treatment cycle will be considered 28 days in length. In the absence of intolerable toxicity or disease progression, lenalidomide will be given for a total of 12 cycles.&#xD;
Idelalisib:&#xD;
Dosing is fixed in all cohorts receiving idelalisib at 150 mg orally (twice daily) for 12 cycles, with the exception of dose modifications for toxicity.</description>
