  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is a condition that results from damage to the central nervous system and causes&#xD;
      painful muscle contractures that drastically affect level of independence, activities of&#xD;
      daily living, and quality of life. Although there are well-known and accepted treatments for&#xD;
      spasticity, spasticity is often left undertreated; the specific reasons for this observation&#xD;
      are unknown. Because there is no blood test or scan that indicates the presence of&#xD;
      spasticity, diagnosis is based entirely on physician impression. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that one reason that spasticity is undertreated is due to the lack of a&#xD;
      standardized diagnostic procedure. This study attempts to test the reliability of a&#xD;
      diagnostic flowchart that seeks to increase the accuracy of physician diagnosis of&#xD;
      spasticity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is defined as a velocity-dependent increase in stretch reflex with muscle&#xD;
      overactivity, and is associated with involuntary limb movements or spasms which can often be&#xD;
      painful. Active function (such as walking, driving, writing, or sexual activity) can be&#xD;
      adversely affected by spasticity. For patients with significant disability requiring a&#xD;
      caregiver, passive function (such as facilitation of bathing, dressing, and undergarment&#xD;
      change) can also become very difficult, especially when spasticity is left untreated.&#xD;
      Finally, persistent involuntary motion or spasms may negatively impact an individual's mood&#xD;
      or self image, making social situations more difficult and sometimes overwhelming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spasticity is especially undertreated in vulnerable populations; population surveys in&#xD;
      individuals with intellectual disability and nursing home residents have shown that less than&#xD;
      20% of affected individuals are treated. There are severe negative consequences of leaving&#xD;
      spasticity untreated, like muscle shortening and tendon and soft tissue contractures. Once&#xD;
      developed, contractures are very difficult to treat and can hinder personal hygiene and&#xD;
      dressing, and well as the ability to sit or lie properly. Bad hygiene and immobility can&#xD;
      lead, in turn, to urinary tract infections, pressure ulcers and skin breakdown. Furthermore,&#xD;
      spasticity can stunt muscle growth and cause abnormal bone growth and formation, especially&#xD;
      in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spasticity is diagnosed based upon a physician's clinical impression; there is currently no&#xD;
      biomarker to facilitate an objective diagnosis. The two instruments most commonly used to&#xD;
      document severity are the Modified Ashworth Scale and Range of Motion Assessment. Both&#xD;
      assessments are based upon a clinician's assessment of muscle tone, but there is no&#xD;
      widely-accepted protocol to determine the presence of spasticity. We therefore hypothesize&#xD;
      one reason spasticity is widely undertreated is the challenge faced by physicians when&#xD;
      attempting to make a diagnosis. In the absence of a biomarker, a more standardized method of&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis is necessary, both for future research and for advocacy efforts. The&#xD;
      treatment of spasticity could increase quality of life by allowing an individual to&#xD;
      participate more independently in activities of daily living, and by making assistance easier&#xD;
      for caregivers.&#xD;
