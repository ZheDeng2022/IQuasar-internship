    <textblock>
      Since 2004, intravitreal injection of Avastin, Lucentis, and Macugen for wet age-related&#xD;
      macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, and diabetic macular edema are being&#xD;
      administered in the United States at increasing rates. A 2010 study showed that in Canada and&#xD;
      the incidence of injections grew 8 fold from 2005 to 2007 to 25.9 injections per 100,000&#xD;
      citizens. (Campbell 2010) In 2009, in the United States, over 1 million intravitreal&#xD;
      injections were administered to Medicare beneficiaries. (Wykoff 2011) In the year 2011, the&#xD;
      four doctors in my retina group administered a total of 6,494 intravitreal injections; in&#xD;
      2010, we administered 5021 intravitreal injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though intravitreal injections are commonly administered, the optimal method of&#xD;
      anesthetizing the eye prior to injection has yet to be determined. Some physicians use an&#xD;
      anesthetic drop, some a soaked cotton pledget, some use an anesthetic gel and some use&#xD;
      subconjunctival injected anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009, the last time the Procedures and Trends Survey (PAT) (Mittra 2009) conducted by the&#xD;
      American Society of Retina Specialists (the largest retina society in the world) asked about&#xD;
      anesthetic methods for administering intravitreal injections, the following response was&#xD;
      given by the 433 respondents:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Topical anesthetic drop: 21.48%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Topical viscous anesthetic: 23.33%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Topical anesthetic &amp; soaked cotton-tip or pledget: 29.79%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subconjunctival injection of anesthetic: 24.02%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other: 1.39%&#xD;
&#xD;
      An editorial in 2011 in the journal Retina, discusses the lack of good studies assessing&#xD;
      optimal anesthetic prior to intravitreal injections. (Prenner 2011).&#xD;

      1 &amp; 2. General information including the rationale for the study. Explain the area of Current&#xD;
      scientific concern and why the research is needed; Background information including a&#xD;
      description of existing research and information that is already known on the topic; Since&#xD;
      2004, intravitreal injections of Avastin, Lucentis, and Macugen for wet age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, and diabetic macular edema are being administered in&#xD;
      the United States at an increasing rate. In Canada, the incidence of intravitreal injections&#xD;
      grew 8 fold from 2005 to 2007 to 25.9 injections per 100,000 citizens. (Campbell 2010) In&#xD;
      2009, in the United States, over 1 million intravitreal injections were administered to&#xD;

      administered a total of 6,494 intravitreal injections; in 2010, we administered 5021&#xD;
      intravitreal injections.&#xD;
&#xD;

      subconjunctival injected anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009, the last time the Procedures and Trends Survey (PAT) (Mittra 2009) conducted by the&#xD;
      American Society of Retina Specialists (the largest retina society in the world) asked about&#xD;
      anesthetic methods for administering intravitreal injections, the following response was&#xD;
      given by the 433 respondents:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Topical anesthetic drop: 21.48%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Topical viscous anesthetic: 23.33%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Topical anesthetic &amp; soaked cotton-tip or pledget: 29.79%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subconjunctival injection of anesthetic: 24.02%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other: 1.39%&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2005, 12 patients were studied who were given subconjunctival lidocaine injection prior to&#xD;
      intravitreal injection and subsequently (on another visit) given topical gel anesthesia prior&#xD;
      to intravitreal injection. The patients rated their pain on a scale from 0 to 10. These&#xD;
      researchers found that the pain scores were the same for the two groups but the patients&#xD;
      receiving subconjunctival anesthetic had more chemosis and subconjunctival hemorrhage. This&#xD;
      study was very small and not powered to determine a difference between the groups. (Friedman&#xD;
      2005)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2006, a study comparing topical gel to subconjunctival lidocaine injection using an analog&#xD;
      pain scale in one hundred patients found no difference between the two groups (N=100). The&#xD;
      intravitreal injection was given within 30 seconds of the first anesthetic application: the&#xD;
      application of anesthetic gel or the injection of subconjunctival lidocaine. (Freeman 2006)&#xD;
      In most patients, lidocaine take longer than 30 seconds to work. A study of 2% lidocaine for&#xD;
      dental procedures shows that the onset of anesthetic for the tooth is 3.3 +/- 1.5 minutes&#xD;
      (average +/- SD).(Oka 1997)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, a study comparing various topical anesthetic agents was published showing no&#xD;
      significant difference between topical proparicaine drops, 4% lidocaine solution, and 3.5%&#xD;
      lidocaine gel in a group of 120 patients using an analog pain scale from 0 to 10. This study&#xD;
      performed the intravitreal injection from between 20 to 70 seconds of the first anesthetic&#xD;
      application. (Davis 2012)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, a study was performed in 60 patients comparing tetracaine, proparacaine, and&#xD;
      TetraVisc gel and found tetracaine to be the least painful. They also found significantly&#xD;
      lower pain scores in patients who had improved vision from previous injections, female sex,&#xD;
      and age &gt; 65. This suggests that factors other than anesthetic type used might affect the&#xD;
      results of pain studies. (Rifkin, 2012)&#xD;
&#xD;
      An editorial in 2011 in the journal Retina, discusses the lack of good studies assessing&#xD;
      optimal anesthetic prior to intravitreal injections. (Prenner 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. The research questions, objectives and purpose;&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if topical gel with subconjunctival lidocaine is superior to topical gel in&#xD;
      relieving pain of intravitreous injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. The study design including information that is needed to answer the research questions;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a within patient, factorial, single blinded, randomized trial comparing&#xD;
      topical anesthetic gel to topical anesthetic gel plus subconjunctival lidocaine for relieving&#xD;
      pain of intravitreous injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving bilateral simultaneous injections for wet macular degeneration or retinal&#xD;
      vein occlusion or diabetic macular edema will be asked to participate in the study. Those who&#xD;
      consent and sign an approved informed consent will be treated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A coin will be flipped to determine which treatment the right is going to get. The right eye&#xD;
      will always be treated before the left eye, but both eyes will be treated as nearly&#xD;
      simultaneously as possible. Both eyes will be prepared simultaneously and the left eye will&#xD;
      receive its intravitreal injection within 30 seconds of the right eye being injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for the injection, one drop of Proparicaine Hydrochloride 0.5% and one drop&#xD;
      brimonidine 0.2%, will be instilled into each eye followed by ¼ inch of TetraVisc Forte Gel.&#xD;
      The patient will then be instructed to close the eyes for 5-minutes. Then another application&#xD;
      of ¼ inch of TetraVisc Forte Gel will be placed in the inferior conjunctival fornix. Another&#xD;
      5-minute waiting period will be observed. Finally, in the eye randomized to subconjunctival&#xD;
      lidocaine 0.1 cc of 2% lidocaine hydrochloride, 20 mg/ml, will injected subconjunctivally at&#xD;
      the intended site of the intravitreal injection. In the eye randomized to no subconjunctival&#xD;
      lidocaine, a pretend injection will be given by pushing a syringe without a needle against&#xD;
      the eye. Another 5-minute waiting period will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another drop of Proparicaine Hydrochloride Solution 0.5% will be placed in each eye and&#xD;
      another ¼ inch of TetraVisc Gel, and then a sterile eyelid speculum will be used to separate&#xD;
      the lid, and then the eyes will be prepped with a drop of 5% Betadine Solution. After the&#xD;
      Betadine prep, each eye (right then left) will be injected through the pars plana, 3 mm&#xD;
      posterior to the corneal scleral limbus, with the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      drug. Following the intravitreal injection, the sterile lid speculum will be removed. The&#xD;
      eyes will be irrigated with sterile eye rinse eye irrigation solution and a drop of Acuvail&#xD;
      will be placed into each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be asked to keep the eyes mostly closed for one hour following the&#xD;
      injection, to use artificial tears hourly for every four hours, and to not rub their eyes&#xD;
      after the procedure because of the anesthetic. The patient will also be warned to report any&#xD;
      adverse events immediately, especially escalating pain, within a day or two after the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain will be rated in two ways during the procedures, comparing the two eyes and also on a 0&#xD;
      to 10 standardized pain scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to any treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After subconjunctival anesthetic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After intravitreal injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That evening by phone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following day by phone&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each of these 5 times, patients will be asked if in the right eye compared to the left eye&#xD;
      is there:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Much more pain right eye; a little more pain right eye; no difference; a little more&#xD;
           pain left eye; much more pain left eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate pain in each eye from 0 to 10&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final endpoint will be the following day when patients decide which eye they prefer&#xD;
      overall anesthetic therapy. They will be asked to choose the method for the next visit to be&#xD;
      used in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients do not have a preference after one study visit, a second study visit will be&#xD;
      performed reversing treatment as to which eye gets which anesthesia. Then they will have to&#xD;
      choose which method they like best or state the two treatments are the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Sample size should be justified&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 44 patients would provide an 80 percent probability of detecting an&#xD;
      important difference in pain magnitude if one exists assuming a ratio of expected treatment&#xD;
      effect to standard deviation of 0.6 (two-tailed, alpha = 0.05) (Friedman 2006)&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. The risks to the subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
      These treatments and anesthetics have been validated in several large clinical studies. There&#xD;
      are is a higher risk of subconjunctival hemorrhage and chemosis in eyes with a&#xD;
      subconjunctival anesthetic. Neither of those causes lasting harm to the eye, but they can&#xD;
      cause some discomfort for a day or two. With either anesthetic, there is a risk of:&#xD;
      conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, vitreous floater, foreign body sensation, and ocular&#xD;
      discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.Any experimental procedures including the use procedures already being performed on&#xD;
      subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes;&#xD;
&#xD;
      None.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.The potential benefits to subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow each patient to determine the optimal anesthetic protocol for&#xD;
      themselves. From experience, there are some patients who prefer one mode of anesthesia and&#xD;
      some who prefer another mode of anesthesia. Usually the physician chooses the anesthetic&#xD;
      type. This study will allow each patient to determine what type of anesthetic they prefer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.Human subjects considerations including a description of the informed consent process;&#xD;
      when potentially vulnerable subjects will be enrolled (e.g., children, prisoners, the&#xD;
      cognitively impaired, institutionalized or critically/terminally ill), include a discussion&#xD;
      of additional safeguards in place to protect the subjects; include a discussion of how the&#xD;
      privacy and confidentiality of the subjects will be maintained&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be given both verbal and written on the day of the visit. Patients who&#xD;
      are eligible will also be contact by phone prior to the visit so they can be told about the&#xD;
      study on the phone. Finally, patients will be given the option to enter or leave the study&#xD;
      whenever they want. If they do not want to enroll on the initial visit when the study is&#xD;
      discussed, they will be offered entry on the following visit. No children, prisoners,&#xD;
      cognitively impaired or terminally ill patients will be enrolled. Finally, all research notes&#xD;
      will only have a code using the patient's record number from our retina practice on it.&#xD;
      Charts in our office are always maintained in a HIPPA compliant manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13.Data and safety monitoring plan including whether or not there is a data and safety&#xD;
      monitoring board associated with the study, how often data will be reviewed for safety, early&#xD;
      stopping criteria, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no data and safety monitoring board.&#xD;
