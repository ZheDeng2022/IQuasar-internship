  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the vast majority of patients with Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma (PTMC) have&#xD;
      excellent long-term outcomes, some patients experience tumor recurrence, either locally or,&#xD;
      less frequently, as distant metastases, with some patients dying due to this disease. The&#xD;
      natural course of PTMC has not always been universally accepted, thus creating controversy&#xD;
      concerning the diagnosis and treatment of PTMC. Further, it is not yet possible to&#xD;
      confidently identify PTMCs that would take aggressive courses if left untreated. Treatment&#xD;
      recommendations range from observation alone to vigorous intervention featuring total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy, prophylactic cervical lymph node dissection, and adjuvant RI ablation.&#xD;
      Therefore, no consensus has yet been reached on the biological aggressiveness of PTMC or on&#xD;
      which therapy is the most appropriate. Moreover, the impact of several clinicopathologic risk&#xD;
      factors, including tumor size, is unclear, although patients with tumors ≤ 0.5cm in diameter&#xD;
      may have a better prognosis than patients with tumors 0.5-1 cm in size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies evaluating the proper extent of surgery for PTMC have been retrospective in&#xD;
      design. A prospective, long-term, randomized study in a large number of patients, however,&#xD;
      may not be feasible owing to the need for an extensive follow-up duration, the costs&#xD;
      associated with such a study, and, particularly, its ethical constraints. Consequently, it is&#xD;
      not currently possible to determine the prognosis of patients with PTMC or the proper&#xD;
      therapeutic approach in these patients. The investigators therefore compared long-term&#xD;
      outcomes after total thyroidectomy (TT: total or near-total thyroidectomy) or less than total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy (LT: lobectomy or subtotal thyroidectomy) in a large cohort of patients with&#xD;
      PTMC, using propensity-score matching to adjust for the uncontrolled assignment of surgical&#xD;
      extent in these patients. In addition, the investigators evaluated whether tumor size, ≤ 0.5&#xD;
      cm or &gt; 0.5 cm, had a significant impact in determining the extent of surgery in patients&#xD;
      with PTMC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study population From March 1986 to December 2006, a total of 5042 patients with PTC (of all&#xD;
      tumor sizes) underwent initial surgical therapy at our institution. Of these, 2441 patients&#xD;
      (48.4%) had PTMCs ≤ 1 cm in diameter, with 1270 undergoing TT and 1171 undergoing LT.&#xD;
      Complete follow-up data for major clinical events were available for 2014 patients (82.5%),&#xD;
      including 1015 (79.9%) of the TT group and 999 (85.3%) of the LT group (p=0.083). Patients&#xD;
      were followed-up for a median 11.8 years (range, 5 to 26 years). All histopathologic&#xD;
      diagnoses were reviewed and verified by endocrine pathologists using WHO criteria. The study&#xD;
      protocol was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Details of patients' presentations,&#xD;
      surgical and pathologic findings, and adjunctive treatments were obtained from the Yonsei&#xD;
      University Thyroid Cancer Database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management strategy In patients diagnosed with PTMC after a complete radiologic and&#xD;
      histologic examination, the extent of thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine (RI) therapy were&#xD;
      based on prognostic factors. However, the protocol of our institution as to how PTMC should&#xD;
      be appropriately managed has been changed according to update of clinical reports and&#xD;
      validated treatment guidelines. Therefore, the lack of a standardized approach during the&#xD;
      study period allowed us to assess the impact of various therapeutic modalities, especially&#xD;
      extent of thyroidectomy, in patients with PTMC.&#xD;
