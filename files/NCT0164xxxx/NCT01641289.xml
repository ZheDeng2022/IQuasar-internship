      Blackwater fever, characterized by intravascular haemolysis and hemoglobinuria, is an&#xD;
      important cause of renal impairment and mortality in severe malaria caused by Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum. The largest malaria clinical trials report blackwater incidences of 5-7% in Asian&#xD;
      adults and 4% in African children with severe malaria treated with artesunate or quinine. The&#xD;
      prevalence of blackwater fever in Chittagong, Bangladesh is 15% with associated rates of&#xD;
      renal failure and mortality of 42.9% and 14.2% respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fundamental characteristic of blackwater fever is the presence of intravascular hemolysis&#xD;
      of both infected and uninfected erythrocytes and release of free haemoglobin. The cytotoxic&#xD;
      free haemoglobin present can cause severe oxidative damage as a result of haem redox cycling&#xD;
      yielding ferric and ferryl heme, which generate radical species that induce lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation and subsequent production of F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs). Evidence suggests that&#xD;
      F2-IsoPs generated by the hemoprotein-catalyzed oxidation of lipids are responsible for the&#xD;
      oxidative damage and vasoconstriction associated with renal injury in haemolytic disorders&#xD;
      and rhabdomyolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel mechanism of paracetamol was recently demonstrated, showing that paracetamol is a&#xD;
      potent inhibitor of hemoprotein-catalyzed lipid peroxidation by reducing ferryl heme to its&#xD;
      less toxic ferric state and quenching globin radicals. In a recent proof of concept trial,&#xD;
      paracetamol at therapeutic levels was shown to significantly decrease oxidant kidney injury,&#xD;
      improve renal function and reduce renal damage by inhibiting the hemoprotein-catalyzed lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation in a rat model of rhabdomyolysis-induced renal injury. Since adults with severe&#xD;
      malaria demonstrate increased concentrations of cell-free haemoglobin, and urinary F2-IsoPs,&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesize that this novel inhibitory mechanism of paracetamol may provide&#xD;
      renal protection in this population by reducing the hemoprotein-induced lipid peroxidation.&#xD;
      As there is currently no consensus that exists concerning adequate medical treatment for&#xD;
      blackwater fever, the potential application of this safe and extensively used drug would be&#xD;
      of great benefit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mortality in severe malaria remains ~15% despite the best available parasiticidal&#xD;
      antimalarial therapy, intravenous artesunate. Adjunctive therapies in combination with&#xD;
      anti-parasitic drugs have the potential to improve outcomes. However, currently there are no&#xD;
      proven adjunctive therapies for the treatment of severe malaria, which can improve&#xD;
      case-fatality when used in combination with anti-parasitic drugs. This research proposal&#xD;
      focuses on exploring if paracetamol prevents renal dysfunction caused by free haemoglobin&#xD;
      induced oxidative damage in severe malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blackwater fever epidemiology As early as the 1800s, blackwater fever complicating severe&#xD;
      malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum was recognized as an important cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, with a 25-30% mean mortality rate. The etiology and pathogenesis is poorly&#xD;
      understood but it is characterized by massive intravascular haemolysis and passage of black&#xD;
      or red urine, which can lead to renal impairment and death. This manifestation was linked to&#xD;
      quinine therapy as its occurrence nearly disappeared during the chloroquine era from 1950 to&#xD;
      1980. Since 1990, the resurgence in the number of cases noted in both malaria-free and&#xD;
      malarious areas in non-immune and immune individuals has generated renewed interest into this&#xD;
      manifestation of severe malaria. The largest malaria clinical trials report blackwater fever&#xD;
      incidences of 7% and 4% in Asian adult patients with severe malaria treated with artesunate&#xD;
      and quinine, respectively and 4% in African children treated with either drug. The prevalence&#xD;
      of blackwater fever in Chittagong, Bangladesh was recently determined in a pilot study to be&#xD;
      15% with associated renal failure and mortality rates of 42.9% and 14.2% respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blackwater fever pathogenesis Although the exact mechanism linking falciparum malaria and&#xD;
      blackwater fever is uncertain, numerous explanations have been suggested. It has been&#xD;
      proposed to occur in 4 specific circumstances: (1) in case patients with G6PD deficiency with&#xD;
      or without malaria who take oxidant drugs (primaquine) (2) in case patients with G6PD&#xD;
      deficiency and malaria untreated and treated with quinine (3) when patients (normal G6PD)&#xD;
      with severe malaria are treated with quinine (4) when people exposed to malaria self-medicate&#xD;
      with quinine or related amino-alcohol drugs. However, new circumstances of blackwater fever&#xD;
      have emerged, occurring in patients with normal G6PD levels with severe malaria who have&#xD;
      received artesunate rather than quinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of oxidative stress and free haem The fundamental characteristic of blackwater fever is&#xD;
      the presence of massive haemolysis of both infected and uninfected erythrocytes and release&#xD;
      of free haemoglobin. The free haem is highly cytotoxic, and an important scavenger of nitric&#xD;
      oxide, promoting endothelial damage and is proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      renal injury and cerebral malaria. When the degree of intravascular haemolysis exceeds the&#xD;
      capacity of plasma haptoglobin to bind the haemoglobin released from red blood cells, free&#xD;
      haemoglobin is then filtered by the glomeruli and enters the renal tubules. In a series of&#xD;
      renal biopsies, fine and coarse haemoglobin granules are present in the proximal tubules,&#xD;
      while haemoglobin casts and granular casts predominate in the distal and collecting tubules&#xD;
      in patients with blackwater fever and intravascular haemolysis. This classic theory of renal&#xD;
      damage by tubular precipitation is challenged by recent findings of reversing oxidative&#xD;
      properties of free haem can prevent renal damage. The free haemoglobin present is pathogenic&#xD;
      as the ferrous haem can be oxidized to the ferric state (FeIII) subsequently conferring&#xD;
      peroxidase activity to the haemoglobin. Consequently, the haemoglobin can reduce&#xD;
      hydroperoxides, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and lipid hydroperoxides, which generate the&#xD;
      ferryl state (FeIV=O) of haemoglobin and a globin protein radical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haem Fe(III) protein + H2O2 --&gt; haem [Fe(IV)=O] proteinâ€¢ + H+ + H2O The ferryl haem and&#xD;
      protein radical can then generate lipid radicals by oxidation of free and&#xD;
      phospholipid-esterified unsaturated fatty acids. The arachidonic side chains of membrane&#xD;
      phospholipids are particularly vulnerable to this free radical-mediated damage in the complex&#xD;
      cascade of lipid oxidation leading to the generation of F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs) and&#xD;
      isofurans (IsoFs). Evidence suggests that F2-isoPs generated by the haemoprotein-catalyzed&#xD;
      oxidation of lipids are responsible for the oxidative damage and vasoconstriction associated&#xD;
      with renal injury in the setting of hemolytic disorders and rhabdomyolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracetamol and oxidative stress A novel mechanism of paracetamol was recently demonstrated,&#xD;
      showing that paracetamol acts as a potent inhibitor of haemoprotein-catalyzed lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation by reducing ferryl haem to its less toxic ferric state and quenching globin&#xD;
      radicals. This effect is enhanced 14-fold in an acidic milieu. In a recent proof of concept&#xD;
      trial, paracetamol at therapeutic levels was shown to significantly decrease oxidant injury&#xD;
      in the kidney, improve renal function and reduce renal damage by inhibiting the&#xD;
      haemoprotein-catalyzed lipid peroxidation, mediated by redox cycling of the haem moiety of&#xD;
      myoglobin, in a rat model of rhabdomyolysis-induced renal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Since adults with severe malaria and blackwater fever associated with haemolysis&#xD;
      demonstrate increased concentrations of cell-free haemoglobin, severe acidosis and urinary&#xD;
      F2-IsoPs, the investigators hypothesize that this novel inhibitory mechanism of paracetamol&#xD;
      may provide renal protection in this population by reducing the haemoprotein-induced lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation. As there is currently no consensus that exists concerning adequate medical&#xD;
      treatment for blackwater fever, the potential application of this safe and extensively used&#xD;
      drug would be of great benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed activities The main activity proposed is a randomised open label controlled study of&#xD;
      paracetamol in patients with severe falciparum malaria to assess its modulating effect on&#xD;
      renal function and oxidative stress.&#xD;
