    <textblock>
      Drug resistance resulting from emergence of Imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL clones is a&#xD;
      significant problem in Ph positive ALL patients because after a very good initial response to&#xD;
      one TKI inhibitor, many patients relapse within one year, relapse being almost always&#xD;
      associated with a BCR-ABL kinase domain point mutation. The patients who relapse after&#xD;
      treatment with one TKI can be rescued to remission with another TKI, but the second remission&#xD;
      is usually shorter than the previous one. A more potent TKI inhibitor, and pan-active not&#xD;
      only on all the BCR-ABL variants (including the second generation TKI resistant T315I&#xD;
      mutant), but also on others molecular targets can do better. In this context, Ponatinib is a&#xD;
      novel synthetic orally active tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), specifically developed to&#xD;
      inhibit BCR-ABL, the fusion protein that is the product of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)&#xD;
      in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and in a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL).&#xD;
      It potently inhibits the BCR-ABL protein as well as mutated forms of the protein that arise&#xD;
      in patients resistant to prior therapies with TKIs. Ponatinib has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      inhibit all the mutations that have been detected so far, in vitro and in vivo and to&#xD;
      uniformly suppress the emerge of single-mutant clones in a mutagenesis assay. In the Phase II&#xD;
      study, 41% of Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients treated&#xD;
      with Ponatinib achieved major hematologic response, 47% had a major cytogenetic response, 38%&#xD;
      obtained a complete cytogenetic response, showing that Ponatinib provides significant benefit&#xD;
      despite previous intolerance or refractoriness to other TKIs. The Phase I trial showed that&#xD;
      patients with a more recent diagnosis had increased rates of major molecular response: 79%&#xD;
      for 14 patients with 0 to 5 years since diagnosis vs. 29% for 14 patients with more than 5 to&#xD;
      9 years since diagnosis (P=0.02) and 27% for 15 patients with more than 9 to 24 years since&#xD;
      diagnosis (P=0.009). These characteristics support the hypothesis for a role of Ponatinib not&#xD;
      only in patients resistant to prior TKI therapy but also in untreated ALL Ph+ patients, in&#xD;
      order to prevent the emergence of resistant caused by the selection of mutated Ph+ clones and&#xD;
      in order to avoid rapid progression of the disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, phase 2, single arm unblinded trial of oral Ponatinib in patients&#xD;
      with Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Patients will receive daily oral administration of&#xD;
      Ponatinib at a dose of 45 mg/day for 6 weeks (defined as one course) for 8 courses, same dose&#xD;
      and schedule, for a total of 48 weeks. Each patient will be followed for the subsequent 24&#xD;
      months, every 3 month, providing survival information and monitoring serious adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient should be treated for a minimum of 6 weeks. Then a patient can be discontinued&#xD;
      in the following situation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the end of first course (6 weeks), in case of lack of CHR;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the end of third course (18 weeks), in case of lack of CCgR;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any time in case of loss of CHR or CCgR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they remain on therapy after 48 weeks, they will be able to continue treatment during the&#xD;
      extension phase of the study, if it is of interest of the patient, or they will be allowed to&#xD;
      receive any treatment that is in their interest. For all the patients remaining on trial,&#xD;
      response, outcome and toxicity will be followed for the subsequent 24 months.The 6-weeks&#xD;
      periodicity must be rigidly respected, irrespective of the temporary discontinuation of study&#xD;
      drug (eg, if a patient will take Ponatinib only for 4 weeks and will remain off-treatment for&#xD;
      the subsequent two weeks because of AE, when the 7th week begins this patient will restart&#xD;
      Ponatinib as a second course, as per protocol). Prednisone (P) will be administered to all&#xD;
      patients for 7-14 days, before Ponatinib, so as to make it possible to wait for the results&#xD;
      of cytogenetic and molecular tests, and to evaluate the response to P alone, hence for&#xD;
      another 21 days. Intrathecal therapy (IT) with MTX/AraC/DEX is mandatory, every 28 days, in&#xD;
      patients without clinical-cytologic evidence of meningeal involvement. In patients with CNS&#xD;
      disease, IT is performed twice weekly until a complete clearance of cerebrospinal fluid blast&#xD;
      cells is achieved, hence once weekly for 4 weeks, hence once monthly.&#xD;
