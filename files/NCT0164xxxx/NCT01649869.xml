  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation&#xD;
      valganciclovir treatment for up to 54 children (up to 4 years of age) with&#xD;
      virologically-confirmed congenital CMV infection and hearing loss. Subject participation will&#xD;
      be over a six-month period and study subjects will be stratified according to age. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to assess whether a six-week course of oral valganciclovir can stabilize&#xD;
      the hearing of children with congenital CMV infection who present with hearing loss.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most frequent known viral cause of mental&#xD;
      retardation, and is the leading non-genetic cause of sensorineural hearing loss in many&#xD;
      countries including the United States. This is a Phase II international, multi-center,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of 6 weeks of oral valganciclovir treatment or 6&#xD;
      weeks of placebo for fifty-four male and female infants/toddlers 1 month through 3 years of&#xD;
      age (up to 4 years of age) with virologically-confirmed congenital CMV infection and hearing&#xD;
      loss. Patient who are between 1 month and 4 years of age and who have SNHL (Sensorineural&#xD;
      Hearing Loss) and are eligible for enrollment. The expected study duration is 3.5 years from&#xD;
      enrollment of first study subject. The primary objective is to assess whether a six week&#xD;
      course of oral valganciclovir can stabilize the hearing of children with congenital CMV&#xD;
      infection who present with hearing loss. The secondary objective is to define the following&#xD;
      responses as a function of systemic exposure to ganciclovir (active metabolite of&#xD;
      valganciclovir): CMV viral load in blood; CMV viral load in urine; and CMV viral load in&#xD;
      saliva. Also, to define the safety and tolerability of valganciclovir in enrolled subjects.&#xD;
      The tertiary objective is to define the pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir (metabolite)&#xD;
      following administration of valganciclovir (prodrug) in enrolled subjects.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Ears That Had (1) Improved Hearing or no Change in Hearing (2) Worsened Hearing.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>A single, independent study audiologist who is masked (blinded) to treatment assignment will assess the audiology test battery for each subject and assign the classifications of normal hearing, mild hearing loss, moderate hearing loss, or severe hearing loss based upon their hearing thresholds (in decibels). The classifications will be assigned by ear (one for the left ear and one for the right ear), giving &quot;total ear&quot; classifications. At the analyses stage, the &quot;best ear&quot; classification for the subject at that study visit will be determined; for example, if a subject had mild hearing loss in their left ear and severe hearing loss in their right ear, then the &quot;best ear&quot; classification will be mild hearing loss. Not both ears are evaluable for all subjects. In some subjects, only one ear is evaluable.</description>

For this outcome, we combine the improved hearing and no change for the special case only of normal to normal. Other category include worsened and no change from (1) mild to mild hearing loss, (2) moderate to moderate hearing loss, or (3) severe to severe hearing loss.</description>

    <measure>Association of Change in Viral Load (Blood) With Change in Total Ear Hearing at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of actual viral load was done using log base 10 transformation. Undetectable viral load value was replaced by a value of 10. A summary measure of the viral load over time considers all time points available by calculating the average area under the curve (AUC) (trapezoidal rule) applied to the log base 10 viral load. Average is based on the maximum period of time with viral load data for a given subject. The average or standardize AUC units is therefore the original AUC units of log 10 copies/ml*days divided by days in study which equals log 10 copies/ml.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>For this study, subjects were enrolled once they signed the informed consent form (ICF). It was not until after hearing loss was confirmed by audiology testing and confirmation of congenital CMV by dried blood spot that a subject was randomized and started on study drug. This reduced protocol enrollment from 54 to 35.</recruitment_details>

        <title>Number of Ears That Had (1) Improved Hearing or no Change in Hearing (2) Worsened Hearing.</title>
        <description>A single, independent study audiologist who is masked (blinded) to treatment assignment will assess the audiology test battery for each subject and assign the classifications of normal hearing, mild hearing loss, moderate hearing loss, or severe hearing loss based upon their hearing thresholds (in decibels). The classifications will be assigned by ear (one for the left ear and one for the right ear), giving &quot;total ear&quot; classifications. At the analyses stage, the &quot;best ear&quot; classification for the subject at that study visit will be determined; for example, if a subject had mild hearing loss in their left ear and severe hearing loss in their right ear, then the &quot;best ear&quot; classification will be mild hearing loss. Not both ears are evaluable for all subjects. In some subjects, only one ear is evaluable.</description>

        <description>A single, independent study audiologist who is masked (blinded) to treatment assignment will assess the audiology test battery for each subject and assign the classifications of normal hearing, mild hearing loss, moderate hearing loss, or severe hearing loss based upon their hearing thresholds (in decibels). The classifications will be assigned by ear (one for the left ear and one for the right ear), giving &quot;total ear&quot; classifications. At the analyses stage, the &quot;best ear&quot; classification for the subject at that study visit will be determined; for example, if a subject had mild hearing loss in their left ear and severe hearing loss in their right ear, then the &quot;best ear&quot; classification will be mild hearing loss.</description>

        <title>Association of Change in Viral Load (Blood) With Change in Total Ear Hearing at 6 Months</title>
        <description>Analysis of actual viral load was done using log base 10 transformation. Undetectable viral load value was replaced by a value of 10. A summary measure of the viral load over time considers all time points available by calculating the average area under the curve (AUC) (trapezoidal rule) applied to the log base 10 viral load. Average is based on the maximum period of time with viral load data for a given subject. The average or standardize AUC units is therefore the original AUC units of log 10 copies/ml*days divided by days in study which equals log 10 copies/ml.</description>

        <title>Association of Change in Viral Load (Blood) With Change in Best Ear Hearing at 6 Months</title>
        <description>Analysis of actual viral load was done using log base 10 transformation. Undetectable viral load value was replaced by a value of 10. A summary measure of the viral load over time considers all time points available by calculating the average area under the curve (AUC) (trapezoidal rule) applied to the log base 10 viral load. Average is based on the maximum period of time with viral load data for a given subject. The average or standardize AUC units is therefore the original AUC units of log 10 copies/ml*days divided by days in study which equals log 10 copies/ml.</description>
