  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malfunction of mechanical heart valves due to clot formation is a potentially devastating&#xD;
      complication. It often results in heart failure, death or stroke. This condition occurs&#xD;
      frequently in patients with mechanical valves in developing countries because they are unable&#xD;
      to monitor and adjust the dose of blood thinning medications. The best treatment modality for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with this condition is not known. There is no reliable data from&#xD;
      clinical trials to guide treatment and there are no firm guidelines. Treatment with&#xD;
      clot-busting drugs is most commonly used because these drugs (e.g., streptokinase) are&#xD;
      readily available, cheap, and easy to use. However, this treatment is associated with high&#xD;
      rates of treatment-related side-effects (death, life-threatening bleeding and stroke).&#xD;
      Moreover, some recent studies suggest that clot-busting drugs may not be as efficacious in&#xD;
      restoring valve function, as previously believed. Emergency surgery is less often used&#xD;
      because it is more expensive and the required facilities and manpower are not available at&#xD;
      all times at all places. But there is evidence to suggest that surgery results in better&#xD;
      success rates with a lower risk of bleeding and stroke. Well-designed prospective randomised&#xD;
      trials (the &quot;gold-standard&quot; for reliable evidence) comparing the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the two modalities, are needed to help doctors in developing countries&#xD;
      make informed decisions when treating patients with clotted mechanical heart valves. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to perform a randomised controlled trial comparing emergency surgery&#xD;
      with treatment with clot-busting agents in patients with clotted mechanical valves. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted over 4 years at a single, university hospital in a developing country. This&#xD;
      study will determine how often patients who are treated with surgery will be discharged from&#xD;
      hospital, with completely restored valve function, without having suffered a stroke or&#xD;
      life-threatening bleeding, when compared to those who received clot-busting drugs. The&#xD;
      investigators will also find out which of the treatments is safe and cost-effective.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Left-sided prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT) is a potentially devastating complication which&#xD;
      can affect patients with mechanical heart valves. It occurs frequently in developing&#xD;
      countries because of poor anticoagulation quality. The best modality for treating this&#xD;
      condition is not known. Most of the available data is from retrospective studies and case&#xD;
      series, and current guidelines are based largely on expert opinion. Therefore recommendations&#xD;
      for treatment vary widely. Fibrinolytic therapy (FT) is the most commonly used treatment&#xD;
      because fibrinolytic agents such as streptokinase are readily available, cheap, and easy to&#xD;
      use. However, FT is associated with high rates of treatment-related adverse effects (death,&#xD;
      major bleeding and stroke). Moreover, recent studies suggest that FT may not be as&#xD;
      efficacious in restoring valve function, as previously believed. Emergency surgery is less&#xD;
      often used because it is more expensive and the required facilities and manpower are not&#xD;
      available at all times at all places. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available&#xD;
      literature that the investigators performed, suggests that surgery may result in better&#xD;
      success rates with a lower risk of major bleeding, stroke and non-CNS systemic embolism.&#xD;
      Evidence from well designed randomised controlled trials is needed to determine the optimal&#xD;
      treatment of left-sided PVT. The investigators propose to do a single-centre, open-label,&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial comparing emergency surgery with FT for the treatment of&#xD;
      symptomatic patients with left-sided PVT. The primary outcome is the occurrence of a complete&#xD;
      clinical response, defined as discharge from hospital with completely restored valve&#xD;
      function, in the absence of stroke, major bleeding or non-CNS systemic embolism. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare the safety of the two interventions and quality of life at&#xD;
      discharge and at 1 year. The investigators will also assess the cost-effectiveness of surgery&#xD;
      compared to FT from a societal perspective in the context of the Indian healthcare system&#xD;
