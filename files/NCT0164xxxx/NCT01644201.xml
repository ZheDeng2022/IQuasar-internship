  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One out of two adults in Canada is currently overweight and therefore at increased risk for a&#xD;
      number of medical conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, heart attacks and&#xD;
      stroke. Obesity is less prevalent in populations consuming large amounts of dietary fibre,&#xD;
      suggesting that fibre intake could play an important role in prevention and progression of&#xD;
      obesity and diabetes and other conditions. Several studies have suggested that fibre has a&#xD;
      positive effect on blood sugar and may help lower body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to help better understand the effect of adding fibre&#xD;
      supplementation to a low calorie diet on blood sugar control and weight loss. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that blood sugar control will improve in participants in the fibre&#xD;
      supplementation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women, with stable Type 2 Diabetes (e.g. no medication change in the last 3 months),&#xD;
      between 18 - 75 years of age, and with a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 27 - 60 kg/m2 can&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;
