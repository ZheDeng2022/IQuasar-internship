      The aim of the study was to assess whether the behavior, anxiety, and pain of pediatric&#xD;
      patients during dental treatment improves when a cartoon film is viewed or a videogame is&#xD;
      played as methods of distraction.&#xD;

      Each patient required a minimum of 2 visits for restorative treatment in a mandibular&#xD;
      quadrant and had undergone a previous restorative dental experience. All parents or guardians&#xD;
      of the children who participated in the study were informed about the study before enrolment,&#xD;
      and gave their voluntary consent. Each visit lasted approximately 35 minutes and involved&#xD;
      restorative treatment in a mandibular quadrant with an alveolar nerve block. The parents were&#xD;
      not present in the operating room during the treatment. The maximum time between the 2&#xD;
      treatment sessions was 2 weeks. Before the start of each treatment session, as a part of the&#xD;
      standard process of a paediatric dental visit, the child was given an explanation as to what&#xD;
      the visit would comprise, with the aim of interrupting the treatment as little as possible.&#xD;
      The children knew at the beginning of the first appointment (control) that they would be able&#xD;
      to watch a movie or play a videogame during their next visit.&#xD;
