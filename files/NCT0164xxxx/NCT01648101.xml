  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immediate release (IR) formulation of retigabine has been shown to be superior to placebo&#xD;
      as adjunctive therapy in 3 adequate and well-controlled studies in subjects with&#xD;
      drug-resistant partial-onset seizures (POS) who had previously failed to respond to two or&#xD;
      more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and were still having seizures despite current treatment with&#xD;
      1, 2, or 3 AEDs. However, of 1244 subjects randomly assigned to treatment in these 3 clinical&#xD;
      studies, only 10 were Asian subjects and only 5 of these Asian subjects were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to treatment with retigabine. Therefore, this Phase III study is being conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and health outcomes of retigabine, at doses&#xD;
      of 900 mg/day and 600 mg/day, compared with placebo in adult Asian subjects with&#xD;
      drug-resistant POS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and health&#xD;
      outcomes of 2 doses of retigabine immediate release (IR) (GW582892) compared with placebo in&#xD;
      adult Asian subjects with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures (POS) who are already taking&#xD;
      1, 2, or 3 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group study will compare retigabine IR at doses of 900 mg/day and 600 mg/day taken&#xD;
      in equally divided doses three times a day with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design includes an 8-week Screening/Baseline Phase, a 16-week Treatment Phase&#xD;
      (4-week Titration Phase and 12-week Maintenance Phase), and a 4-week Transition or&#xD;
      Taper/Follow-up Phase. Approximately 500 subjects will be screened and enrolled with&#xD;
      approximately 354 subjects randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1:1&#xD;
      (retigabine 900 mg/day, retigabine 600 mg/day, or placebo). The total duration of the study&#xD;
      for each subject will be approximately 28 weeks. At the end of the Maintenance Phase,&#xD;
      eligible subjects will be given the opportunity to enrol in an open-label extension study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of responders, defined as subjects with&#xD;
      &gt;/=50% reduction in 28 day total POS frequency, from the Baseline Phase to the Maintenance&#xD;
      Phase, in subjects randomly assigned to retigabine 900 mg/day compared with placebo. The key&#xD;
      secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of responders, defined as subjects with &gt;/=50%&#xD;
      reduction in 28 day total POS frequency, from the Baseline Phase to the Maintenance Phase, in&#xD;
      subjects randomly assigned to retigabine 600 mg/day compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability endpoints are incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs);&#xD;
      proportion of subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation; change from Baseline in vital&#xD;
      sign measurements and weight; change from Baseline in electrocardiogram parameters; change&#xD;
      from Baseline in haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis parameters; changes from Baseline in&#xD;
      American Urological Association Symptom Index and post-void residual bladder ultrasound&#xD;
      volumes; and summary of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.&#xD;

    <description>A responder is defined as a par. with &gt;=50% reduction in the 28 day total partial on-set seizure (POS) frequency from the Baseline Phase (BP) to the MP, randomly assigned to retigabine 900 mg/day compared with placebo. The total 28-day POS rate was defined as: (total number of POS over the evaluable period (MP) / number of days of seizure (sz) data in the evaluable period) *28 days. In the event of one or more innumerable seizures (IS) occurring on a day, these were to be counted as an additional 10 seizures for that day, regardless of the number of occurrences of IS on that day. The number of applicable days in a phase for seizure data is calculated as: the end date of MP minus start date of the MP minus days on which seizures were recorded as &quot;Not done&quot; + 1). Each occurrence of status epilepticus (SE) was counted as 1 seizure (whether partial or not).</description>

             appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms).&#xD;
             However, if indicated, this should be confirmed by estradiol and follicle-stimulating&#xD;
             hormone levels consistent with menopause (according to local laboratory ranges). Women&#xD;

             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are currently following or planning to follow a ketogenic diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been treated with felbamate or vigabatrin within the 6 months prior to Screening.&#xD;
             If a subject has been previously treated with vigabatrin &gt;6 months prior to Screening,&#xD;
             a visual perimetry test performed within 6 months prior to Screening must show normal&#xD;
             visual fields or no worsening of recognised visual field abnormalities as compared&#xD;
             with prior to vigabatrin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are using central nervous system (CNS)-active medication (other than concomitant AED&#xD;
             therapy), unless the subject has been stabilised on such medication for more than 1&#xD;
             month prior to Screening; or currently taking medications known to lower seizure&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have a history of urinary retention or risk factors for urinary retention that in the&#xD;
             investigator's judgment could potentially affect subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any medical condition that, in the investigator's judgment, is considered to be&#xD;
             clinically significant and could potentially affect subject safety or study outcome,&#xD;
             including but not limited to: clinically significant cardiac, renal, or hepatic&#xD;
             conditions; or a condition that affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism or&#xD;
             excretion of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Randomisation Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must also meet the following criteria at the end of the Baseline Phase (Visit 3)&#xD;
        and before randomisation and administration of the first dose of study medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a documented 28-day total POS frequency rate of ≥4 POS over an 8 week Baseline&#xD;
             Phase. Note: In subjects with simple partial seizures, although all seizures occurring&#xD;
             during the Baseline Phase will be collected, only seizures with motor signs will be&#xD;
             counted toward qualification for meeting the randomisation criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have not had a seizure-free period of ≥21 consecutive days during the Baseline Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have not had innumerable seizures (defined as an episode of seizure activity lasting&#xD;
             &lt;30 minutes during which several seizures occur with such frequency that the&#xD;
             initiation and termination of each individual seizure cannot be distinguished) during&#xD;
             the 8 week Baseline Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have not had an episode of status epilepticus (other than simple partial status&#xD;
             epilepticus) during the 8 week Baseline Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have not required dose adjustments of concurrent AEDs, addition of new AEDs,&#xD;
             discontinuation of existing AEDs, changes to VNS settings, or acute use of&#xD;
             benzodiazepines for the treatment of seizures during the Baseline Phase.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures (POS) who were taking 1, 2, or 3 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with or without vagus nerve stimulator (VNS); had a 28-day total POS frequency rate &gt;=4 seizures; and did not have a period of &gt;=21 consecutive days without a POS over the 8-week Baseline Phase were enrolled in this study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>76 participants (par.) were randomized to study treatment; 75 par. comprised the Intent-to-Treat Population (par. who were randomly assigned to treatment, received &gt;=1 dose/any portion of a dose of study medication, had Baseline [BL] seizure data, and had &gt;=1 post-BL seizure record between the Titration Phase and the end of the Maintenance Phase).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Placebo</title>
          <description>Participants entered a 16-week Treatment Phase (TrP) consisting of a 4-week Titration Phase (TiP) and a 12-week Maintenance Phase (MP). In the TiP, participants received matching placebo in increasing doses. Participants that could not tolerate the titration or withdrew were discontinued from the study and entered the Taper/Follow-up Phase (TaP/FUP). Participants who tolerated titration entered the MP and continued to receive the same dose regimen for 12 weeks. After completing the MP, participants who opted to enroll in the open-label extension (OLE) study entered the 4-week Transition Phase (TnP). In the TnP, participants received active retigabine in increasing doses starting at 300 milligrams per day (mg/day), 450 mg/day, 600 mg/day, and 750 mg/day, respectively, in each of 4 weeks. Participants that did not enroll in the OLE study completed a 3-week TaP and 1 week of FUP.</description>

          <description>Participants entered a 16-week TrP consisting of a 4-week TiP and a 12-week MP. In the TiP, participants received a starting dose of retigabine (RTG) 300 mg/day that increased by 150 mg/day per week until a target dose of 600 mg/day was reached. Participants that could not tolerate the titration or withdrew were discontinued from the study and entered the TaP/FUP. Participants who tolerated titration entered the MP and continued to receive 600 mg/day for 12 weeks. After completing the MP, participants who opted to enroll in the OLE study entered the 4-week TnP. In the TnP, participants received RTG 600 mg/day for 3 weeks and RTG 750 mg/day in the last week. Participants that did not enroll in the OLE study completed a 3-week TaP and 1 week of FUP.</description>

In the TiP, participants received a starting dose of retigabine (RTG) 300 mg/day that increased by 150 mg/day per week until a target dose of 600 mg/day was reached. Participants that could not tolerate the titration or withdrew were discontinued from the study and entered the TaP/FUP. Participants who tolerated titration entered the MP and continued to receive 600 mg/day for 12 weeks. After completing the MP, participants who opted to enroll in the OLE study entered the 4-week TnP. In the TnP, participants received RTG 600 mg/day for 3 weeks and RTG 750 mg/day in the last week. Participants that did not enroll in the OLE study completed a 3-week TaP and 1 week of FUP.</description>

        <title>Number of Placebo and Retigabine 900 mg Responders During the Maintenance Phase (MP)</title>
        <description>A responder is defined as a par. with &gt;=50% reduction in the 28 day total partial on-set seizure (POS) frequency from the Baseline Phase (BP) to the MP, randomly assigned to retigabine 900 mg/day compared with placebo. The total 28-day POS rate was defined as: (total number of POS over the evaluable period (MP) / number of days of seizure (sz) data in the evaluable period) *28 days. In the event of one or more innumerable seizures (IS) occurring on a day, these were to be counted as an additional 10 seizures for that day, regardless of the number of occurrences of IS on that day. The number of applicable days in a phase for seizure data is calculated as: the end date of MP minus start date of the MP minus days on which seizures were recorded as &quot;Not done&quot; + 1). Each occurrence of status epilepticus (SE) was counted as 1 seizure (whether partial or not).</description>

        <title>Number of Responders From the BP to the Treatment Phase (TrP)</title>
        <description>A &quot;responder&quot; is defined as a participant experiencing a &gt;=50% reduction in the 28-day total POS frequency from the BP to the TrP (TiP plus MP). The 28-day total POS frequency was calculated as: (total number of PS over the time period of interest [TrP] / number of applicable days in that period) * 28. In a case of one or more occurrences of IS on a day, these seizures were to be counted as an additional 10 seizures for that day, regardless of whether the IS were PS or not, and regardless of the number of occurrences of IS on that day. The number of applicable days in a phase for seizure data is calculated as: the end date of the TrP minus the start date of the TrP minus days on which seizures were recorded as &quot;Not Done&quot; during the TrP plus 1). Each occurrence of SE was counted as 1 seizure (whether partial status or not).</description>

A participant was considered to be seizure free during the MP if he/she had no record of countable seizures of any type, no IS, and no SE during the MP. Participants who had one or more days on which they recorded seizures as &quot;Not Done&quot; on the seizure calendar were not disqualified from being considered as seizure free for that day. Participants who did not complete the study or experienced any seizures in the MP were not considered to be seizure free. A participant who completed the study AND had no seizures during the maintenance phase were counted to be seizure free. Also, a completer who only had seizures during the TiP is considered seizure free.</description>

          <description>A seizure free-day is defined as a day with non-missing seizure data but without any seizures. A participant was considered to be seizure free during the MP if he/she had no record of countable seizures of any type, no IS, and no SE during the MP. Participants who had one or more days on which they recorded seizures as &quot;Not Done&quot; on the seizure calendar were not disqualified from being considered as seizure free for that day. Participants who did not complete the study or experienced any seizures in the MP were not considered to be seizure free. A participant who completed the study AND had no seizures during the maintenance phase were counted to be seizure free. Also, a completer who only had seizures during the TiP is considered seizure free.</description>

          <title>Incidence of New Seizure Types During the TrP in Participants Without a History of the Indicated Seizure Types at Baseline</title>
          <description>A participant was considered to have new seizure types during the TrP if they experienced a new seizure types (such as SE, myoclonic, absence, secondary generalization) and had no prior history of these seizure types. At Screening, a history of previous seizure types was collected, with &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;No,&quot; &quot;IS,&quot; &quot;SE,&quot; or &quot;Unknown&quot; being recorded for each of the seizures types. The history of seizure types was updated during the 8-week BP as pre-treatment status. New types of seizures during the TrP were recorded as A1=simple PS with motor signs; AX=simple PS without motor signs; B=complex PS; C=PS evolving to secondary generalized seizures; D1=absence of seizures; D2=myoclonic seizures; D3=clonic seizures; D4=tonic seizures; D5=tonic-clonic seizures; D6=atonic seizures; E=unclassified seizures; and SE=status epilepticus.</description>
