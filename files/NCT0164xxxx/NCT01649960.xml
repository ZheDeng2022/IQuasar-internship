      The investigators will do the study in two phases. The first phase will be a pilot study on&#xD;
      up to 18 participants [patients 60 years or older with coronary artery disease (CAD)&#xD;
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG)&#xD;
      or patients who are eligible to undergo and participate in cardiac rehabilitation (CR)]; up&#xD;
      to 6 participants each will be given oral daily rapamycin (0.5, 1, and 2mg) dose for the&#xD;
      duration of CR. Baseline and follow-up data will be collected for age-associated impairment&#xD;
      (AAI): frailty (primary endpoint) and quality of life (QOL),senescent-associated secretory&#xD;
      phenotype (SASP)and abdominal/thigh subcutaneous adipose biopsy for measurement of adipocyte&#xD;
      mitochondrial DNA copy number and to quantitate the number of senescent preadipocytes. Safety&#xD;
      of rapamycin will be assessed by periodic clinical follow-up, blood draws, and serum&#xD;
      rapamycin levels. Following completion of the pilot phase, the data will be analyzed. If&#xD;
      favorable changes are noted in the SASP or AAI, the investigators will start a phase 2&#xD;
      randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second phase: In a prospective, randomized, clinical trial design, patients 60 years or older&#xD;
      will be randomized at the time of CR to a standardized exercise protocol, or exercise&#xD;
      protocol with the addition of low-dose rapamycin to test the hypothesis whether low-dose&#xD;
      rapamycin (demonstrated in the pilot trial to improve SASP/AAI) will improve measures of AAI,&#xD;
      SASP, or findings on the fat biopsy as compared to exercise alone. The null hypotheses are&#xD;
      that there is no improvement with rapamycin in measures of AAI or SASP.&#xD;

      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study: Patients, 60 years or older, selected for this single-center open label pilot&#xD;
      study will be consented for participation at initiation of CR following PCI or CABG. We will&#xD;
      enroll up to 18 patients; no more than 6 patients will receive a dose at one of the three&#xD;
      proposed levels:0.5mg, 1.0mg, and 2mg daily oral rapamycin for the duration of CR (typically&#xD;
      12 weeks). We will perform physical performance tests for frailty assessment, short-form 12&#xD;
      for quality of life, and tests for SASP [(IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 3, and&#xD;
      monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) 1], and abdominal/thigh subcutaneous adipose biopsy for&#xD;
      measurement of adipocyte mitochondrial DNA copy number and to quantitate the number of&#xD;
      senescent preadipocytes. at baseline and at the conclusion of CR. Fasting lipid panel will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and at the completion of CR. Baseline complete blood count, liver, and&#xD;
      kidney functions will be performed. These tests will be repeated at 14 days, 30 days, 8&#xD;
      weeks, and at the completion of CR. Serum rapamycin levels will be measured at 7, 14, 30&#xD;
      days, and at the completion of CR. The serum levels of the drug will be kept below 6ng/ml. If&#xD;
      the drug levels were found to be higher, next low dose of the medication will be prescribed.&#xD;
      Participants with serious side effects (appendix) from the medications will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in sets of three. Thirty days of monitoring must pass on all three&#xD;
      subjects before three more may be enrolled. The first three patients will be assigned to the&#xD;
      0.5 mg dose level. If two patients of those three have serious adverse events, the pilot&#xD;
      study will be terminated. If 1 of 3 patients has an serious adverse event, we will enroll&#xD;
      three more subjects at the 0.5 mg level. If those three have no serious events or if there&#xD;
      were no events in the first three subjects, then we will proceed to enroll three subjects at&#xD;
      the 1.0mg level. Otherwise, if there are 2 or more serious events in the 6 patients assigned&#xD;
      to 0.5mg, we will terminate the study. We will proceed similarly with the 1.0 mg level before&#xD;
      enrolling patients to the 2.0 mg level. If we observe 2 serious events at the 1.0 mg level&#xD;
      and only 3 patients have been enrolled at the 0.5mg level, we will finish the pilot by&#xD;
      enrolling 3 more at the 0.5 mg level. Similarly, if we observe 2 serious events at the 2.0 mg&#xD;
      level and only have 3 subjects (with 0 events) at the 1.0 level, we will enroll 3 more at the&#xD;
      1.0 level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Trial: The Cardiac rehabilitation And Rapamycin in Elderly (CARE) study is a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, phase 2 clinical trial that will be done at Mayo Clinic, Rochester,&#xD;
      MN. The pool of potential study participants will consist of all patients 60 years or older&#xD;
      with CAD who are referred to the CR following PCI or CABG. To minimize the drop out rate, we&#xD;
      will obtain consent at the end of first week of CR participation, since most patients who&#xD;
      quit CR do so in the first week. Consent will be obtained by the study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, assessments of height, weight, and blood pressure will be made,&#xD;
      and all participants will have a chemistry 15 panel, complete blood cell count, and an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram. Race and ethnicity will be self-reported. Baseline demographic,&#xD;
      angiographic, and other relevant clinical and laboratory data will be entered prospectively&#xD;
      into a database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical parameters: The mechanisms through which rapamycin retard cellular senescence and&#xD;
      extend life span are still unclear. With this aim, a better understanding of effects of&#xD;
      rapamycin on inflammation, mitochondrial DNA copy number, quantitation of senescent&#xD;
      preadipocytes and diverse biomarkers of aging could be demonstrated. To assess the effect of&#xD;
      CR, we will assess these parameters at baseline and then at the completion of the CR program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SASP: Proinflammatory biomarkers, IL-6, MMP 3 and MCP 1 will be studied (ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either regular CR, or CR with the addition of&#xD;
      0.5mg/1.0mg/2.0mg of rapamycin. The lowest dose of rapamycin that demonstrates potential to&#xD;
      reduce SASP, and/or improve AAI in the pilot trial will be used.&#xD;
