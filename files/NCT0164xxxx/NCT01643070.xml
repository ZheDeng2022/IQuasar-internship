      To investigate the feasibility of preoperative chemoradiation with oxaliplatin plus&#xD;
      capecitabine, with or without prior induction chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      or marginally resectable rectal cancer with resectable synchronous liver metastases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative chemoradiation is now an initial treatment of choice for locally advanced&#xD;
      resectable rectal cancer, and 5-fluorouracil is the standard agent during chemoradiation.&#xD;
      Capecitabine is an oral fluoropyrimidine which has been thought to be a replacement for&#xD;
      intravenous 5-fluorouracil, and several trials have proved that preoperative chemoradiation&#xD;
      with capecitabine was also effective in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin, a newer platinum agent, plus fluoropyrimidines (either 5-fluorouracil or&#xD;
      capecitabine) is one of the standard cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimen for metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, and it is also proved to be effective as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for&#xD;
      patients with liver only metastasis from colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 25% of patients with colorectal cancer have liver metastases initially at the&#xD;
      time of diagnosis and there have been quite well established evidences for clear survival&#xD;
      benefits from hepatic metastasectomy in these patients. Treatment for colorectal liver&#xD;
      metastases should be planned with consideration of both systemic chemotherapy and local&#xD;
      treatment modality (surgery or radiofrequency ablation) because long term survival would be&#xD;
      expected after curative liver metastasectomy. As mentioned previously, neoadjuvant&#xD;
      oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidines before hepatic metastasectomy improved disease-free&#xD;
      survival, thus it is thought to be that better systemic controls would be achieved with&#xD;
      perioperative oxaliplatin based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, preoperative chemoradiation with&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidines improves local control but not systemic control. Recent randomized trials&#xD;
      of preoperative chemoradiation with oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidines failed to show better&#xD;
      local control rates than those with fluoropyrimidines alone. But it is too early to determine&#xD;
      the non-superiority of preoperative chemoradiation with oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidines in&#xD;
      terms of systemic control; long-term duration of follow-up is needed to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy in terms of disease-free or overall survival and it is evident that oxaliplatin&#xD;
      based chemotherapy is effective for systemic control in patients who will be candidate for&#xD;
      liver metastasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators planned a randomized phase II trial of preoperative chemoradiation&#xD;
      with oxaliplatin plus capecitabine, with or without prior induction chemotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced or borderlinely resectable rectal cancer with resectable synchronous&#xD;
      liver metastases.&#xD;
