    <textblock>
      An open-label study to assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerance of FCR001 cell therapy in&#xD;
      adult recipients 3-12 months after kidney transplantation from a living donor.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, preliminary efficacy, and overall benefit&#xD;
      of FCR001 cell therapy in previously transplanted recipients of a kidney from a living donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FCR001 is a novel, cryopreserved allogeneic somatic cell therapy, derived from mobilized&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the same donor as the allograft, and containing&#xD;
      hematopoietic progenitor cells, facilitating cells, and αβ T cells. The rationale is to&#xD;
      establish durable chimerism and donor-specific tolerance in the recipient enabling freedom&#xD;
      from chronic immunosuppression (IS) and its associated toxicities.&#xD;
