  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Important health benefits of meditation may be conferred as much by what people actually do&#xD;
      and say in their daily lives as by how they self-perceive the effect of training on their&#xD;
      behavior and emotions. To test this hypothesis, and to explore whether specific elements of&#xD;
      meditation (e.g. compassion vs. mindfulness) have different effects on real-world social&#xD;
      behavior, the current project proposes to use the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) in&#xD;
      a randomized, longitudinal design to objectively measure whether meditation does indeed make&#xD;
      people behave in happier, kinder and more prosocial ways in their daily lives. This design&#xD;
      will permit an exploratory analysis of how such behavioral transformations might relate to&#xD;
      subjective reports of meditative effects. To accomplish these objectives, 108 medically&#xD;
      healthy adults will be randomized to 8 weeks training in compassion meditation (n=36),&#xD;
      Mindfulness Attention Training (MAT) (n = 36) or to an active control condition consisting of&#xD;
      a health education discussion group (n=36). Prior to randomization and again upon completion&#xD;
      of these interventions, all subjects will participate in an EAR protocol to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of meditation training on their real-world prosocial and affiliative behavior. Based&#xD;
      on prior research and direct pilot data from 25 participants, prosocial and affiliative&#xD;
      behavior will be assessed as the amount of (1) shown empathy and affection, (2) laughing vs.&#xD;
      sighing, (3) arguing and complaining, (4) time spent interacting with others vs. alone, (5)&#xD;
      meaningful conversations, (6) socially inclusive (i.e. use of &quot;we&quot;/us&quot;) vs. self-focused&#xD;
      (i.e. use of &quot;I&quot;/me&quot;) first person language. Following the first EAR assessment, subjects&#xD;
      will commence 8 weeks of compassion meditation training, MAT, or attendance in the health&#xD;
      discussion group. Following these interventions subjects will participate in EAR monitoring&#xD;
      identical to the initial assessment. To assess whether changes in daily behavior are&#xD;
      sustained over a longer period, all subjects will undergo a final EAR assessment 6 months&#xD;
      following completion of the study interventions. Self-report measures of social integration&#xD;
      and support and behavioral/lifestyle variables that might be associated with EAR outcomes&#xD;
      will be evaluated prior to each EAR assessment and treated as covariates.&#xD;
