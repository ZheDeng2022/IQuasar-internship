      After up to 7-day screening period, Eligible Patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment&#xD;
      groups, and begin treatment with BTDS 5mg, 10mg,20mg for 7 days.Venous blood will be&#xD;
      collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96,120, 144,168,169,170,171,172,174,180,192,216,&#xD;
      240 h postdose respectively.Plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine will&#xD;
      be analyzed to determine the following pharmacokinetic parameters: AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax,&#xD;
      Tmax, t½.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects will be randomized to receive either a single dose of BTDS 5, or BTDS 10, or BTDS 20 for 7 days. Plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine will be analyzed to determine the following pharmacokinetic parameters: AUC0-t:pg•hr/ml-Area under the plasma concentration-time curve frame: predose,6,12,24,36,48,60,72,96,120,144,168,169,170,171,172,174,180,192,216,240 hours post-dose.AUC0-inf:pg•hr/ml-Area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity. Cmax: pg/ml-Maximum observed plasma buprenorphine concentration. Tmax: hrs-time at which Cmax is first observed. t½: Apparent half life of buprenorphine elimination.</description>
