      Hypothesis: The primary objective of this study is to assess whether using a flow measurement&#xD;
      device, in this case the Transonics flow device, as an end-point to interventional treatment&#xD;
      of diseased dialysis fistulae can help increase immediate treatment success in terms of&#xD;
      quality of dialysis immediately following the treatment and increasing time to&#xD;
      reintervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized study. All intervention will be carried out by experienced&#xD;
      radiologists in the two study centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least fifty (50) consecutive subjects meeting the eligibility criteria, scheduled for&#xD;
      angiographic assessment (with a view to PTA if necessary), will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      the study. Subjects who consent will undergo their procedure, which will be performed by a&#xD;
      qualified interventional radiology doctor (IRD). Patients will be randomly allocated to each&#xD;
      group. All previous Transonics measurements will be available to the treating IRD. A target&#xD;
      flow rate will be pre-decided in all patients in consultation with the nephrology service.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will undergo a fistulogram, a routine interventional Xray exam where&#xD;
           radiocontrast media (RCM) is injected under X ray control to identify narrowings within&#xD;
           the vessels. Significant lesions will be identified based on this exam. If a lesion is&#xD;
           believed to be significant, the patient will be assigned to either arm of the study. The&#xD;
           details of the disease present will be recorded as location and percentage stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the control arm, an initial Transonic measurement pre-treatment will be performed.&#xD;
           The interventionalist will select the most significant lesion based on angiographic&#xD;
           appearances and treat this lesion, which may require use of multiple balloons for the&#xD;
           same lesion. At this point a Transonics measurement will be taken - Measurement A. The&#xD;
           results will not be revealed to the interventionalist, who will proceed with the&#xD;
           procedure as per their standard practice. A Transonics measurement will be taken after&#xD;
           treatment of each of the significant lesions identified at the start of the exam. A&#xD;
           post-procedural Transonics measurement (Measurement X) will also be taken, again the&#xD;
           interventionalist will blinded as to this result. The appearances on completion&#xD;
           angiography will be recorded as percentage stenosis remaining.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the Transonics arm, a pre-treatment Transonic measurement will be done. The lesions&#xD;
           will be treated. Once Measurement A is obtained, the interventionalist will only be&#xD;
           informed if the target value has been reached or not, they will not be told the actual&#xD;
           value. This will be repeated for the treatment of each subsequent lesion, with the&#xD;
           interventionalist being informed if the target had been reached, whilst being blinded as&#xD;
           to the Transonics result, until the target has been achieved. The interventionalist will&#xD;
           not pursue further treatment, regardless of the Transonics measurement, if he deems it&#xD;
           would pose a greater risk of complication to the patient, than his/her standard&#xD;
           practice. The appearances on completion angiography will be recorded as percentage&#xD;
           stenosis remaining.&#xD;
