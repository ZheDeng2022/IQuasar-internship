      Main objective:To evaluate the effectiveness of the &quot;Diabetes Self-Management Programme&quot;&#xD;
      (DSMP) on the metabolic control, cardiovascular risk reduction, quality of life and&#xD;
      self-efficacy in adult patients with type 2 diabetes, compared with current standard care of&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes, in the context of Osakidetza's Primary Care network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of the implementation of DSMP in the use of health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of DSMP in the cost of treatment of the involved population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the improvement in physical activity and diet patterns among the&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the feasibility of implementing the DSMP in the Basque Country's primary&#xD;
           health care system Methodology: Randomized clinical trial in which patients diagnosed&#xD;
           with type 2 diabetes aged between 18 and 80 years pertaining to 4 primary regions of the&#xD;
           Basque country, who agree to participate in the study, will be randomly assigned to two&#xD;
           groups: the intervention group (the DSMP programme) and the control group. The&#xD;
           intervention will be performed by trained patients with type 2 diabetes and health&#xD;
           professionals and it will consist in 6 group sessions of two and a half hours each, on a&#xD;
           weekly basis with a overall duration of 6 weeks. The session content includes techniques&#xD;
           for dealing with problems, promotion of exercise, nutrition concepts, proper use of&#xD;
           medication, effective communication and basic knowledge about diabetes and its&#xD;
           complications. The sessions are supported with educational material. The main outcome is&#xD;
           the improvement of HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) levels. Secondary outcomes are reduction&#xD;
           of cardiovascular risk, increase of quality of life and self-efficacy. The results will&#xD;
           be analyzed at 6, 12 and 24 months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: An educational intervention on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus based on&#xD;
      the program DSMP conducted by previously trained lay persons and health professionals,&#xD;
      improve metabolic control as measured on a 0.5% decrease in Hb A1c (Clar, 2010),compared to&#xD;
      regular health education. On the other hand, it is expected to see improvements in the&#xD;
      quality of life for these patients. The intervention may reduce the weight and cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk due to changes in the physical activity and diet patterns, getting to a more appropriate&#xD;
      use of health services and medication. It is expected that changes in the variables occur 6&#xD;
      months after the intervention and remain over the time&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of chronic diseases (CD) is a challenge for health services. The health system&#xD;
      must provide a more efficient and coordinated care for people with CD aimed at reducing their&#xD;
      decompensation and improving the quality of life for both the patient and his/her family. In&#xD;
      this task, primary care (PC) plays a key role (Bengoa, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The better living conditions and the current development of health care have produced a&#xD;
      demographic shift in population, resulting in increased life expectancy and therefore the&#xD;
      prevalence of CD. In the Basque Country (BC), the population over 65 has increased in recent&#xD;
      years by 25% (EUSTAT 2005). According to the BC Health Survey of 2007, prevalence of CD is&#xD;
      increasing in our community as 83.5% of men and 86.1% of women over 65 have a chronic disease&#xD;
      (Arcelay, 2009). In the health system, 80% of primary care consultations are caused by CD,&#xD;
      representing 60% of hospital admissions and 70% of health spending (Bengoa, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) in the BC has also increased in recent years.&#xD;
      Currently, it is estimated that the prevalence of DM2 may be up to 12% in people over 30&#xD;
      years. An evaluation of the diabetic population coverage in primary care records estimates&#xD;
      that up to 4% of the diabetic population remains undiagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in people with DM2 is higher than in the general&#xD;
      population. The mortality rate for diabetes is between 13 and 30 deaths per 100,000 people&#xD;
      per year. 75% of patients with diabetes die due to cardiovascular disease, especially&#xD;
      coronary heart disease. Between 6.3% and 7.4% of the spending in our health care system is&#xD;
      deemed to be caused by diabetes. Self-promotion has a paramount importance in diabetes care&#xD;
      (diabetes Strategy in the National Health System, 2007). It is estimated that 42% of&#xD;
      diabetics in our community are obese, 79.6% are hypertensive and 22% have diabetic&#xD;
      macroangiopathy (Arteagoitia, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control of diabetes in our country, according to the latest assessment of the&#xD;
      preferential offer of the BC, can be improved. 44% are well-controlled diabetic patients,&#xD;
      i.e. A1 Hb less than 7%, and only 25% have blood pressure (BP) below 140/90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data contrast with those obtained in the final report of the GEDAPS (Red Group Study of&#xD;
      Diabetes in Primary Health Care, 2010) covering the year 2007, in which the figures were 59%&#xD;
      for HbA1c and 65,1% for BP. One of the proposals, raised by the group GEDAPS to improve&#xD;
      control of patients, is the increase of educational activities to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in other developed countries, the health system in Spain has completed a cycle and&#xD;
      requires a new organizational model to meet the challenge of chronic patient care (Department&#xD;
      of Health Basque Government, 2010). There are different proposals to meet that challenge.&#xD;
      Among the most developed and evaluated, we find the models for managing chronic diseases&#xD;
      (Chronic Care Model) and the Pyramid Model of Risk (Bengoa, 2008). In both programs,&#xD;
      self-care and education involving the subject's participation in the management of their&#xD;
      disease have a critical role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this change in the management of chronic disease, several health administrations&#xD;
      have suggested self-management education programs by non-professionals. The most widely used&#xD;
      and structured approach, with the greatest evidence of its effectiveness, is the Chronic&#xD;
      Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) of Stanford University, which has been implemented in&#xD;
      12 countries, including UK´s Expert Patient Programme, Australia´s Partners in Health and&#xD;
      Canada's Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CDSMP is based on the self-efficacy theory of Albert Bandura, a social cognitive theory,&#xD;
      which states that the key predictors of successful change in behaviour are confidence&#xD;
      (self-efficacy) in the ability to perform an action and the prospect of achieving a&#xD;
      particular goal (expected outcome). Self-efficacy is considered the first step in the causal&#xD;
      pathways of behavior change in self-care programmes. Increased self-efficacy is a&#xD;
      prerequisite for behaviour change through an improvement in the treatment of chronic disease,&#xD;
      resulting in lower demand for health care (Foster, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CDSMP was designed at Stanford University in California. It was developed and evaluated&#xD;
      for 20 years, through randomized controlled trials (Gordon, 2008). The first program was the&#xD;
      &quot;Course of arthritis self-management&quot; which later became the prototype of the following&#xD;
      courses of self-management. They have developed a specific self-management course for&#xD;
      diabetes, &quot;Diabetes Self-Management Programme (DSMP)&quot;, which in the Spanish version is called&#xD;
      &quot;Manejo Personal de la Diabetes (MPD)&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient is trained through structured courses, to complete personal action plans&#xD;
      designed to take control of his life with chronic illness. The mission of the leaders, two in&#xD;
      each course, is to assist patients in problem solving, decision making and self-efficacy.&#xD;
      Leaders are usually non-professionals with one or more chronic diseases, but caregivers of&#xD;
      chronic patients could act as leaders as well&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education by non-professionals differs from education provided by professionals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Commonly they live with chronic illnesses so they can act as role models for&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The format is less formal in order to promote discussion on ways of self care that&#xD;
           participants consider useful, and might not feel able to discuss in a program run by&#xD;
           professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lay leaders, especially for certain ethnic groups, can provide a subtle but important&#xD;
           interpretation of health advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is a self-management education programme taught by non-professionals (DSMP) for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes living in the Basque Country more effective than regular health education, evaluated&#xD;
      in terms of improvement in HbA1c, quality of life, self-efficacy,cost and other clinical&#xD;
      variables(BP, cardiovascular risk, BMI, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for the novelty of the question, the expected progress beyond what is currently&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many systematic reviews (SR) about the effectiveness of these models have been published&#xD;
      (Foster, 2007) (Gordon, 2008) (Bury, 2005). RS conducted by Chodosh (Chodosh et al., 2005),&#xD;
      limited to old people, found benefits in outcome variables (blood pressure and glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin) in diseases such as diabetes and hypertension but not in osteoarthritis. The&#xD;
      Cochrane's SR (Foster, 2007) evaluated 17 clinical trials (EK), none of them taking place in&#xD;
      our environment, and includes references that appear in the report of the NICE (Bury, 2005).&#xD;
      Seven of the studies were on CDSMP. The diseases included were arthritis, diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension and chronic pain. Their conclusions differ from Chodosh's, because Cochrane's SR&#xD;
      obtains small but significant differences in self-rated health, aerobic physical exercise and&#xD;
      cognitive treatment of symptoms but no evidence on variables such as psychological health,&#xD;
      quality of life or number of visits to the general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Spain, Andalucía (Andalusian School of Public Health) and Catalonia (Catalan Health&#xD;
      Institute) have experience in chronic disease programmes following this model. Both cases had&#xD;
      preliminary favourable results. However, they have not been evaluated prospectively and&#xD;
      neither of them has been compared with usual care or with other structured programs (Gonzalez&#xD;
      Mestre, 2009)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A very recent study, performed in another health care setting (male veterans in the U.S.),&#xD;
      has shown that an educational intervention conducted by patients is more effective in&#xD;
      glycemic control than educational intervention conducted by nurses (Heisler, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another recently published study conducted in primary care in Ireland using also patients has&#xD;
      not been shown effective in patients with type 2 diabetes. The program used is not the&#xD;
      Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme (CDSMP) (Smith, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although educational group interventions by health care professionals have proven&#xD;
      effectiveness (Deakin, 2008), they are not a regular practice in Osakidetza's Primary Care&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, we can conclude from the literature review that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are no assessments by prospective controlled studies of these interventions in our&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The heterogeneity in the outcomes of interventions is a fact, due to the different&#xD;
           lengths of studies, type of interventions and populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no long-term assessment of effectiveness of these models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is an under-representation of children and men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publications evaluating these models suggest the following research areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-centered evaluation of clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design-studies that evaluate the use of health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost-effectiveness studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Influence of the different components of interventions on outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative research on the way that participants experience interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the discrepancy between the findings of the various publications, such as those in the&#xD;
      NHS, and the lack of research in our country, we reaffirm the need for research in our&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of the question&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health department of the BC is supporting a new management strategy for chronic patient&#xD;
      according to the Chronic Care Model (http://cronicidad.euskadi.net). One of the cornerstones&#xD;
      of this model is the promotion of self-care and education of the population. Following that&#xD;
      idea, the strategy wants to promote the &quot;Active Patient Programme &quot;. This programme is based&#xD;
      on the CDSMP and the DSMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DM2 is a chronic disease whose management is currently carried out in our community in&#xD;
      Primary Care (PC) and in which nursing has always had a fundamental role. PC professionals in&#xD;
      our community have broad experience in the clinical management of diabetes in both individual&#xD;
      patient education and treatment to prevent long term complications. Nursing has an added&#xD;
      motivation, as one of the strategic lines of the current health department is the involvement&#xD;
      of this group in the new ways of managing chronic illness. Nurses will likely accept programs&#xD;
      that promote these new roles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, implementing this programme does not require expensive new material&#xD;
      resources or complicated infrastructure. These programs may be conducted within daily&#xD;
      activities of our health facilities although it may be necessary to use venues outside the&#xD;
      health system as cultural centers, neighbourhood associations, etc…&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the strengths of the program is the simplicity of its implementation. The program is&#xD;
      designed to be led by patients who, after specific training and receiving standardized&#xD;
      material support, are capable of directing groups. These patients are people with chronic&#xD;
      illness, who voluntarily offered themselves to help other patients to learn how to self&#xD;
      manage their disease.&#xD;
