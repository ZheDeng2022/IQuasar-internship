      Stimulating the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) may restore a disturbed balance as seen in&#xD;
      depression. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial the investigators will&#xD;
      test the effects of a single dose (500mg) fludrocortisone, an MR-agonist, on the information&#xD;
      processing in healthy female volunteers (N = 2x20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to investigate whether the acute administration of fludrocortisone&#xD;
      (FC) in healthy females enhances the appraisal of emotional information related to&#xD;
      depression, hypothesizing that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FC relative to placebo selectively improves the recognition of happy and fearful faces:&#xD;
           resulting in more correct responses and faster RTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FC induces a bias towards more positive self-description and an improved memory for&#xD;
           positive information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female participants were selected because the haplotype MRI180V is related to depression&#xD;
      vulnerability in women, not in men. If the effects of fludrocortisone are comparable to the&#xD;
      effects of antidepressants on the same tests and the same population, it might be a first&#xD;
      indication that fludrocortisone may function as an antidepressant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We found in depressed individuals, compared with non-depressed controls, that MRs had a&#xD;
      decreased (approximately -30%) expression in hippocampus, inferior frontal gyrus and&#xD;
      cingulate gyrus. It is proposed that decreased expression of MRs is part of the underlying&#xD;
      pathological process in depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have revealed considerable interpersonal differences with regard to the&#xD;
      functioning of the MRs. Firstly, common MR gene polymorphisms influence the cortisol&#xD;
      awakening response (CAR). Secondly, clinical populations differ in observed depressive&#xD;
      symptoms as a function of MRI180V genotype. This MR I180V gene variant showed less activity&#xD;
      in vitro, which suggests that functionality in vivo is decreased. Finally, MR haplotype 2,&#xD;
      which is prevalent in 35% of the Caucasian population, enhances the transcription,&#xD;
      translation and transactivation of the MR. This haplotype is associated with higher&#xD;
      dispositional optimism, fewer thoughts of hopelessness and lower risk of major depression.&#xD;
      These effects are restricted to pre-menopausal women. This suggests that female sex steroids&#xD;
      may interact with the MR gene, thereby modulating resilience. Indeed, it has been shown that&#xD;
      progesterone and oestrogen modulate MR-expression in rats. Taken together, mineralocorticoid&#xD;
      receptors in the brain are considered to be a new target for the treatment of stress related&#xD;
      disorders like depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fludrocortisone (9Î± fluoro-hydrocortisone) (FC) is a specific MR-agonist currently used to&#xD;
      treat diseases of the adrenal cortex, septic shock (Russel, 2008) and occasionally&#xD;
      orthostatic hypotension. It is shown that FC significantly inhibits nocturnal HPA axis&#xD;
      activity without first depleting MR receptors with an MR-antagonist. This suggests FC have&#xD;
      interesting implications in disorders of HPA axis excess, such as depression. Consistent with&#xD;
      the idea that the stimulation of the MR might be useful in the treatment of depression,&#xD;
      fludrocortisone accelerated the antidepressant effects of the SSRI escitalopram, at least in&#xD;
      those patients who responded to escitalopram. This is in line with a previous observation&#xD;
      that spironolactone, a MR antagonist, decreased the efficacy of the antidepressant&#xD;
      amitriptyline in depressed patients. These studies show that stimulation of the MR might be a&#xD;
      useful addition to the treatment of depression. Though, the explanatory mechanism behind&#xD;
      these observations remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a first step in investigating the potential antidepressant effects of MR&#xD;
      stimulation by fludrocortisone. We will test the effects of FC on indices of emotional&#xD;
      information processing in healthy volunteers, which is a recently validated model of&#xD;
      antidepressant drug action. It has been demonstrated repeatedly that a single dose of an&#xD;
      antidepressant changes the processing of emotionally relevant information in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, within a few hours after administration. For instance, one dose of citalopram&#xD;
      improved the recognition of facial expressions of fear and happiness relative to placebo in&#xD;
      healthy female volunteers. This finding has been replicated with different antidepressants&#xD;
      and different populations.&#xD;
