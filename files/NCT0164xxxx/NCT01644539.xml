  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The amount and kind of food which is ingested influences the regulation of meal size. Neural&#xD;
      signals from the gastrointestinal tract travel via the vagus nerve to the brainstem and&#xD;
      thalamus, which projects to the rest of the brain, in particular the hypothalamus, amygdala&#xD;
      and primary sensory cortices. In neuroimaging studies in which the stomach was distended with&#xD;
      a gastric balloon activation was observed in the right insula, left posterior amygdala, left&#xD;
      posterior insula, left inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex. So far, no study&#xD;
      has examined the effects of the ingestion or infusion of a food on the brain. In addition to&#xD;
      neural signals, hormonal signals are important for meal termination. Hormones like insulin,&#xD;
      ghrelin and cholecystokinin interact with gastric as well as sensory signals in the process&#xD;
      of satiation, which ultimately leads to meal termination. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the interaction between food administration, hormone responses and brain&#xD;
      responses. To this end an oral or intra-gastric load will be administered while measuring&#xD;
      brain activity (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and hormone concentrations. Subjects&#xD;
      will participate in one trainings session and in three functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) sessions (35-min fMRI scan). A training session will take 40-minutes and consists of&#xD;
      placing a naso-gastric tube and ingesting 500 ml of chocolate milk orally. The fMRI sessions&#xD;
      will consist of three conditions: in condition one (A) 500ml of chocolate milk will be&#xD;
      administrated orally. In condition two (B) and three (C) an intra-gastric load of 500 ml is&#xD;
      administrated.&#xD;

      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening: Before inclusion in the study, potential subjects will complete a screening&#xD;
           questionnaire Subjects will then be informed about their eligibility. Also the procedure&#xD;
           and risks will be explained. If they decide to participate, they will fill in and sign&#xD;
           the standard MRI-screening form and the informed consent form. Also a training session&#xD;
           date will be planed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Training session: When subjects want to participate and match to the criteria a training&#xD;
           session will be planned. During this training session a naso-gastric tube will be&#xD;
           inserted by a qualified nurse (according to the &quot;maagsonde-protocol&quot; UMC Utrecht). After&#xD;
           insertion of the tube subjects rest to allow water used to assist insertion of the tube&#xD;
           to leave the stomach and to become comfortable with the tube. During this insertion the&#xD;
           nurse and the subject can see if a subject can handle the naso-gastric tube and can or&#xD;
           will participate in the study. Subjects will rate hunger, fullness, thirst, desire to&#xD;
           eat, prospective consumption, nauseous, and anxiety on a VAS scale. To simulate the&#xD;
           position in the MR scanner, subjects will be asked to lie down on a doctors table. A&#xD;
           towel will be placed under need there right side, in this way the stomach will be more&#xD;
           in the position when standing/sitting, this is to simulate normal gastric filling. A&#xD;
           tube will be placed between the teeth of the subject (like a straw) after which an oral&#xD;
           load of 500 ml will be ingested through the tube in the month. This ingestion will be&#xD;
           driven by a pomp (100ml/min), which simulates a sip systematically. First 200 ml will be&#xD;
           ingested, then there will be a pause of 30 seconds, second the next 150 ml will be&#xD;
           pumped, following again a 30 second rest period, then the last 150 ml will be ingested.&#xD;
           The subjects know the rate and speed of the sips and can stop the pomp on command when&#xD;
           necessary. The subject will also hear a tone just before the sip is ingested. Here a&#xD;
           subject learns to drink with a naso-gastric tube placed and when lying down. After&#xD;
           ingestion the subjects will fill in the same questionnaire again. The naso-gastric tube&#xD;
           will be removed after the rating. This training session will take about 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessments and procedures on the study days: All subjects will be asked to arrive in&#xD;
           the morning after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. The evening before the scan&#xD;
           subjects will be ask to eat a standardized meal given by the researchers (AH kant &amp;&#xD;
           klaar). An appetite questionnaire will be filled in (hunger, fullness, thirst, desire to&#xD;
           eat, quantity to eat, desire to eat something sweet or savory, nauseous, and anxiety).&#xD;
           An intravenous cannula will be placed by a qualified person. Next, the naso-gastric tube&#xD;
           will be placed (same procedure as training session). After the subject has been placed&#xD;
           in the scanner (as in the training session with a towel under need there right side);&#xD;
           one blood draw will be done for baseline measurements (e.g. glucose, insulin,&#xD;
           cholecystokinin and ghrelin for every time point). The appetite questionnaire will be&#xD;
           filled in again in the scanner. A reference and anatomic scan will be done. Now the fmri&#xD;
           session begins; after five minutes of baseline scanning, food administration will start&#xD;
           (t = 0). This consists of administration of the intra gastric load through the&#xD;
           naso-gastric tube (caloric or non-caloric) or of ingestion of the caloric load through a&#xD;
           tube (oral). Blood will be drawn at t = 2.5, t = 5, t = 10, t = 15 and at t = 30 min.&#xD;
           Before every blood sample subjects will give fullness and nausea ratings. One of the&#xD;
           researchers will stand next to the subject/scanner during the whole experiment. If&#xD;
           aspiration occurs a researcher will be there to help immediately. The researchers also&#xD;
           make sure a subject knows how to get out of the scanner as quick as possible if&#xD;
           aspiration occurs. At t = 30 min the subject will be taken out the scanner and fill in&#xD;
           the appetite questionnaire. The naso-gastric tube and intravenous cannula will be&#xD;
           removed. Subsequently subjects will be provided with an ad libitum breakfast buffet at t&#xD;
           = 45 min. Food weight and macro-nutrient intake will be recorded. After breakfast the&#xD;
           appetite questionnaire is filled in once more.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood sampling and storage: On the study day, a 10 ml blood sample will be drawn by&#xD;
           certified experienced medical personnel. Blood samples will be put on ice immediately&#xD;
           and then centrifuged at 1730 × g for 10 min at 4 ˚C. Blood material from the collection&#xD;
           tubes will be split into two portions and stored, one portion for the analyses and one&#xD;
           portion as a backup. Blood serum will be stored at -80 ˚C at the Rudolf Magnus Institute&#xD;
           until sample collection is complete. Only RMI laboratory personnel and the investigators&#xD;
           will have access to the samples. Blood samples will be coded as follows: P01, P02, etc.&#xD;
           The key to this code will only be known by the principal and medical investigators and&#xD;
           not by the personnel performing the blood analyses. Samples will be kept for 10 years&#xD;
           and then destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Naso-gastric tube: A qualified nurse will place the naso-gastric tube. The placement&#xD;
           will go according to the 'maagsonde -protocol' (UMC Utrecht). After insertion of the&#xD;
           tube subjects rest to allow water used to assist insertion of the tube to leave the&#xD;
           stomach and to become comfortable with the tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Withdrawal of individual subjects: Subjects can leave the study at any time for any&#xD;
           reason if they wish to do so without any consequences. The investigator can decide to&#xD;
           withdraw a subject from the study for urgent medical reasons. Each subject who does not&#xD;
           complete the study for any reason will have a post-study screening by the end of the&#xD;
           particular study day to ensure that the drop-out is not the result of a structural&#xD;
           problem. Data of subjects who withdrew prematurely will be used for statistical&#xD;
           analyses, as far as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Replacement of individual subjects after withdrawal: In case subjects withdraw during&#xD;
           the study (fMRI sessions), they will not be replaced. If a subject decides not to&#xD;
           participate during the training session a new subject will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Follow-up of subjects withdrawn from treatment: Subjects who withdraw from the study&#xD;
           will not be followed up, unless they withdraw because of an adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Post-study screening: Subjects will be asked how they experienced the study procedures.&#xD;
           This information, if the subject is willing to share it, will be used to evaluate (the&#xD;
           burden of) the study protocol.&#xD;
