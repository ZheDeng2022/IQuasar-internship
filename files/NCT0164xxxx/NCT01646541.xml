  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with mitral valve disease are symptomatic with shortness of breath and a&#xD;
      limited activity level prior to mitral valve surgery. Despite surgical repair or replacement&#xD;
      of the mitral valve, many patients remain symptomatic with an impaired ability to live an&#xD;
      active lifestyle. Often after extensive evaluation, no other pulmonary, left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction, or valvular heart disease is responsible for the continued symptoms, and some of&#xD;
      these patients will be limited by persistent pulmonary hypertension (PH) at rest or with&#xD;
      exertion that is responsible for limiting their activity level and impacting their quality of&#xD;
      their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is our goal in the proposed study to systematically characterize symptomatic and&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients greater than six months after mitral valve surgery using clinical data,&#xD;
      echocardiographic evaluation, laboratory assessment, and in some patients, invasive&#xD;
      hemodynamic measurements. The investigators will screen asymptomatic and symptomatic patients&#xD;
      with resting echocardiography and also with echocardiography during exercise, as many&#xD;
      patients will exhibit exercise-induced PH following mitral valve surgery. Pulmonary artery&#xD;
      (PA) pressure will be estimated from echocardiography using Doppler-derived calculations. If&#xD;
      elevated PA pressures are observed with echocardiography, then symptomatic patients will&#xD;
      undergo right heart catheterization for invasive pressure measurement, which is the&#xD;
      gold-standard for the diagnosis of PH. When PH is present and there is a normal wedge&#xD;
      pressure (PCWP) during invasive pressure measurement, further assessment to identify&#xD;
      potential candidates for PH therapy will be performed. This involves having patients breathe&#xD;
      inhaled nitric oxide, a rapid-acting, pulmonary vasodilator with a short half-life. While&#xD;
      breathing inhaled nitric oxide, blood pressure, PA pressure, PCWP, and cardiac output will be&#xD;
      monitored to characterize individuals who could benefit symptomatically from pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      to treat underlying PH. It is important to note that only a small minority of patients&#xD;
      exhibit a positive vasodilator response and those with PH and a normal PCWP without an&#xD;
      initial vasodilator response would still be identified as candidates for chronic PH therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information generated from this proposed research will make a significant contribution to&#xD;
      the understanding of PH in a group of patients in whom it has not been previously studied.&#xD;
      Scientific reports on the evaluation of patients with PH after mitral valve surgery are&#xD;
      almost nonexistent from the modern era. Furthermore, patients with PH due to mitral valve&#xD;
      disease have been excluded from clinical trials of agents currently approved by the U.S. Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat PH. Therefore, this work will carefully characterize&#xD;
      PA pressures in an objective manner in a group of patients following mitral valve surgery who&#xD;
      remain limited with respect to their activity levels. In addition, the investigators will&#xD;
      gain a better understanding of the frequency with which patients have PH and a normal PCWP,&#xD;
      which identifies a cohort of patients who could have an improvement in their symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life with chronic vasodilator treatment.&#xD;
