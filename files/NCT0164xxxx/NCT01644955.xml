  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the toxicity and safety of carboplatin administered by&#xD;
      convection enhanced delivery into the tumor in patients with high grade glial neoplasms. This&#xD;
      study is a dose escalating study, (the dose of the study drug is increased at set time&#xD;
      points). Carboplatin is in a class of drugs known as platinum-containing compounds; it slows&#xD;
      or stops the growth of cancer cells in your body. Convection enhanced delivery involves&#xD;
      placing one or more catheters into the brain and delivering chemotherapy through those&#xD;
      catheters directly into the brain&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose and define the toxicity profile of carboplatin&#xD;
      delivered intracerebrally via convection enhanced delivery (CED) for patients with high grade&#xD;
      glial neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine the efficacy as defined by six-month progression free survival (PFS), median&#xD;
      progression free survival, overall survival, and the radiographic response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the drug distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo craniotomy and then receive carboplatin intracerebrally via&#xD;
      convection-enhanced delivery (CED) over 72 hours.&#xD;
