      Study preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To progress this prospective study, the investigators analyzed the retrospective data of&#xD;
           426 patients who had been managed with conventional critical pathway after gastric&#xD;
           cancer surgery during last 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Through this retrospective analysis, we decided the inclusion criteria which showed&#xD;
           significantly the lower complication rate and shorter hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method for Prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who enroll in this prospective study are administered and are supplied a liquid&#xD;
           diet one day before surgery without bowel preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After gastric cancer surgery, they start sips of water on postoperative first day, and&#xD;
           they are discharged once they exhibit at least three times soft diet without specific&#xD;
           complaint and had normal clinical status and physical examination.&#xD;

      Enrollment of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the patients are enrolled in this study, they give us informed consents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A liquid diet is supplied beginning from the morning of the day prior to operation to&#xD;
           the midnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operation and postoperative management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All procedures are approached by laparoscopic surgery, and partial gastrectomy with&#xD;
           lymph node dissection are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients who are considered to be difficult to progress early oral feeding in&#xD;
           surgical field are excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasogastric tube is not applied to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative pain is managed by non-opioid pain killer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients are started on sips of water on the first postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If they are tolerable, a liquid diet is started on the second postoperative day, and a&#xD;
           soft diet on a third postoperative day for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have a plan to discharge the patients on the fourth postoperative day if they exhibit&#xD;
           at least three times soft diet without specific complaint and had normal clinical status&#xD;
           and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The patients are followed up to 30 days after discharge from hospital, and we check whether&#xD;
      they are tolerable without any compliant and are readmitted.&#xD;
