      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving implantation rates in ICSI cycles has been the focus of research in recent decades.&#xD;
      Because success rates is not satisfactory enough especially when transferring good embryos to&#xD;
      the uterine cavity and pregnancy does not occur. Trying to improve endometrial receptivity,&#xD;
      the investigators have thought about stem cell therapy as stem cells have played a pivotal&#xD;
      role in regenerative medicine in many pathologies as myocardial infarction, Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
      and spinal cord injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Garget and Healy reported in 2011 treatment of a case with Asherman's syndrome by&#xD;
      administration of bone marrow stem cells in the uterine cavity. Endometrial growth and&#xD;
      improved vascularity has been observed by ultrasound follow-up and Doppler study of&#xD;
      endometrial blood flow. Endometrial regeneration has been enough to support pregnancy through&#xD;
      successful IVF trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have succeeded in previous work to isolate MSC from placental tissue and&#xD;
      differentiate it to endometrium-like cells. The investigators compared the differentiation&#xD;
      ability of placental derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and Wharton Jelly derived MSC to&#xD;
      differentiate to endometrium under 3 different culture conditions: endometrium conditioned&#xD;
      medium (ECM), follicular fluid (FF) conditioned medium and medium containing both. The&#xD;
      investigators found that placental MSC has better differentiating ability to endometrium&#xD;
      especially under culture conditions containing both ECM and FF as evidenced by prominent&#xD;
      appearance of glandular pattern and expression of progesterone receptors in differentiated&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the investigators need to direct this study and test the effect of placental&#xD;
      derived MSC in improving implantation rates in patients with recurrent implantation failure,&#xD;
      unresponsive endometrium to ovulation induction drugs or with endometrial atrophy or advanced&#xD;
      maternal age planning for ICSI trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients attending Kasr El-Aini assisted reproduction unit and private IVF center will be&#xD;
      randomized to three groups by computer generated programs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group, patients randomized to receive differentiated stem cell therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ovum pick-up, MSC differentiated to endometrium is deposited in the uterine cavity&#xD;
      through an IUI catheter. Embryo transfer will be done at day 5 at the blastocyst stage to&#xD;
      allow enough time for endometrial regeneration and increased endometrial receptivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group, patients randomized to receive undifferentiated stem cell therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately postmenstrual undifferentiated MSC is deposited in the uterine cavity through an&#xD;
      IUI catheter to allow enough time for the MSC to differentiate as it needs 7-10 days for&#xD;
      differentiation. Ovum pick-up will be done as usual while all other steps will be the same&#xD;
      including embryo transfer which will be done at day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third group, control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to receive no stem cell therapy; All ICSI steps from ovulation&#xD;
      induction protocol to embryo transfer conditions will be the same for all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be taken from the patients after detailed explanation of all steps of&#xD;
      the procedure.&#xD;
