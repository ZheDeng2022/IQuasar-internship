  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about an experimental drug called sEphB4-HSA (recombinant albumin fusion&#xD;
      protein sEphB4-HSA). This research study will be the first time sEphB4-HSA is given to&#xD;
      people. sEphB4-HSA prevents tumor cells from multiplying and blocks several compounds that&#xD;
      promote the growth of blood vessels that bring nutrients to the tumor. sEphB4-HSA has shrunk&#xD;
      colon, lung, breast, glioma, melanoma, prostate and Kaposi's sarcoma tumors in mice&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      sEphB4-HSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the dose limiting toxicities and adverse event profile of sEphB4-HSA in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the pharmacokinetics of sEphB4-HSA. IV. To describe the anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      of sEphB4-HSA as manifested by responses to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To obtain preliminary evaluation of effect of sEphB4-HSA on absolute circulating tumor&#xD;
      cell (CTC) numbers as compared with pre-treatment levels using pre- and during treatment CTC.&#xD;
      Exploratory evaluation of effect of sEphB4-HSA on downstream protein mediators of the Ephrin&#xD;
      pathway (pAKT, pSrc) and their transcriptional target genes (rgs5 and psenen) will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To collect pilot information to identify a dose or doses with biologic activity. Biologic&#xD;
      activity after treatment with sEphB4-HSA will be defined as evidence of drug-on-target effect&#xD;
      as manifested by reduction in absolute CTC numbers. Other exploratory evaluations of&#xD;
      drug-on-target effect such as increase in transcript levels of psenen or rgs5 may be&#xD;
      considered in the assessment of biologic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients will be assigned to receive recombinant&#xD;
      EphB4-HSA fusion protein intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes in one of the following treatment&#xD;
      schedules:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Weekly treatment - administered on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days&#xD;
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Every 2 weeks treatment - administered on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Every 3 weeks treatment - administered on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
