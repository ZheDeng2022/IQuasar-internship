  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been a growing interest in recent years on cancer stem cells (CSC) and their&#xD;
      implication in cancer biology and therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSCs refer to a subset of tumor cells that has the ability to self-renew and generate the&#xD;
      diverse cells that comprise the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These cells have been termed cancer Stem cells to reflect their 'stem-like' properties and&#xD;
      ability to continually initiate and sustain tumorigenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSCs share important properties with normal tissue stem cells, including self-renewal (by&#xD;
      symmetric and asymmetric division) and differentiation capacity, albeit aberrant.&#xD;
      Multilineage differentiation, however, is not a mandatory feature of a CSC. Furthermore,&#xD;
      these cells are thought to be resistant to conventional cancer therapy including chemotherapy&#xD;
      and radiotherapy which may explain rapid tumor cell repopulation following treatment mainly&#xD;
      by this subtype of cells, therefore new therapeutic method to target CSCs are now under&#xD;
      thorough investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the major difficulties in finding and identifying CSC is that they are hard to&#xD;
      isolate, grow, and enrich.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several in vitro assays have been used to identify stem cells, including sphere assays,&#xD;
      serial colony-forming unit (CFU) assays (replating assays), and label-retention assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have also been performed with the goal of determining genetic signatures that define&#xD;
      CSCs. However, each of these methods has potential pitfalls that complicate interpretation of&#xD;
      the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore additional method to easily harvest and enrich the CSCs is required. Currently, the&#xD;
      vast majority of cells are cultivated in 2-D flat hard plastic plates and flasks that are&#xD;
      inert to the cells. However CSCs are grown in a 3-D serum free conditions which make their&#xD;
      growth slow and complicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often proteins, such as fibronectin or collagen, have been employed as coatings to render the&#xD;
      plastic more &quot;cell friendly&quot;. However yields are still low; costs are high, and require much&#xD;
      floor space (large footprint). Moreover, the cells attached to the plastic must be&#xD;
      trypsinized in order to transfer or to implant affecting the survival of cells exposed to&#xD;
      digesting enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrinogen is an acute phase protein , occurring at 2-4g/l in human blood, upon treatment&#xD;
      with glucocorticoid, inflammation or trauma, the concentration of fibrinogen increase&#xD;
      Fibrinogen exerts adhesive effect on cultured fibroblast and other cells. Specifically&#xD;
      fibrinogen and its various lytic fragments (D.E ,FPA )were shown to be chemotactic to&#xD;
      macrophage , human fibroblast and endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrin matrix is commonly used surgical hemostasis and tissue sealing Fibrin(ogen) - a&#xD;
      possible candidate from which a 3-D matrix for cell culturing could be fabricated, is the&#xD;
      major component of the blood coagulation system. Native fibrinogen is soluble in aqueous&#xD;
      buffer and cannot usually be employed for cell culture applications, except as a coating for&#xD;
      plastics. However, when mixed with a trace of thrombin, it becomes transformed into an&#xD;
      insoluble fibrin clot that attracts cells and provides a provisional matrix for tissue&#xD;
      repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Generating and enriching CSC (in vitro) from established cell lines of human cancer We&#xD;
           will isolate, purify, and characterize CSC from a series of established cell line&#xD;
           including , U87-MG human glioma, MCF7 breast carcinoma and PANC-1 human pancreatic&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma, using standard techniques as described in Methods . These cells will be&#xD;
           cultured and grown as monolayer's in serum containing medium or as spheres in serum free&#xD;
           medium supplemented by growth factors .(18-7-19) We will evaluate the ability of the&#xD;
           cells to form spheres and characterize their stem cell properties using surface markers&#xD;
           detection and measuring ALDH activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Growing CSCs on iFP substance:&#xD;
&#xD;
           iFP may exhibit high attachment response for cancer cells, conserve cell surface marker,&#xD;
           and yield optimal growth rate. In addition, the cells on IFP could be transferred&#xD;
           without trypsinization which can diminish cell damage during harvesting from plastic&#xD;
           plate resulting in higher survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cells will be cultured in dishes coated iFP substance as described in the Methods. After&#xD;
           2 weeks in culture, cells will be harvested identified for CSCs for cancer stem cell&#xD;
           proprieties using the same methods we described above (e.g surface markers and ALDH&#xD;
           activity) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To isolate and enrich CSCs from fresh tumor specimens This aim designed to promote the&#xD;
           implication of iFP in cancer research by studying, harvesting, and growing CSCs obtained&#xD;
           from fresh tumors and subsequently using them for in vitro therapeutic testing. Such an&#xD;
           approach can optimize the therapy which may target this type of cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor specimens will be obtained from consenting patients according to the Internal Review&#xD;
      and The Ethics Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor samples will be collected from the pathology department from the histological&#xD;
      diagnostic assessment during tumor resection (when the samples are still fresh). Thus samples&#xD;
      will be received in the Laboratory within 30 minutes of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumors will be prepared as single cell suspensions and then will be grown using either&#xD;
      conventional standard method or iFP. Subsequently, cells will be harvested and evaluated for&#xD;
      CSC characteristics using the same method we used for cell lines. A comparison of the yield&#xD;
      of CSC percentage will be performed between iFP and the conventional methodology.&#xD;
