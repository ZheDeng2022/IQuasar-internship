    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must meet all of the following criteria in order to be enrolled into the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be at least 12 years of age, male or female, of any race;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Provide written informed consent and sign a HIPAA form. Patients who are under the age&#xD;
             of 18 will need to sign an assent form as well as having a parent or legal guardian&#xD;
             sign an informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willingness and ability to follow all instructions and comply with schedule for&#xD;
             follow-up visits;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For females capable of becoming pregnant, agree to have urine pregnancy testing&#xD;
             performed prior to randomization of the study eye and prior to treatment of a fellow&#xD;
             and/or cross-over eye; must not be lactating, and must agree to use a medically&#xD;
             acceptable form of birth control for at least one week prior to the randomization&#xD;
             visit, one week prior to treatment of a fellow eye or cross-over eye, and continue to&#xD;
             use the method for one month following the last treatment. Acceptable forms for birth&#xD;
             control are spermicide with barrier, oral contraceptive, injectable or implantable&#xD;
             method of contraception, transdermal contraceptive, intrauterine device, or surgical&#xD;
             sterilization of partner. For non-sexually active females, abstinence will be&#xD;
             considered an acceptable form of birth control. Women considered capable of becoming&#xD;
             pregnant include all females who have experienced menarche and have not experienced&#xD;
             menopause (as defined by amenorrhea for greater than 12 consecutive months) or have&#xD;
             not undergone successful surgical sterilization (e.g. hysterectomy, bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Having a diagnosis of corneal ectasia after refractive surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Having axial topography consistent with corneal ectasia;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Presence of central or inferior steepening on the Pentacam map;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. BSCVA (Best Spectacle Corrected Visual Acuity) of ≥ 1 letter and ≤ 80 letters on ETDRS&#xD;
             (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study) chart;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Contact Lens Wearers Only: Removal of contact lenses is required for a 1 week period&#xD;
             prior to the screening visit(s);&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Contact Lens Wearers Only: Manifest refraction must be stable between two visits which&#xD;
             occur at least 7 days apart. A stable refraction is one in which the manifest&#xD;
             refraction spherical equivalent and the average K (Km) on the Pentacam taken at the&#xD;
             first visit do not differ by more than 0.75 D from the respective measurements taken&#xD;
             at the second exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not meet any of the following criteria in order to be enrolled into the&#xD;
        trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Contraindications, sensitivity or known allergy to the use of the test article(s) or&#xD;
             their components;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If female, be pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy or have a positive urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test prior to the randomization or treatment of either eye or during the&#xD;
             course of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A history of previous corneal surgery or the insertion of Intacs in the eye(s) to be&#xD;
             treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A history of previous Limbal Relaxing Incision (LRI) procedure in the eye(s) to be&#xD;
             treated;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Corneal pachymetry that is &lt; 375 microns prior to epithelial debridement at the&#xD;
             thinnest point measured by Pentacam in the eye to be treated;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eyes which are aphakic;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Eyes which are pseudophakic and do not have a UV blocking lens implanted;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Eyes that have the maximum corneal curvature (Kmax) outside of the central 5mm zone as&#xD;
             measured by the Pentacam;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Previous ocular condition (other than refractive error) in the eye to be treated that&#xD;
             may predispose the eye for future complications. For example:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. History of corneal disease (e.g., herpes simplex, herpes zoster keratitis,&#xD;
                  corneal melt, corneal dystrophy, etc.);&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Clinically significant corneal scarring in the cross-linking treatment zone that&#xD;
                  is not related to corneal ectasia or, in the investigator's opinion, will&#xD;
                  interfere with the cross-linking procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A history of delayed epithelial healing in the eye to be treated;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with nystagmus or any other condition that would prevent a steady gaze during&#xD;
             the treatment or other diagnostic tests;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with a current condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere&#xD;
             with or prolong epithelial healing;&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Taking Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplements within 1 week of the cross-linking&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. A history of previous corneal crosslinking treatment in the eye to be treated;&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Have used an investigational drug or device within 30 days of the study or be&#xD;
             concurrently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial within 30 days&#xD;
             of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. In addition, the Investigator may exclude or discontinue any subject for any sound&#xD;
             medical reason.&#xD;
