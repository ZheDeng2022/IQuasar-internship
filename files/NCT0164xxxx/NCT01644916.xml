  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) stands out among chronic diseases with its high&#xD;
      and rising prevalence and mortality, poor quality of life, high re-hospitalization rates and&#xD;
      societal burden of care. Current therapeutic and management practices are generally met with&#xD;
      limited success. Research in recent years have highlighted the high level of psychiatric&#xD;
      co-morbidity in COPD patients, and the major prognostic significance of anxiety/depression in&#xD;
      COPD outcomes such as re-hospitalization, smoking cessation, quality of life, and survival.&#xD;
      This suggests that addressing psychiatric and psycho-social aspects of care prominent in COPD&#xD;
      patients may have strongly positive impact on outcomes, but the available evidence of&#xD;
      effectiveness is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the effectiveness of a holistic&#xD;
      disease management paradigm of psychiatric liaison consultation (CL) that integrates&#xD;
      psychiatric and respiratory care to improve outcomes for COPD patients. This integrated&#xD;
      psychiatric consultation liaison (IPCL) management paradigm includes the routine screening&#xD;
      and structured collaborative care of anxiety and major depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      depressive/anxiety disorder in COPD patients. We postulate that the IPCL care paradigm would&#xD;
      reduce mood symptoms, increase smoking quit rates, reduce symptom burden and functional&#xD;
      disability, and improve quality of life, while reducing rehospitalization, emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) and unscheduled physician visits. A secondary aim is to evaluate its cost&#xD;
      effectiveness by concurrently collecting resource utilization data.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the effectiveness of a holistic disease&#xD;
      management paradigm of) that integrates psychiatric and respiratory care (Integrated&#xD;
      Psychiatric Consultation Liaison, IPCL) that addresses the high level of psychiatric&#xD;
      co-morbidity in COPD patients to improve COPD outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population Inpatients and specialist outpatients with established clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital based specialist outpatient and inpatient acute care and step-down care facilities&#xD;
      in four hospitals (NUHS, AH, SGH and CGH) and one community hospital (SLH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The site PIs from each hospital are Lim Tow Keang (NUHS),Loo Chian Min (SGH),K. Narendran&#xD;
      (CGH), Gerald Chua (AH) and Tan Boon Yeow (SLH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Parallel group, randomized, controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible individuals are randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Integrated Psychiatric Consultation Liaison (IPCL) care (N=450);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Usual care. Patients in this group will receive usual standard care (N=450).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline screening and assessment. Prior to randomization to either IPCL or UC arm, COPD&#xD;
      patients are screened for anxiety /depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale&#xD;
      (HADS, see below for details).21.For patients with high HADS scores(â‰¥8), a semi-structured&#xD;
      diagnostic assessment will be immediately performed using Structured Clinical Interview for&#xD;
      DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I for DSM-IV22 by an advanced practice nurse (APN) and the&#xD;
      provisional diagnosis of anxiety and/or major depressive disorder will be confirmed by a&#xD;
      psychiatrist, Cases with significant anxiety or depressive symptomatology that do not meet&#xD;
      DSM-IV threshold criteria are classified as subsyndromal cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. After informed consent is signed and patient eligibility is confirmed, the&#xD;
      patient will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention arm receiving IPCL care&#xD;
      or the control arm receiving usual care. Stratification by center is used to ensure balance&#xD;
      between the two arms across centers. Random permuted blocks are used to ensure balance over&#xD;
      time. The block length is determined by the study statistician. The patient will be assigned&#xD;
      an individual number upon randomization. This assigned randomized number will identify the&#xD;
      patient and will be used for all documentation for this patient in this study. The list of&#xD;
      randomizations will go through Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI). Randomization&#xD;
      may be done via the following options: (i) Direct web randomization: Authorized study center&#xD;
      personnel will randomize the patient via a password-protected internet web site available 24&#xD;
      hours a day; (ii) Envelope Randomization: In case of web downtime due to technical error,&#xD;
      site personnel may randomize patients using the back-up envelopes that will be provided upon&#xD;
      activation of the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPCL Care Group For patients who are randomly allocated to the IPCL arm,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Routine active screening and diagnosis of psychiatric co-morbidity using HADS followed&#xD;
           by appropriate SCID interview by a trained APN, and confirmation by a consultant&#xD;
           psychiatrist, will be performed at 3 monthly intervals during unscheduled and scheduled&#xD;
           outpatient consultation or follow up visits and at each hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The appropriate management of psychiatric and psycho-social problems will be performed&#xD;
           by a multi-disciplinary care team that includes the respiratory physician, psychiatrist,&#xD;
           advanced practice nurse and nurse clinicians&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The APN and nurse clinician perform critical roles as case manager and patient educator.&#xD;
           Psychoeducation is a critical care process component that will aim to ensure that the&#xD;
           majority (over 70%) of COPD patients in the IPCL group with psychological symptoms will&#xD;
           accept psycho-social and psychiatric care, in contrast to a large majority of patients&#xD;
           who will conventionally refuse care, particularly in the UC group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The treatment of cases will accord with recommended treatment guidelines for&#xD;
           anxiety/depression, and individualized for each patient according to a treatment plan&#xD;
           drawn up by the psychiatrist, with the agreement of the respiratory physician. Treatment&#xD;
           and care management of mild depressive symptomatology, psycho-social problems, or severe&#xD;
           major depression and/or anxiety disorder will include appropriate pharmacologic and/or&#xD;
           non-pharmacologic therapies (such as cognitive and/or behavioural therapy) and&#xD;
           psycho-social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Where pharmacologic treatment is indicated, the preferred drugs are SSRI antidepressants&#xD;
           prescribed according to local standard dosages. The recommended first line of treatment&#xD;
           is Fluoxetine, a dose of 20 mg/day or Escitalopram (10 to 20 mg/day). Alternatively,&#xD;
           patients who do not respond to Fluoxetine or Escitalopram after 4 weeks, or who have&#xD;
           intolerable side effects may be prescribed Venlafaxine XR, 75/mg/day, increased to&#xD;
           150-225 mg/day OR Mirtazapine (15mg/day, increased to 30-45 mg/day). If no response,&#xD;
           mood stabilizer or electro convulsive therapy (ECT) or psychosocial intervention will be&#xD;
           added on with the medication (Figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Non-drug psychotherapy will be provided either by the psychiatrist or psychological&#xD;
           counselor where appropriate (for most patients with only depressive or anxiety&#xD;
           symptomatology).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The case manager will liaise with medical social worker for financial and other&#xD;
           community services support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The nurse educator will provide standard patient education and behavioural modification&#xD;
           including information about disease and medications for both COPD and depression, and&#xD;
           changing attitudes and behaviour particularly in regard to smoking cessation and&#xD;
           medication adherence, and general psycho-social supportive counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Appropriate existing and redesigned treatment algorithms and management protocols will&#xD;
           be put together and provide a sourcebook for drawing up individual care plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Routine monitoring and outcomes assessments is integrated as part of IPCL care and&#xD;
           performed at 3 or 6 monthly intervals as appropriate: these include perceived symptoms&#xD;
           of breathlessness, exercise tolerance, spirometric measurement (12 month), smoking&#xD;
           cessation, HADS, SGRQ quality of life, acute COPD exacerbations, rehospitalization(s),&#xD;
           emergency department visits, and unscheduled physician visits etc.(see schedule).&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Ad hoc follow up visits are scheduled at any appropriate times for therapeutic&#xD;
           monitoring and responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. The management of COPD will proceed as usual according to standard clinical practice for&#xD;
           COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Care Control Group. For patients who are randomly allocated to the UC Control Group,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The presence of psychiatric co-morbidity will be identified under standard conditions by&#xD;
           usual care team, with the appropriate psychiatric consultation-liaison referrals and&#xD;
           treatment effected as deemed necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment and care management of psychiatric and psycho-social problems will include&#xD;
           appropriate pharmacologic and/or non-pharmacologic therapies and psycho-social support,&#xD;
           in accordance with standard recommended guidelines and practices for both COPD and&#xD;
           anxiety/depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The assessment of trial outcomes performed at 3 or 6 monthly intervals as appropriate&#xD;
           (perceived symptoms of breathlessness, exercise tolerance, spirometric measurement,&#xD;
           smoking cessation, HADS, SGRQ quality of life, acute COPD exacerbations,&#xD;
           rehospitalization(s), emergency department visits, and unscheduled physician visits&#xD;
           etc.) is also performed, but is not an integral part of Usual Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ad hoc outpatient follow up visits are scheduled at any appropriate times for&#xD;
           therapeutic and other care monitoring and responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The management of COPD will proceed as usual according to standard clinical practice for&#xD;
           COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To mimic prevailing conditions of healthcare financing and delivery, payments for referrals&#xD;
      to hospital psychiatrists for treatment, drugs and psychotherapy, regardless of allocation to&#xD;
      IPCL or UC group, will be borne by the patients using existing avenues of health service&#xD;
      financing (Medisave, Medishield, and/or out-of-pockets) as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial related scheduled assessments of outcome measures All participants in both IPCL and UC&#xD;
      control arms will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months for the&#xD;
      following trial related outcomes. We define loss to follow-up (LTFU) as incomplete&#xD;
      ascertainment of the primary outcome for subjects randomized in the trial. Operationally,&#xD;
      LTFU is defined as absence from at least 2 consecutive assessments (&gt;6 months).&#xD;
