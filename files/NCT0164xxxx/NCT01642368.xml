    <textblock>
      The goal of the Optimum Omega-3 (OO3) Diet Study is to assess whether swapping specific food&#xD;
      ingredients in diets can significantly change omega-3 blood profiles with 10 weeks of a 7-day&#xD;
      menu in men and women (18-40 years old). We want to look at the effect on a person's response&#xD;
      to cognition, satiety and physical fitness. Investigators think that low omega-6 and moderate&#xD;
      omega-3 fatty acid diets may regulate emotional response and help to return to normal after&#xD;
      load carrying activities. We plan to test the effects of improving overall fatty acids on&#xD;
      emotional response, satiety, and physical fitness levels by a diet with an improved omega-3&#xD;
      to omega-6 diet compared to a control diet.&#xD;

      The goal of the Optimum Omega-3 (OO3) Diet Study is to assess whether swapping specific food&#xD;
      ingredients in components of US Military Garrison diet can significantly change blood&#xD;
      profiles of n-3 HUFAs (highly unsaturated fatty acids) from baseline with 10 weeks of a 7-day&#xD;
      menu in men and women (18-40 years old), and its effect on a person's response to cognitive&#xD;
      measures, satiety and physical fitness (Adjunct Studies). The Department of Defense is&#xD;
      interested in strategies to improve body composition of n-3 HUFAs and whether such strategies&#xD;
      help people respond better emotionally. It is felt that low omega-6 and moderate omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acid diets may improve the regulation of emotional responses, and may accelerate return&#xD;
      of muscle strength and lower limb range of motion after fatiguing exercise such as walking&#xD;
      while carrying a heavy load. We plan to test the effects of improving overall fatty acids on&#xD;
      cognitive response, satiety, and physical fitness levels by substituting all chicken meat,&#xD;
      eggs, beef, oil and other ingredients in 7 days of 3 meals plus snacks with like products&#xD;
      that have low omega-6 PUFA (and/or enhanced omega-3 PUFA) in comparison with a control diet&#xD;
      in which the ingredients have not been replaced.&#xD;

    <description>We expect to see an increase in blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids in participants following 12 weeks of consuming a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids and a lower content of omega-6 fatty acids for a more positive ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 and related to a variety of positive health outcomes.</description>
