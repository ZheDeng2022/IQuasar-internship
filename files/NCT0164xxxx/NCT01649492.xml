      The goal of this study is to evaluate the actual potential for in vivo pineapple juice&#xD;
      inhibition with CYP2C9 substrates in human volunteers with use of diclofenac as a marker of&#xD;
      CYP2C9 activity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For ovarian cancer, colorectal and gastric cancers presenting with peritoneal metastases,&#xD;
      complete tumor removal at surgery is the most important independent prognostic factor.&#xD;
      Consequently, accurate detection of tumors often compromising resectability, like&#xD;
      extra-abdominal metastases, liver metastases, portal and superior mesenteric artery deposits&#xD;
      and extensive intestinal serosal invasion is pivotal prior to treatment selection. Computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) has variable accuracy for staging, due to the difficult detection of&#xD;
      low-contrast or small-sized peritoneal or nodal metastases. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron&#xD;
      emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) improves detection of thoraco-abdominal lymphadenopathy&#xD;
      and liver metastases, but inconsistently detects small (&lt;5mm) peritoneal metastases.&#xD;
      Therefore a diagnostic staging laparoscopy under general anesthesia is currently the&#xD;
      necessary standard of clinical practice in addition to imaging for assessment of operability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is researched at the department of&#xD;
      radiology, University Hospitals Leuven in collaboration with the departments of abdominal&#xD;
      surgery, oncologic surgery, oncologic gynaecology and digestive oncology. The technique holds&#xD;
      high promise to combine a high accuracy in systemic thoraco-abdominal staging and peritoneal&#xD;
      assessment of operability. Technological progress has enabled time-efficient WB-DWI with&#xD;
      thin-slice-acquisition and multiplanar image reformatting. DWI depicts lesions by measuring&#xD;
      water diffusion differences, correlating with cellular density. Tumors are depicted with high&#xD;
      signal compared to background by combining a short-T1-inversion-time inversion recovery&#xD;
      (STIR) prepulse - suppressing ascites, blood vessels, fat, bowel and visceral organs - and&#xD;
      heavy diffusion weighting. However, due to contraction and mucosal cellularity, the bowel&#xD;
      wall can show increased signal-intensity (SI), hampering the detection of serosal deposits.&#xD;
      This is overcome by suppressing contractions by intravenous antispasmodic and by distending&#xD;
      the bowel wall and suppressing the signal of bowel content by peroral pineapple juice which&#xD;
      shows negative contrast properties due to the manganese-content. In a first pilot study in&#xD;
      ovarian cancer at this center in 32 patients, an accuracy for detection of intestinal serosal&#xD;
      metastases of 90% was reached by WB-DWI combined with peroral pineapple juice. As such, the&#xD;
      pineapple juice plays a pivotal role as a peroral contrast in addition to WB-DWI for accurate&#xD;
      peritoneal staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the inhibitory potential of pineapple juice on cytochrome P450 2C9 activity has only&#xD;
      been described in vitro in human microsomes. In this model, in which diclofenac and its&#xD;
      metabolite 4-OH-diclofenac have been used as probes for CYP2C9 activity, it has been shown&#xD;
      that pineapple juice is capable to inhibit CYP2C9 very potently (IC50 0.08%) in an&#xD;
      irreversible manner. It has been suggested that the main effect is caused by bromelain, a&#xD;
      24-26 kDa cysteine protease enzyme present in pineapple juice. The intestinal absorption of&#xD;
      intact bromelain after oral intake has been described in 19 healthy men, which is surprising&#xD;
      as the adult intestinal epithelium has traditionally been described as non-permeable to&#xD;
      proteins. The (limited) absorption is thought to occur via the paracellular route, which&#xD;
      could explain that the catalytic activity bromelain is preserved following absorption into&#xD;
      the blood circulation. Although no effects of bromelain on CYP2C9 activity are expected in&#xD;
      vivo (due to low oral bioavailability), no in vivo trials have been undertaken to elucidate&#xD;
      if pineapple juice, and more specifically bromelain, is capable of inhibiting intestinal and,&#xD;
      more importantly, hepatic CYP2C9 in a clinically relevant manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in vivo inhibitory profile of CYP2C9 by pineapple juice will be evaluated in this study&#xD;
      in 10 healthy volunteers, by examining the impact on the area-under-the-curves (AUCs) of&#xD;
      diclofenac and its metabolite 4-OH diclofenac.&#xD;
