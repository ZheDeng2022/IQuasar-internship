      The investigators want to evaluate whether an original action based on the administration of&#xD;
      alkali (mainly sodium bicarbonate) is able to significantly modify renal death and to reduce&#xD;
      mortality due to cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a proposal of Multicentric, prospective, cohort, randomized, open-label and&#xD;
      controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will Randomize 728 patients with Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) stage 3b&#xD;
      (CKD-3b) and CKD stage 4: 364 of these patients will be included in the study group called&#xD;
      Bicarbonate Group (Bic), in which levels of bicarbonate should be kept &gt; 24 mEq/l; the other&#xD;
      364 patients will included in the Usual Treatment Group (no-Bic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The aim of the Research Protocol is to demonstrate if that the optimal correction of&#xD;
      uremic acidosis (with administration of sodium bicarbonate or of any other alkalinizing&#xD;
      agent, e.g. sodium citrate) reduces renal and cardiovascular mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions. In conclusion the Work Group of the Conservative Therapy for Chronic Renal&#xD;
      Insufficiency proposes this cohort, randomized, controlled, prospective, multicentric study&#xD;
      to evaluate the effects of correction of acidosis on the progression of the kidney disease&#xD;
      considered as renal death in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is associated with a high incidence of morbility and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NANHES) shows that 19%&#xD;
      of the uremic population presents metabolic acidosis (CKD stage 4). This high prevalence and&#xD;
      the low costs of the correction by bicarbonate pave the way for a potential and interesting&#xD;
      research activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, a Cochrane Collaboration review reports that there is no evidence for correction of&#xD;
      acidosis by sodium bicarbonate in pre-End-Stage Renal Disease) (ESRD) patients, and concludes&#xD;
      that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are necessary to evaluate the benefits and harms of&#xD;
      correcting metabolic acidosis in pre-ESRD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the same year, 2009, another RCT appears in the scientific literature showing that the&#xD;
      administration of sodium bicarbonate, and the consequent correction of acidosis, slows the&#xD;
      progression of CKD and improves the nutritional status in ESRD patients stages 4-5. This&#xD;
      study was randomized, prospective, open-label, monocentric, and was conducted on 134&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that acidosis stimulates proteic catabolism, accelerates branched-chain&#xD;
      amino acid oxidation and reduces the synthesis of visceral proteins. The beneficial effects&#xD;
      of bicarbonate in experimental models in rats and the effects of correcting acidosis on the&#xD;
      nutritional status are also known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Less information is available on the possibility that correcting acidosis in pre-ESRD&#xD;
      patients slows renal death and improves outcomes also in the future, on dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above cited study of Brito and Ashurst highlights that bicarbonate supplementation (that&#xD;
      causes the blood value to increase from 20 to 22 mmol/L) slows the rate of progression of CKD&#xD;
      and betters the nutritional status of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, very recently the author Menon has demonstrated that low levels of serum&#xD;
      bicarbonate increase the risk of outcomes, e.g. renal death and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, an article recently published on Kidney International has put in evidence the&#xD;
      pathogenetic factors, e.g. endothelin and hyperaldosteronism, which were caused to worsen&#xD;
      renal function in rats by the presence of metabolic acidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to this article, an editorial by the authors Sahni, Rosa and Batlle D. has been&#xD;
      published on the same issue of Kidney International with the following statement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;There is increasing evidence that alkali therapy can retard progression of chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD). We summarize recent studies and discuss a mechanism whereby alkali therapy may&#xD;
      neutralize acid production associated with typical Western diets, which generate acid. We&#xD;
      emphasize the rationale for using alkali therapy early in the course of CKD, even in the&#xD;
      absence of overt metabolic acidosis, and we urge the pharmaceutical industry to develop&#xD;
      palatable alkali- containing solutions.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposal for the study For the reasons explained above, the Work Group of the Conservative&#xD;
      Therapy for Chronic Renal Insufficiency proposes this cohort, randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      prospective, multicentric study to evaluate the effects of correction of acidosis on the&#xD;
      progression of the kidney disease considered as renal death in ESRD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate whether an original action based on the administration of alkali (mainly&#xD;
           sodium bicarbonate) is able to significantly modify progression of renal disease, and&#xD;
           renal death, and to reduce mortality due to cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To verify if bicarbonate therapy modify progression of renal disease, and renal death,&#xD;
           and to reduce mortality due to cardiovascular events in APKD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To verify if bicarbonate therapy modify progression of renal disease, and renal death,&#xD;
           and to reduce mortality due to cardiovascular events in dianetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if nutritional parameters improve during the period of study; To evaluate blood&#xD;
      pressure (as absolute value and as increase in antihypertensive drugs); To evaluate how the&#xD;
      correction of acidosis influences bone turnover (vascular calcifications); To evaluate&#xD;
      changes in calcium and phosphorus metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Multicentric, prospective, cohort, randomized and controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomize 728 patients with CKD-3b and CKD-4: 364 of these patients will be included in the&#xD;
      study group called Bicarbonate Group (Bic), in which levels of bicarbonate should be kept &gt;&#xD;
      24 mEq/l; the other 364 patients will included in the Usual Treatment Group (no-Bic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in period with one visit per month for 3 months, followed by a 36-month study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigated patients must be randomized by sex, diabetes and level of renal function&#xD;
      (measured Clearance of Creatinine between 60 and 30 ml/min, between 30 and 15, &lt;15 on&#xD;
      pre-dialysis) and all the requirements for a Best Practice Treatment (BPT) must be applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For anemia (Hb 11-12 g/dl; TSAT &gt; 20 %),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For arterial hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;130 mmHg; diastolic blood&#xD;
           pressure (DBP) &lt; 90 mm g),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For hyperlipidemia (low-density (LDL) cholesterol &lt;100),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For osteodystrophy (phosphatemia 2.7-4.6 mg/dl; calcemia 8.4-10.2 mg/dl; in CKD-3:&#xD;
           parathyroid hormone (PTH) 35-70 pg/ml; in CKD-4: PTH 70-110 pg/ml; 25(OH) vitamin D &gt; 30&#xD;
           nmol/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Failure to reach the BPT target will not cause exclusion as the centralized randomization&#xD;
      will probably be the reason for the enrollment of patients who have the same clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and the same treatments during the follow-up period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be centralized and patients will be randomized on the basis of sex, age,&#xD;
      diabetes, levels of renal function (measured).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be provided with a nutritional and diet counseling consisting of a low&#xD;
      protein, phosphorus and sodium diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doubling of Creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
           . Beginning of dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All-cause mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Power&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the sample size was used EAST software version 3.1 and considered the following&#xD;
      assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. alfa 0.05;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. power 0.90;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. treatment/untreatment 1;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. lost to follow-up 10 %;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Two-tailed statistical test with type I error of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical power of the test equal to 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it was determined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of events required 194.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of subjects needed 728&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study duration 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters measured every 3-6 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bicarbonate levels blood albumin levels, fetuin-A, C-reactive protein blood levels of sodium,&#xD;
      potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, blood levels of homocysteine, lipid profile blood levels of&#xD;
      calcium, phosphorus, PTH, alkaline phosphatase, bone turnover markers blood levels of&#xD;
      creatinine, plasma urea, blood count 24h urinary urea excretion, 24h urinary sodium&#xD;
      excretion, 24h urinary protein excretion, 24 urinary creatinine excretion bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance assessment (BIA), body weight, blood pressure, Lateral abdominal X-ray for vascular&#xD;
      calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of anti-hypertensive drugs and diuretics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of bicarbonates:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular weight of sodium bicarbonate is 84.01. Each gram of substance therefore&#xD;
      contains 11.9 mmol, so initially as much as 3-4 grams can be administered, subsequently it&#xD;
      has to be adjusted according to the blood level of bicarbonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations should be made on a bimonthly basis in order to adjust the administration of&#xD;
      bicarbonate according to blood levels of bicarbonate (target values &gt;24 e &lt;28 mEq/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bicarbonate administration should be suspended if blood bicarbonate levels are &gt; 28 mEq/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ethical reasons, partial correction of acidosis is allowed (up to 22 mEq/L) for blood&#xD;
      bicarbonate levels lower than 18 mEq/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate that the optimal correction of uremic acidosis (with&#xD;
      administration of sodium bicarbonate or of any other alkalinizing agent, e.g. sodium citrate)&#xD;
      reduces renal and cardiovascular mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prerequisites of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) to expose the patient to low risks of unfavourable events, c) patients will be asked for a&#xD;
      little but constant effort with some modifications in their life style, d) costs should be&#xD;
      low for the family and for the institution where the patient is treated. No specific&#xD;
      equipment and competences are required, so that the study can be easily performed in any&#xD;
      Nephrology Division.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ------------------------- Ethical aspects The physician will describe the study in detail and&#xD;
      will read all information regarding the study to the patient so that he/she will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask for any further clarification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, the patients will be provided with the Informed Consent, which he/she should sign&#xD;
      after reading it throughout (see attachments). Patient's data will be recorded, processed and&#xD;
      stored in complete accordance with the data protection laws, in order to safeguard the safety&#xD;
      and privacy of data; if included in publications and/or presented at conferences, data will&#xD;
      undergo a statical process and will be kept anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Methods of descriptive and distribution statistics together with parametric and&#xD;
      non-parametric tests will be applied. Linear correlation or the Spearman test will be used to&#xD;
      analyse the relationship between two variables considered simultaneously; the relationship&#xD;
      among more variables will be analysed with multiple regression (linear or logistic).&#xD;
