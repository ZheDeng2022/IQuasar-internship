      The purpose of the study is to determine the permanency of PV isolation with the Arctic Front&#xD;
      Advance cryoablation system in paroxysmal AF patients. It will also provide data on acute&#xD;
      procedural outcomes and measures as well as clinical AF recurrence in these patients&#xD;
      approximately 3 months post-ablation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. It&#xD;
      is estimated that more than 7 million people worldwide have the disease. Over the past&#xD;
      decade, catheter ablation has become an accepted treatment for patients with AF. Ablation&#xD;
      strategies that target the pulmonary vein are considered the cornerstone for treatment. The&#xD;
      innovative Arctic Front cryoballoon is used for the treatment of drug refractory recurrent&#xD;
      symptomatic paroxysmal AF (PAF). The system was designed to overcome many of the challenges&#xD;
      of point-by-point catheter ablation by providing an anatomical approach for pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation (PVI), creating long contiguous circumferential lesions surrounding the pulmonary&#xD;
      vein. The cryoballoon system has a low risk of complications and proven efficacy in treating&#xD;
      PAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AF recurrence rates have been reported up to 30% after initial ablation with PVI technologies&#xD;
      including point-by-point RF catheter ablation. Arrhythmia recurrence can be caused by&#xD;
      non-contiguous ablation lines that allow conduction gaps. Arctic Front Advance™ Cardiac&#xD;
      CryoAblation Catheter (Arctic Front Advance), the second-generation cryoballoon which has&#xD;
      recently been introduced following clearance by regulatory agencies in both the US and EU, is&#xD;
      positioned to address this challenge with PVI technologies. The new catheter features the&#xD;
      EvenCool™ Cryo Technology, which optimizes how the refrigerant is distributed inside the&#xD;
      balloon, providing more uniform, distal cooling around the circumference of the balloon. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to examine the rate of electrical PV isolation with the next&#xD;
      generation system .&#xD;
