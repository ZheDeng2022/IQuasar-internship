    <textblock>
      Background: Bortezomib is a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma. It is given by intravenous injection. Lenalidomide is a drug&#xD;
      that alters the immune system. It may also help suppress tumor growth. It is approved by the&#xD;
      FDA to treat some types of blood cancers. Dexamethasone prevents or treats inflammation. It&#xD;
      is sometimes used to treat multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The purpose of this study examine how the combination of the study drugs affects&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants at least 18 years old who have multiple myeloma that has come back, did not&#xD;
           respond to treatment, or worsened while being treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who may be pregnant will be tested to ensure that they are not pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a history and physical examination. Blood work and&#xD;
           urine samples will be taken. A series of x-rays of all bones will be done. A bone marrow&#xD;
           biopsy will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will continue as long as the cancer does not grow or spread and no serious&#xD;
           side effects develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be up to eight 21-day treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bortezomib is given by subcutaneous (under the skin) (SC) injection on days 1, 4, 8, and&#xD;
           11 of the cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide is given by mouth on days 1 14 of the cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone is given by mouth on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of the cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following cycle eight, if the disease is stable or better, participants will receive&#xD;
           bortezomib SC at the dose given at the end of cycle eight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take valacyclovir or acyclovir while taking bortezomib to prevent&#xD;
           virus infections.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell neoplasm with a median survival of 3-4&#xD;
           years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased survival has been achieved with the introduction of the proteasome inhibitor&#xD;
           bortezomib and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) such as lenalidomide. Bortezomib and&#xD;
           lenalidomide have different but overlapping mechanism of anti-MM activity in preclinical&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite the benefits of novel agents, bortezomib and lenalidomide pose clinical&#xD;
           challenges. Bortezomib drug toxicity includes neuropathy, GI distress, myelosuppression&#xD;
           and herpes zoster reactivation. Together with lenalidomide, the incidence of sensory&#xD;
           neuropathy reaches 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subcutaneous (SC) Bortezomib was evaluated in a prospective phase I trial for relapsed&#xD;
           and/or refractory MM. SC administration was found to be comparable with the established&#xD;
           IV route, with no differences in overall systemic availability and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
           activity, similar toxicity profiles, and similar response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combining SC, rather than IV bortezomib, with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is&#xD;
           especially attractive given the potential for less overall neurotoxicity and improved&#xD;
           convenience for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Also, using bortezomib SC as a maintenance therapy after combination therapy is a novel&#xD;
           strategy that has the potential to set the stage for coming oral proteasome inhibitors&#xD;
           as potential maintenance strategies in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine response rates, of S.C. bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd) in&#xD;
           relapse and/or refractory MM patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess peripheral blood for immune cell populations in relation to SC bortezomib&#xD;
           maintenance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate toxicity, including peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate patterns of change in patient-reported quality of life and symptom distress&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gauge the feasibility, responsiveness to change and associated effect sizes when using&#xD;
           patient-reported outcomes to augment clinician ratings of regimen-related treatment&#xD;
           toxicity, including incidence and severity of peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine duration of response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine progression free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically confirmed relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Without serious co-morbidity that would interfere with receipt of VRd&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patient has neuropathy, it must be less than or equal to Grade 1 at the time of first&#xD;
           dose or within 14 days of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than equal to 1.0 K/uL, hemoglobin less than or&#xD;
           equal to 8 g/dL, and platelet count greater than or equal to 75 K/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate hepatic function, with bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times ULN; AST and ALT &lt; 3.0 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine Clearance greater than or equal to 60 ml/min. CrCl will be calculated by&#xD;
           Cockcroft-Gault method. CrCl (calculated) = (140 Age) times Mass (in kilograms) times&#xD;
           [0.85 if Female] 72 times Serum Creatinine (in mg/dL). If calculated CrCl based on&#xD;
           Cockcroft-Gault method is &lt; 60 mL/min, patient will have a 24 hr urine collection to&#xD;
           measure CrCl. The measured CrCl must also be greater than or equal to 60 ml/min for the&#xD;
           patient to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will receive treatment in this single arm study for 8 total cycles (each cycle is 21&#xD;
      days) with the following drugs, dosages and schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Bortezomib&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1-8: 1.0 mg/m(2) SC at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml to the thighs or abdomen on days 1,&#xD;
      4, 8, 11 of 21 day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Lenalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1: 15 mg oral daily on days 2-14 of 21 day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 2-8: 15 mg oral daily on days 1-14 of 21 day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1: 10 mg oral on days 2,4,5,8,9,11,12 of 21 day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 2-8: 10 mg oral on days 1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12 of 21 day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Maintenance therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of cycle 8, patients with greater than or equal to stable disease will&#xD;
      receive maintenance with bortezomib S.C. at a dose per end of Cycle 8. Maintenance will be&#xD;
      given on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle, and will continue until progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
