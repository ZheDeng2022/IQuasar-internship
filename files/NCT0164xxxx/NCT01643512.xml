  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in the United&#xD;
      States. The cause of NAFLD is poorly defined but is thought to involve complex interactions&#xD;
      of genetic and environmental factors. NAFLD is often associated with the traits of the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome including diabetes, high cholesterol or elevated blood pressure.&#xD;
      Currently, there are no accurate noninvasive means of evaluating NAFLD and its more serious&#xD;
      form which includes inflammation that may lead to severe scarring in the liver. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate shared genetic factors that underlie NAFLD and features of the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome as determined by blood work and radiographic studies in a cohort of twins&#xD;
      and first degree relatives.&#xD;

      Following an information session during which the primary consent document, a genetic&#xD;
      sampling consent document and the UCSD HIPPA forms are reviewed, discussed and signed, the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures will be done. For each subject, the study visit will be for&#xD;
      3-4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will undergo a detailed history, physical examination, anthropometrics and&#xD;
           vital signs including blood pressure and pulse. Standardized questionnaires including&#xD;
           the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Tests (AUDIT) and Skinner Lifetime Drinking&#xD;
           History will be used to identify alcohol use as a cause of fatty liver disease. A&#xD;
           trained investigator will measure waist/hip ratio at the same time as other measures are&#xD;
           taken. The Body Mass Index (BMI) will be as calculated by measuring each subject's&#xD;
           weight (Kg) and height (m) with empty bowel and bladder and using the formula: BMI =&#xD;
           weight (kg)/ height (m)2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood tests: Participants will undergo phlebotomy, after an overnight fast, for complete&#xD;
           metabolic panel (including liver function tests), complete blood count, protime, lipid&#xD;
           panel, free fatty acids, serum insulin, hemoglobin A1C, fasting glucose, hepatitis B&#xD;
           surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, prothrombin time and HIV. 30ml of blood will be&#xD;
           collected: including 5ml of serum banking, 5ml of plasma banking, 5ml of DNA banking,&#xD;
           and 15ml for planned labs as listed above. Plasma will be stored for adipocytokines and&#xD;
           testing of novel genes or biomarkers for NALFD in later studies. Fasting plasma glucose&#xD;
           and plasma insulin levels will be obtained. Insulin resistance will be measured by&#xD;
           HOMA-IR, the homeostasis assessment model of insulin resistance, where HOMA-IR (mmol/L x&#xD;
           µU/ml) = fasting glucose (mmol/L) x fasting insulin (µU/ml)/22.5). The participants will&#xD;
           be required to provide a stool and urine sample as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A urine pregnancy test will be performed for all women of childbearing age. Women who&#xD;
           have had hysterectomies are excluded from pregnancy testing. If the pregnancy test is&#xD;
           positive, the patient will not be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The patient will undergo magnetic resonance imaging for hepatic fat fraction.&#xD;
