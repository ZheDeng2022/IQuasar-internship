      Aims and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to explore the ways in which Optifood can be developed to create relevant&#xD;
      food-based recommendations (FBRs) and be used for advocacy purposes. Specific objectives seek&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a tool with which to formulate/test FBRs and create effective advocacy&#xD;
           materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess its performance in the hands of government/NGOs, in Peru, Thailand and India&#xD;
           to identify structural changes required and provide guidance on its incorporation into&#xD;
           their program planning and advocacy activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To use the tool to develop locally appropriate FBRs in Peru, Thailand and India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in Switzerland, India, Thailand and Peru. Collaborating partners&#xD;
      and specific locations are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  World Health Organisation - Geneva&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Society for Applied Studies - New Delhi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mahidol University - Bangkok&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instituto de Investigaci√≥n Nutricional - Peru.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FBRs will be tested in India in Kheri Kalan PHC in Haryana State.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to pilot test the Optifood tool with relevant organisations, then use the tool&#xD;
      to test and refine existing FBRs for the target population. Mixed-methods research is&#xD;
      recommended for exploring complex interventions. Accordingly, quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      methods will be used to address the study objectives. The study will use a wide range of&#xD;
      respondents to gain a broader understanding of current behaviours, identify key influencers&#xD;
      and understand the facilitators and barriers to behaviour change from different perspectives.&#xD;
      Sample size will be determined by saturation sampling, that is, continuing investigating&#xD;
      until no new information is uncovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key staff from relevant nutrition experts and governmental and non-governmental organisations&#xD;
      will be trained to use Optifood, and asked to provide feedback on how it may be adapted to&#xD;
      support nutrition programme planning activities. Next, Optifood will be used to evaluate and&#xD;
      refine current FBRs for the target population, which will then be tested with mothers of&#xD;
      children aged 9-11 months in the study area. This age group has been selected since 9-11&#xD;
      month old infants will likely demonstrate greater nutritional benefit when compared to older&#xD;
      children, and they have more established CF intakes than a younger age group (e.g. 6-8&#xD;
      months) that is more likely to be transitioning to eating complementary foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organisational staff will be purposefully selected from relevant NGOs and research institutes&#xD;
      in Peru, Thailand and India. Relevant global nutrition experts will also be purposefully&#xD;
      sampled for the initial pilot test in Geneva. Sampling will be purposive as the research team&#xD;
      is aiming for inclusiveness, not representativeness. The characteristics of participants in&#xD;
      the FGD will reflect the diversity and breadth of potential Optifood users. Organisations&#xD;
      will be selected based on whether they are involved in nutrition programming and would have&#xD;
      use for Optifood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers of children aged 9-11 months (n=60) will be recruited from six catchment areas within&#xD;
      the study setting to collect information on food patterns, which is needed to run Optifood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers of children aged 9-11 months (n=36) will also be randomly selected from six&#xD;
      subcentres in Kheri Kalan PHC (i.e. 6 randomly selected mothers from each subcentre) to test&#xD;
      FBRs once they have been finalised using Optifood. This number is based on the recommended&#xD;
      sample size from the Trials for Improved Practices (TIPs) protocol guidance, and factors in&#xD;
      an attrition rate of 10% based on observed in a similar TIPs study in Indonesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health workers (n=3-6 per FGD) will be purposefully selected from each study area to express&#xD;
      their impressions of the new FBRs in FGDs. Sampling will be purposive as the research team is&#xD;
      aiming for inclusiveness, not representativeness. The number of FGDs will depend on the&#xD;
      number required to reach data saturation i.e., repeated and new material or themes do not&#xD;
      emerge. Characteristics of Health workers in the FGDs will reflect the diversity and breadth&#xD;
      of potential Health workers involved in the promotion of nutrition messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data collection methods in this study include QQs, FFQs, and 24-HRs. All&#xD;
      quantitative data will be double-entered and data entry errors will be identified using range&#xD;
      and consistency checks. After the data are cleaned, they will be transferred to Stata 11&#xD;
      software for analysis. Dietary data will be analysed in a specific diet program that has been&#xD;
      developed using Microsoft Excel. Categories will be generated for continuous variables as&#xD;
      needed. Data will be analysed and represented using numerical, graphical and tabular methods.&#xD;
      In order to estimate any changes in infant diet when FBRs are tested with mothers, paired&#xD;
      t-tests will be used to identify differences in means with 95% CIs for all 24-HRs.&#xD;
      Differences will be considered significant at P&lt; 0.05. Statistics will be used for&#xD;
      descriptive purposes, i.e. the study population will be represented as proportions, means,&#xD;
      etc. and dietary data will be represented in means and standard deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will rely heavily on FGDs, IDIs and structured observations at various stages for&#xD;
      insights into how to refine the Optifood tool. Qualitative analysis will be iterative, thus&#xD;
      evolve alongside data collection. NVivo 8 software will be used to store and code all the FGD&#xD;
      and IDI transcripts after they have been translated into English. Contents of FGD and IDI&#xD;
      transcripts will identify the range of health personnel and mothers' reactions to Optifood&#xD;
      and FBRs, respectively. A thematic approach will be used to code FDGs and IDIs, starting with&#xD;
      initial free coding with an ultimate aim of categorizing themes into categories. This process&#xD;
      will not use a grounded theory approach, in which coding is entirely inductive.8 However, all&#xD;
      qualitative data will be coded allowing for emergence of new unanticipated themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triangulation of data is important to establish reliability of data. Accordingly, data from&#xD;
      all the FGDs and IDIs will be compared and checked against each other for inconsistencies and&#xD;
      completeness. Doing so will help the student ascertain the most &quot;correct&quot; interpretation of&#xD;
      data. All conclusions will be presented to key study staff for accuracy to further improve&#xD;
      reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1- Developing the Optifood tool&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global nutrition experts will be trained to use the Optifood tool in Geneva. Two FGDs will be&#xD;
      conducted during and 1-day post-training to assess the performance and potential applications&#xD;
      of Optifood. A self-administered QQ will be collected to obtain information on computer&#xD;
      literacy, professional experience and socio-demographics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will take place with a trained facilitator with fluency in local language(s) and a&#xD;
      transcriber. Nutrition experts will answer questions on recommended changes, as well as the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of Optifood. Open-ended questions will be asked, and then&#xD;
      followed up by specific prompts which relate to the research question. FGDs will be recorded&#xD;
      with digital recorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health personnel will answer self-administered QQs on computer literacy, professional&#xD;
      experience and sociodemographic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2- Adapting Optifood for local use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key staff from NGOs and/or research institutes in Lima, Bangkok and New Delhi will be trained&#xD;
      to use the Optifood tool. For each organisation, two FGDs will be conducted during and 7-days&#xD;
      post-training to assess the performance and potential applications of Optifood. A&#xD;
      self-administered QQ will be collected to obtain information on computer literacy,&#xD;
      professional experience and socio-demographics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FGDs will take place with a trained facilitator with fluency in local language(s) and a&#xD;
      transcriber. Health personnel will answer questions on recommended changes, as well as the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of Optifood. Open-ended questions will be asked, and then&#xD;
      followed up by specific prompts which relate to the research question. FGDs will be recorded&#xD;
      with digital recorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QQs will be translated into local languages as needed. Health personnel will answer&#xD;
      self-administered QQs on computer literacy, professional experience and sociodemographic&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3 - Using Optifood to develop, test and refine FBRs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing FBRs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optifood will be used to develop population-specific FBRs for the target population. In order&#xD;
      to run the model, Optifood requires data on the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. List of foods eaten by the target population&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Average portion size&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How many times/week the food could be consumed&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Whether the food is staple food (Yes/No)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Whether the food is a snack (Yes/No)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cost per 100 grams edible portion for each food&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Information on food patterns by food groups (e.g. legumes, fruit, vegetables, milk,&#xD;
           etc.) to be measured in number of servings/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. This information should also include a lower level (5th percentile), upper level&#xD;
           (95th percentile) and average (50th percentile)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Food Composition Table&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Average body weight of population - this can be an estimate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of these data are available through the collaborating partners. However, data on cost of&#xD;
      food and food frequency needs to be collected in order to run Optifood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A food sub-group frequency questionnaire will be used to collect dietary data on the weekly&#xD;
      frequency of consumption for each food sub-group usually consumed by children aged 9-11&#xD;
      months. The food groups and sub-groups to include in the FFQ will be finalised in India based&#xD;
      on foods reported in the dietary survey data from SAS. This FFQ is based on the FFQ used in&#xD;
      the National Nutrition Survey in Colombia. Data will be collected from 30 mothers of infants&#xD;
      aged 9-11 months. For each food sub-group, a trained research assistant fluent in local&#xD;
      language(s) will ask mothers if any foods from a food sub-group (i.e. cooked vegetables,&#xD;
      salads or raw vegetables) are consumed by the child. If the answer is yes, mothers will be&#xD;
      asked to estimate the number of times her child consumed foods from this sub-group over the&#xD;
      past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A market survey will also be done to obtain cost of foods consumed per 100g edible portion.&#xD;
      Research assistants will go to 3 local markets and 3 food sellers in each study setting to&#xD;
      collect one sample of each frequently consumed food regardless of whether it is cooked or&#xD;
      raw. The edible portion will be determined from the grams of food purchased. For cooked&#xD;
      foods, raw ingredients will be purchased and cooked to provide a cost per 100g edible&#xD;
      portion. This method is based on one used in a similar study in Indonesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once these data have been collected, Optifood will be used to generate FBRs for each target&#xD;
      population in each study setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing FBRs with mothers&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interviewer-administered socio-demographic QQ will be collected to obtain descriptive data&#xD;
      on participants testing the FBRs. QQs will be translated into local languages as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon development, FBRs will be tested with 36 mothers of infants aged 9-11 months. Evaluation&#xD;
      methodology is based on the ProPAN strategy, with one modification of using the Trial of&#xD;
      Improved Practices (TIPs) method of testing multiple instead of individual FBRs with each&#xD;
      mother. Sample size is based on TIPS guidance and a similar study in Indonesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research assistants will introduce FBRs to mothers in their respective homes. IDIs will be&#xD;
      done to assess their impressions of the FBRs and the feasibility of adopting them. Mothers&#xD;
      will be given 7 days to implement the FBRs. IDIs will be done at the beginning, middle and&#xD;
      end of the 7-day testing period (Day 8) to reinforce messages and to assess feasibility of&#xD;
      long-term practice. IDIs will take place with a trained interviewer with fluency in local&#xD;
      language(s). Mothers will answer questions on the feasibility and acceptability of FBRs,&#xD;
      barriers to their use and potential ways to change them after they have put the FBRs into&#xD;
      practice. IDIs at the final visit at the end of the 7-day testing period will be recorded&#xD;
      with digital recorders. Based on IDI results, FBRs will be refined for use in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child's dietary intakes will also be assessed using a modification of the interactive&#xD;
      multiple-pass 24-hour recall7 pre- and post-FBR introduction. Trained research assistants&#xD;
      with fluency in local language(s) will ask mothers to recall all food and beverages consumed&#xD;
      by their child in the past 24 hours, and estimate the amount of each food consumed. The&#xD;
      modification that will be made to the original interactive multiple-pass 24 hour recall is&#xD;
      that at the end of the interview, mothers will also be asked to estimate the frequency of&#xD;
      consumption of each food over the past week. Infant weight will also be measured at the end&#xD;
      of the 7-day testing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health workers will also provide additional data on the barriers to nutrition counseling, as&#xD;
      well as the feasibility and acceptability of promoting the Optifood-generated FBRs in&#xD;
      comparison with those currently being used. Health workers will participate in a FGD to&#xD;
      collect data on these FBRs. A trained facilitator with fluency in local language(s) and a&#xD;
      transcriber will ask health workers open-ended questions about their impressions of the FBRs,&#xD;
      the feasibility of promoting them, and barriers to nutrition counseling in the target area.&#xD;
      FGDs will be recorded with digital recorders. A brief socio-demographic QQ will also be&#xD;
      administered to health workers to collect descriptive data.&#xD;
