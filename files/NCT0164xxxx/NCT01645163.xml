      Aims and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to develop, design and pilot a mHealth intervention to strengthen CF&#xD;
      components of the ICDS programme. Specific objectives seek to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. Exploring caregivers, AWWs and other relevant ICDS personnel's views on the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and best means of using mobile phones to facilitate the process of delivering&#xD;
      CF counselling within the ICDS programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Designing a context-specific, relevant and sustainable mHealth intervention to&#xD;
      strengthen CF components of the ICDS programme based on existing evidence and views of&#xD;
      caregivers, AWWs and other relevant ICDS personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Pilot testing and refining the mHealth intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that a mHealth intervention might potentially strengthen CF components of&#xD;
      the ICDS programme. Accordingly, qualitative and quantitative strategies will be used to&#xD;
      develop, design and pilot a mHealth intervention that endeavours to address the following&#xD;
      three barriers within the ICDS programme: (i) inadequate feeding practices, (ii) not&#xD;
      targeting children under 3 years of age, and (iii) poor AWW supervision and unmanageable&#xD;
      workload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) will be conducted in the study&#xD;
      site with AWWs, other relevant ICDS personnel and mothers/caregivers of children aged 9-11&#xD;
      months to assess the feasibility, acceptability and best means of using mobile phones to&#xD;
      facilitate the process of delivering CF counselling and improving AWW supervision and&#xD;
      workload. Any changes in infant diet will be also be assessed using 24-hour dietary recalls.&#xD;
      This infant age group has been selected since 9-11 month old infants will likely demonstrate&#xD;
      greater nutritional benefit when compared to older children, and they have more established&#xD;
      CF intakes than a younger age group (e.g. 6-8 months) that is more likely to be transitioning&#xD;
      to eating complementary foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-demographic questionnaires will also be administered to AWWs, ICDS personnel and&#xD;
      mothers/caregivers for descriptive data. Findings will be presented in an intervention design&#xD;
      workshop to develop the mHealth intervention, which will then be pilot tested and refined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed-methods research is recommended for exploring complex interventions. Accordingly,&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to address the study objectives. The study&#xD;
      will use a wide range of respondents to gain a broader understanding of current behaviours,&#xD;
      identify key influencers and understand the facilitators and barriers to behaviour change&#xD;
      from different perspectives. Sample size will be determined by saturation sampling, that is,&#xD;
      continuing investigating until no new information is uncovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      AWWs, relevant ICDS personnel and mothers/caregivers of children aged 9-11 months will be&#xD;
      purposively selected from the study area. Criterion for selection is that the participants&#xD;
      are involved in nutrition counselling within the ICDS programme. Sampling will be purposive&#xD;
      as the research team is aiming for inclusiveness, not representativeness. The number of FGDs&#xD;
      and IDIs will depend on the number required to reach data saturation i.e., repeated and new&#xD;
      material or themes do not emerge. The characteristics of AWWs and other relevant ICDS&#xD;
      personnel in the FGDs and IDIs will reflect the diversity and breadth of potential AWWs and&#xD;
      other relevant ICDS personnel involved in the promotion of nutrition messages. The&#xD;
      characteristics of mothers/caregivers in the FGDs and IDIs will also reflect the diversity&#xD;
      and breadth of potential mothers/caregivers receiving nutrition messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1.1: Assessing the feasibility, acceptability and best means of using mobile phones&#xD;
      for CF counselling&#xD;
&#xD;
      FGD 1.1.1 and FGD 1.1.2 will take place with a trained facilitator and a person for&#xD;
      transcription with fluency in local language(s). AWWs, relevant ICDS personnel and&#xD;
      mothers/caregivers will answer questions on the feasibility, acceptability and best ways of&#xD;
      using mobile phones to facilitate the process of delivering CF counselling within the ICDS&#xD;
      programme. Open-ended questions will be asked, and then followed up by specific prompts which&#xD;
      relate to the research question. FGDs will be recorded with digital recorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QQ 1.1.1, QQ 1.2.2 and QQ 1.2.3 will be translated into local languages as needed.&#xD;
      Mothers/caregivers will answer an interviewer-administered questionnaire on socio-demographic&#xD;
      information. Questions about mobile phones will also be asked by trained interviewers with&#xD;
      fluency in local language(s) to inform Study 2. AWWs and other relevant ICDS personnel will&#xD;
      answer self-administered questionnaires on mobile phone use, professional experience and&#xD;
      socio-demographic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1.2: Designing a mHealth intervention to strengthen CF components of the ICDS&#xD;
      programme&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data about potential usage of mobile phones within the ICDS system will be presented at an&#xD;
      intervention development workshop where stakeholders and relevant experts will review the&#xD;
      findings of the formative research and make decisions about the mHealth intervention's&#xD;
      content and structure. Outputs will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behaviour change strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mHealth intervention strategy and components, including who should be targeted and how&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conceptual framework of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention materials including manuals, protocols and creative briefs will be written as&#xD;
      needed after the intervention design workshop. Relevant intervention components will also be&#xD;
      tried out prior to the pilot intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that the outcome of this workshop is entirely evidence-driven; that is, no&#xD;
      further details can be provided on the potential design of the mHealth intervention until&#xD;
      data from FGDs with AWWs, other relevant ICDS personnel and mothers/caregivers have been&#xD;
      collected and analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1.3: Pilot testing and refining the mHealth intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mHealth intervention will be pilot tested and refined with relevant ICDS personnel and&#xD;
      mothers/caregivers in order to test all operational elements that were selected and developed&#xD;
      in the intervention design workshop. This pilot study will purposively select participants -&#xD;
      mothers/caregivers, AWWs and/or other relevant ICDS personnel depending on the intervention&#xD;
      design - from the study site to pilot test the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AWWs will be trained on counselling messages prior to implementing the pilot test with mobile&#xD;
      phones. The pilot test take place over 6 weeks with approximately 72 purposively selected&#xD;
      participants. Any changes in infant diet will be measured by administering to&#xD;
      mothers/caregivers in the pilot study before and after the pilot study. Process evaluation&#xD;
      tools will also be used to measure context, fidelity to protocol, dose, and facilitators and&#xD;
      barriers to implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the pilot testing period, IDIs will be used with study participants to collect&#xD;
      data on the following indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility (including frequency and timing of messages and/or phone calls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tone of messages&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Barriers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Facilitating factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modifications&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of IDIs will depend on the number required to reach data saturation i.e., repeated&#xD;
      and new material or themes do not emerge. Participant characteristics in the IDIs will&#xD;
      reflect the diversity and breadth of study participants recruited to test mobile phones in&#xD;
      the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QQs will also be used with study participants to collect socio-demographic information.&#xD;
      Interviewer-administered QQs will be used with mothers/caregivers if they are part of the&#xD;
      study due to low literacy rates in both the proposed study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will be collected with the aim of describing the successes and challenges of&#xD;
      implementing a mHealth intervention in this setting, and how it may potentially be used&#xD;
      within the ICDS programme and other settings to deliver complementary feeding counselling.&#xD;
      They will be used to further refine the mHealth intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed protocols including sampling strategies, QQs and forms to collect data will be&#xD;
      finalised once a context-specific mHealth intervention has been developed in the intervention&#xD;
      design workshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data collection methods in this study include QQs and 24-hour recalls. All&#xD;
      quantitative data will be double-entered and data entry errors will be identified using range&#xD;
      and consistency checks. After the data are cleaned, they will be transferred to STATA 11&#xD;
      software for analysis. Dietary data will be analysed in a specific diet program that has been&#xD;
      developed using Microsoft Excel. Categories will be generated for continuous variables as&#xD;
      needed. Data will be analysed and represented using numerical, graphical and tabular methods.&#xD;
      In order to estimate any changes in infant diet when FBRs are tested with mothers/caregivers&#xD;
      (Objective 1.3), paired t-tests will be used to identify differences in means with 95% CIs&#xD;
      for all dietary outcomes. Differences will be considered significant at P&lt; 0.05. Statistics&#xD;
      will be used for descriptive purposes, i.e. the study population will be represented as&#xD;
      proportions, means, etc. and dietary data from the pilot test will be represented in means&#xD;
      and standard deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will rely heavily on FGDs, IDIs and structured observations at various stages for&#xD;
      insights into how to develop, implement, and evaluate the mHealth intervention. Qualitative&#xD;
      analysis will be iterative, thus evolve alongside data collection. NVivo 8 software will be&#xD;
      used to store and code all the FGD and IDI transcripts after they have been translated into&#xD;
      English. Contents of FGD and IDI transcripts will identify the range of ICDS personnel and&#xD;
      mothers/caregivers' reactions to FBRs and using mobile phones for nutrition counselling. A&#xD;
      thematic approach will be used to code FDGs and IDIs, starting with initial free coding with&#xD;
      an ultimate aim of categorizing themes into categories. In part, these codes will be based on&#xD;
      predetermined themes emerging from the literature review about nutrition counselling&#xD;
      interventions and the current state of the ICDS programme in India. This process will not use&#xD;
      a grounded theory approach, in which coding is entirely inductive.11 However, all qualitative&#xD;
      data will be coded allowing for emergence of new unanticipated themes which will influence&#xD;
      the pre-conceptualised framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triangulation of data is important to establish reliability of data. 12 Accordingly, data&#xD;
      from all the FGDs and IDIs will be compared and checked against each other for&#xD;
      inconsistencies and completeness. Doing so will help the student ascertain the most &quot;correct&quot;&#xD;
      interpretation of data. All conclusions will be presented to key study staff for accuracy to&#xD;
      further improve reliability.&#xD;
