  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various parts of the brain are sensitive to various anesthetics.We like to study the effect&#xD;
      of dexmedetomidine on the different parts of the brain in patients who are coming for DBS&#xD;
      electrode removal under sedation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cortical and sub cortical structures will have different sensitivities to various&#xD;
      anesthetics.The objective of this study is to look at the changes in the intracranial&#xD;
      electroencephalographic (EEG) characteristics during dexmedetomidine sedation and to&#xD;
      determine the differences in the EEG characteristics between cortical and subcortical&#xD;
      structures.&#xD;

    <description>iEEG data from each patient was analyzed using MATLAB (Natick, MA, USA). Data were presented as power spectral density, also referred to as the power spectrum or spectrum which quantifies the frequency distribution of energy or power within a signal. The spectrogram is a time-varying version of the spectrum. In these spectrograms, frequencies are arranged along the y-axis, and time along the x-axis, and power is indicated by color on a decibel (dB) scale. The power spectrum was computed for each channel using The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). A window length of 20,000 data points was chosen in order to incorporate 4 cycles of a 1 Hz signal. The length of each window was therefore 4 seconds. A Hanning window was used to avoid edge effects of the windowing procedure. The length of the FFT was chosen to be 32768, which is the next power of 2 of the window length. The window overlap was set to zero.</description>
