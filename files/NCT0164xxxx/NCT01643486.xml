      Hypothesis: The use of a program that assists with selection of the appropriate number of&#xD;
      phosphate binders for a meal based on patient specific factors will result in improved serum&#xD;
      phosphate control, a reduction in overall number of phosphate binders used and enhanced&#xD;
      patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To determine if teaching patients to use a 'phosphate counting' program&#xD;
      installed on an iTouch that selects the appropriate amount of phosphate binder to be taken&#xD;
      with each meal is associated with better phosphate control than usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: There will be 3 phases to the study. Phase 1: Recruitment of 60 peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis (PD) patients. The information generated from this phase will be used to develop the&#xD;
      iTouch program for phosphate counting and matching binder number. Phase 2: iTouch program&#xD;
      once developed will be pilot tested on a convenience sample of 10 PD patients and modified if&#xD;
      required. Phase 3: Randomized controlled trial of 92 PD patients to determine if using the&#xD;
      iTouch phosphate counting program reduces serum phosphate compared to controls. Success would&#xD;
      be based on seeing a statistically significant difference in serum phosphate as expected from&#xD;
      our sample size calculation&#xD;

      Project approach and work plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: In the week prior to the collection of standard pre-clinic blood work (to include&#xD;
      calcium, phosphate, PTH), PD patients will keep a 3-day diary that will include all foods and&#xD;
      beverages consumed in addition to the portion sizes. At the time of standard pre-clinic&#xD;
      bloodwork collection, patients will perform an adequest. Medication lists will be reviewed&#xD;
      for: 1) Proton pump inhibitors/ H2 receptor antagonists 2) 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25&#xD;
      dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 3) phosphate binders. Doses taken the week prior to standard&#xD;
      pre-clinic blood work when the diet diaries are compiled will be recorded. This information&#xD;
      will be used for 2 separate purposes: 1) A list of the foods that are actually being eaten by&#xD;
      the PD patients will be generated 2) The 3-day average phosphate content will be estimated&#xD;
      from each PD patient's food diaries. A regression equation that predicts serum phosphate&#xD;
      concentration taking into account phosphate intake, the amount of phosphate binders taken,&#xD;
      the dose of vitamin D, use of proton pump inhibitors/H2 antagonists, dialysis adequacy, and&#xD;
      serum PTH concentration will be generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: An iTouch program will be developed using Phase 1 information to assist patients in&#xD;
      meal phosphate counting and appropriate binder selection. Processes used to develop similar&#xD;
      programs such as the pilot study in patients with diabetes mellitus will be used. A&#xD;
      convenience sample of 10 PD patients will use the iTouch program for one month and document&#xD;
      their impressions about ease of use, convenience and applicability to their diet choices.&#xD;
      Changes to the program will be incorporated based on the patient's comments and laboratory&#xD;
      values. If substantial changes are required, another convenience sample of 10 PD patients&#xD;
      will be invited to use the program and provide feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: 80 consenting PD patients from the Ottawa Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital (if&#xD;
      required) will be randomized to usual care for managing phosphate versus use of the iTouch&#xD;
      program for meal phosphate counting and matching binder use. This phase of the trial will&#xD;
      last 3 months. As simply recording meal phosphate intake in the iTouch program may have an&#xD;
      impact on patient behavior, the control group will be asked to enter this data into the&#xD;
      program but no binder therapy information will be provided to the patients. During the course&#xD;
      of the study, the dose of vitamin D and PD prescription will be held constant in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: All 60 PD patients will be recruited over a 6-month period. Data entry and&#xD;
      statistical analysis are expected to take another 2-4 months. Phase 2: Actual development of&#xD;
      the iTouch program using the data generated in phase 1 is expected to take about 6 months. It&#xD;
      is anticipated that all 10 patients will be recruited over a 2-month period with a further&#xD;
      one-month of follow-up. Interviews with the patients and collation of the data are expected&#xD;
      to take another month. It is unclear how much time will be required to make adjustments to&#xD;
      the iTouch program but we anticipate &lt;3months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: We anticipate that we can recruit the 80 patients from the greater than 250 patients&#xD;
      at the Ottawa Hospital and St Michaels Home Dialysis programs and complete the 3 months of&#xD;
      follow-up in approximately 12-18months. Data analysis and manuscript preparation should take&#xD;
      another 4-5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Given the large number of PD patients in the two programs, the novelty of Phase 2&#xD;
      and 3 and the incentives in Phase 3, we do not anticipate difficulties with recruitment. The&#xD;
      laboratory tests are all standard and visits will occur during a patient's regularly&#xD;
      scheduled PD visit.&#xD;
