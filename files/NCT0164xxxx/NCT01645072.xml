  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a frequent cause of morbidity in the pediatric age group. Many catastrophic&#xD;
      epilepsies present during infancy and childhood1. Seizures in these epileptic disorders are&#xD;
      difficult to control; sometimes only at the expense of multiple and toxic levels of&#xD;
      antiepileptic medications. The shortcomings of antiepileptic drug therapy and epilepsy&#xD;
      surgery warrants the need for alternative treatments. Ketogenic diet is effective for&#xD;
      refractory epilepsies (33% of patients with refractory epilepsy have more than 50% reduction&#xD;
      in seizures from the baseline and 15-20% become seizure free) and has gained widespread&#xD;
      acceptance. Low glycemic index diet treatment (LGIT) is designed as a variant of ketogenic&#xD;
      diet. There are retrospective studies on LGIT in childhood refractory epilepsy reporting&#xD;
      seizure reduction comparable to that of patients on ketogenic diet. There have been no&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of the low glycemic index diet in&#xD;
      refractory epilepsy. In this study we plan to assess the efficacy of LGIT among children with&#xD;
      drug refractory epilepsy.&#xD;

      Each patient will undergo detailed clinical evaluation according to a structured proforma.&#xD;
      Seizure type, frequency, age at onset, perinatal details, family history, developmental&#xD;
      status and treatment history will be recorded. Corticosteroids or ACTH (if patient is already&#xD;
      on) would be tapered off 2 weeks before starting LGIT. All co-medications will be changed to&#xD;
      carbohydrate free preparations, wherever available only in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized in to two groups: the intervention and the control arm.&#xD;
      Both groups will undergo a baseline four week observation period, during which parents will&#xD;
      be asked to maintain a daily seizure log; recording seizure type, duration and frequency. In&#xD;
      the intervention arm, the children will be started on low glycemic index diet after this&#xD;
      4-week baseline period. The control group will receive their usual diet without any&#xD;
      alteration. No changes will be made to the patients' antiepileptic medication during the&#xD;
      4-week baseline or the 3-month study periods in both the intervention and control groups,&#xD;
      unless medically indicated; e.g. drug side effects, or status epilepticus; in which case&#xD;
      appropriate changes will be made to their medications and same will be documented. The drop&#xD;
      out from the intervention group will be documented along with the reason for the same. At the&#xD;
      end of the 3 month study period patient in the intervention arm will be continued with the&#xD;
      LGIT but that will not come under the purview of this study. At the end of three months study&#xD;
      period, patients in the control arm will be offered the option of low glycemic index diet&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low glycemic index diet administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Three day food intake by recall method will be documented&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The calorie requirement would be calculated as per the recommended daily allowance (RDA)&#xD;
           for the ideal weight for that age&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diet regime will be explained to the parents&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients (wherever applicable) and their parents will be given diet counseling&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. LGIT will be started on out patient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Medium and high-GI carbohydrates (GI &gt;55) will be eliminated from the diet and only food&#xD;
           items with low glycemic index (GI &lt;55) will be allowed. Parent will be given a list of&#xD;
           low glycemic index food items33. They will also be given a list of food items (medium&#xD;
           and high glycemic index) which should be avoided. (Appendix)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Total carbohydrates intake will be restricted to 10% of caloric intake/ day (maximum&#xD;
           40-60 g/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Carbohydrate values of various food items will be explained in detail, and carbohydrate&#xD;
           exchange lists will be provided to the parent. Three to four 15 gram carbohydrate&#xD;
           exchanges will be allowed in a day. (Appendix)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Fats (e.g. cream, butter, oils and ghee) can be taken by the patient without any&#xD;
           restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Proteins intake will be allowed up to 30% of the total caloric intake per day (cheese,&#xD;
           fish, eggs, chicken and soya products).&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Sample menu will be discussed with the parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Clear carbohydrate free fluids will not be restricted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Children will be reviewed as outpatients at 1, 2 and 3 months. A three day dietary&#xD;
      intake chart will be reviewed at each visit to compute calorie and carbohydrate intake, and&#xD;
      to evaluate and reinforce compliance with the prescribed diet. Weight will be checked at each&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
