  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia and depression are two of the most prevalent mental health disorders and often&#xD;
      co-occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health disparities in rural America and among African-Americans are well documented. The&#xD;
      investigators propose an R34 exploratory project to test the feasibility of delivering&#xD;
      high-fidelity insomnia and depression psychological services to an underserved population.&#xD;
      Treatment of Insomnia and Depression in Elders (TIDE) is a pilot study that will treat rural,&#xD;
      predominantly African-American older adults who present to their primary care physician with&#xD;
      co-occurring insomnia/depression. Stage 1 will be an uncontrolled case study series (n = 10)&#xD;
      focusing on treatment development/refinement and patient acceptability. In stage 2,&#xD;
      feasibility will be experimentally tested with 46 participants randomized to integrated&#xD;
      cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) + usual care or to usual care only in an effectiveness pilot&#xD;
      study. The treatment will combine/integrate compact CBT for insomnia (including relaxation,&#xD;
      sleep restriction, and stimulus control) and for depression (including cognitive therapy and&#xD;
      behavioral activation). The experimental intervention comprises delivering CBT services by&#xD;
      videoconferencing to patients in primary care settings who live in rural areas. Treatment&#xD;
      will be evaluated by pre, post, and follow-up self report instruments on insomnia,&#xD;
      depression, and quality of life. In addition, the stage 1 pilot will use investigator&#xD;
      designed quantitative and qualitative measures to evaluate critical process variables&#xD;
      including patient acceptability of the video format, patient acceptability of the treatments,&#xD;
      and obstacles to adherence. Depending on stage 1 data, these measures may be incorporated&#xD;
      into stage 2 as well. Several innovative features of this exploratory project include:&#xD;
      intervening with CBT on both disorders hoping to gain a synergy by their combined&#xD;
      presentation; use of telehealth to deliver treatment to distant locations; translation of&#xD;
      efficacy findings to an effectiveness trial; treatment will be delivered in the primary care&#xD;
      setting, the preferred locale of rural, older adults; the study will extend knowledge of the&#xD;
      range of CBT applications by enrolling under-represented groups with respect to ethnicity,&#xD;
      literacy, and financial resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of this project are (1) to determine the feasibility and maximal therapy&#xD;
      characteristics of integrated CBT for co-occurring insomnia/depression in both the case study&#xD;
      series (stage 1) and the experimental investigation (stage 2), (2) collect pilot data on&#xD;
      whether participants receiving integrated CBT + usual care show comparable or greater&#xD;
      reductions in insomnia symptoms compared to participants receiving usual care at&#xD;
      posttreatment and follow-up, and (3) collect pilot data on whether participants receiving&#xD;
      integrated CBT + usual care show comparable or greater reductions in depression symptoms&#xD;
      compared to participants receiving usual care at posttreatment and follow-up.&#xD;
