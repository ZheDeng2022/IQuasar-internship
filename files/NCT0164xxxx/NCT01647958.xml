      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Transoral Incisionless&#xD;
      Fundoplication (TIF) performed with EsophyX as compared to proton pump inhibitor (PPI)&#xD;
      therapy for the treatment of chronic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) patients with&#xD;
      refractory symptoms on Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of TIF performed with&#xD;
      EsophyX as compared to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for the treatment of chronic GERD&#xD;
      patients with medically refractory GERD symptoms other than heartburn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: TIF will be superior to PPIs in eliminating or significantly improving&#xD;
      daily bothersome GERD symptoms and/or troublesome regurgitation, if present, at 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up. Secondary hypotheses: TIF will be superior to PPIs in eliminating or significantly&#xD;
      improving daily bothersome GERD symptoms and/or troublesome regurgitation, if present, at&#xD;
      12-, 24-, 36-, 48- and 60-month follow-up. The majority of surgical patients will have&#xD;
      normalized or 50% improved esophageal acid exposure compared to baseline at 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up. The majority of surgical patients will be completely off PPIs at 6-, 12-, 24-,&#xD;
      36-, 48- and 60-month follow-up compared to baseline. The majority of crossover patients will&#xD;
      be completely off PPIs at 6-, 18-, 30-, 42- and 54-month follow-up compared to baseline. A&#xD;
      statistically greater proportion of crossover patients treated with TIF will be free of daily&#xD;
      bothersome symptom(s) or will experience clinically significant improvement at 6-, 18-, 30-,&#xD;
      42- and 54-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) Symptom Elimination or Clinically Significant Improvement Evaluated by RSI (Reflux Symptom Index) and RDQ (Reflux Disease Questionnaire).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Elimination or clinically significant improvement in GERD symptoms, other than heartburn, refractory to PPI, evaluated by Reflux Symptom Index (RSI):9-item questionnaire measures atypical symptoms: hoarseness, throat clearing, excess throat mucus, dysphagia, cough. Scale for each item ranges from 0 (no problem) to 5 (severe), with max total score of 45, normality threshold of â‰¤13. Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ):12-item questionnaire to assess frequency and severity of heartburn (4 items measure frequency/severity of pain and burning behind breastbone), regurgitation (4 items measure frequency/severity of acid taste in mouth and movement of material upward from stomach), and dyspeptic complaints (4 items measure frequency and severity of pain or burning in upper stomach). Responses from 0 (not present) to 5 (daily) for frequency and 0 (not present) to 5 (severe) for severity. Scores calculated as mean of item responses with higher scores indicating more severe or frequent symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Elimination or clinically significant improvement in troublesome regurgitation refractory to PPIs as evaluated by the disease-specific and validated instrument, Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ):12-item questionnaire assesses frequency and severity of heartburn (4 items measure frequency and severity of pain and burning behind breastbone), regurgitation (4 items measuring the frequency and severity of acid taste in mouth and movement of material upward from stomach), and dyspeptic complaints (4 items measure frequency and severity of pain or burning in upper stomach). Responses range from 0 (not present) to 5 (daily) for frequency and 0 (not present) to 5 (severe) for severity. Patient's score is calculated as the mean of item responses with higher scores indicating more severe or frequent symptoms. A frequency score of 3 or more and severity score of 2 or more for the regurgitation questions were required to meet the Montreal consensus criteria for troublesome regurgitation.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Elimination of Daily Troublesome Heartburn Assessed Using a Validated Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Elimination of daily bothersome heartburn as measured by GERD-HRQL (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease - Health-Related Quality of Life) questionnaire. GERD-HRQL is a validated questionnaire used to assess typical GERD symptoms by measuring 10 items on the visual analog scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (worst symptoms). A higher total GERD-HRQL score (range from 0 to 50) indicates more severe GERD.&#xD;
Note Control Arm patients are assessed while on standard daily dose of PPIs.</description>

        <description>Elimination or clinically significant improvement in GERD symptoms, other than heartburn, refractory to PPI, evaluated by Reflux Symptom Index (RSI):9-item questionnaire measures atypical symptoms: hoarseness, throat clearing, excess throat mucus, dysphagia, cough. Scale for each item ranges from 0 (no problem) to 5 (severe), with max total score of 45, normality threshold of â‰¤13. Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ):12-item questionnaire to assess frequency and severity of heartburn (4 items measure frequency/severity of pain and burning behind breastbone), regurgitation (4 items measure frequency/severity of acid taste in mouth and movement of material upward from stomach), and dyspeptic complaints (4 items measure frequency and severity of pain or burning in upper stomach). Responses from 0 (not present) to 5 (daily) for frequency and 0 (not present) to 5 (severe) for severity. Scores calculated as mean of item responses with higher scores indicating more severe or frequent symptoms.</description>

        <description>Elimination of daily bothersome heartburn as measured by GERD-HRQL (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease - Health-Related Quality of Life) questionnaire. GERD-HRQL is a validated questionnaire used to assess typical GERD symptoms by measuring 10 items on the visual analog scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (worst symptoms). A higher total GERD-HRQL score (range from 0 to 50) indicates more severe GERD.&#xD;

          <description>Assessment of the number of patients reporting elimination of troublesome regurgitation using the validated Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ), a 12-item questionnaire to assess frequency and severity of heartburn (4 items measure frequency/severity of pain and burning behind breastbone), regurgitation (4 items measure frequency/severity of acid taste in mouth and movement of material upward from stomach), and dyspeptic complaints (4 items measure frequency and severity of pain or burning in upper stomach). Responses from 0 (not present) to 5 (daily) for frequency and 0 (not present) to 5 (severe) for severity. A frequency score of three or more and severity score of two or more for the regurgitation questions were required to meet the Montreal consensus criteria for troublesome regurgitation. The cohort of patients reported includes Treatment arm patients and Crossover patients combined as one group. Crossover patients included in the cohort are 30 months post TIF.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Elimination of Daily Troublesome Regurgitation (Primary Endpoint)</title>
          <description>Number of patients reporting elimination of troublesome regurgitation using the validated Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ), a 12-item questionnaire to assess frequency and severity of heartburn (4 items measure frequency/severity of pain and burning behind breastbone), regurgitation (4 items measuring frequency/severity of acid taste in mouth and movement of material upward from stomach), and dyspeptic complaints (4 items measure frequency/severity of pain or burning in upper stomach). 9 response options range from 0 (not present) to 5 (daily) for frequency and 0 (not present) to 5 (severe) for severity. Each patient's score is calculated as the mean of item responses, with higher scores indicating more frequent and/or severe symptoms. Cohort of patients reported at this time period includes Treatment arm patients and Control/Crossover patients combined as 1 group. Control/Crossover patients included in cohort are at 54 months post TIF.</description>
          <population>There were 44 patients available for follow up at 5 years post TIF. 43 were analyzed for regurgitation.&#xD;
Treatment and Control/Crossover patients were combined into one cohort, shown in Treatment arm. Control arm value is 0. Control/crossover patients are at 54 months post TIF.</population>
