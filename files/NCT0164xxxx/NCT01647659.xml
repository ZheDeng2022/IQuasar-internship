    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover study with&#xD;
      incomplete washout is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of 2mg GSK1120212 pediatric&#xD;
      oral solution formulation in comparison to 2mg GSK1120212 tablet formulation, to investigate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of a single dose of the GSK1120212 pediatric oral solution&#xD;
      formulation as compared to a single dose of the GSK1120212 tablet formulation, and to&#xD;
      investigate the palatability of the GSK1120212 pediatric oral solution formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned to one of two possible treatment sequences according to the&#xD;
      randomization code provided to the sites by GSK: a single dose of 2mg GSK1120212 pediatric&#xD;
      oral solution formulation then a single dose of 2mg GSK1120212 tablet formulation, or a&#xD;
      single dose of 2mg GSK1120212 tablet formulation, then a single dose of 2mg GSK1120212&#xD;
      pediatric oral solution formulation. Administration of GSK1120212 in either sequence will be&#xD;
      followed by 7 days of serial blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma&#xD;
      GSK1120212. Safety assessments, including assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      values (hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis) and vital signs, will be made&#xD;
      throughout the study. After completing the pharmacokinetic assessments for two periods,&#xD;
      eligible subjects may transition to MEK114375, an open-label rollover study of GSK1120212.&#xD;
