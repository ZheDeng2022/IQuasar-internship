      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the oral alendronate treatment of&#xD;
      post-menopausal osteoporosis could be a risk factor for jaw bone healing after dental&#xD;
      extraction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alendronate is the main oral bisphosphonate used in the treatment and the prevention of the&#xD;
      postmenopausal osteoporosis because of its high antiresorbant ability for bone tissue.&#xD;
      Alendronate delayed bone healing after dental extraction on animals models, murine as canine.&#xD;
      Anti-angiogenic and anti-osteoclastic characteristics are suggested to explain this&#xD;
      phenomenon. There is no available data in human and it is now well known that bisphosphonates&#xD;
      are involved in the occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaws even if this major adverse effect&#xD;
      seems to be very seldom with oral alendronate. Moreover, bisphosphonate showed toxicity for&#xD;
      oral mucosal cells. The main aim of this study is to quantify the impact of oral alendronate&#xD;
      weekly treatment on bone and mucosa healing after dental extraction in postmenopausal&#xD;
      osteoporotic women. A secondary aim is to investigate a panel of 50 peptids potentially&#xD;
      involved in bone and mucosal healing and to detect changes in their rates by salivary&#xD;
      proteomic approach. The investigators hope so identify salivary biomarkers of bone and/or&#xD;
      mucosa healing in these women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that after dental extraction, bone healing could be delayed in&#xD;
      postmenopausal osteoporotic women treated with oral weekly alendronate (BP+ group) versus&#xD;
      matched osteoporotic women untreated with bisphosphonates (BP- group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective and multicentric (17 investigation centers dispatched in France) study&#xD;
      including 140 osteoporotic postmenopausal women treated weekly with oral bisphosphonates (BP+&#xD;
      group) and 140 osteoporotic postmenopausal women untreated with bisphosphonates (BP- group).&#xD;
      This is a clinical follow-up study (T0, T0 + 7, T0 + 30, T0 + 90 days), a radiological study&#xD;
      (T0, T0 + 30, T0 + 90 days), and a salivary proteomic study (T0, T0 + 30, T0 + 90 days). This&#xD;
      is a 4 years study starting in april 2012 (anticipated date).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main investigated parameters are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone healing: Bone filling rate (in %) of the post-extractional alveolar socket (BFR) at&#xD;
           T0, T0 + 30 and T0 + 90 days by a radiographic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mucosa healing: mucosal injury by metric approach at T0 and T0 + 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivary biomarkers: Fifty peptides by proteomic approach at T0 and T0 + 30 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that this study will allow us to build a reference scale of bone and&#xD;
      mucosa healing in osteoporotic postmenopausal women treated weekly by oral alendronate. This&#xD;
      scale will be a helpful tool for dental physicians. The investigators hope also to identify&#xD;
      salivary biomarkers variations to make a diagnosis and a prognosis tool of worse bone healing&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives of this study is to constitute a national network of deleterious effect on bone&#xD;
      healing in such women patients and to up-date guidelines in this area.&#xD;
