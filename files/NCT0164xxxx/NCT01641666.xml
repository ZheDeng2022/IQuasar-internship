    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of boceprevir dosed 800 mg three&#xD;
      times daily (TID) orally (PO) in combination with Peginterferon alfa-2b (PEG2b) 1.5 mcg/kg&#xD;
      once a week (QW) administered subcutaneously (SC) plus ribavirin (RBV) (800 to 1400 mg/day)&#xD;
      PO in Response Guided Therapy (RGT) in adult Vietnamese subjects with Chronic Hepatitis C,&#xD;
      Genotype 1 (CHC GT1) who failed prior treatment with any interferon and ribavirin in Vietnam.&#xD;

      Each participant will participate in the trial for a maximum of 80 weeks from the time the&#xD;
      participant signs the Informed Consent Form (ICF) through the final contact. After a&#xD;
      Screening phase of approximately 4 to 8 weeks, each participant will receive treatment for&#xD;
      approximately 36-48 weeks depending on response at Treatment Week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4-week lead-in period with PEG2b plus RBV will be followed by 32 weeks boceprevir plus&#xD;
      PEG2b/RBV. At treatment Week 36 participants will be assigned to the following treatments&#xD;
      depending on the virologic response at Week 8 and cirrhotic status:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For non-cirrhotic participants with undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA on Week 8,&#xD;
           all treatment will be discontinued at Week 36.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For non-cirrhotic participants with detectable HCV-RNA on Week 8, only boceprevir&#xD;
           treatment will be discontinued at Week 36 and PEG2b and RBV treatment will continue to&#xD;
           Week 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For cirrhotic participants, the boceprevir plus PEG2b/RBV treatment will continue to&#xD;
           Week 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a futility rule at Week 12 at which point all subjects with detectable HCV-RNA&#xD;
      levels will be discontinued. All participants will have a post-treatment follow-up period of&#xD;
      at least 24 weeks.&#xD;
