  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, balanced, 3 way crossover study (3 periods)&#xD;
      in healthy adult subjects. During each period, subjects will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      GSK1265744 oral formulation in the fasted state and serial PK sampling for up to 168 hours (8&#xD;
      days) and safety assessments will be performed. Each period will be separated by a washout&#xD;
      period of at least 14 days and a follow-up visit will occur 10 to 14 days after the last dose&#xD;
      of study drug.&#xD;

             parameter outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included&#xD;
             only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is&#xD;

             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to more than four new investigational chemical entities within 12 months&#xD;

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140 millimeters of&#xD;
             mercury (mmHg), or diastolic blood pressure is outside the range of 45 to 90 mmHg.&#xD;
