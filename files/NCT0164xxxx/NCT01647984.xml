      Study on the role of a combination of nutraceuticals (Ritmonutra) with an effect on benign&#xD;
      supraventricular and ventricular extrasystoles in subjects free of a specific organic heart&#xD;
      disease. It has been suggested treatment with a nutritional supplement, able to normalize the&#xD;
      'cardiac electrophysiology' and help to maintain wellness. Ritmonutra ® is a combination of&#xD;
      nutraceuticals®, including Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, Hawthorn, Astaxanthin and&#xD;
      Vitamin E, help to normalize the heart pacing, reducing the total number of benign&#xD;
      extrasystoles and consequently improving the quality of life.&#xD;

      Benign supraventricular and ventricular extrasystoles may frequently occur in subjects free&#xD;
      of a specific organic heart disease. use of potent anti-arrhythmic is not indicated for these&#xD;
      kind of arrhythmias but the occurrence of this type of extrasystoles may generate concern in&#xD;
      patients and consequently worse quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Rationale Supraventricular and ventricular extrasystoles may frequently occur in&#xD;
           subjects free of a specific organic heart disease. The prognosis of these arrhythmias is&#xD;
           benign and the only clinical indication is to perform periodic medical examinations to&#xD;
           confirm the absence of an organic heart disease during follow up. Treatment of these&#xD;
           benign arrhythmias doesn't required use of potent anti-arrhythmic drugs because of their&#xD;
           potential side effects. However, the occurrence of this type of extrasystoles may&#xD;
           generate concern in patients despite the assurances of the physician, and consequently&#xD;
           worse quality of life. For these reasons it has been suggested treatment with a&#xD;
           nutritional supplement, able to normalize the 'cardiac electrophysiology' and help to&#xD;
           maintain wellness . Ritmonutra ® is a combination of nutraceuticals with a demonstrated&#xD;
           efficacy on preserving the physiological cardiovascular functions in addition to an&#xD;
           adequate diet. Ritmonutra ® is classified by the Ministry of Health as a food supplement&#xD;
           with Notification in 26 Settmbre 2011. The functional components of Ritmonutra ®,&#xD;
           including Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, Hawthorn, Astaxanthin and Vitamin E, help&#xD;
           to normalize the pace, reducing the total number of benign extrasystoles, and&#xD;
           consequently improving the quality of life. According to preliminary studies performed&#xD;
           in patients with benign extrasystoles, both supraventricular and ventricular, free of&#xD;
           specific heart disease, Ritmonutra ® has been demonstrated to have a significant effect&#xD;
           in reducing the number of total extrasystoles and in improving the wellness of the&#xD;
           subject. In particular, Ritmonutra ® was shown to improve the social life of individuals&#xD;
           and reduce the limitations caused by emotional state, without side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AIM OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim of the study is to investigate whether addition of Ritmonutra in addition to a&#xD;
           adequate diet can improve and normalize the regular rhythm in patients free of specific&#xD;
           organic cardiovascular disease compared to a mere placebo. Moreover, in patients with&#xD;
           symptomatic benign extrasytoles, the investigators want to evaluate whether this&#xD;
           nutraceutical supplement can reduce the discomfort related to perceiving these&#xD;
           arrhythmias and consequently improve life quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN multicentre, randomized, controlled parallel-group study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY POPULATION The study will include participation of one clinic centre coordinating&#xD;
           150 general practitioners (GPs). Each GP will select at least 10 subjects of both&#xD;
           gender, All participants will give written informed consent to the protocol approved by&#xD;
           the local institutional review boards. At least 150 doctors will take part in the study;&#xD;
           each will treat at least 10 subjects of both genders with diagnosis of symptomatic&#xD;
           benign ventricular and supraventricular extrasytoles, free of specific organic&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease and not requiring pharmacological therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
           GPs are required: 1) to record a full medical history, including smoking and drinking&#xD;
           habits, based on a pre-defined clinical record; 2) to collect demographic and&#xD;
           anthropometric measures (height, weight, waist circumference at the iliac crest); 3) to&#xD;
           perform a complete physical exam. At the first visit and after 4 and 8 weeks all&#xD;
           eligible patients will perform a complete physical exam that includes measure of office&#xD;
           blood pressure and heart rate in the sitting position and in triplicate, using a manual&#xD;
           sphygmomanometer, according to international guidelines. Measurements will be rounded to&#xD;
           the closest 2 mmHg interval. The baseline visit and the others screening visits also&#xD;
           include Electrocardiogram (ECG), Ergometric test, Echocardiogram and Holter ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary endpoint is reduction of total number of extrasystoles. Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
           the improvement in the wellness of the subject and consequently in the life quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1. Sample size The estimate of the sample size was performed by the SISA method&#xD;
           (Simple Interactive Statistical Analysis) - Machin, David and Campbell, Michael J.&#xD;
           (1987) Statistical Tables for the Design of Clinical Trials. Blackwell Scientific&#xD;
           Publications, Boston. Based on the values of a previous preliminary study comparing&#xD;
           Ritmonutra ® with a control group (-58.5% reduction of total extrasystoles after 4 weeks&#xD;
           with Ritmonutra ® compared with-0.5% in the control group) an approximate estimate was&#xD;
           made of the number of observations necessary so that the two percentages are significant&#xD;
           at the 5% probability level: 12 subjects cases in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. TREATMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           All subjects will receive dietary counseling determined by the general practitioner&#xD;
           depending on the subject's clinical condition, in accordance with the instructions of&#xD;
           the Coordinating Site. Centralized randomization will be used to assign subjects to one&#xD;
           of the two study treatments, Inert Placebo - Vitamin B complex + diet or vitamin B&#xD;
           complex - Ritmonutra ® + diet. How Ritmonutra will be taken: 2 tavgel gum daily of&#xD;
           Ritmonutra ® or vitamin B complex 2 tablets chewing a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Duration of treatment: Subjects in both groups will take the assigned treatment for 4&#xD;
           weeks. Ritmonutra ® contains: 720 mg of Fish Oil with Omega-3, including 480 mg of EPA&#xD;
           and 40 mg of DHA, Hawthorn (extract from Crataegus mongyna) 300 mg equivalent to 5.4 mg&#xD;
           of vitexin, 4 mg of Astaxanthin and 36 mg of Vitamin E.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. EVALUATION CRITERIA At baseline, and after 4 and 8 weeks cardiovascular parameters&#xD;
           (blood pressure, heart rate, Holter ECG) and the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire and&#xD;
           the 4SQ_2011questionnaire investigating somatic symptoms related to stress will be&#xD;
           assessed as well as the others clinical parameters necessary to evaluate the&#xD;
           cardiovascular risk and changes in life quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. STUDY PROCEDURES Each doctor will initially be given a login and password allowing&#xD;
           confidential and individual access to the website www.ritmonutra.net for data entry. In&#xD;
           order to avoid sampling errors, the doctor will include in the study the first 10&#xD;
           consecutive subjects who meet the admission criteria (see point 4). The doctor will&#xD;
           complete the appropriate form (also available on the ritmonutra.net site) insert&#xD;
           information of the point 0 and will assign the subject to one of two regimens, Inert&#xD;
           Placebo - Vitamin B complex + diet or vitamin B complex - Ritmonutra ® + diet, based on&#xD;
           what has been determined by centralized randomization under the responsibility of Prof.&#xD;
           Bruno Trimarco and delivery to the subject the treatment required for 4 weeks&#xD;
           (Ritmonutra ® or control). After four weeks all the subjects under go to Holter ECG, the&#xD;
           SF-36 and 4SQ_2011. After the first four weeks patients will receive the alternative&#xD;
           treatment provided by randomization (control - Ritmonutra ®). After another four weeks&#xD;
           all the subjects underwent 24-Hour Holter (ECG) monitoring , the SF-36 and 4SQ_2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The statistical analysis of baseline homogeneity will be undertaken&#xD;
           using the chi-square test and analysis of variance, if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The statistical analysis to assess the clinical efficacy will be based on a comparison&#xD;
           between differences at the various time points versus the baseline obtained in the two&#xD;
           treatment groups and will be conducted using the chi-square test and analysis of&#xD;
           variance, where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The level of significance will be considered to be an Alfa = 0.05 (type I error) and the&#xD;
           power level a beta = 0.90 (type II error).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. STUDY TIMELINES The study will start from the time the login and password have been&#xD;
           delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. AVAILABILITY OF DATA All participants will be informed of the results once the data have&#xD;
           been processed.&#xD;
