    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of dasatinib when given together&#xD;
      with ipilimumab in treating patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors or other sarcomas&#xD;
      that cannot be removed by surgery or have spread to other places in the body. Dasatinib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block tumor growth in different ways by&#xD;
      targeting certain cells. Giving dasatinib together with ipilimumab may be a better treatment&#xD;
      for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors or other sarcomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of treatment with ipilimumab in combination with&#xD;
      dasatinib in subjects with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and other advanced sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Response rate (RR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1,&#xD;
      immune-related response criteria, and Choi criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Progression free survival (PFS). III. Progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6months).&#xD;
      IV. Overall survival (OS). V. Immunological correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 7 days. Patients then receive&#xD;
      dasatinib PO QD and ipilimumab intravenously (IV) once on weeks 1, 4, 7 and 10. Beginning on&#xD;
      week 24, patients then receive dasatinib PO QD and ipilimumab IV once every 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
