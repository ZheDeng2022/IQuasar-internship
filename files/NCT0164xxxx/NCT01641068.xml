    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine thinking abilities, mood, and quality of life in&#xD;
      cancer survivors before and after an 8-week group-based memory and thinking skills workshop.&#xD;
      Research participants will include people treated for cancer in the past. Researchers would&#xD;
      like to know if there is a relationship between baseline performance on timed attention and&#xD;
      memory tasks before receiving memory and thinking skills workshop designed to improve&#xD;
      cognition, and performance on such tasks after the workshop.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To objectively assess changes in cognitive performance and quality of life (QOL) pre and&#xD;
      post participation in a cognitive rehabilitation intervention in gynecologic and breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors who have undergone chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure changes in neural function as measured by functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal and corresponding behavioral&#xD;
      responses while performing cognitive tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (Skills workshop): Patients participate in a memory and thinking skills workshop once&#xD;
      weekly for 7 weeks. Patients complete cognitive tests and questionnaires at pre-baseline&#xD;
      (Visit 1), baseline (Visit 2), and 7 weeks (Visit 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (Education workshop): Patients participate in education workshop for 7 weeks 1-hour&#xD;
      duration group focusing on the brain and cognition. Patients complete cognitive tests and&#xD;
      questionnaires at pre-baseline (Visit 1), baseline (Visit 2), and 7 weeks (Visit 3).&#xD;
