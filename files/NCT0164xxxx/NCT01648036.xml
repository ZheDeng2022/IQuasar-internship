  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Life-threatening infections account for 10% of all intensive care unit admissions and&#xD;
      constitute the second more frequent cause of death in the ICU after heart diseases. The most&#xD;
      common cause of death in patients admitted with life-threatening infections is multi-organ&#xD;
      failure that is mediated by severe inflammation. Given the relationship between inflammation&#xD;
      and blood clotting, blood-thinners (also called anticoagulants) have been used to decrease&#xD;
      inflammation and the formation of small clots. Several lines of evidence suggest that&#xD;
      heparin, a proven and inexpensive blood-thinner, may reduce improve survival in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with life-threatening infection. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      demonstrate the feasibility of enrolling patients in a large randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      investigating heparin in patients with severe infections. In this study, patients with&#xD;
      life-threatening infections will have an equal chance of receiving an intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      heparin, or a low dose of a similar drug to prevent of blood clots while patients are&#xD;
      immobile. The primary purpose of the study is to demonstrate that an average of 2 patients&#xD;
      per site, per month, can be enrolled. Other measures of feasibility include the consent rate,&#xD;
      the number of protocol violations that occur during the trial, and the number of dose&#xD;
      reductions needed due to excessive anticoagulation. To study the biologic effects of heparin&#xD;
      in patients with severe infection, specific laboratory markers will be measured and analyzed.&#xD;
      If the feasibility of the trial is confirmed, a large randomized trial designed to tell if&#xD;
      heparin can safely improve survival will be conducted. Given its low cost and availability,&#xD;
      if heparin is shown to improve survival in patients with severe infection, adoption of this&#xD;
      therapy on a global scale is anticipated.&#xD;
