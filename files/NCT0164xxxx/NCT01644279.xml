    <textblock>
      The age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, also termed sarcopenia, is a commonly&#xD;
      recognized consequence of aging and has been associated with frailty, functional loss,&#xD;
      hospitalization, and increased mortality among older people. Sarcopenia and its consequences&#xD;
      have a considerable economic impact, since it has been estimated that the healthcare cost&#xD;
      attributable to sarcopenia in the US in 2000 was $ 18.5 billions. Preclinical animal models&#xD;
      strongly suggest that apoptosis, a programmed cell death, might play a prominent role in the&#xD;
      age-related muscle wasting. In specific aim one, the investigators will assess the extent of&#xD;
      muscle apoptosis in muscle biopsies obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of young&#xD;
      control subjects (ages 20-35) and high-performance and low-performance older subjects (age&#xD;
      range 70-99 years). In specific aim 2, the investigators will investigate the role of Poly&#xD;
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in the induction of&#xD;
      skeletal muscle apoptosis. In specific aim 3, the investigators propose to investigate the&#xD;
      contribution of the muscle energy deficit, due to the age-related mitochondrial dysfunction,&#xD;
      in the development of muscle wasting. Finally, in specific aim 4, the investigators propose&#xD;
      to reassess after four years physical performance, muscle mass and the extent of muscle&#xD;
      apoptosis, in the high-performing participants, in order to correlate eventual decline in&#xD;
      physical function, muscle mass and functional status, with changes in muscle apoptosis and in&#xD;
      biochemical parameters in this very old population. Physical performance will be established&#xD;
      according to the summary performance score obtained in the Short Form Physical Performance&#xD;
      Battery (SPPB). In addition to the SPPB the investigators will also employ hand grip strength&#xD;
      and knee extensor strength tests and the investigators will quantify muscle contractile area&#xD;
      using 3D magnetic resonance imaging. Disability will be assessed using a self-report&#xD;
      questionnaire. These studies will enhance our understanding of the biology and&#xD;
      pathophysiology underlying the geriatric syndrome of sarcopenia and provide significant and&#xD;
      novel insights that will enable us to identify new potential targets for interventions aimed&#xD;
      at preventing and treating sarcopenia and functional impairment in older adults.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. To determine the extent of muscle apoptosis during aging in young healthy&#xD;
      controls and in high-functioning and low-functioning older subjects. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the observed level of muscle cell apoptosis is associated with physical&#xD;
      disability. The investigators will recruit a cohort of ten young control subjects (age&#xD;
      20-35). The investigators will also recruit and stratify a cohort of forty elderly (age 70-99&#xD;
      years) into two distinct categories by set criteria based on their level of physical&#xD;
      performance. Subjects with a summary performance score ≥ 11 at the Short Physical Performance&#xD;
      Battery (SPPB) (66) will be considered high-functioning. Conversely, subjects with a summary&#xD;
      performance score ≤ 7 will be considered low-functioning. In addition to the SPPB, the&#xD;
      investigators will also perform the hand grip strength test and the isokinetic knee extensor&#xD;
      test, and will implement 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to precisely quantify the&#xD;
      quadriceps contractile area. The investigators will obtain a muscle biopsy for each subject&#xD;
      to determine the severity of apoptosis using biochemical and histological analyses (see&#xD;
      Methods). Disability will be assessed using a self-report questionnaire. Hence, the&#xD;
      investigators will determine the extent muscle apoptosis and the investigators will be able&#xD;
      to correlate this to the level of physical disability and muscle mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. To elucidate the role of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and&#xD;
      apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in the induction of apoptosis in human skeletal muscle. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the observed cell loss due to apoptosis is mainly related to a&#xD;
      caspase-independent mechanism. The investigators have recently shown that activation of&#xD;
      mitochondrial caspase-independent pathway of apoptosis may play a more important role than&#xD;
      the caspase-dependent pathway in contributing to nuclear cell death (67). Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the PARP-1/AIF pathway of apoptosis might be involved in the&#xD;
      age-related muscle wasting process. The investigators will quantitatively assess PARP-1 and&#xD;
      AIF and correlate these measures with the extent of muscle apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3. To assess the role of mitochondria dysfunction and energy failure in muscle&#xD;
      apoptosis, sarcopenia, and disability. The investigators hypothesize that mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction and the resulting reduced production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is causally&#xD;
      related to sarcopenia, possibly by triggering the apoptosis program. It has been estimated&#xD;
      that the mean ATP production in the quadriceps muscle of old human subjects is approximately&#xD;
      50% of that of younger subjects (68), and it has been postulated that energy failure might&#xD;
      trigger apoptosis (58). Consistently with these findings, the investigators have recently&#xD;
      found that in rats' gastrocnemius muscle, ATP content and the rate of ATP production declined&#xD;
      by ~50% with age (59). The investigators will quantitatively assess myocytes' ATP content&#xD;
      along with key mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, namely citrate synthase, cytochrome-c-oxidase&#xD;
      (COX), ATPase, and aconitase. The investigators will correlate these parameters with the&#xD;
      level of apoptosis and with measures of physical performance, disability, and muscle mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4. To correlate changes in physical function and muscle mass with muscle&#xD;
      apoptosis and biochemical parameters at follow-up (longitudinal study). After 4 years&#xD;
      subjects in the high-performance group will be reevaluated for muscle apoptosis rate, PARP-1&#xD;
      and AIF activity, and energy production. The investigators will correlate these parameters&#xD;
      with measures of physical performance and muscle mass assessed by MRI, as well as with&#xD;
      self-reported disability. Hence, the investigators will be able to directly correlate an&#xD;
      eventual decline in physical performance, muscle mass and functional status at this very old&#xD;
      age with changes in muscle apoptosis and in biochemical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a cross-sectional design (age 20-35 and 70-99 years) the investigators will quantify&#xD;
      the level of apoptosis in the vastus lateralis muscle in a healthy (see inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria) population. Apoptosis of irreplaceable post-mitotic cells may be important&#xD;
      mechanism in the development of sarcopenia and has not been investigated in healthy humans&#xD;
      with age. A variety of chronic diseases have documented cases of apoptosis in human skeletal&#xD;
      muscle; i.e., chronic pulmonary diseases (69,70) and patients with heart failure (69,71,72).&#xD;
      However, it is essential to establish baseline levels of apoptosis in relatively healthy&#xD;
      humans before proceeding to more complex conditions, such as disease conditions and frailty.&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will determine knee extensors strength, the myocyte volume,&#xD;
      extra cellular space and the myonuclear domain (cross-sectional muscle area/nucleus) by&#xD;
      quantifying the number of nuclei within a cross-sectional area of muscle. This specific aim&#xD;
      will establish baseline levels of apoptosis and assess standard measures to assess&#xD;
      sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. To accomplish our aims, the investigators propose two separates, yet&#xD;
      complementary studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In order to gain insights into changes of the apoptosis potential with age and its&#xD;
           contribution to muscle mass and strength loss, the investigators will quantify the level&#xD;
           of apoptosis in the vastus lateralis muscle in young (age 20-35 years; N =20), old&#xD;
           high-functioning, (age 70-99 years; N = 25), and old low-functioning (age 70-99 years; N&#xD;
           = 20) subjects. Muscle biopsy and MRI scan to quantify quadriceps contractile area will&#xD;
           be performed in the study participants. Muscle strength will be assessed by hand grip&#xD;
           strength test and the isokinetic knee extensor test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preliminary data on the contribution of skeletal muscle apoptosis to sarcopenia,&#xD;
           physical function loss in advanced age will be gathered by quantifying the extent of&#xD;
           muscle apoptosis in the vastus lateralis muscle of old (age 70-99 years),&#xD;
           high-functioning (N = 25) and low-functioning (N = 20) subjects, along with measures of&#xD;
           muscle mass (MRI), muscle strength (hand grip and knee extension test), and overall&#xD;
           physical performance (Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB (67)). In addition, the&#xD;
           investigators will collect preliminary data regarding the role mitochondrial-driven&#xD;
           apoptosis in muscle wasting and functional loss at old age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brief physical exam will be administered to all study participants, and major biological&#xD;
      signs (body weight, standing height, body temperature, blood pressure, and pulse) will be&#xD;
      recorded. A basic questionnaire regarding participants' health history will also be&#xD;
      administered&#xD;
&#xD;
      After four years the old participants will be reevaluated for physical performance,&#xD;
      functional status muscle mass (MRI), muscle apoptosis, and biochemical parameters Disability&#xD;
      will also be assessed using a self-report disability questionnaire. In order to gain&#xD;
      information regarding changes in physical performance and functional status with time and to&#xD;
      maximize retention, an annual visit employing SPPB, hand grip and knee extensor testing, will&#xD;
      be scheduled for the old participants.&#xD;

        questionnaire is not specific to a certain disease and asks about perceived difficulties in&#xD;
        general activities of daily living during the last month. Respondents answer for each of&#xD;
        the items whether they experience 1) no difficulty, 2) a little difficulty, 3) some&#xD;
        difficulty, 4) a lot of difficulty, 5) unable to do or, 6) did not do for other reasons.&#xD;
        Answers can be averaged across the items in order to receive an indication of the overall&#xD;
        perceived disability burden by a person.&#xD;
