  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of long-term cancer survivors is growing. As a result, treatment-related morbidity&#xD;
      - such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, functional decline and fatigue - is&#xD;
      impacting quality of life and impairing survival. Metabolic syndrome in the general&#xD;
      population is currently treated with lifestyle advice to increase physical activity (PA) and&#xD;
      reduce caloric intake. This approach is still underused as standard care for cancer&#xD;
      survivors. The aim of this study is investigate whether a tailored PA program that starts&#xD;
      early (during curative chemotherapy with cardiovascular toxic potential) is superior in terms&#xD;
      of reducing long-term cancer-treatment-related metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity to a program that starts late (after completion of chemotherapy).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Improved treatment is partly responsible for the increased survival and life expectancy in&#xD;
      cancer patients. However, such treatment can be harmful as well, and cancer survivors&#xD;
      therefore, face an increased risk of second malignancies and other chronic diseases, e.g.&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the growing number of cancer patients and survivors, attention for rehabilitation,&#xD;
      especially physical training, is growing. Several meta-analyses show the beneficial effects&#xD;
      of physical training on several outcomes such as physical fitness, muscle strength, fatigue&#xD;
      and quality of life, and a few studies showed the effect of exercise on physical active&#xD;
      behaviour. However, studies on the effect of timing of exercise are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to insert a tailored physical activity program early versus late in&#xD;
      the chemotherapy based cancer treatment and will yield data about its safety and efficacy. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that a tailored physical activity program during early cancer treatment may more&#xD;
      be effective to reduce long-term cancer treatment toxicities and morbidity in cancer&#xD;
      survivors compared to a program after cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To investigate whether a tailored physical activity program that starts&#xD;
      during chemotherapy (early) is superior in terms of physical fitness, as determined by VO2&#xD;
      peak at one year, to a program that starts after completion of chemotherapy (late).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To examine the effect of the physical activity program on muscle&#xD;
      strength and activity level, change in metabolic and cardiovascular damage parameters,&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors and quality of life including self-efficacy, motivation for&#xD;
      exercise, and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This protocol describes a multicenter, randomized study with 2 arms. Patients who&#xD;
      will be treated with curative systemic chemotherapeutic treatment for testicular cancer,&#xD;
      early colon cancer, early breast cancer or B-NHL will be randomized into an early or late PA&#xD;
      program group. The early group will start the PA program during chemotherapy (for 12 weeks)&#xD;
      until 12 weeks after completion of chemotherapy (total 24 weeks of training). The late group&#xD;
      will start the same program (total of 12 weeks) after completion of chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      longitudinal effects of the physical activity (PA) program for all participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated at different time points in the UMCG: before start of chemotherapeutic treatment;&#xD;
      at the start of the PA program and at 3, 6, 18 months after starting the PA program and 18&#xD;
      months after the last chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>The aim of this study is investigate whether a tailored PA program that starts early (during curative chemotherapy with cardiovascular toxic potential) is superior in terms of reducing long-term cancer-treatment-related metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular morbidity to a program that starts late (after completion of chemotherapy).&#xD;
The VO2 at the peak of the exercise will be defined as peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak), measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) on a stationary bicycle ergometer. The CPET is considered to be the most precise measure of cardio-respiratory fitness and is recommended for use in order to determine a patient's objective or subjective difference in exercise capacity</description>

    <description>Maximal voluntary isometric muscle force of the right and left extremity of extension of the knee, flexion of the knee, flexion of the elbow and extension of the elbow will be measured using a hand-held dynamometer. The &quot;break method&quot; will be used for all measurements. To employ this technique, the examiner gradually overcomes the force exerted by the patient until the extremity gives way. All measurements will be performed at least three times, with recovery intervals of at least 10 seconds. The peak forces (in Newtons) will be recorded and mean values of three technically correct measurements will be taken for analysis.</description>
