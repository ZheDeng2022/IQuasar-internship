      A promising strategy to reduce CVD is to directly target inflammation at the level of the&#xD;
      vessel wall. A potential drawback of anti-inflammatory strategies pertains to the thin line&#xD;
      between inhibiting 'inappropriate' inflammation versus inducing immuno-suppression. One of&#xD;
      the strategies to limit systemic immunosuppression is to strive for local delivery and&#xD;
      prolonged efficacy and low systemic burden of the drug by encapsulating the compound in&#xD;
      liposomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposome-encapsulated drugs efficiently target lesions and accumulate at a much higher extent&#xD;
      at desired areas of interest. Thus, local delivery and prolonged efficacy can be very&#xD;
      important tools to overcome the potential drawback anti-inflammatory drugs; namely an&#xD;
      inappropriate immune suppression. In the present project, the investigators therefore aim to&#xD;
      evaluate the delivery and superior efficacy of Nanocort above Prednison or placebo in&#xD;
      patients with peripheral artery disease due to atherosclerosis. Because these patients will&#xD;
      undergo an endarteriectomy the investigators will be able to collect atherosclerotic material&#xD;
      after drug administration and thus evaluate the local delivery and compare the effects of&#xD;
      Nanocort to Prednison or Placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed&#xD;
      nations. CVD is primarily caused by atherosclerosis, a systemic disease characterized by&#xD;
      lipid deposition in the subendothelial space with a concomitant, low-grade inflammatory&#xD;
      reaction. Nowadays, most therapeutic interventions aimed at lowering CVD have thus far&#xD;
      focused on modulating lipid levels, either lowering LDLc or increasing HDLc levels. Yet,&#xD;
      since the introduction of statins 20 years ago, there have been few breakthroughs in the&#xD;
      treatment of this disease. In fact, the recent failure of a potent HDL-increasing drug, i.e.&#xD;
      torcetrapib, has emphasized the need to also consider non-lipid modulating targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising strategy to reduce CVD is to directly target inflammation at the level of the&#xD;
      vessel wall. A potential drawback of anti-inflammatory strategies pertains to the thin line&#xD;
      between inhibiting 'inappropriate' inflammation versus inducing immuno-suppression. One of&#xD;
      the strategies to limit systemic immunosuppression is to strive for local delivery and&#xD;
      prolonged efficacy and low systemic burden of the drug by encapsulating the compound in&#xD;
      liposomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposome-encapsulated drugs efficiently target lesions and accumulate at a much higher extent&#xD;
      at desired areas of interest. This approach is currently used for the clinical treatment of&#xD;
      different types of cancer(liposomal doxorubicin) and fungal infections (liposomal&#xD;
      amphotericine-B). Liposomes for other applications (rheumatoid arthritis, cystic fibrosis,&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis and atherosclerosis) are being pre-clinically developed or investigated in&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent pre-clinical studies in animal models corroborate that liposomal glucocorticoids&#xD;
      effectively attenuate atherosclerotic plaque inflammation and exhibit improved&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Also, local delivery through localization of liposomes&#xD;
      at inflammatory sites and in local macrophages was demonstrated in animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, the potential of PEG-liposomes to target inflammatory sites has been showed by&#xD;
      imaging of radioactive liposomes. However, the concept of local delivery and (prolonged)&#xD;
      efficacy of liposomal corticosteroids at the inflammatory sites, such as atherosclerosis, and&#xD;
      at local macrophages remains to be determined in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, local delivery and prolonged efficacy can be very important tools to overcome the&#xD;
      potential drawback anti-inflammatory drugs; namely an inappropriate immune suppression. To&#xD;
      proof this concept, the investigators need to evaluate the local delivery and efficacy at the&#xD;
      site of inflammation (atherosclerosis) of intravenously administered liposomal&#xD;
      glucocorticoids (Nanocort) compared to free glucocorticoids (Prednison). Only by comparing&#xD;
      these two drugs, the investigators can prove the potential benefits of nanomedicine as a&#xD;
      vehicle for local drug delivery. This can have major implications in future drug strategies&#xD;
      for cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present project, the investigators therefore aim to evaluate the delivery and superior&#xD;
      efficacy of Nanocort above Prednison or placebo in patients with peripheral artery disease&#xD;
      due to atherosclerosis. Because these patients will undergo an endarteriectomy the&#xD;
      investigators will be able to collect atherosclerotic material after drug administration and&#xD;
      thus evaluate the local delivery and compare the effects of Nanocort to Prednison or Placebo.&#xD;
