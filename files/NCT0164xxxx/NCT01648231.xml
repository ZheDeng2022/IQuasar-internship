    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the comparative bioavailability of two fixed dose&#xD;
      combination tablet formulations of amlodipine and losartan in healthy volunteers. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive each of the following three treatments administered in a randomized three-way&#xD;
      crossover design: a reference treatment consisting of a 5mg amlodipine tablet and 100mg&#xD;
      losartan tablet; a fixed dose combination tablet consisting of 5mg amlodipine and 100mg&#xD;
      losartan; and another fixed dose combination tablet consisting of 5mg amlodipine and 100mg&#xD;
      losartan; all three treatments will be administered once orally and in a fasted state. Serial&#xD;
      blood samples will be obtained at pre-defined timepoints for pharmacokinetic analysis of&#xD;
      amlodipine, losartan and carboxylic acid (this is the primary active losartan metabolite).&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include measurements of orthostatic vital signs, electrocardiograms&#xD;
      (ECG), collection of adverse events (AE) and clinical laboratory tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amlodipine and losartan are calcium channel and angiotensin II receptor type-1 blockers,&#xD;
      respectively, and are established treatments to manage blood pressure (BP) levels for&#xD;
      patients with hypertension; both medications are currently marketed in the United States and&#xD;
      Europe as anti-hypertensive agents. This is a an open-label, randomized, single dose,&#xD;
      three-way crossover study enrolling 24 healthy adult male and female subjects under fasting&#xD;
      conditions. Each subject will participate in three treatment periods. The study consists of a&#xD;
      screening phase, three treatment periods and a follow-up visit. Subjects will receive each of&#xD;
      the following three treatments administered in a randomized three-way crossover design: a&#xD;
      reference treatment consisting of a single 5mg amlodipine tablet and a single 100mg losartan&#xD;
      tablet; a single fixed dose combination tablet consisting of 5mg amlodipine and 100mg&#xD;
      losartan; and another single fixed dose combination tablet consisting of 5mg amlodipine and&#xD;
      100mg losartan; all three treatments will be administered once orally and in a fasted state.&#xD;
      Serial blood samples will be obtained at pre-defined timepoints for pharmacokinetic analysis&#xD;
      of amlodipine, losartan and carboxylic acid (this is the primary active losartan metabolite).&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include measurements of orthostatic vital signs, electrocardiograms&#xD;
      (ECG), collection of adverse events (AE) and clinical laboratory tests.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of&#xD;
             normal (ULN; isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated&#xD;
             and direct bilirubin &lt;35%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal electrocardiogram (ECG) morphology and measurements. In particular QTc &lt;450&#xD;
             msec or QT &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block based on an average from&#xD;
             three ECGs obtained over a brief recording period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if&#xD;
             the Investigator feels that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk&#xD;
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal&#xD;
        ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea&#xD;
        (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
        &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;147 pmol/L) is confirmatory. Females on hormone&#xD;
        replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use a&#xD;
        protocol approved contraception method if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.&#xD;
        Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior&#xD;
        to study enrollment. For mostforms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the&#xD;
        cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of&#xD;
        HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT&#xD;
        during the study without use of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the protocol approved contraception&#xD;
        methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or&#xD;
        investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy&#xD;
        at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 14 days post-last dose&#xD;
        of amlodipine/losartan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg and a body mass index (BMI) within the range 19 - 32 kg/m2&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             result within 3 months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any subject with a systolic blood pressure (BP) &lt;95mmHg or with a recent history of&#xD;
             postural symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities&#xD;
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).&#xD;

&#xD;
        An average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is&#xD;
        equivalent to 8 g of alcohol: a half-pint (~240 ml) of beer, 1 glass (100 ml) of wine or 1&#xD;
        (25 ml) measure of spirits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;

             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study&#xD;
             procedures or compromise subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.&#xD;
