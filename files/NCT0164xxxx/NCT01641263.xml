      The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of a behavioral intervention,&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy for sleep quality (CBT-SQ) to reduce sleep complaints,&#xD;
      depression recurrence, and cellular and genomic markers of inflammation in older adults with&#xD;
      sleep complaints who have a prior history of depression. The investigators aim to: 1)&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of CBT-SQ vs. Sleep Seminar (SS) on objective (actigraphy) and&#xD;
      subjective (sleep diary; questionnaire) measures of sleep symptoms over a two-year follow-up;&#xD;
      2) determine the effects of CBT-SQ vs. SS on recurrence of depressive symptoms and depression&#xD;
      episode(s) over a two-year follow-up. The investigators will also secondarily examine the&#xD;
      effects of CBT-SQ vs. SS on cellular and genomic markers of inflammation over a two-year&#xD;
      follow-up, and explore whether markers of inflammation and cytokine genes can explain&#xD;
      variability in the risk of depression recurrence in those older adults receiving CBT-SQ vs.&#xD;
      SS. The present study is highly significant by being the first study, to the investigators&#xD;
      knowledge, to focus on the prevention of depression in community dwelling older adults who&#xD;
      have a history of depression, and by targeting sleep disturbance, a modifiable risk factor to&#xD;
      prevent depression recurrence.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression, one of the most common diseases in older adults, carries significant risk for&#xD;
      morbidity, and mortality. However, many older adults with depression are not identified and&#xD;
      even when identified, they face protracted courses of treatment, with over 60% of elderly&#xD;
      patients failing to achieve symptomatic remission. Given the burgeoning population of older&#xD;
      adults, as well as the enormous burden of depression, efforts to maximize depression&#xD;
      prevention are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advances in understanding the behavioral pathways that contribute to depression,&#xD;
      there has been little attention aimed at targeting behavioral risk factors such as sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, even though such strategies have the potential to optimize efficiency (i.e.,&#xD;
      decrease number needed to treat (NNT) among vulnerable older adults with a history of&#xD;
      depression. In this study, we hypothesize that recognition and treatment of sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, a modifiable behavioral risk factor, will prevent depression incidence in older&#xD;
      adults. Whereas sleep disturbance in depressed patients often lingers and its persistence can&#xD;
      represent a residual phase of a major mood disorder, emergence of disturbed sleep in&#xD;
      non-depressed older adults serves as an independent risk factor depression that occurs later&#xD;
      in life. In a 2-year prospective cohort study of community-dwelling older adults aged 60&#xD;
      years or older (N=351), we have found that sleep disturbance is prospectively associated with&#xD;
      depression incidence independent of other current depressive symptoms, as well as&#xD;
      antidepressant and hypnotic medication use, and medical status. To evaluate sleep disturbance&#xD;
      at the community level, sleep disturbance was defined by a self-report measure (i.e. scores &gt;&#xD;
      5 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which highly correlates with insomnia&#xD;
      diagnosis. We have found similar prospective results between reported sleep disturbance and&#xD;
      depression in adults (N=1716).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing evidence also implicates inflammation as a biological mechanism that contributes&#xD;
      to depression, and we further hypothesize that increases in inflammation are associated with&#xD;
      the link between sleep disturbance and depression incidence. Whereas multiple other factors&#xD;
      including but not limited to, psychosocial stress, medical illness, obesity, sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle, social isolation, low socio-economic status, female sex, and smoking can drive&#xD;
      inflammation and are associated with depression, our preliminary data have found that sleep&#xD;
      disturbance induces activation of inflammatory signaling,and additional naturalistic and&#xD;
      epidemiologic preliminary findings show that sleep disturbance is associated with increases&#xD;
      in markers of inflammation especially among those with a history of depression. In turn, we&#xD;
      and others have found that inflammation prospectively predicts depression recurrence in&#xD;
      community dwelling adults who have a history of depression (N=1716)16 Although there is also&#xD;
      evidence that this association can be reciprocal,33 our experimental preliminary data show&#xD;
      that inflammatory activation induces depressed mood. In contrast, cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)) reduces cellular markers of inflammation in older adults who&#xD;
      show a remission of clinical sleep complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The over-arching objectives of this study are to evaluate the ability of CBT-I vs. an active&#xD;
      comparator control, Sleep Education Therapy (SET) to reduce sleep complaints, depression&#xD;
      incidence, and cellular and genomic markers of inflammation in older adults with&#xD;
      self-reported sleep disturbance with follow-up up to three years.&#xD;
