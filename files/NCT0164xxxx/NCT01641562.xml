      Breast cancer represents the most frequent form of neoplasia in women worldwide, being&#xD;
      responsible of 1.6% of annual deaths. Therefore, it is a major public health issue and&#xD;
      research in this field should be a priority. Taxanes, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, are&#xD;
      extremely powerful antineoplastic drugs, which alone or in association to anthracyclines,&#xD;
      increase survival and lower the recurrence rate of cancer, but their use is limited by&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity can appear early or late after therapy, and may vary from&#xD;
      subclinical myocardial dysfunction to irreversible heart failure. Currently, cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction induced by taxanes is diagnosed through classical echocardiographic parameters.&#xD;
      However, these cannot detect subtle, early changes of cardiac structure and function.&#xD;
      Consequently, description of new parameters, which could detect cardiac dysfunction in an&#xD;
      early stage, becomes essential for detecting the group of patients at risk for irreversible&#xD;
      heart failure. The objectives of the investigators project, in patients with breast cancer&#xD;
      treated with taxanes, are to investigate their mechanisms which lead to cardiac dysfunction,&#xD;
      to describe new parameters for the early diagnosis of cardiotoxicity, and to define&#xD;
      predictive models for cardiotoxicity. Meanwhile, project will publish the results in&#xD;
      prestigious journals, leading to an increase of the visibility of Romanian research&#xD;
      internationally.&#xD;

      Scientific context and motivation. Breast cancer represents the most frequent form of&#xD;
      neoplasia in women worldwide, comprising 16% off all neoplasias. A report of the World Health&#xD;
      Organization showed that 1 from 6 cancers is determined by breast cancer and this form of&#xD;
      neoplasm causes around 550,000 deaths/year, respective 1.6% of all annual deaths in the&#xD;
      world. The incidence of breast cancer is increasing, over 1.1 million of women being newly&#xD;
      diagnosed with cancer every year. Although considered a pathology specific to developed&#xD;
      countries, recently it was established that developing countries, such as Romania, include&#xD;
      over 69% of all breast cancers. Therefore, breast cancer is currently a major public health&#xD;
      and economical issue and research on new therapies, as well as monitoring their safety use,&#xD;
      should be a priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies showed that, due to new chemotherapy, breast cancer can be considered a curable&#xD;
      disease. And indeed, use of a multidisciplinary approach - surgery, radiotherapy,&#xD;
      chemotherapy - has conducted to a significant reduction in the mortality. As a consequence of&#xD;
      increased life expectancy, it becomes essential that specific oncologic therapies should be&#xD;
      safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taxanes, inhibitors of cellular mitosis (paclitaxel and docetaxel), relatively new drugs, are&#xD;
      extremely potent and widely used in different therapeutic regimes. Their single use or the&#xD;
      association with classical chemotherapy, have been proved to increase significantly rate of&#xD;
      cure in breast cancer, as well as to reduce recurrences. However, the applicability of these&#xD;
      drugs on medium or long term is limited by the risk of cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiotoxicity is one of the most important adverse reactions of taxanes, leading to an&#xD;
      important increase of morbidity and mortality. Cardiotoxicity can appear early or late in the&#xD;
      course of the disease, and may vary from subclinical myocardial dysfunction to irreversible&#xD;
      heart failure or even death. Recent research has showed that cardiac dysfunction induced by&#xD;
      taxanes may increase exponentially with the cumulative dose used; meanwhile, it may be&#xD;
      augmented by other associated cytotoxic drugs. Data on the susceptibility of patients to&#xD;
      develop cardiotoxicity are scarce. Some studies suggest that patients without known&#xD;
      cardiovascular history may develop symptomatic heart failure in direct connection to the&#xD;
      cumulative dose received, affirmation which has led to the use of reduced doses of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and, therefore, to a reduction in their efficiency. But also under these&#xD;
      circumstances, there is a risk of cardiotoxicity induced by taxanes therapy, risk which&#xD;
      cannot be foreseen by the cumulative dose. Moreover, the cardiac alteration is very&#xD;
      frequently subclinical and it can appear early (during therapy), late (during the first year&#xD;
      after therapy) or very late (more than one year after finishing therapy). Consequently, early&#xD;
      diagnosis of subclinical cardiac dysfunction in patients with breast cancer treated with&#xD;
      taxanes, as well as the establishment of prediction models for irreversible heart failure is&#xD;
      essential in the management of such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, recommendations of diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction induced by taxanes are to use&#xD;
      functional and structural parameters of conventional echocardiography, such as left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular shortening fraction (LVSF), as well as&#xD;
      diameters and volumes of the heart chambers. However, sometime, these conventional&#xD;
      measurements allow only the late diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction, which might be already&#xD;
      irreversible. Therefore, description of new and simple parameters, able to diagnose more&#xD;
      subtle, subclinical changes of cardiac function becomes mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been showed that myocardial velocities, cardiac deformation, parameters of&#xD;
      ventricular torsion, and parameters of intra- and inter- ventricular dyssynchrony are&#xD;
      affected before reduction of LVEF and LVSF. Therefore, these parameters might be useful in&#xD;
      the early diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction induced by taxanes, and in establishing prediction&#xD;
      of cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, recently, early diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction is also based on increase of the&#xD;
      biomarkers. Some of them, such as such as brain natriuretic peptides, troponins, markers of&#xD;
      cardiac fibrosis and inflammation, might be more important during the subclinical cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction induced by chemotherapy, hypothesis that will be also verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, it was suggested that therapy with taxanes might increase the oxidative stress,&#xD;
      causing endothelial dysfunction with increased arterial stiffness. This might be a mechanisms&#xD;
      by which taxanes promotes cardiac dysfunction, through alteration of ventriculo-arterial&#xD;
      coupling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, early detection of cardiovascular dysfunction and establish of predictive&#xD;
      models for cardiotoxicity represent a priority in the management of breast cancer. This can&#xD;
      be done by using new ultrasound technique, assessing subclinical myocardial disease and&#xD;
      ventriculo-arterial coupling, and new laboratory methods, assessing different biomarkers and&#xD;
      the oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The main objective of our project is to describe new parameters for the early&#xD;
      diagnosis of cardiovascular dysfunction patients with early breast cancer, treated with&#xD;
      taxanes, and to define predictive models for cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Taxanes (alone or in combination with anthracycline) increase oxidative stress, with&#xD;
           excessive production of free oxygen radicals, and activation of neurohormonal mediators&#xD;
           of inflammation and fibrosis. Decrease of antioxidant capacity, genetically determined,&#xD;
           might be an additional mechanism is some patients. Therefore, we will test the&#xD;
           hypothesis that imbalance between oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity is one of&#xD;
           the main mechanism of cardiotoxicity induced by taxanes in patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Oxidative stress determines endothelial dysfunction with arterial remodeling and&#xD;
           increased arterial stiffness. We will test the hypothesis that impaired&#xD;
           endothelial-arterial-ventricular coupling might play an important role in the&#xD;
           cardiotoxicity induced by chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subclinical cardiac dysfunction can be diagnosed by looking to new parameters of&#xD;
           myocardial deformation and torsion, and their timing into the cardiac cycle. We assume&#xD;
           that these parameters are first affected, before conventional echo parameters, during&#xD;
           cardiotoxicity induced by chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, objectives of our study, in patients with early breast cancer, without&#xD;
      cardiovascular symptoms, treated with taxanes (alone or in combination with anthracycline),&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess imbalance between oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in order to&#xD;
           describe new potential mechanisms of cardiotoxicity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test implication of some genetic disorders in predicting cardiotoxicity, mainly&#xD;
           through decrease of antioxidant capacity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess endothelial-arterial-ventricular coupling as a possible determinant of&#xD;
           cardiotoxicity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of new echo parameters, as well as new biomarkers,&#xD;
           for the early diagnosis of cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To establish a standard evaluation protocol, by using these parameters and their&#xD;
           predictive value, in order to identify patients at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By achieving these objectives of our research, derived objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To promote original research in a new and important interdisciplinary field&#xD;
           (cardiotoxicity induced by chemotherapy);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To increase international visibility of Romanian research by publishing the results;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To increase the research capacity of our unit, also by attracting new researchers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To further develop an interdisciplinary research center, attached to our new oncology&#xD;
           unit; to participate to international muticentric studies/networks in the&#xD;
           cardio-oncology field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and approach. Study population. Study will include 60 patients with early breast&#xD;
      cancer, scheduled to receive taxanes, in monotherapy (30 patients) or associated to&#xD;
      anthracyclines (30 patients), with doses according to the stage of the disease. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria are: (1) Age over 18 years; (2) Informed consent signed; (3) Patients with early&#xD;
      breast cancer, scheduled to receive chemotherapy; (4) LVEF &gt; 50% and LVSF &gt; 20%. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are: (1) Any history of cardiovascular disease and/or active cardiovascular&#xD;
      treatment; (2) Diabetes mellitus; (3) Mediastinal irradiation. The protocol will be sent for&#xD;
      approval to the Local Ethic Committee. All patients referred to the oncology department with&#xD;
      the diagnosis of breast cancer, and scheduled to receive chemotherapy, will be screened.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated 24 hours before initiation of treatment, and within 24 hours from&#xD;
      the end of the cycle of chemotherapy. Long-term follow-up will be performed at 1 and 2 years&#xD;
      after the end of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. All patients will be assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General characteristics: age, sex, height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, family&#xD;
           history, risk factors, clinical stage of breast cancer, date of surgical intervention&#xD;
           (if applicable), date of initiation of chemotherapy, details of the scheme of&#xD;
           chemotherapy, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Electrocardiogram (12 leads) and routine blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Biomarkers: brain natriuretic peptides, troponin T, markers of myocardial fibrosis (β&#xD;
           cross laps and procollagen type-1 amino terminal), and markers of inflammation (PCR-hs,&#xD;
           IL1, IL6, IL 10, TNFalpha).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Markers of the oxidative stress: concentration of carbonyl in plasmatic proteins, and&#xD;
           the antioxidant capacity of plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Genetic tests of susceptibility to cardiotoxicity: genomic DNA extraction kit/DNA&#xD;
           quantification tests/PCR tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Echocardiography: detailed echo examination (VIVID 7 GE echo machine, with dedicated&#xD;
           software ECHOPAC BT09) will be performed, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Conventional echocardiography will measure/calculate:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Structural parameters: thickness of the cardiac walls; diameters and volumes&#xD;
                     of the cardiac cavities, aorta, and pulmonary artery; left ventricular mass;&#xD;
                     relative wall thickness; wall stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Functional parameters of systolic and diastolic function: ejection fraction,&#xD;
                     shortening fraction, stroke volume, cardiac output, cardiac index, tricuspid&#xD;
                     and mitral annular excursions; and, respectively, parameters derived from the&#xD;
                     transmitral flow, pulmonary veins flow, velocity of propagation of the mitral&#xD;
                     flow into the LV.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Q analysis by tissue velocity imaging: measurements of systolic and diastolic&#xD;
                myocardial velocities, and of the isovolumic accelerations, at the level of&#xD;
                multiple left and right ventricular myocardial segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Speckle tracking imaging, which is a new non-invasive method for the assessment of&#xD;
                cardiac global and regional function; it uses myocardial speckles that represent&#xD;
                tissue markers that can be tracked frame by frame throughout the cardiac cycles.&#xD;
                Motion is analyzed by integrating frame by frame changes. This new method offers an&#xD;
                alternative to techniques such as color-coded tissue velocity imaging for&#xD;
                myocardial deformation (measured as strain and strain rate) in radial,&#xD;
                longitudinal, and circumferential directions, in order to assess left and right&#xD;
                ventricular, systolic and diastolic function, left ventricular torsion, and left&#xD;
                and right atrial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Advanced Q-Scan imaging, which is a new and innovative dedicated parametric&#xD;
                imaging, supported by the 4D probe, for quantitative display of regional wall&#xD;
                deformation. It consists of tissue synchronization, a real time parametric imaging&#xD;
                technique for displaying mechanical synchronicity, and strain and strain rate&#xD;
                imaging, showing myocardial deformation and the rate of deformation in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. 3D echocardiography allows precise evaluation of the cardiac chamber anatomy and&#xD;
                function. 4D analysis enables post-processing of multi-plane imaging datasets,&#xD;
                allows multi-dimensional imaging acquired in parasternal bi-plane and apical&#xD;
                tri-plane views, and supports 2D, color, as well as, tissue Doppler modes&#xD;
                (including tissue synchronization imaging). All data can be stored in raw data&#xD;
                DICOM format and can be recalled for post-processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Measurement of endothelial function, parameters of arterial remodeling, and arterial&#xD;
           stiffness at the level of the common carotid artery (vascular remodeling and arterial&#xD;
           stiffness indices), and at the level of the brachial artery (endothelial function).&#xD;
           Assessment will be done using an ALOKA α10 ultrasound machine, using a high resolution&#xD;
           probe of 7,5-10 MHz, equipped with an &quot;echo-tracking&quot; system. Meanwhile, a dedicated new&#xD;
           software available on the machine (wave intensity analysis) will be used to assess&#xD;
           ventriculo-arterial coupling. Another system (Complior) will be used in order to measure&#xD;
           the pulse wave velocity between 2 arterial sites (carotid-femoral and carotido-radial),&#xD;
           as another measure of arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team who will participate in the project has an important experience in the&#xD;
      field of cardiology and use of the new ultrasound techniques, as well as in the field of&#xD;
      oncology, especially breast cancer, with many publications, national and international&#xD;
      communications/ lectures on these topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Working Plan is well adapted for achieving the goals of this project, and human and&#xD;
      material resources are appropriate to achieve all the objectives of the projects, taking into&#xD;
      account the existing and newly acquired resources and infrastructure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact, relevance, applications. The relevance for the field. Because breast cancer is the&#xD;
      most frequent neoplasia in women worldwide, including Romania, and the most feared adverse&#xD;
      effect of chemotherapy is cardiac dysfunction, which leads to a significant increase in&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality, and economical costs, we believe that the identification in early&#xD;
      stages of cardiac dysfunction is a health problem of major interest and should represent a&#xD;
      priority of the cardiology and oncology research. Using new imagistic and laboratory&#xD;
      parameters might allow their integration into predictive scores, essential to identify&#xD;
      patients at risk and to optimize treatment strategies in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated impact and applications of the project. This project could contribute to the&#xD;
      elucidation of mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction induced by taxanes (alone or in combination&#xD;
      with anthracyclines). Moreover, it might be able to introduce into clinical practice new&#xD;
      diagnostic and predictive methods for patients at risk for developing cardiac dysfunction,&#xD;
      consequently leading to an optimization of chemotherapy. Therefore, the results of the&#xD;
      project could be applicative also from social and economic purposes, taking into account the&#xD;
      disabilities and costs of heart failure that could occur after chemotherapy. Our proposal&#xD;
      fits into the strategic objectives of our National System of Exploratory Research Projects,&#xD;
      initiated by CNCSIS. It will create knowledge in the medical field and generate important&#xD;
      scientific results, nationally and internationally competitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the project might be able to generate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Publication of results in prestigious, ISI indexed journals, contributing to the rise of&#xD;
           the visibility of Romanian research at international level;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase of the research capacity of our unit, also by attracting new researchers, which&#xD;
           will have the chance to complete their training in an adequate scientific environment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A national interdisciplinary (cardiology and oncology) network dedicated to the early&#xD;
           diagnostic and prediction of cardiotoxicity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The premises of interdisciplinary, national and international collaboration, with other&#xD;
           centers with common interest, collaboration which could be the background of new&#xD;
           research projects.&#xD;
