      This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer will receive investigational study drug MEK162&#xD;
      and paclitaxel. Patients will receive increasing doses of study drug in combination with&#xD;
      paclitaxel in order to achieve the highest dose of study drug possible that will not cause&#xD;
      unacceptable side effects. Patients will be followed to see what side effects the combination&#xD;
      causes and what effectiveness the combination has, if any, in treating the cancer.&#xD;
      Approximately 36 patients from the US will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary&#xD;
             peritoneal cancer (measurable or evaluable, nonmeasurable disease) that is&#xD;
             platinum-resistant or refractory. In the judgment of the Investigator, a patient who&#xD;
             is platinum-sensitive but would not benefit from further platinum treatment is also&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have had ≥ 1 prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen containing&#xD;
             carboplatin, cisplatin or another organoplatinum compound for management of primary&#xD;
             disease. This initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal (IP) therapy,&#xD;
             consolidation, non-cytotoxic agents or extended therapy administered after surgical or&#xD;
             non-surgical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Available archival tumor sample (excisional or core biopsy) that can be acquired and&#xD;
             provide consent to biomarker testing of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional criteria exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or concurrent evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or current risk factors&#xD;
             for RVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with a MEK inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to taxanes or drug formulations containing Cremophor®.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of acute coronary syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metastases that are not stable, require steroids,&#xD;
             are potentially life-threatening or that have required radiation within 28 days prior&#xD;
             to first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies with less than a 5-year disease-free&#xD;
             interval at the time of enrollment; patients with adequately resected basal or&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or ductal&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ may enroll irrespective of the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known positive serology for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis&#xD;
             C, and/or active hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with ritonavir at the time of first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with continuous or intermittent small molecular therapeutics, biologic&#xD;
             therapy or hormonal therapy within 28 days prior to first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with a cyclical chemotherapy within a period of time that is less than the&#xD;
             cycle length used for that treatment prior to first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any other investigational agents within a period of time that is less&#xD;
             than the cycle length used for the treatment or within 28 days (whichever is shorter)&#xD;
             prior to first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with prior radiotherapy within 21 days prior to first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment; however, if the radiation portal covered ≤ 10% of the bone marrow reserve,&#xD;
             the patient may be enrolled irrespective of the end date of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional criteria exist.&#xD;
