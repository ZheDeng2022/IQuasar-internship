      In this protocol we aim to use rTMS to better characterize STS role in normal and abnormal&#xD;
      social cognition. With that purpose, we will measure the effect of inhibitory and excitatory&#xD;
      rTMS on the fixation time on social scenes (using eye-tracking methodology) or on the ability&#xD;
      to recognize human voice/sounds.&#xD;

      Autism is characterized by severe impairments in verbal and non verbal communication and in&#xD;
      social interactions. Results from cerebral imaging studies have suggested that abnormalities&#xD;
      located on the superior temporal Sulcus (STS) level would be implicated in social impairments&#xD;
      in autism. This abnormalities are both anatomical and functional: 1) rest hypoperfusion&#xD;
      detected by positron emission tomography (PET); 2) abnormal activation during social tasks&#xD;
      (fMRI) and 3) structural abnormalities shown on anatomical MRI. The STS is implicated in&#xD;
      social cognition in normal subjects. Our hypothesis is that these anatomo-functional&#xD;
      abnormalities would appear very early in brain development and could be one of the first&#xD;
      steps in the cascade of neuronal dysfunction in autism. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation&#xD;
      (rTMS) is a technique which is used in cognitive neuroscience research as well as in&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches in certain neurological and psychiatry diseases. It consists on&#xD;
      applying a magnetic impulse on the brain trough the scalp in a non-invasive and painless by&#xD;
      placing a coil on the surface of the head. This magnetic fields induce an electrical field&#xD;
      which modifies activity of those neurons inside the magnetic field and induce an&#xD;
      electrophysiological change in the target area. This process allows a non-invasive&#xD;
      interaction with the human brain in action during focal stimulations. In cognitive&#xD;
      neuroscience research, we are interested in the modifications caused by rTMS in cognitive&#xD;
      performances in order to better precise the functional role of the target region. The&#xD;
      intensity and the frequency of the impulse can be controlled (frequency &lt;1 Hz = inhibitory&#xD;
      effect ; frequency &gt; 3 Hz = excitatory effect). The functional characteristics of a given&#xD;
      region and it's eventual dysfunctions may be identified thank to the abnormalities in&#xD;
      reactivity and cortical connectivity. The goal of this project is to study inhibitory and&#xD;
      excitatory effects of rTMS applied to the STS in healthy controls and patients with autism.&#xD;
      This effect will be measured by two main parameters of social cognition: 1) visual perception&#xD;
      of social scenes, measured by eye-tracking methodology; 2) auditory perception of human&#xD;
      voice. We will study 50 healthy voluntaries controls and 50 patients with a non-syndromic&#xD;
      autism (18 to 25 years old; IQ &gt; 60), diagnosed by DSM-IV and ADI-R. All participants will&#xD;
      undergo an structural MRI and a rTMS session on the STS. In both cases, the STS will be&#xD;
      localised based on the structural MRI. The total duration of the rTMS session is about two&#xD;
      hours. All data will be analysed by the adapted statistical methods. This study will allow a&#xD;
      better understanding of the role of STS in social cognition in healthy subjects as well as&#xD;
      it's implication in the social impairments which characterize autism. Finally, the rTMS may&#xD;
      become, in a near future, a innovative therapeutic strategy in autism.&#xD;
