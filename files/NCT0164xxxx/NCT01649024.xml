  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to define the immunologic and clinical activity of Tremelimumab in&#xD;
      patients with advanced mesothelioma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No effective standard treatment can improve significantly the prognosis of malignant&#xD;
      mesothelioma (MM) patients. However, there is evidence that MM patients may benefit from&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies examining CTLA-4 blockade are providing convincing evidences on the&#xD;
      immunobiological effects and on the clinical activity of this new class of immunomodulating&#xD;
      therapeutic agents, likely due to their ability to stimulate patients'immune system to more&#xD;
      effectively attack tumor cells by blocking a negative regulatory signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tremelimumab is a fully human anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb), developed as an IgG2&#xD;
      isotype to minimize complement activation and reduce the risk of cytokine storm. As a single&#xD;
      agent, Tremelimumab can induce durable tumor regression in 7-10% of patients with advanced&#xD;
      melanoma. Tremelimumab has been tested in several clinical trials as single-agent or in&#xD;
      combination with other agents in different solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidences above unveil a strong immunologic potential of treatment with Tremelimumab also&#xD;
      in MM patients.&#xD;
