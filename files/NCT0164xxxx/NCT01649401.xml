  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine whether the use of the PARI LC Sprint Sp&#xD;
      nebulizer in the treatment of asthma in children under 36 months reduces the duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate whether the use of the LC Sprint Sp&#xD;
      Nebulizer results in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A-shortened duration of oxygen-dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-reduced side effects by assessing the patient's heart rate before and 30 minutes after the&#xD;
      first aerosol and noting the occurrence of desaturation &lt;90% during the nebulisation&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-increased acceptance of the aerosol, measured via a questionnaire given to the patient's&#xD;
      parents at the end of hospitalization (a single questionnaire will be completed by either&#xD;
      parent or both parents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-shortened length of stay based on the following discharge criteria: observation of a&#xD;
      respiratory severity score ≤ 2 (Clinical Asthma Score (CAS)) for at least 12 consecutive&#xD;
      hours and a transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2)&gt; 94% when awake or &gt; 91% during sleep.&#xD;
