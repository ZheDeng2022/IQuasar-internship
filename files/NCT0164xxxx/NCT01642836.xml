      Stanford GOALS is a large-scale, community-based randomized controlled trial of an&#xD;
      innovative, interdisciplinary, multi-component, multi-level, multi-setting (MMM) approach to&#xD;
      treating overweight and obese children. Primary Research Question: Will a 3-year, innovative,&#xD;
      interdisciplinary, multi-component, multi-level, multi-setting (MMM) community-based&#xD;
      intervention to treat overweight and obese children significantly reduce BMI compared to an&#xD;
      enhanced standard care/health and nutrition education active comparison intervention?&#xD;
