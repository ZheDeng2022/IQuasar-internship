  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single dose evaluation using an open label dose escalating design. Cohort1&#xD;
      will consist of 3 healthy male volunteers. Each volunteer will receive a slow IV infusion&#xD;
      over 6 hours consisting of saline for 30 minutes (run in period), 8 mcg/h GW328267X for 1.5&#xD;
      hours (total dose of 12mcg) and 10 mcg/h GW328267X for 4 hours (total dose of 40 mcg).&#xD;
      Subjects will have continuous cardiac monitoring throughout the dosing period and up to 2&#xD;
      hours after cessation of the intravenous infusion. PK measurements and measurement of&#xD;
      erythropoietin and platelet activation will also be done. Samples for PK will be taken at 30&#xD;
      minute intervals during the infusion of GW328267X up to and including 1 hour after cessation&#xD;
      of the intravenous infusion. Samples for erythropoietin and platelet aggregation will be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 is optional and may be carried out in the event that the dose of GW328267X given in&#xD;
      Cohort 1 is both well tolerated and subjects do not meet the stopping criteria. The decision&#xD;
      to proceed to Cohort 2 and the dose level will be made by the GSK Study Team and the&#xD;
      Investigator based on safety, tolerability and preliminary PK/PD data obtained in Cohort 1.&#xD;
      It is planned that the maximum total dose given to any subject will not exceed 150mcg. Cohort&#xD;
      2 will consist of 3 healthy male volunteers and the study procedures for this additional&#xD;
      Cohort will be the same as that described for Cohort 1.&#xD;

             atrial fibrillation or flutter) or finding on baseline examination that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, may place the subject at an unacceptable risk as a&#xD;
             participant in this trial or may interfere with interpretation of cardiovascular&#xD;
             safety results during the conduct of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
