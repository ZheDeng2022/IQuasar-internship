    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase II study is designed to assess&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of using JVS-100 to treat heart failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      90 subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy will be randomized to receive a single dose of 15 or&#xD;
      30 mg of JVS-100 or matching placebo. Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either&#xD;
      placebo, 15 mg or 30 mg of JVS-100. Subjects will be monitored overnight for 18-24 hours post&#xD;
      dose and have scheduled visits at 3 days post-injection for safety evaluations. All subjects&#xD;
      will be scheduled for follow-up visits at approximately 30 days (1 month), 120 days (4&#xD;
      months), and 360 days (12 months) to assess safety and cardiac function.&#xD;
