  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 20 million Americans have allergic nasal symptoms including stuffiness, sneezing and a&#xD;
      &quot;runny&quot; nose. AkPharma's Calcium Glycerophosphate used as a nasal spray wash is believed to&#xD;
      improve these symptoms without side effects common to over the counter and prescription&#xD;
      medication. It is hypothesized that Calcium Glycerophosphate will have a perceived&#xD;
      improvement in breathing comfort.&#xD;

      Subjects will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria and consented if they fit the&#xD;
      same criteria. They will be instructed on keeping a nasal diary of symptoms &quot;runny, itchy,&#xD;
      congestion, sneezing, voice changes and throat clearing&quot;. They will have blood drawn for&#xD;
      allergy testing. After a 1 week run-in, subjects will return their diary. If they still&#xD;
      qualify based on the diary they will have baseline labs drawn and baseline breathing test&#xD;
      (Spirometry) performed. They will also have a nasal wash and specimen collection performed.&#xD;
      They will be instructed on use of the nasal wash. There will be three more weekly visits&#xD;
      before study conclusion which will include diary submission, Spirometry and nasal wash and&#xD;
      specimen collection. On the final visit blood will again be collected as well.&#xD;
