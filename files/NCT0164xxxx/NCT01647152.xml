      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Uveitis is an eye inflammation that can cause vision loss. It is treated with eye drops,&#xD;
      drugs and sometimes surgery. In some people, treatment may not prevent vision loss. A type of&#xD;
      white blood cells called T-cells often have a role in causing uveitis. In some cases of&#xD;
      uveitis, T-cells attack the eye and cause inflammation. A drug called ustekinumab reduces&#xD;
      inflammation from these T-cells. Researchers want to see if ustekinumab can be used to treat&#xD;
      uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if ustekinumab can be used to treat uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have active uveitis that needs treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, eye exam, and medical history. Blood&#xD;
           and urine samples will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have at least eight clinic visits during the 64-week study period.&#xD;
           After the first visit, visits will occur at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and then every 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a ustekinumab injection at the first study visit. They will have&#xD;
           additional doses at the second and third visits, and then every 12 weeks until 1 year&#xD;
           after the first dose (Week 52).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and eye exams. Other standard&#xD;
           treatments for uveitis may be given as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be a final study visit 3 months after the last injection.&#xD;

      Objective: Uveitis refers to intraocular inflammatory diseases that are an important cause of&#xD;
      visual loss. Standard systemic immunosuppressive medications for uveitis can cause&#xD;
      significant adverse effects and many patients continue to experience disease flare-ups.&#xD;
      Ustekinumab is a human IL-12 and -23 antagonist. The involvement of IL-12 and IL-23 in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of uveitis and other autoimmune diseases known to be associated with uveitis&#xD;
      suggests that ustekinumab could be a potential treatment for uveitis. The study objective is&#xD;
      to investigate the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of subcutaneous injections of&#xD;
      ustekinumab as a possible treatment for active intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis or&#xD;
      panuveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Five participants with active intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis or&#xD;
      panuveitis who meet the inclusion criteria will be initially enrolled. Up to seven&#xD;
      participants may be enrolled, as up to two participants may be accrued to account for&#xD;
      participants who withdraw from the study prior to Week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a prospective, non-randomized, uncontrolled, single-center pilot study to&#xD;
      evaluate subcutaneous injections of ustekinumab as a possible treatment for active&#xD;
      intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis or panuveitis. Participants will receive a 90 mg&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection of ustekinumab at baseline and a second and third injection at Week 2&#xD;
      and 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Participants will continue to receive injections of&#xD;
      ustekinumab every 12 weeks until Week 52. Participants will return for a final safety visit&#xD;
      12 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the number of participants who experience treatment&#xD;
      response (as defined in Appendix 1) by Week 8. Secondary outcomes include changes in visual&#xD;
      acuity, the number of participants who experience a recurrence, the number of days to&#xD;
      recurrence, presence or extent of macular edema, the amount of retino-vascular leakage,&#xD;
      changes in retinal thickening, the length of time to quiescence and the ability to taper&#xD;
      concomitant immunosuppressive medications. Safety outcomes include the number and severity of&#xD;
      systemic and ocular toxicities and adverse events, the proportion of participants who&#xD;
      experience vision loss of greater than or equal to 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy&#xD;
      Study (ETDRS) letters and the number of participants who experience a substantial rise in&#xD;
      elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).&#xD;
