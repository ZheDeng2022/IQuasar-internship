    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a destructive chronic infection of the gums, ligaments, and bone,&#xD;
      predominantly caused by Gram-negative bacteria. Individuals with periodontal disease are at&#xD;
      increased risk of systemic diseases. Increased prevalence of periodontal disease has been&#xD;
      reported in patients with chronic kidney disease, especially in dialysis patients. Chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD) is the progressive loss of kidney function over time. When kidneys loose&#xD;
      their 85-90 % function, dialysis is performed. Efficacy of dialysis is checked by serum&#xD;
      albumin levels. Lower-than-normal levels of serum albumin may be a sign of kidney diseases.&#xD;
      Hypoalbuminemia has been demonstrated to be a strong predictor of death in chronic renal&#xD;
      failure. A proposed mechanism for the effect of periodontitis on the development of kidney&#xD;
      disease is systemic inflammation. The deleterious effects of systemic inflammation on kidney&#xD;
      function could occur during the period of active periodontal infection and accumulate during&#xD;
      the life time of the individual. This randomized control trial is designed to observe the&#xD;
      effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy on serum albumin levels of patients on maintenance&#xD;
      hemodialysis therapy. Patients will undergo periodontal examination and their serum albumin&#xD;
      levels will be checked. Then they will be randomly divided in two groups. One group will be&#xD;
      given non surgical periodontal treatment and second group will be offered late treatment.&#xD;
      After 6 weeks 1st group will be reevaluated by serum albumin level and periodontal&#xD;
      examination to observe the effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy. Statistical analyses&#xD;
      shall be performed using SPSS software. T tests and Chi-sq tests shall be used to test&#xD;
      differences according to periodontal status for continuous and categorical variables,&#xD;
      respectively. The level of significance is set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

      Periodontitis is a destructive chronic infection of the gums, ligaments, and bone,&#xD;
      predominantly caused by Gram-negative bacteria residing in biofilm surrounding the teeth.&#xD;
      Biofilm is an aggregate of microbes with a distinct architecture. This biofilm contains&#xD;
      clusters of bacterial species that are found commonly below the gingiva and are associated&#xD;
      reproducibly with periodontal disease. These bacteria involved in periodontitis causes&#xD;
      destruction of tissues which leads to formation of a periodontal pocket. This space becomes a&#xD;
      site for further bacterial colonization and possible entry route of bacteria in blood stream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is evident from the data that periodontal health of the Pakistani nation is very poor with&#xD;
      only 28% of the 12 year old having healthy gums and more than 93% of the 65 year old have&#xD;
      some gum or periodontal disease . These results indicate that periodontal disease including&#xD;
      inflammation of gums and calculus is endemic in Pakistan . Like caries, the level of gingival&#xD;
      and periodontal disease is higher in the rural population of the Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an increasing evidence that individuals with periodontal disease are at increased&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular disease, preterm delivery of low birth weight infants, pulmonary&#xD;
      diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, alzheimer's disease &amp; kidney&#xD;
      diseases. The factors predisposing to periodontal disease and accelerating its progression&#xD;
      are clearly evident in chronic renal failure. They encompass hyposalivation and xerostomia,&#xD;
      impaired immunity and wound healing, alveolar bone destruction due to renal osteodystrophy,&#xD;
      bleeding diathesis, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition and a state of general disability&#xD;
      impairing oral hygiene. There is evidence for increased prevalence of periodontal disease in&#xD;
      patients with renal disease, especially in dialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the progressive loss of kidney function over time. Normal&#xD;
      renal functions are normally evaluated by glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Normal results&#xD;
      range from 90 - 120 mL/min/1.73 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The loss of kidney function usually takes months or years to occur. The final stage of&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease is called end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after which kidneys no longer&#xD;
      function and the patient needs dialysis or a kidney transplant .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic kidney disease changes the serum levels of Albumin, Potassium, Calcium, Phosphorus,&#xD;
      Sodium, Cholesterol and electrolytes. Among all these, albumin is of prime importance because&#xD;
      it plays an important role in keeping the fluid from the blood from leaking out into the&#xD;
      tissues. The normal range is 3.4 - 5.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower-than-normal levels of serum albumin may be a sign of kidney diseases or liver disease&#xD;
      (for example, hepatitis, cirrhosis). Decreased albumin may occur when body does not get or&#xD;
      absorb enough nutrients, such as after Crohn's disease, Low-protein diets, Sprue, Whipple's&#xD;
      disease . Other conditions under which the albumin levels are need to be measured are&#xD;
      widespread burns and Wilson,s disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoalbuminemia has been demonstrated to be a strong predictor of death in chronic renal&#xD;
      failure . Some studies have however suggested that hypoalbuminemia may be more indicative of&#xD;
      underlying inflammation, rather than nutritional status, especially in patients with kidney&#xD;
      disease. In a study it was observed that on dialysis initiation in the US pediatric&#xD;
      population, hypoalbuminemic patients were at higher risk of dying as compared to patients in&#xD;
      whom dialysis was initiated with normal albumin levels . It was also assessed that&#xD;
      hypoalbuminemia, is highly prevalent in kidney failure and is associated with an increased&#xD;
      mortality risk in this population. Serum albumin level may reflect both the nutritional&#xD;
      status and chronic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A proposed mechanism for the effect of periodontitis on the development of kidney disease is&#xD;
      systemic inflammation . Periodontal pathogens have been shown to have the ability to adhere&#xD;
      to, invade, and proliferate in coronary endothelial cells leading to atheroma formation and&#xD;
      impaired vasculature relaxation. Cardiovascular diseases and CKD share many risk factors, so&#xD;
      it is it can be assumed that periodontal disease exerts similar effects within the&#xD;
      vasculature of the kidney. Both periodontitis and kidney diseases are associated with&#xD;
      inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and chronic low level inflammation associated&#xD;
      with periodontitis may lead to endothelial dysfunction which plays a role in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of kidney disease in edentulous patients. The deleterious effects of systemic inflammation on&#xD;
      kidney function could occur during the period of active periodontal infection and accumulate&#xD;
      during the life time of the individual. Inflammation is an important predictor of low serum&#xD;
      albumin levels among dialysis patients, independent of nutritional status. Low albumin is&#xD;
      often indicative of malnutrition, but chronic inflammation appears to be the culprit in half&#xD;
      of the patients with low levels of albumin. This may explain why nutritional therapy does not&#xD;
      increase serum albumin levels in some patients suggesting chronic inflammation. High CRP&#xD;
      levels correlates with increased mortality, regardless of nutritional status suggesting an&#xD;
      independent role for chronic inflammation in causing hypoalbuminemia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abhijit V. Kshirsagar et al. observed an association of severe periodontal disease and&#xD;
      hypoalbuminemia in a group of patients who were receiving long-term outpatient hemodialysis.&#xD;
      In study subjects, patients with periodontal disease were more than three times more likely&#xD;
      to have low serum albumin than patients without periodontal disease. Increased levels of&#xD;
      plaque have been reported for hemodialysis (HD) populations from several countries including&#xD;
      Brazil. It has to be noted, however, that HD patients are also repeatedly exposed to systemic&#xD;
      anticoagulation with high-dose heparin during blood purification procedures. This predisposes&#xD;
      them further to gingival bleeding and, in consequence, facilitates bacterial colonization and&#xD;
      growth, and may propagate periodontal disease. Recently, an impressive 3-fold decrease in&#xD;
      C-reactive protein and a rise in hemoglobin (Hb) levels in HD patients were reported to occur&#xD;
      already after 4-6 weeks following traditional periodontal therapy . Thus, the issue of poor&#xD;
      oral health status in CKD patients apparently deserves a higher awareness of the problem, and&#xD;
      increased attention, and indicates the need for a closer collaboration between primary care&#xD;
      physicians, nephrologists and dentists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence supporting the contribution of periodontitis to systemic inflammation.&#xD;
      Several possible mechanisms have been suggested, including the locally produced inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators and bacterial by-products that invade the blood stream, interact with host cells&#xD;
      and trigger inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study from Turkey of End Stage Renal disease (ESRD) patients on HD therapy found increased&#xD;
      periodontitis as measured by the Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs (CPITN). In a&#xD;
      study of renal patients receiving HD, Chaung et al, 2005 in Taiwan, reported increased rates&#xD;
      of periodontitis when compared with national data on periodontal disease for the Taiwanese&#xD;
      population. Studies focusing on the periodontal health of End Stage Renal disease (ESRD)&#xD;
      patients on HD maintenance therapy have reported the presence of poor oral hygiene and&#xD;
      attendant gingival inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bots CP, Poortermann JHG, Brand HS et al (2006) in a study from Netherlands of ESRD patients,&#xD;
      some of whom were receiving HD, did not find an increased loss of attachment when compared&#xD;
      with some healthy case-matched controls. Periodontal status of End stage Renal Disease (ESRD)&#xD;
      patients receiving HD showed no increase in periodontal indices when compared with&#xD;
      case-matched controls. The authors did note that the HD group had greater numbers of&#xD;
      periodontopathic bacterial species than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of studies conducted so far to establish association between severe periodontitis&#xD;
      and hypoalbuminemia are variable and are not conclusive. Only one clinical trial has been&#xD;
      conducted regarding that, therefore aim of the study is to observe the effect of non surgical&#xD;
      periodontal therapy on changes of albumin levels in maintenance dialysis patients.&#xD;
