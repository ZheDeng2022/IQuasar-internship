    <textblock>
      NOVOCART® Disc plus is being investigated to explore its clinical applicability, safety and&#xD;
      efficacy in the repair of a herniated disc with an indication for an elective sequestrectomy,&#xD;
      and of the adjacent degenerated disc, if present. The objective of this clinical study is to&#xD;
      provide basis for a confirmatory study design (endpoints, methodologies) (Phase II), and to&#xD;
      develop a safety profile (Phase I). This study further aims at developing and validating&#xD;
      known and new biologic markers for the quality and clinical efficacy of the product as&#xD;
      requested in the context of identity, purity and potency characteristics of the&#xD;
      medicinal/investigational product.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a classical Phase II study with an implicated Phase I part. The Phase I/II&#xD;
      combination study is a non-confirmatory study aimed at gathering preliminary clinical&#xD;
      information on NOVOCART® Disc plus used in a new indication in the repair of a herniated&#xD;
      disc. It will be conducted in a prospective, multicenter, unmasked, clinical trial including&#xD;
      120 subjects randomized to NOVOCART® Disc plus (NDplus, 60 subjects), media NOVOCART® Disc&#xD;
      basic with no active cell component (NDbasic, 36 subjects) and to standard of care (SC)&#xD;
      sequestrectomy as control (24 subjects). 24 patients will be enrolled in Phase I of the study&#xD;
      (12 NDplus, 12 NDbasic) and 96 patients in Phase II (48 NDplus, 24 NDbasic, 24 SC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be evaluated at 1.5-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, 48-months post-t0 examination&#xD;
      in the SC study arm and 1.5-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, 48-months post-t5 examination in the&#xD;
      NDplus and NDbasic study arms, and then 5 years post-t0/t5 to collect long-term clinical&#xD;
      data. Efficacy measurements for functional improvement will be evaluated among NDplus,&#xD;
      NDbasic and SC. Physiological effects observed from MRI measurements will be compared between&#xD;
      appropriate treatments depending on expected treatment mechanisms. Safety data of NDplus will&#xD;
      be combined with NDbasic to contrast against SC on procedure related risks and NDplus against&#xD;
      NDbasic and SC together on graft-related adverse experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To optimize the usefulness of clinical information, data collected in the study may be&#xD;
      analyzed and reviewed continuously. Early findings may be used to modify the study design&#xD;
      when deemed appropriate and acceptable by the Sponsor's medical advisors. Data-driven&#xD;
      adaptive actions include but are not limited to stopping enrollment early. The Sponsor will&#xD;
      inform regulatory bodies, Ethic Committees, and investigators before implementing study&#xD;
      design modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells and tissues collected from this study will be used in other in vitro-controlled&#xD;
      experiments aimed at developing and validating known and novel biologic markers to quantify&#xD;
      cell quality in the context of identity, purity and potency. Prognostic values of these&#xD;
      biologic markers will be examined by correlating them with clinical data collected in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow each subject for a total of five years post-t0 examination in the SC&#xD;
      study arm and post-t5 examination in the NDplus and NDbasic study arms to obtain long-term&#xD;
      performance data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have a single-level acute disc herniation with an indication for an elective&#xD;
      sequestrectomy. They may further have corresponding disc degeneration in the proximal&#xD;
      adjacent segment (Pfirrmann Score Stage 3-4). A total of 120 adults will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will remain in the study for 5 years post t0/t5 examination to complete the&#xD;
      planned follow-up phase. It is expected to take 6 years and five months to collect all&#xD;
      required data for this study.&#xD;
