    <textblock>
      Pain is very common in persons with a history of addiction, but few studies have examined the&#xD;
      best treatment of pain in this population. This is a study to determine the pain relief&#xD;
      provided by intravenous hydromorphone (Dilaudid) or buprenorphine given to persons maintained&#xD;
      on stable doses of methadone or buprenorphine. Experimental sessions will require overnight&#xD;
      stays on a residential research unit. In these sessions, persons will be exposed to standard&#xD;
      experimental pain techniques at baseline and then rate the relief (if any) provided by the&#xD;
      study medication when exposed to the same techniques. Persons will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      2 or 3 sessions, each separated by at least 7 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to learn how to better treat pain in people maintained on opioid&#xD;
      medications, like methadone and buprenorphine (Suboxone ®, Subutex ®). People who take opioid&#xD;
      medications for long periods of time are known to experience pain differently; and, regular&#xD;
      amounts of medications may not be enough to treat the pain of these individuals.&#xD;
      Additionally, many people with a history of addiction are afraid of taking opioid pain&#xD;
      relievers, like morphine or hydromorphone (Dilaudid ®), for fear of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help guide the medical community on better pain treatment for people&#xD;
      prescribed buprenorphine or methadone. Investigators also want to determine the risk for&#xD;
      relapse in people who receive opioid pain relievers for the treatment of acute pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people aged 18-55 who are maintained on buprenorphine or methadone for the treatment&#xD;
      of opioid dependence may take part in this study. Participants must be free of illicit drug&#xD;
      use and be on a stable dose of methadone or buprenorphine. Initial screening will occur over&#xD;
      the phone and then select participants will be scheduled for an in-person screening at the&#xD;
      BPRU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant meets all criteria and agrees to participate, he or she will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the study. Enrolled participants will have 2 or 3 sessions involving overnight stays on&#xD;
      the Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit (BPRU) residential unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants are on methadone, they will have 2 sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants are on buprenorphine, they will have 3 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions will each last for about 40 hours and involve identical procedures. That means&#xD;
      participants will stay 2 nights on the BPRU residential unit for each session, and these&#xD;
      sessions will be at least a week a part. Most people will complete all sessions within 1&#xD;
      month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During sessions participants will experience the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 - Admission to the BPRU residential unit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take an alcohol breath test and provide a urine sample to check for&#xD;
           drug use (and pregnancy if female). These tests must be negative to be admitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive their normal dose of methadone or buprenorphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 - Experimental pain testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On each session day, a nurse will insert an IV catheter on the arm or hand not involved&#xD;
           with pain testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigational drug or placebo will be given in random order. During each pain testing&#xD;
           session, participants will receive 4 doses of the same investigational drug or placebo.&#xD;
           If participants are on methadone, they will not receive buprenorphine injections as&#xD;
           these could cause opioid withdrawal symptoms. Participants will not be told which drug&#xD;
           or placebo they are getting and the research staff will not know the assignment either.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 7 rounds of experimental pain testing, each lasting about 45&#xD;
           minutes and consisting of the same pain procedures. A trained technician will show&#xD;
           participants each of the pain testing procedures and practice with them until&#xD;
           participants learn what is involved and how to respond. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
           complete 4 different types of standard pain tests during each session. Participants may&#xD;
           stop these procedures at any point by telling the technician that they wish to stop.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. One type of test will produce pain by a device that will be pressed against the&#xD;
                skin on the shoulder and arm. This produces pressure, similar to pressing a finger&#xD;
                against the skin. Participants will be asked to indicate when the pain from the&#xD;
                pressure reaches certain levels of intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Another type of test will produce pain by a small device that gives off heat. An&#xD;
                investigator will put this device on a participant's forearm and it will increase&#xD;
                in temperature. Some of these temperatures will cause participants to experience&#xD;
                pain, and they will be asked to rate the pain produced by different intensities of&#xD;
                heat.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The third type of pain test will involve placing a hand in very cold water and&#xD;
                leaving it there for as long as possible, or until reaching a time limit.&#xD;
                Participants will be asked to rate the pain that they feel from the cold water and&#xD;
                they may remove their hand from the water at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. In addition to pain tests, investigators will also test the ability to detect&#xD;
                touch, warmth, and cold sensations. To test for touch sensitivity, a series of very&#xD;
                fine threads or thread-like objects will be applied to the forearm and&#xD;
                investigators will ask participants to communicate when first noticing any&#xD;
                sensation. To test for warmth and cold sensitivity, the same device used to test&#xD;
                heat pain sensitivity will be placed on the arm. Participants will be asked to let&#xD;
                the investigator know when they first notice the sensation of warmth or cold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At times, participants will experience more than one type of pain at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions about their experiences, including questions about&#xD;
           how the study drug or placebo makes them feel and about any problems with the study drug&#xD;
           or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staff will take a participant's vital signs and take a picture of the eye repeatedly&#xD;
           over each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unless participants experience symptoms of opioid withdrawal (for example - nausea,&#xD;
           vomiting, diarrhea or loose stools, body aches, and goosebumps), they will not be given&#xD;
           the daily dose of methadone or buprenorphine on pain testing day (Day 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3 - Discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs will be measured and a picture of the eye will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions about their experiences from Day 2, including&#xD;
           questions about any lasting drug effects and about any problems with the study drug or&#xD;
           placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive their normal dose of methadone or buprenorphine and be&#xD;
           discharged from the residential unit.&#xD;
