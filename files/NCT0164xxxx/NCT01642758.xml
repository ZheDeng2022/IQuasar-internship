  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta thalassemia intermedia syndromes are genetic anemias caused by mutations which reduce&#xD;
      production of beta globin, a major component of adult hemoglobin A, the protein which&#xD;
      delivers oxygen throughout the body. Patients suffer from poor growth, fatigue, heart&#xD;
      failure, endocrine deficiencies, and eventually, many require chronic blood transfusions.&#xD;
      There is no approved therapeutic for the deficiency of beta globin chains in beta&#xD;
      thalassemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will study an oral therapeutic which stimulates production of fetal globin, an&#xD;
      alternate type which is produced by all humans, but is normally switched off in infancy. This&#xD;
      type of globin can compensate for the missing protein in beta thalassemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial of an experimental oral medicine which stimulates production of fetal&#xD;
      hemoglobin, an innate type of hemoglobin which is normally made but is suppressed in infancy.&#xD;
      Fetal globin (HbF) can perform the function of the missing beta globin and reduce anemia in&#xD;
      beta thalassemia, when it is produced in higher amounts than normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, 10 patients with beta thalassemia intermedia in Lebanon will all receive the&#xD;
      study drug for 6 months at a dose which has been previously shown to be safe in normal&#xD;
      volunteers and in beta thalassemia and sickle cell patients and to stimulate fetal globin&#xD;
      production in many, when given for brief periods. The purpose of this trial is the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if total hemoglobin levels increase above baseline in some subjects when&#xD;
           the study drug is taken for 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if fetal globin is increased above baseline levels in a proportion of&#xD;
           subjects when the study drug is taken for 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the number of adverse events which occur with 26 weeks of administration of&#xD;
           the study drug in beta thalassemia intermedia subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a screening period, the subjects will take the study drug at home once a day. They will&#xD;
      be seen once every 4 weeks for examinations and laboratory tests during the dosing period and&#xD;
      for 4 weeks afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will provide an important step in evaluating a potential treatment for patients&#xD;
      with beta thalassemia intermedia, that can be used around the world, if it is effective and&#xD;
      safe.&#xD;

    <description>Baseline hemoglobin levels will be determined in each subject and averaged from levels obtained on a screening visit and on day one of the study, before any drug is taken. Hemoglobin levels will then be analyzed every 4 weeks during 26 weeks of taking the study drug and for 4 weeks after the dosing is completed. Changes from baseline will be determined.</description>

    <description>Levels of HbF will be averaged from a screening visit and day 1 of the study, prior to any drug treatment. HbF levels will then be measured every 4 weeks during treatment and for 4 weeks after the treatment, and compared to each subject's baseline value. The number of subjects in which an increase in HbF develops above individuals' average baseline value will be obtained.</description>
