      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mitochondria are the parts of cells that help produce energy. Metabolism is the process&#xD;
           by which the body uses energy to help cells grow and reproduce. Metabolic and&#xD;
           mitochondrial disorders affect the body s ability to produce and store energy. These&#xD;
           disorders can cause a wide variety of problems, but most often they affect the muscles&#xD;
           and the brain, where energy requirements are high. Treatment is difficult because the&#xD;
           exact source of the problem is hard to detect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EPI-743 is a new drug that is based on vitamin E. Tests have shown that it can help&#xD;
           improve the function of cells with mitochondrial problems. It may be able to treat&#xD;
           people with genetic disorders that affect metabolism and mitochondria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if EPI-743 can improve energy production and use in people with mitochondrial or&#xD;
      metabolic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children between 2 and 11 years of age who have metabolic or mitochondrial problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last about 13 months. Participants will have seven 3- to 5-day inpatient&#xD;
           study visits about 3 months apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take either EPI-743 or a placebo for the first 6 months of the study.&#xD;
           After 6 months, there will be a 1-month rest period. Then, those who received EPI-743 in&#xD;
           the first 6 months will take the placebo for the next 6 months. Those who had the&#xD;
           placebo will take EPI-743.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During each inpatient study visit, participants will have a physical exam. A 24-hour&#xD;
           urine collection will be obtained. Blood samples will also be taken. Imaging studies and&#xD;
           other tests may be performed as directed by the study researchers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The clinical manifestations of disorders of energy metabolism and defects in&#xD;
      oxidation/reduction are similar because the basic defect involves the inability to transfer&#xD;
      electrons. The same is true for many mitochondrial diseases. Affected patients exhibit a wide&#xD;
      variety of signs and symptoms, but the most frequent and earliest dysfunctions occur in the&#xD;
      muscle and brain, where energy requirements are high. The diagnosis of this type of defect is&#xD;
      problematic because of the nonspecific and protean clinical manifestations of these&#xD;
      disorders. Treatment is equally challenging, since the exact locus of the primary defect&#xD;
      generally remains enigmatic. As a consequence, physicians rely upon generic cocktails of&#xD;
      vitamin co-factors or endogenous intermediates intended to enhance mitochondrial electron&#xD;
      transport, diminish the damage of reactive oxygen species, and promote energy production. The&#xD;
      field is such a morass that, in general, it calls for trial-and-error treatment based upon&#xD;
      empiric data. Edison Pharmaceuticals, Inc, has developed an in vitro assay that utilizes&#xD;
      patient fibroblasts to model the innate susceptibility to oxidative stress caused by the&#xD;
      disorders of energy metabolism and oxidation/reduction. The assay system also determines if&#xD;
      the cells respond with increased viability to an IND drug called EPI-743. We propose a&#xD;
      clinical trial that enrolls 20 children who meet three criteria. First, they must have a&#xD;
      disorder that, based upon studies performed in a clinical protocol such as 76-HG-0238&#xD;
      (&quot;Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Inborn Errors of Metabolism and Other Genetic&#xD;
      Disorders&quot;), is consistent with a defect in energy metabolism or oxidation/reduction. Second,&#xD;
      their cultured fibroblasts must exhibit a defect in the ability to withstand oxidant stress.&#xD;
      Third, their fibroblasts must respond to EPI-743 in vitro by showing improved viability under&#xD;
      conditions of oxidative stress. This protocol is a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover&#xD;
      study with 6-month periods of treatment and a two-month washout period. Patients will be&#xD;
      admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2-5 days every 3 months. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      will be quality of life based upon the Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale&#xD;
      (NPMDS) for ages 2-11 years; parts IIII&#xD;
&#xD;
      will be evaluated separately from part IV. Secondary outcome measures will be tailored to&#xD;
      each patient's laboratory, imaging, and clinical abnormalities. Results while receiving&#xD;
      EPI-743 will be compared to results while receiving placebo; both repeated measures analyses&#xD;
      and Student's t test will be employed.&#xD;

    <limitations_and_caveats>All 20 randomized patients were included in the model to assess baseline characteristics. Of the 20 randomized, 19 provided 6-month outcomes (10 placebo, 9 treatment), who then crossed over their treatments and provided 8-month baseline scores. Of these, 16 provided 14-month outcomes (8 who had crossed over to treatment, and 8 who had crossed over to placebo).</limitations_and_caveats>
