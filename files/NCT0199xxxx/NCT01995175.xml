  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence and associated healthcare utilization of&#xD;
      RSV-associated, suspected LRTI in a general population of infants from birth up to 2 years of&#xD;
      age, and also to assess the accuracy of a newly developed LRTI case definition and severity&#xD;
      scale compared to two existing definitions. The study will also assess the population&#xD;
      attributable risk percent of RSV LRTI on the development of wheeze and asthma from 0 to 6&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      New born infants from various countries over the world will be followed up for up to two&#xD;
      years for the occurrence of Lower Respiratory Tract Infections. Through active and passive&#xD;
      surveillance, any suspected case will be identified, assessed during an examination visit and&#xD;
      followed up until completion through a diary card. Full symptomology will be assessed during&#xD;
      the examination visit. The disease course and all healthcare utilization will be subsequently&#xD;
      collected through a two-week diary card and contact with ay healthcare providers involved in&#xD;
      management of the disease. RSV detection will occur through quantitative PCR of collected&#xD;
      nasal swabs. A baseline cord blood serum sample of all subjects and a follow-up blood serum&#xD;
      sample from a sub-cohort will also be collected to assess antibody levels at various points&#xD;
      in time and in relation to risk of RSV LRTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For extension period, pertaining to wheeze and asthma (Epoch 002): Subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s)&#xD;
      will be asked to re-consent and subjects will be followed up through quarterly contacts up to&#xD;
      the age of 6 years. Data collection will also occur from medical charts retrospectively for&#xD;
      those who have a gap period between the end of the primary study and providing re-consent for&#xD;
      the extension. The extension involves enrolment visit (at 2nd birthday [on completion of&#xD;
      primary study or as soon as possible thereafter]) and quarterly surveillance contacts.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From birth up to 2 years of age</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence rate was calculated by dividing the number of subjects reporting first episode over the follow-up period, to the total person-years. Detection of the RSV-infection was performed by reverse transcription quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR ) assay on ribonucleic acids (RNA) extracted from nasal swabs. Number of suspected RSV RTI cases were tabulated.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>2409 subjects were enrolled into the current primary study, which included subjects from birth to 2 years of age. This study will be further extended to follow-up subjects up to 6 years of age (extension study). Results presented in this record correspond to the primary study and will be updated with the results of the extension study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Out of the 2409 subjects enrolled initially, 7 subjects did not sign the re-consent for study participation after delivery (birth), leaving 2402 subjects to be enrolled into the Total enrolled cohort. 1 subject was excluded due to protocol violation, hence 2401 subjects formed the Per Protocol Set (PPS).</pre_assignment_details>

Severe LRTI refers to Child with LRTI AND SaO2 &lt; 92%, OR Difficulty breathing leading to: Irritability/agitation, OR Lethargy/sleepiness, OR Severe chest indrawing, OR Reduced/no vocalization, OR Apnoea &gt; 20 sec, OR Cyanosis, OR Stop feeding well/dehydration. The number of WHO LRTI cases were assessed for the following age groups: 0-2, 3-5, 6-11 and 12-23 months of age.Occurrence of LRTI/severe LRTI cases as classified by the LRTI case definitions and severity scale, was not limited to the subgroups of subjects recruited from Months 1-6 and 13-18 but was provided for subjects in all age intervals: 0-2 months, 3-5 months, 6-11 months and 12-23 months.</description>
