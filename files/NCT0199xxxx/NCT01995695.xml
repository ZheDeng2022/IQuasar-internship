      H7N9 avian influenza (AI) viruses have caused a recent outbreak of severe respiratory disease&#xD;
      in humans in China. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      a live attenuated H7N9 A/Anhui/13 ca influenza virus vaccine in healthy adults. A single dose&#xD;
      of inactivated subvirion H7N9 influenza vaccine will be administered 3 months later.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      H7N9 AI viruses have recently caused a large outbreak of severe respiratory disease in humans&#xD;
      in China. A vaccine for use in the event of an H7N9 AI pandemic is an important research&#xD;
      priority. Previous studies have shown that when subjects who received a live bird flu vaccine&#xD;
      received a subsequent &quot;booster&quot; dose of inactivated bird flu vaccine, a vigorous antibody&#xD;
      response was detected. The inactivated vaccine served as a way to probe the immune response&#xD;
      to the initial live vaccine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      infectivity, and immunogenicity of a live attenuated H7N9 A/Anhui/13 ca influenza virus&#xD;
      vaccine in healthy adults, and to administer a booster dose of an inactivated subvirion H7N9&#xD;
      influenza vaccine 3 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy adults who are willing to remain in an isolation unit in an&#xD;
      inpatient clinic for several days during the study. They will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either one dose (Group 1) or two doses (Group 2) of the live attenuated H7N9 A/Anhui/13 ca&#xD;
      influenza virus vaccine, which will be delivered by a nasal spray device. Participants in&#xD;
      both groups will receive one &quot;booster&quot; dose of inactivated subvirion H7N9 influenza vaccine 3&#xD;
      months later in an outpatient setting. All participants will be admitted to the inpatient&#xD;
      clinic and will receive one dose of the live attenuated H7N9 A/Anhui/13 ca influenza virus&#xD;
      vaccine 2 days after entering the clinic. Participants will remain in the inpatient clinic&#xD;
      for approximately 9 days after receiving the vaccine. While in the clinic, participants will&#xD;
      undergo medical history reviews, blood collections, urine collections, physical examinations,&#xD;
      nasal wash procedures, and vital sign measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 1 will attend a study visit at Day 28 and undergo a medical history&#xD;
      review, blood collection, and a nasal wash. Participants in Group 2 will be readmitted to the&#xD;
      inpatient clinic 2 days prior to receiving a second dose of the live attenuated H7N9&#xD;
      A/Anhui/13 ca influenza virus vaccine at Day 28. They will remain in the clinic for&#xD;
      approximately 9 days after receiving the vaccine; while in the clinic, they will take part in&#xD;
      the same study procedures as during the first inpatient visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will attend a study visit at Day 56 and undergo a medical history review,&#xD;
      blood collection, and a nasal wash. At Day 98, all participants will receive one &quot;booster&quot;&#xD;
      dose of the inactivated subvirion H7N9 influenza vaccine, as outpatients. They will attend&#xD;
      additional study visits on Days 101, 105, 112, 126, 154, and 180, which may include medical&#xD;
      history reviews; physical examinations; and urine, blood, and nasal secretion collections.&#xD;
