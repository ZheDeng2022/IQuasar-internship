    <textblock>
      Nasogastric decompression was routinely used in most major intra-abdominal operations.&#xD;
      Nasogastric tube intubation was thought to decrease postoperative ileus (nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      and gastric distension). Would and respiratory complications, and to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      anastomotic leaks after gastrointestinal surgery. However, the necessity of nasogastric&#xD;
      decompression following elective abdominal surgery has been increasingly questioned over the&#xD;
      last several years. Many clinical studies have suggested that this practice does not provide&#xD;
      any benefit but could increase patient discomfort and respiratory complications. Furthermore,&#xD;
      meta-analyses have concluded that routine nasogastric decompression is no longer warranted&#xD;
      after elective abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elective abdominal surgery without nasogastric decompression was initially tested and then&#xD;
      widely used on patients with colorectal surgery.However, after upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      operations such as gastrectomy, nasogastric has been considered necessary to prevent the&#xD;
      consequences of postoperative ileus (anastomotic leakage or leaking from the duodenal stump.&#xD;
      Therefore, studies of gastrectomy without nasogastric tube emerged later than those of&#xD;
      colectomy. In spite more and more studies reported of no need of nasogastric tube after&#xD;
      abdominal operation, no papers reported after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Postulated causes of&#xD;
      lack in studies to assess the need of a nasogastric tube after pancreaticoduodenectomy&#xD;
      include anticipated prolonged postoperative paralytic ileus caused by PD-related extensive&#xD;
      destruction and potential risk of gastric stasis after PD. However, our pilot study of&#xD;
      retrospective analysis of postoperative NG drainage amount in 100 patients recently having PD&#xD;
      at our hospital showed more than 90% of patients had less than 200cc/day NG drainage amount&#xD;
      within postoperative day three. Theoretically, these patients might not need a nasogastric&#xD;
      tube after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Therefore, investigators propose a prospective&#xD;
      multicenter randomized trial to assess the need of a nasogastric tube after PD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be started only after approval of Ethics Committee of National Taiwan&#xD;
      University Hospital and consent sheet will be obtained from all included patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients planned to have PD at national Taiwan University Hospital will be included in this&#xD;
      study after obtaining their consent sheet. Patients with emergency surgery, history of upper&#xD;
      abdominal operation, or other underlying symptoms causing vomiting would be excluded from the&#xD;
      study. PD will be performed as described before, including feeding gastrostomy tube. The type&#xD;
      of surgery (pylorus preserving or standard PD) and the type of management of the pancreatic&#xD;
      stump (duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy, serosal pancreaticojejunostomy, or&#xD;
      pancreaticogastrostomy) will be left to the surgeons' discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be randomized into postoperatively maintaining tube group and non-tube&#xD;
      control group. Patients in the maintaining tube group will have a 14- or 16-French&#xD;
      nasogastric tube inserted before the operation. For patients in both maintaining tube and&#xD;
      non-tube groups, enteral feeding will be routinely went on within 24 h after the operation&#xD;
      and consisted from 480 mL (20 mL/h continuously) of commercially available enteral nutrition&#xD;
      solution, with a calorie-to-milliliter ratio of 1:1 and glucose-to-lipid ratio of 70:30. The&#xD;
      rate of delivery will be progressively increased by 10 mL/day until the goal of full&#xD;
      nutrition (25~30 kcal/kg) will be reached. Enteral nutrition will be reduced and subsequently&#xD;
      stopped when the patient is able to eat a sufficient amount of food without vomiting. In some&#xD;
      patients, feeding rates will be reduced or stopped as a result of significant abdominal&#xD;
      symptoms after advancement to full enteral support via the jejunostomy tube in the first few&#xD;
      postoperative days. At that time, many were beginning oral diets and therefore jejunostomy&#xD;
      feeding was not increased or even withdrawn. Patients who could not resume oral intake will&#xD;
      be encouraged daily to maintain or increase enteral feeding to the level of the nutrition&#xD;
      goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in non-tube group, the tube was removed right after suction off gastric fluid&#xD;
      after extubation weather in operative theater or surgical intensive care unit. After first&#xD;
      flatus passage, the patient will be allowed to drink 300-500 mL of liquids, and afterwards a&#xD;
      soft diet will be given for 2 days. If this well tolerated, increasing amounts of solid food&#xD;
      will be given. The tube will be reinserted if the patient later vomits a volume of more than&#xD;
      300 mL on more than one occasion. Reinserted tubes will be removed if the reflux is less than&#xD;
      200 mL per 24 h, and oral feeding (initially with a liquid diet) will be tried again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in maintaining tube group, the nasogastric tube will be maintained even the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube is removed. After first flatus passage, the patient will be allowed to&#xD;
      drink 300-500 mL of liquids, and afterwards a soft diet will be given for 2 days. The tube&#xD;
      will be clumped if the drainage amount less than 200mL within 24 hours then be removed 1-2&#xD;
      days later if there is no vomitus after tube clumping. If this well tolerated, increasing&#xD;
      amounts of solid food will be given. The tube will be reinserted after removal if the patient&#xD;
      later vomits a volume of more than 300 mL on more than one occasion. Reinserted tubes will be&#xD;
      removed if the reflux is less than 200 mL per 24 h, and oral feeding (initially with a liquid&#xD;
      diet) will be tried again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the surgical staff, not involved in the trial, will record postoperative&#xD;
      complications. The postoperative course of each patient will be closely monitored. The day of&#xD;
      passage of flatus and oral food intake, the duration of nasogastric tube or nasojejunal&#xD;
      decompression, and length of hospital stay will be recorded. Mortality, abdominal&#xD;
      complications, pulmonary complications (pneumonia, atelectasis), postoperative fever, nausea,&#xD;
      and vomiting, tube insertion or reinsertion, and discomfort from the tube (ear pain, nasal&#xD;
      soreness, painful swallowing) will be noted. According to the recommendation by the&#xD;
      International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS), gastroparesis will be defined as the&#xD;
      need for an NGT for &gt;3 days or the need to reinsert the NGT for persistent vomiting after&#xD;
      surgery. The severity of gastroparesis will be classified by the ISGPS definition as grade A:&#xD;
      NGT required for 4-7 days or reinsertion after postoperative day (POD) 3 or inability to&#xD;
      tolerate solid oral intake by POD 7; grade B: NGT required for 8-14 days or inability to&#xD;
      tolerate solid oral intake by POD 14; grade C: NGT required for &gt;14 days or inability to&#xD;
      tolerate solid food by POD 21. Again, according to the International Study Group definition,&#xD;
      postoperative pancreatic fistula will be defined as output via an operatively placed drain&#xD;
      (or a subsequently placed percutaneous drain) of any measurable volume of drain fluid on or&#xD;
      after POD 3, with an amylase content greater than three times the upper normal serum value.&#xD;
      Postoperative bleeding will also be graded using ISGPS definitions. All infectious&#xD;
      complications will be proven by microbiological analysis and positive fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the control and modified groups, all surgical complications will be further&#xD;
      classified by severity using a novel grading system proposed by Dindo et al. In brief, grade&#xD;
      I and II complications include only minor deteriorations from the normal postoperative course&#xD;
      that can be treated with drugs, blood transfusion, physiotherapy, and nutritional supply.&#xD;
      Grade III complications require interventional treatment. Grade IV complications are&#xD;
      life-threatening and require intensive care unit management. Death is the only grade V&#xD;
      complication. Grade I and II complications will be classified as minor and grades III, IV,&#xD;
      and V will be classified as major.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for comparison will be the difference in postoperative course&#xD;
      determined by continuous variables (time to first passage of flatus, first oral intake,&#xD;
      duration of postoperative perfusions, and hospital stay after operation).&#xD;
