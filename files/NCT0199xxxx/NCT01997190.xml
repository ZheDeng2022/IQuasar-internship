  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of intrapleural AdV-tk therapy in patients with malignant pleural&#xD;
      effusion (MPE). The primary objective is to test the safety of intrapleural AdV-tk therapy.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate clinical efficacy and biologic activity&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this open-label, dose escalation clinical trial is to investigate if the&#xD;
      administration of AdV-tk to patients with MPE followed by valacyclovir and chemotherapy is&#xD;
      safe, can be effectively delivered without disturbing standard therapy, and will have&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity in patients with solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first and second dose levels have been completed, and the study is currently expanded to&#xD;
      enroll more patients to dose level 2 with Celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive one injection of AdV-tk through a pleural catheter on day 0. The&#xD;
      prodrug, valacyclovir, will be administered orally at a fixed dose for 14 days after each&#xD;
      AdV-tk injection. Celecoxib will be administered starting 3 days before AdV-tk and continuing&#xD;
      for 2 days after AdV-tk administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy may begin at any time after completion of valacyclovir. Choice of chemotherapy&#xD;
      depends on the treating oncologist.&#xD;

    <description>The primary study endpoint for the phase I portion is safety based on standard laboratory and clinical adverse event monitoring. Safety profile will be characterized by collection of adverse event information and laboratory values during the treatment phase. Acute toxicity data will be collected at each follow up visit every 2-3 weeks until week 8. The long term effects will be evaluated at follow up visits very 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for the second year. After 2 years, clinical assessment of late toxicity and disease status will be conducted yearly through year 5 after which long-term follow up of general health status will continue yearly through at least 10 years.</description>

             include NSCLC, small cell lung cancer, malignant mesothelioma (MM), breast cancer and&#xD;
             ovarian cancer. Diagnosis must be made prior to AdV-tk injection. For patients with&#xD;
             MM, histologic proof is needed, but positive pleural fluid cytology is not required.&#xD;
