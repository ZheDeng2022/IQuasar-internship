  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, phase 1b study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      DNIB0600A in participants with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC) or Non-Squamous&#xD;
      Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The maximum tolerated dose of intravenously infused&#xD;
      DNIB0600A in combination with carboplatin will be determined in escalating dose cohorts. The&#xD;
      combination of DNIB0600A and carboplatin will then be evaluated with and without bevacizumab&#xD;
      [Avastin] in three dose expansion cohorts.&#xD;
