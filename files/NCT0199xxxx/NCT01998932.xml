  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic venous ulceration of the lower limb poses a significant problem to patients and&#xD;
      healthcare providers alike. 1% of the population of Western countries have either an open or&#xD;
      healed chronic venous ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the pathophysiological abnormalities are not entirely clear in how raised venous&#xD;
      pressure translates into the changes seen in the skin culminating in an open ulcer. The&#xD;
      standard treatment of this condition in the United Kingdom is to undertaken compression&#xD;
      bandaging of the lower limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to further their knowledge of venous ulceration, the investigators seek to determine&#xD;
      the biological profile of venous ulcers over a maximum of twenty-eight weeks and by dividing&#xD;
      the groups into healing and non-healing wounds, the investigators may be able to demonstrate&#xD;
      a difference in the biological profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work may provide insights into predicting who will respond to treatment and targets for&#xD;
      treatment in the future.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Forty patients with chronic venous ulceration of the lower limb who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be entered into the study and assessed over a twenty week period with&#xD;
      assessments at week 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 20. Urine, serum and ulcer fluid will be sampled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the ulcer has not healed, further assessments using an approved biological dressing will&#xD;
      be undertaken at weeks 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 and 28 with further sampling of ulcer fluid, urine&#xD;
      and serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will undergo metabolic profiling using established metabonomic techniques developed&#xD;
      at Imperial College.&#xD;
