      This study is in two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 purpose is to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of multiple TAB08 doses in&#xD;
      patients with active Rheumatoid Arthritis in which methotrexate (MTX) treatment is not enough&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 purpose is to assess efficacy parameters (ACR criteria) of at least one selected&#xD;
      TAB08 dose in extended patient population with active Rheumatoid Arthritis in which&#xD;
      methotrexate (MTX) treatment with at least 10 mg/week is not enough effective.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage 1 is designed as standard phase 1 study with one arm and sequential dose cohorts with&#xD;
      ascending doses. Each patient in each dose cohort will be administered TAB08 several times.&#xD;
      After last TAB08 administration each patient will undergo investigational-treatment-free&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Stage 2 at least one TAB08 dose, selected during Stage 1 will be studied during longer&#xD;
      timeframe in extended patient population.&#xD;
