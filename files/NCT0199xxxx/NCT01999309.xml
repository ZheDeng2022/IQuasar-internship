      Rationale: There is ample evidence that inflammatory processes play a role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Although Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
      have been shown to be able to reduce symptoms in these patients, these drugs either have&#xD;
      unfavourable cardiovascular side effects or are otherwise not well tolerated. Moreover,&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia already tend to have an increased cardiovascular risk. The&#xD;
      combination of well-established vascular protection and reduction of inflammation by&#xD;
      simvastatin offers a highly attractive potential to further improve the treatment of&#xD;
      schizophrenia and related disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Daily treatment with 40mg simvastatin in addition to antipsychotic treatment&#xD;
      reduces psychotic symptoms, improves cognition, attenuates brain volume loss, and decreases&#xD;
      the risk for metabolic syndrome as well as for movement disorders, when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the proposed beneficial&#xD;
      effect of simvastatin as compared to placebo when given for one year in addition to&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication to patients with psychotic disorder. We expect lower symptom&#xD;
      severity as measured with the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) and less cognitive&#xD;
      decline as measured with the BACS (Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia).Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are assessment of general functioning, presence and severity of metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      and degree of movement disorders, and assessments of brain volume. Lastly, we examine various&#xD;
      immunological parameters in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the experience&#xD;
      of childhood trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 150 men and women, between 18 and 50 years of age, diagnosed with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder (DSM-IV 295.*) or psychosis NOS&#xD;
      (not otherwise specified) (298.9). Onset of first psychosis no longer than 3 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either 40 mg simvastatin or placebo daily,&#xD;
      in the form of identical tablets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Different lines of evidence now suggest that low grade inflammation in the central&#xD;
      nervous system is involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. These include the altered&#xD;
      risk of schizophrenia patients and their relatives for specific auto-immune diseases,&#xD;
      clinical similarities between the course of schizophrenia and auto-immune disease and&#xD;
      decreased prevalence of schizophrenia in men who have used Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory&#xD;
      Drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticosteroids for somatic disorders. Furthermore, an infectious&#xD;
      cause or trigger is suggested by the observed association between schizophrenia and pre- and&#xD;
      perinatal infections, as well as by seroconversion to certain pathogens in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. On a cellular level, inflammation of the central nervous system is suggested&#xD;
      by an increased number of activated microglia cells in the brains of patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia as visualized by positron electron tomography. In an activated state, microglia&#xD;
      cells can produce free radicals, pro-inflammatory components and other neurotoxic substances,&#xD;
      causing cell death in their proximity. The activation of microglia cells provides a possible&#xD;
      route by which an increased pro-inflammatory state in the brain could cause increased gray&#xD;
      matter loss and more severe negative and cognitive symptoms. Although Non-Steroidal&#xD;
      Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be able to reduce symptoms in these&#xD;
      patients, these drugs either have unfavourable cardiovascular side effects or are otherwise&#xD;
      not well tolerated. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia already tend to have an increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk. The combination of well-established vascular protection and reduction of&#xD;
      inflammation by simvastatin offers a highly attractive potential to further improve the&#xD;
      treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Daily treatment with 40mg simvastatin in addition to antipsychotic treatment&#xD;
      reduces psychotic symptoms, improves cognition, attenuates brain volume loss, and decreases&#xD;
      the risk for metabolic syndrome as well as for movement disorders, when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the proposed beneficial&#xD;
      effect of simvastatin as compared to placebo when given for one year in addition to&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication to patients with psychotic disorder. We expect lower symptom&#xD;
      severity as measured with the Positive And Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and less cognitive&#xD;
      decline as measured with the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS).Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are assessment of general functioning using the General Assessment of Functioning&#xD;
      (GAF), presence and severity of metabolic syndrome, as defined by the American Heart&#xD;
      Association/National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLB), presence and severity of&#xD;
      movement disorders using validated scales, and assessments of brain volume through magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI). Lastly, we examine various immunological parameters in serum and&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the experience of childhood trauma using the Childhood&#xD;
      Trauma Questionnaire Short Form (CTQ-SF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 150 men and women, between 18 and 50 years of age, diagnosed with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder (DSM-IV 295.*) or psychosis NOS&#xD;
      (not otherwise specified) (298.9). Duration of disease should be no more than three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either 40 mg simvastatin or placebo daily,&#xD;
      in the form of identical tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome is change in total symptom severity (PANSS&#xD;
      score) from baseline to end of treatment. Secondary outcomes will be the changes in GAF&#xD;
      scores, cognitive functioning, presence and severity of metabolic syndrome and movement&#xD;
      disorders and assessment of brain volume change, in addition to the measurement of various&#xD;
      immunological biomarkers, childhood trauma. and depression symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Use of simvastatin implies that there is a risk of side effects, as all&#xD;
      lipid-lowering drugs carry the risk of negative effects. The number of patient visits will be&#xD;
      limited and mainly requires time investment for a few physical examinations, questionnaires&#xD;
      and two cognitive testing sessions (around 10 hours per year in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn at four occasions with negligible and known risks (e.g. irritation). The&#xD;
      burden and risks are acceptable while the benefits are expected to be considerable.&#xD;

&#xD;
        For patients, the MRI scan requires addition exclusion criteria to be eligible to&#xD;
        participate in this part of the study (if these additional criteria are not met, patients&#xD;
        can participate in the study but not in the MRI component):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ferrous objects in or around the body (e.g. braces, glasses, pacemaker, metal&#xD;
