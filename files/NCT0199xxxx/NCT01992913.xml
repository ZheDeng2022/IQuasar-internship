  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia/Schizoaffective Disorder is associated with serious problems with cognitive&#xD;
      skills, social skills, and functional skills (like employment). There is a new form of&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy called integrated cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) that&#xD;
      specifically addresses the cognitive, social, and functional deficits of&#xD;
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder. This study compared iCBT to the usual care (UC) that&#xD;
      Veteran's receive. The investigators compared iCBT to UC in subjects with&#xD;
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder who are enrolled in a Supported Employment (SE)&#xD;
      program, and evaluate whether iCBT is more helpful in improving job performance, and other&#xD;
      areas of functioning, both right after treatment, and 6 months after the end of treatment.&#xD;

      The objective of the current study was to evaluate whether integrated cognitive behavior&#xD;
      therapy (iCBT) can improve engagement and success in an existing Supported Employment (SE)&#xD;
      program among the most functionally disabled patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective&#xD;
      disorder. The iCBT condition also included computerized cognitive remediation. The primary&#xD;
      specific aim was to determine whether iCBT will significantly improve work outcomes at&#xD;
      post-treatment to a greater extent than Usual Care (UC) in low functioning patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder who join the SE program. The secondary aims were to&#xD;
      evaluate the whether iCBT will significantly improve work outcomes at 6 month follow-up&#xD;
      relative to UC, and whether iCBT will improve functional outcomes post-treatment and at&#xD;
      follow-up relative to UC in subjects who join the SE program.&#xD;

The SLOF is a self-report behavioral rating scale used to assess mentally ill patients' level of functioning in the community and in mental hospitals. The 30-item scale emphasizes patients' everyday behaviors rather than emotional or mental capacity, and it focuses on patients' tangible strengths and skills rather than on patients' weaknesses.</description>
