      Non-contact meibography is a useful tool in assessing the health of meibomian glands in&#xD;
      patients. Instead of using normal light in contact meibography, non-contact meibography&#xD;
      utilises infra-red (IR) light. IR light is shined on patients' inverted eyelids and a special&#xD;
      camera then allows visualisation of the structure of the meibomian glands, including the&#xD;
      ducts and acini. Currently, images taken via non-contact meibography are manually analysed by&#xD;
      a skilled clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of the health of meibomian glands is useful, especially in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD). Studies have shown that MGD is one of the most common&#xD;
      causes of evaporative dry eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediview 2.0 is a software that has been programmed to semi-automatically classify meibograph&#xD;
      images taken via non-contact meibography. This software is collaboration with Shanghai&#xD;
      MediWorks Precision Instruments Co., Ltd. The algorithm used was developed by a collaboration&#xD;
      between Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and Singapore Eye Research&#xD;
      Institute (SERI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study aims to validate the diagnostic accuracy of Mediview 2.0 in assessing the&#xD;
      health of meibomian glands of patients, against a trained clinician. We aim to recruit 100&#xD;
      participants for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once this software is found to be valid, a trained technician could be taught how to capture&#xD;
      the images and hence leaving the doctors with more time to focus on clinical assessment and&#xD;
      treatment instead. Therefore, this study has the potential to increase efficiency in the&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a chronic abnormality of the meibomian glands and&#xD;
      commonly characterized by terminal meibomian duct obstruction and/or qualitative or&#xD;
      quantitative changes in the glandular secretion. This may result in alteration of the&#xD;
      composition and functioning of the tear film lipid layer, and subsequently destabilisation of&#xD;
      the tear film. Studies have shown that MGD is one of the most common causes of evaporative&#xD;
      dry eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recommended that the diagnosis of MGD be made by assessing ocular symptoms, lid&#xD;
      morphology, mebomian gland mass, gland expressibility, lipid layer thickness and meibography.&#xD;
      In meibography, the structure of the meibomian glands, including the ducts and acini can be&#xD;
      observed. Photographic documentation of the meibomian gland is also possible under&#xD;
      specialised illumination techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two types of meibography currently in use- contact meibography and non-contact&#xD;
      meibography. Non-contact meibography is advantageous over contact meibography as it is more&#xD;
      comfortable for patients. In non-contact meibography, the slit-lamp microscope is equipped&#xD;
      with an IR charge-coupled (CCD) device video camera and an IR transmitting filter. During the&#xD;
      procedure, IR light is projected onto the inverted eyelid of the subject and the image of the&#xD;
      eyelid captured by a camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, skilled clinicians analyse images obtained via non-contact meibography manually to&#xD;
      determine the health of the patient's eyelid. Through a collaborative project between&#xD;
      scientists from bioinformatics institute, A*STAR, Singapore (Dr Lee Hwee Kuan) and SERI,&#xD;
      semi-automatic algorithms for classifying meibographs into healthy and unhealthy have been&#xD;
      previously developed. The commercial partner for this project, Mediworks, China, has&#xD;
      incorporated these algorithms into the Mediview 2.0 software. This software consists of&#xD;
      modules for acquiring meibography images as well as for analysing these images. Provided a&#xD;
      user draws the outline of the tarsal plate on the captured image, the software is able to&#xD;
      classify images into two categories- Healthy and Unhealthy without the aid of a skilled&#xD;
      clinician. A trained technician could be taught how to capture the images and hence leaving&#xD;
      the doctor with more time to focus on clinical assessment and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the accuracy and reproducibility of this software should be validated against a&#xD;
      clinical assessor just as in the original algorithms. We propose to recruit 50 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and 50 patients from SNEC clinics and from public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical importance Should this modality of imaging be shown to be repeatable, it can be&#xD;
      incorporated into current protocol/workflow for assessment and monitoring of Meibomian Gland&#xD;
      Dysfunction and treatment progress in our centre. The images captured in this project can&#xD;
      also be used for validating further updates of the Mediworks software, since the hardware&#xD;
      will remain unchanged in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Purpose The primary purpose is to validate Mediview 2.0 software as an&#xD;
      objective tool in assessing the health of meibomian glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims include assessing a., the accuracy of Mediview 2.0 in classifying&#xD;
      meibograph images (into Healthy and Unhealthy categories) and b., reproducibility of the&#xD;
      classifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediview 2.0 is a newly developed software and has yet been validated as a tool for&#xD;
      assessment of the health of meibomian glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and target sample size 50 healthy volunteers and 50 patients aged 21 to 99 years&#xD;
      will be recruited for this study. They are outpatients and accompanying relatives from the&#xD;
      Singapore National Eye Centre. Permission would be sought from the attending doctors before&#xD;
      subjects are being recruited. Informed written consent will be obtained from all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit schedules One visit is required for participants. In general, they will not have to&#xD;
      come for additional visits if they are recruited whilst on a scheduled clinical appointment&#xD;
      for other reasons. In exceptional cases, if the meibography cannot be performed on the same&#xD;
      day, participants would be given the option of coming on another suitable day for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Imaging of Meibomian Gland During the imaging of each eye, participants will be required&#xD;
           to place their chins on a chin rest on the slit-lamp microscope. The upper eyelids of&#xD;
           the participant will be in turn everted and an image of meibomian glands present on the&#xD;
           eyelid will be captured. This is also performed for the lower eyelids. This is a&#xD;
           non-invasive technique and the camera and IR lamp will not touch the patient. During&#xD;
           each eversion of eyelid, optometrist will acquire 3 images at one time. Thereafter,&#xD;
           Mediview 2.0 software will proceed to analyse the image into healthy and unhealthy&#xD;
           glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Throughout all measurements, all parameters of the meibographer, (such as light&#xD;
           intensity, magnification of eyelid) will be kept constant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis of Image of Meibomian Gland The images taken above will be exported and&#xD;
           assessed by another optometrist who is unaware of the classification of the image by&#xD;
           Mediview. This assessor will classify the images into healthy and unhealthy. Results&#xD;
           between the Mediview 2.0 software and the optometrist will be assessed. Should there be&#xD;
           any disagreement on the results, a 3rd clinician will be involved in the validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison between software classification and human classification Cohen's kappa&#xD;
           coefficient will be calculated to assess the agreement between these two ratings. For&#xD;
           interpretation of the calculated statistic, we use recommendations from Landis and Koch,&#xD;
           who characterized values &lt; 0 as indicating no agreement and 0-0.20 as slight, 0.21-0.40&#xD;
           as fair, 0.41-0.60 as moderate, 0.61-0.80 as substantial, and 0.81-1 as almost perfect&#xD;
           agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison between the first and second software classifications Similarly we will use&#xD;
           the kappa coefficient to evaluate the agreements between the first and second&#xD;
           classifications made by the software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classification of meibograph images from Mediview 2.0 should show good agreement with the&#xD;
      assessment by the skilled clinician. Similarly classifications of the meibographs taken on&#xD;
      the same day for the same eyes should show good agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential problems No potential problems are expected for this study.&#xD;
