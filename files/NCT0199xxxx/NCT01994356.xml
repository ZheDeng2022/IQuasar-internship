  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As many as one-third of female healthcare providers use intrauterine contraception (IUC), but&#xD;
      only about 8 percent of US women overall do. This begs the question: Might physician&#xD;
      self-disclosure of personal IUC use increase IUC use among patients? However, the positive or&#xD;
      negative impact of physician self disclosure on IUC uptake or patient satisfaction is&#xD;
      generally unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if physician self-disclosure of&#xD;
      personal IUC use increases patient use of IUC or impacts patients' satisfaction with their&#xD;
      clinical encounter.&#xD;
