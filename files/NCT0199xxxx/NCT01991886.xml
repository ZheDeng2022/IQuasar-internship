    <textblock>
      Recent large studies have shown that not all premature babies need to be intubated (have a&#xD;
      breathing tube inserted) and ventilated, nor do they all need to be given lung surfactant&#xD;
      routinely. Those studies showed that even very small babies can be safely supported using&#xD;
      nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (nCPAP) which is applied tightly to the nose using&#xD;
      nasal prongs. This is a type of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) so that the babies continue to&#xD;
      breath, albeit with additional support to reduce their work of breathing. However nCPAP has&#xD;
      some drawbacks, including that it can cause skin damage to the nose, and that the heating and&#xD;
      humidification of the gas is not always sufficient. We have been using, for over 5 years, a&#xD;
      different system to support babies after routine intubation. This is another type of&#xD;
      noninvasive ventilation called nasal High Flow (nHF) for which we use a Vapotherm Precision&#xD;
      Flow device. Published trials show that it is at least as effective as nCPAP to provide NIV&#xD;
      and to prevent the subsequent need for intubation and/or surfactant. However nHF is superior&#xD;
      to nCPAP in respect it does not cause nose damage and its heating and humidification is&#xD;
      excellent. This pilot study aims to describe and evaluate the use of nHF, using a standard&#xD;
      commercially available system (Precision Flow, Vapotherm Inc.), from birth, in babies born&#xD;
      less than 30 completed weeks gestation, with a view to avoiding intubation and ventilation.&#xD;
      This study is important to establish the feasibility of using nHF immediately after birth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to pilot the use of this mobile nHF unit, using the Vapotherm Precision Flow&#xD;
      device, in the premature population of babies who would normally be either intubated and&#xD;
      given surfactant routinely, or be maintained on nCPAP until arrival on the Neonatal Intensive&#xD;
      Care Unit (NICU) then transferred onto nHF. Parents will be informed about the pilot and&#xD;
      their permission will be sought. We aim to recruit 40 babies less than 30 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason for undertaking a pilot study of this nature is to establish feasibility and proof&#xD;
      of concept. It is not designed to be compared to using nCPAP to stabilise babies immediately&#xD;
      after birth (although that will be the next and logical progression if this proves to be a&#xD;
      feasible technique).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that using nHF to stabilise babies immediately after birth will confer the&#xD;
      same advantages as using nCPAP to stabilise babies in this way, which has been demonstrated&#xD;
      in the worldwide literature. For units such as ours who use nHF in preference to nCPAP, this&#xD;
      will be an important step in further defining the management of these babies after birth.&#xD;
      There is evidence that nHF is at least as good as nCPAP in preventing intubation and reducing&#xD;
      lung disease, and it may also offer additional advantages from humidification and reduction&#xD;
      in nasal trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major challenge for this pilot project will be to identify eligible deliveries in a&#xD;
      timely manner to ensure that a suitable member of staff is available to speak to parents and&#xD;
      gain consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a delivery has been identified and the parents have agreed to take part, then the&#xD;
      following process will take place to manage the newborn baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Check the mobile nHF unit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mobile nHF unit should be kept plugged in so that the uninterruptable power supply&#xD;
           (UPS) is fully charged&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To use it, unplug it to check that the UPS is functioning (green lights indicate full&#xD;
           charge), set up a Vapotherm circuit(as per normal routine) and start the machine running&#xD;
           on UPS power supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gas supply should be from the cylinders to check that the pressures are 50bar in both&#xD;
           air and oxygen cylinders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Set the temperature to 37 degrees Celsius&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once running, turn the unit off if not immediately needed or plug into the mains power&#xD;
           and gas(es) where available to conserve gas. The unit can be run on a flow of 1&#xD;
           litre/minute whilst &quot;ticking over&quot; to conserve cylinder gas if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The prongs should be attached to the circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the baby is born&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Place the baby in a polythene bag (as per normal practice)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ensure the baby is breathing. If not, or the baby is bradycardic, then normal&#xD;
           resuscitation measures should be applied. It will only be appropriate to apply the&#xD;
           mobile nHF if the baby is breathing and is clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the baby is born, increase the flow to 6 litres/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the baby is breathing then apply the nHF prongs and observe carefully&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suction should only be applied gently, if needed to remove excessive secretions in the&#xD;
           mouth and throat. Babies on high flow will often &quot;blow bubbles&quot; and there may be lung&#xD;
           fluid in the throat, but suction should not be vigorous&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apply a saturation monitor (as per normal practice) to check Heart Rate (HR) and Oxygen&#xD;
           Saturation (SaO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dry the baby's face sufficiently to be able to apply duoderm dressing to stick down the&#xD;
           prongs to the cheeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe the baby carefully, ensure attention to thermal care and inform the parents&#xD;
           about progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As soon as the baby appears stable, move to NICU as per normal practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfer to NICU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two people are needed to effect the transfer from labour ward/theatre to NICU, one to&#xD;
           move the mobile nHF and one to move the resuscitaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On arrival in NICU, plug the mobile nHF into gas and power supplies (switch the manifold&#xD;
           over)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ensure that there is a second, cotside Vapotherm (empty) unit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leave the baby in the resuscitaire and check the admission temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stop the mobile nHF, remove the cartridge and place it into the cotside Vapotherm unit.&#xD;
           Start it running, it should run straight away. Ensure that the correct temperature, flow&#xD;
           and Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) are set&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This process takes less than 20 seconds and as the baby is breathing will not be&#xD;
           detrimental&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transfer the baby into the incubator and commence normal admission practices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document the resuscitation clearly in the baby's notes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cleaning and charging the mobile nHF&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Remove the mobile nHF, clean the Vapotherm Precision flow nHF unit. Ensure the cylinders&#xD;
      are switched off and plug into the wall to recharge the UPS.&#xD;
