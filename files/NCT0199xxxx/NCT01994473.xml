      This is a study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of SEP-363856 and its&#xD;
      metabolite SEP-363854 in male and female subjects with schizophrenia.&#xD;

      This multicenter study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part 1 and 2). Part 1 of the study is a&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled portion, ascending multiple oral&#xD;
      dose study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of ascending multiple oral&#xD;
      doses of SEP-363856 and its metabolite SEP-363854 in male and female subjects with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Part 1 This study will determine the MTD for once-daily multiple oral&#xD;
      administration of SEP-363856, and characterize the plasma and urine PK profiles of SEP-363856&#xD;
      and its metabolite SEP-363854 in male and female subjects with schizophrenia. The effect of&#xD;
      SEP-363856 on the PANSS, CGI-S, and CDSS scales will also be assessed. For each of the&#xD;
      dose-escalation cohorts, 12 subjects (9 active subjects and 3 placebo subjects) will be dosed&#xD;
      for 7 consecutive days with serial collection of PK blood samples after the first and last&#xD;
      doses, and daily collection of trough PK blood samples. An attempt will be made to have at&#xD;
      least one-third of subjects in each cohort be female. Part 2 of the study is an open-label&#xD;
      safety and tolerability study designed to gain longer-term safety and tolerability data for&#xD;
      75 mg SEP-363856 given once-daily for 28 days in male and female subjects with schizophrenia.&#xD;
      The effect of SEP-363856 on the PANSS, CGI-S, and CDSS scales will also be assessed. In Part&#xD;
      2, 16 subjects will be dosed.&#xD;
