  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most commonly malignant tumors around the world&#xD;
      and causes death of about 600000~1000000 people each year. Since 1990s, hepatic carcinoma has&#xD;
      become the second carcinoma killer in China. Surgical resection or liver transplantation is&#xD;
      the only method possibly able to cure hepatic carcinoma. However, due to multiple tumors or&#xD;
      poor hepatic function reserve in cirrhosis, surgical treatment is suitable for only a small&#xD;
      portion of patients (11.9%-30.1%). Therefore, in clinical practice, transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterial embolization (TAE) is a preferential and standard&#xD;
      treatment of unresectable advanced hepatic carcinoma and has notable advantages in&#xD;
      controlling local tumors of the liver. Hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin after TACE&#xD;
      can significantly increase the local doses of chemotherapeutic agents in the liver, kill&#xD;
      micrometastases and residual foci after embolization and demonstrate outstanding efficacy for&#xD;
      treating concomitant portal and hepatic vein tumor thrombi. S-1 is a chemotherapeutic agent&#xD;
      with convenient use and definite efficacy and, when used concomitantly with TACE,&#xD;
      theoretically can not only effectively control intrahepatic foci but also prevent and control&#xD;
      extrahepatic metastatic foci. However, this hasn't been verified in clinical application.&#xD;
      This study is intended to investigate efficacy and safety of the combination treatment so as&#xD;
      to provide a more effective and safety way for treating patients with advanced hepatic&#xD;
      carcinoma (Barcelona stage-C patients with concomitant portal vein tumor thrombi or&#xD;
      extrahepatic metastasis).&#xD;
