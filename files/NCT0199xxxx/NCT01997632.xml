  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if the study vaccine, m-IPV2 HD (vaccine that&#xD;
      only contains polio serotype 2 in high dose), is as safe as the standard IPV Imovax (that&#xD;
      contains the 3 serotypes of polio). This safety evaluation will be done in young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study vaccine appears to be safe, it will be tested at a later stage in the target&#xD;
      group (infants and children) to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine. After all, the&#xD;
      purpose is to use the study vaccine in the future to protect young children against Polio&#xD;
      serotype 2. Disease with Polio type 2 indeed recently re-appeared, so vaccination of young&#xD;
      children to come to a complete eradication of Polio is needed. The standard use of Imovax to&#xD;
      protect against Polio serotype 2 would be too expensive. Therefore, a monovalent Polio&#xD;
      vaccine containing only serotype 2 (= the vaccine that will be evaluated in this study), has&#xD;
      been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study will be approximately 6 months. 120 subjects between 18 and 45&#xD;
      years of age will participate in Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study there will be 2 groups of subjects. Subjects will be assigned by chance to&#xD;
      one of these groups. One group will receive one single injection of the study vaccine m-IPV2&#xD;
      HD (which contains only serotype 2), the other group will receive one single injection of the&#xD;
      standard polio vaccine IPV, Imovax (which contains the 3 serotypes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this vaccination, there will be a follow-up period of 6 months. Subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to come to the study centre one more time for the second visit (on Day 8, which is 7 days&#xD;
      after the first visit). They will also receive 2 follow-up phone calls for approximately one&#xD;
      month and 6 months after vaccination.&#xD;
