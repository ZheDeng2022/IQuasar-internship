      Background: Reducing postoperative complications remains a dominant challenge for all&#xD;
      clinicians. By minimizing the incidence of adverse outcomes, health care costs and patient&#xD;
      recovery can be improved. A number of studies have documented that fewer postoperative&#xD;
      adverse events occur with the preoperative use of glucocorticoids (GC). Two small manuscripts&#xD;
      support the use of GC with particular reference to liver resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major hepatectomy can be associated with numerous adverse outcomes (hemorrhage, bile leak,&#xD;
      liver failure, wound infection other infectious complications). This rate approaches 54% in&#xD;
      some trials. Additionally, the liver is responsible for numerous metabolic functions and&#xD;
      actively participates in the acute phase response via the generation of inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators and cytokines. Glucocorticoids play an important role in suppressing the&#xD;
      over-synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and therefore may assist in reducing&#xD;
      postoperative complications. These pro-inflammatory cytokines recruit leukocytes at the site&#xD;
      of injury, leading to hepatic parenchymal cell damage. Decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      ratio may therefore reduce hepatic damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will complete a randomized controlled trial evaluating the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative complications and overall hospital length of stay in adult&#xD;
      patients following preoperative vs. no administration of 500 mg of methylprednisolone (MP)&#xD;
      within 30 minutes of starting a hepatectomy. This trial will employ block randomization and&#xD;
      intention to treat protocols. Four HPB surgeons at University of Calgary will participate in&#xD;
      the trial with a planned inclusion of all patients scheduled to undergo hepatectomy in a&#xD;
      period of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Standard statistical analysis will include normally or near-normally distributed&#xD;
      variables reported as means and non-normally distributed variables as medians. Means will be&#xD;
      compared using the student's t test and medians using the Mann-Whitney U test. Differences in&#xD;
      proportions among categorical data will be assessed using Fischer's exact test. A p value &lt;&#xD;
      0.05 will represent statistical significance for all comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Preoperative GC administration will decrease the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      complications and overall hospital length of stay following hepatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact: Health care utilization and economics are an expanding area of importance.&#xD;
      Reducing post-hepatectomy complications are crucial to this end.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major hepatectomy lead to significant postoperative anatomical and physiological changes. The&#xD;
      liver dictates the systemic metabolic environment and helps maintain homeostasis. When&#xD;
      segments of liver are removed, it is challenged to regenerate and restore cellular volume, as&#xD;
      well as continuing to perform mandated metabolic functions. Major hepatectomy can result in&#xD;
      multiple complications (hemorrhage, biliary fistulae, wound infection, liver failure) with an&#xD;
      overall complication rate up to 54% in some studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies purport that preoperative administration of GC may suppress the acute phase&#xD;
      response during the early postoperative period. GCs are steroid hormones with a variety of&#xD;
      immunological and biochemical functions (anti-inflammatory attenuation of the acute phase&#xD;
      response by binding to intra-cytoplasmic GC receptors and therefore increased transcription&#xD;
      of anti-inflammatory proteins interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-1-receptor antagonist (IL-Ra),&#xD;
      lipocortin-1 and neutral endopeptidase, or direct inhibition of activated transcription&#xD;
      factors (nuclear factor kB, activator protein-1)). GC can also suppress gene expression by&#xD;
      altering the chromatin structure and tightening DNA coils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acute phase response is a neuro-humoral and time-limited defensive mechanism, which aims&#xD;
      to restore homeostasis. It is characterized by fever, leukocytosis, gluconeogenesis, as well&#xD;
      as changes in lipid, carbohydrate and protein metabolism. Activation of the&#xD;
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, coagulation and compliment pathways is also one of the&#xD;
      salient features of the acute phase response. It is regulated by cytokine receptor&#xD;
      antagonists (IL-1Ra) and soluble cytokine receptors. Cytokines are soluble, low molecular&#xD;
      weight glycoproteins that act as inflammatory mediators and can be broadly divided into pro&#xD;
      and anti-inflammatory cytokines. At low concentrations, they have a paracrine effect, while&#xD;
      in high concentrations they act systemically. These pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-2,&#xD;
      IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha) remain in the plasma for at least 24 hours after&#xD;
      generation. They also attract leukocytes (neutrophils and macrophages) to the site of injury&#xD;
      and are detrimental if produced in large amounts. Oka et al have demonstrated that increasing&#xD;
      levels of IL-6 are directly related to an increased rate of postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In low doses, GC reduce short term mortality, reverse the shock process and improve&#xD;
      hemodynamics in septic shock patients. In a meta-analysis of 17 RCTs, Annane et al found that&#xD;
      28-day mortality for a low-dose dexamethasone (DXA) group, versus control group was 35.3% vs.&#xD;
      38.5%. Shock reversal was also increased in the DXA group (66.9% vs. 58.6%) and the ICU stay&#xD;
      was decreased by 4.49 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative use of GC improves cardiac functions after coronary artery bypass grafting. The&#xD;
      likely underlying mechanism for this cardio-protective effect is reduced release of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha with a concurrent increased release of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 50% to 75% of patients express nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      in the early postoperative period. In a meta-analysis, Karanicolas et al found that the&#xD;
      absolute risk of nausea in low risk patients. Similarly DXA decreases the absolute risk of&#xD;
      vomiting from 12% to 5% in low risk and 30% to 12% in high risk groups as compared to&#xD;
      placebo. Although the quality of evidence is low regarding postoperative pain in&#xD;
      post-cholecystectomy patients, researchers have found less postoperative pain in the DXA&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gomez-Hernandez et al also suggested that a preoperative single dose of DXA decreased&#xD;
      postoperative nausea, vomiting and pain in patients undergoing mastectomy (28.6% vs. 60% in&#xD;
      the early postoperative period). The patients in placebo group required more anti-emetic&#xD;
      medications. DXA reduced postoperative pain significantly and fewer patients requested&#xD;
      analgesia (10 vs. 21). Additionally there was no increase in adverse events, morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in the steroid group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative use of DXA significantly improves postoperative pain, nausea, vomiting and vocal&#xD;
      function within the first 48 hours after thyroid surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subclinical renal dysfunction is frequently noted following liver transplantation. This&#xD;
      occurs mainly due to hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. Turner et al suggested that GC&#xD;
      decrease the incidence of renal tubular dysfunction when given at the time of induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. The main difference in serum creatinine level was noted on postoperative day 3&#xD;
      (164.8 mumol/L in the saline group vs. 88.5 mumol/L in the MP group). Additionally, patients&#xD;
      in the saline group suffered from more complications (47% vs. 12%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have suggested that GC limit the peritoneal inflammatory response and therefore help&#xD;
      in recovery and fatigue in the early postoperative period. Low levels of IL-6 and IL-13 were&#xD;
      found in the peritoneal fluid of patients receiving GC on postoperative day 1. Schulze et al&#xD;
      observed improved pulmonary function and early mobilization in a MP group, as compared to&#xD;
      placebo, in colon surgery patients. Furthermore, they noted a significant decrease in IL-6, C&#xD;
      reactive protein and pain scores. The appetite was increased significantly in patients on GC,&#xD;
      however there was no difference in wound healing and other infectious complications&#xD;
      (including anastomotic leaks). In colorectal surgery, GC do not appear to increase&#xD;
      postoperative complications. A double blind, randomized clinical trial consisting of 30&#xD;
      patients undergoing colonic surgery, showed that there was no significant difference in&#xD;
      postoperative IL-6, C reactive protein, pain scores, bowel functions, mobilization, hospital&#xD;
      length of stay, complications and readmission rates between the two groups when a single 8 mg&#xD;
      preoperative dose of DXA was given to the interventional group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 moderate quality RCTs suggested decreased&#xD;
      postoperative complications and hospital length of stay of patients undergoing major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery following preoperative use of GC. In the case of liver resection surgery,&#xD;
      Aldrighetti et al found decreased serum ALT, AST, total bilirubin, IL-6, TNF-alpha, hospital&#xD;
      length of stay and postoperative complications following a single preoperative GC dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dominant clinical rationale for not using preoperative steroids is to avoid related side&#xD;
      effects. A substantial number of studies have documented fewer adverse events in MP groups as&#xD;
      compared to placebo, suggesting there is a need to reconsider the steroid-free protocol in&#xD;
      the preoperative period. Further appropriately designed and well-powered studies are urgently&#xD;
      needed to evaluate the effects of preoperative GC use. As a result, we have planned a&#xD;
      prospective RCT at the University of Calgary to determine the role of GC in reducing&#xD;
      postoperative complications and hospital length of stay for patients undergoing partial&#xD;
      hepatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;

      from the offices of the four participating surgeons. Patients will be contacted prior to&#xD;
      surgery by the research staff and will be provided information regarding the study. Patients&#xD;
      who consent to participate will be randomized (the clinic at the time of consent completion&#xD;
      and operative scheduling).&#xD;
&#xD;

           arrhythmias, metastatic cancer, AIDS, obesity, alcohol abuse,psychosis, anemias etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucocorticoids - methylprednisolone given, dose, route of administration and time&#xD;
           before starting surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also track IL-6 and C-Reactive protein (CRP) levels on postoperative&#xD;
      day 1 (with daily blood work) as a marker of global immune function. Definition of&#xD;
      complications can be found in appendix 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation to determine sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The largest surgical trial to date recruited a total of 73 patients. There are 5 small&#xD;
      hepatic resection RCTs available for analysis (all trials utilized MP). The largest of these&#xD;
      studies noted a decrease in overall complications from 54% to 14% with GC use. With a&#xD;
      consistent volume of hepatectomies (100+ per year at FMC), and a planned inclusion/capture&#xD;
      for our group's resections of nearly 100%, we expect to randomize over 100 patients in each&#xD;
      arm in 2 full years. With an alpha = 0.5, probability = 80%, predicted effect size of 0.30&#xD;
      (2-tailed test), the sample size required would be 84 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional comments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylprednisolone (MP) is the best choice of GC because it: (1) has a 5-fold higher&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory action compared to cortisol, (2) has reduced effects on electrolytes, (3)&#xD;
      duration of MP biologic action is 36 hrs (half life = 2.8 hrs) so both phases of&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion injury will be covered, and (4) 500 mg of MP results in a defined and&#xD;
      predictable response of &gt;1 ug/ml in blood and &gt;10 ug/ml in liver tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
