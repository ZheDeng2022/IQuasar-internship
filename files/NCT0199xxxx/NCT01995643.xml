  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to investigate that consumption of grape seed extract (GSE) would&#xD;
      improve antioxidant status and impaired insulin action following consumption of a&#xD;
      pro-oxidative high carbohydrate, high fat (HCHF) meal in healthy human subjects.&#xD;

      This study is a single-center, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 2-arm,&#xD;
      2-sequence, crossover study&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned sample size of 15 will be recruited into the study. This study will require one&#xD;
      initial screening, one pre-study visit, two 6-hour study visits. The study will take 2-5&#xD;
      weeks per subject to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening visit will provide subjects an Institutional Review Board approved&#xD;
      consent document and determine subject eligibility through BMI calculated from height and&#xD;
      weight measurements, vital signs, fasting blood glucose test (finger prick), lipid profiles&#xD;
      (3 ml blood sampling via a butterfly needle device) and completion of a questionnaire related&#xD;
      to general eating, health, and exercise habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects are willing and eligible to participate, a 3-day food record (2 weekdays and 1&#xD;
      weekend day) will be instructed at the initial screening visit and collected at the pre-study&#xD;
      visit to assess subjects' usual dietary intake pattern. After reviewing food records,&#xD;
      subjects will be instructed to avoid any grapes, grape products, berries, berry products&#xD;
      throughout the study and strictly follow a limited polyphenolic diet for 3 days prior to each&#xD;
      6-hr study visit, while maintaining their usual diet pattern and physical activity. Prior to&#xD;
      each study visit, subject will be advised to have the same or similar dinner meal to control&#xD;
      the second meal effect from food and beverage intake of the night before each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will arrive at the center after ~10 hours overnight fasting, well hydrated and&#xD;
      rested. Each study visit will require blood draws throughout the visit. After pre-study&#xD;
      procedures (height, weight, waist circumferences, vital sign, and fasting blood glucose&#xD;
      test), a registered nurse will place a catheter in subject's arm for the purpose of multiple&#xD;
      blood sample collections and collect fasting blood sample. During each study visit, subject&#xD;
      will take one of the two capsules right after fasting blood draw), based on randomization&#xD;
      sequences (either 1 grape seed extract capsule or 1 placebo capsule). One hour after&#xD;
      administration of the assigned capsule, blood samples will be collected. And a standard high&#xD;
      carbohydrate and high fat breakfast meal will be served and subject will have blood draws at&#xD;
      designated time up to 5 hours.&#xD;
