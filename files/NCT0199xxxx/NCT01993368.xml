  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis are inflammatory diseases characterized by the destruction of the&#xD;
      tooth-supporting bone due to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts (OCLs). Two forms are&#xD;
      described: chronic periodontitis (CP) and aggressive periodontitis (AP) that differ by the&#xD;
      severity and rapidity of bone loss, much more important for AP than CP. In both forms, the&#xD;
      link with uncontrolled activation of the immune system is largely admitted. Despite the&#xD;
      physiopathology of CP is fairly well studied, very few data are available regarding AP. The&#xD;
      investigators aim is to understand the severity of AP by analyzing the proportion and action&#xD;
      of immune and mesnchymal cells potentially involved in bone destruction, on biopsies of&#xD;
      periodontal granulation tissue (surgical waste) and blood. Three groups of 20 patients will&#xD;
      be included: affected with AP, CP or controls (necessitating an extraction of wisdom teeth).&#xD;

      Context: Periodontitis are inflammatory diseases affecting the periodontium and characterized&#xD;
      by the destruction of the tooth-supporting bone due to increased bone resorption by&#xD;
      osteoclasts (OCLs). Two forms are described: chronic periodontitis (CP) and aggressive&#xD;
      periodontitis (AP) that differ by the severity and rapidity of bone loss, much more important&#xD;
      for AP than CP. In both forms, the link with uncontrolled activation of the immune system is&#xD;
      largely admitted. But despite the physiopathology of CP is fairly well studied, very few data&#xD;
      are available regarding AP. Based on the investigators previous studies, their hypothesis to&#xD;
      explain this severity is the existence of a vicious circle involving immune cells,&#xD;
      mesenchymal cells and OCLs, that would maintain and amplify inflammation and bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study: this is a transversal, interventional and single-center study. It includes 3 groups of&#xD;
      20 patients: affected with AP, CP or controls (necessitating an extraction of wisdom teeth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: the investigators will compare the proportion of immune and mesenchymal cells in the 3&#xD;
      groups of patients to identify the populations potentially involved in bone destruction. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare in vitro their capacity to induce OCL differentiation in order to&#xD;
      determine their role in bone loss. The investigators will also compare the capacity of OCLs&#xD;
      and mesenchymal cells to activate T cells, in order to determine their role in inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: patients will be recruited in the department of periodontology, CHU of Nice.&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent, a biopsy of periodontal granulation tissue (surgical&#xD;
      waste) will be collected during the usual treatment of these diseases, as well as a blood&#xD;
      sample. Then, patients will leave the study. Cells from the biopsies will be analyzed by flow&#xD;
      cytometry to determine the proportion of lymphocytic, monocytic and mesenchymal cells. In&#xD;
      vitro, their capacity to induce OCL differentiation or to activate T cells will be&#xD;
      determined. From the blood samples, OCLs will be generated to study their capacity to&#xD;
      activate T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronology of consultations and examinations: 3 visits are planned: (1) a routine visit&#xD;
      corresponding to the usual treatment of the patient during which it is proposed to&#xD;
      participate in the study, (2) a visit to obtaining consent, clinical examination, criteria&#xD;
      verification and (3) a visit corresponding to the usual treatment in which will be collected&#xD;
      tissue biopsies and blood.&#xD;
