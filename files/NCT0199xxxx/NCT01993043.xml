  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness. Vascular&#xD;
      endothelium growth factor (VEGF) is an important component of this disease. The goal of&#xD;
      treatment is to reduce the production of VEGF in the immature retina and to eliminate the&#xD;
      abnormal growth of new vessels. Currently, laser photocoagulation of the peripheral avascular&#xD;
      retina is the treatment standard. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF antibody Bevacizumab&#xD;
      (IVB) has been used clinically off-label as an alternative therapy. However, VEGF is&#xD;
      important for the development of neurons and vessels in the systemic organs in premature&#xD;
      infants. Pharmaceutical study showed that IVB was absorbed into the bloodstream. It is&#xD;
      unclear if the systemic absorption of Bevacizumab is dose related, and the short and longterm&#xD;
      effects on ocular and systemic systems, especially neurological development. In this study,&#xD;
      our goals are to establish the pharmacokinetics of Bevacizumab in the premature infant and to&#xD;
      compare the short and long-term vision and neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants treated&#xD;
      with IVB compared to laser ROP.&#xD;

      This study will enroll preterm infants who were scheduled to receive treatment for ROP by&#xD;
      laser or Bevacizumab. We will observe the patients in the hospital for the cure of ROP until&#xD;
      54 weeks' postmenstrual age. We will check the changes of chemicals in the blood and observe&#xD;
      short-term and long-term effects on visual system, brain and other body organs. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics from a two sample t-test or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the short&#xD;
      and long-term vision and neurological development outcomes. We predefined a statistical&#xD;
      significance level p=0.05.&#xD;

    <description>Neurodevelopmental assessments will be performed by board-certified, developmental-behavioral pediatric and neurodevelopmental disability pediatricians. Each neurodevelopmental assessment includes a developmental history, direct behavioral observations, and direct developmental testing using the Revised Gesell Developmental Schedules; the Motor Quotient will be used to assess gross motor development; and the Capute Scales will be used used to assess non-verbal, visual-motor problem-solving development and speech and language development.</description>
