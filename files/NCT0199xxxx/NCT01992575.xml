  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinal blood vessel disease encompasses a wide variety of vision-threatening conditions. Of&#xD;
      these conditions, retinal vein occlusions are the most common. Vision loss can occur as a&#xD;
      result of macular ischemia (loss of blood flow to the macula) or macular edema (fluid&#xD;
      build-up at the macula).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT is an imaging technology that can perform non-contact cross-sectional imaging of retinal&#xD;
      and choroidal tissue structures in real time. It is similar to ultrasound imaging, except&#xD;
      that OCT measures the intensity of reflected light rather than sound waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if non-invasive OCT technology can changes due to retinal&#xD;
      vein occlusions as well as the more invasive fluorescein angiography, which requires an&#xD;
      injection of dye into the vein of an arm of a patient. The study will also compare the&#xD;
      mapping of blood vessels (angiography) and loss of blood flow (ischemia) by fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography and OCT. These studies will be evaluated to see how they relate to vision loss.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of branch or central retinal vein occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to complete study tests within a 30 day period from date of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring&#xD;
             dialysis or kidney transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A prior history of reaction to fluorescein or other dyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in&#xD;
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular&#xD;
             disease, and glycemic control).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110). If blood&#xD;
             pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, subject can become&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic anti-VEGF or pro-VEGF treatment within 4 months prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become&#xD;
             pregnant within the next 12 months due to unknown safety of fluorescein angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior PRP or focal laser that would alter the macular perfusion and retino-vascular&#xD;
             features.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to maintain fixation for OCT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, may&#xD;
             alter the retinal perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An ocular condition is present that, in the opinion of the investigator, might affect&#xD;
             or alter visual acuity during the course of the study (e.g., cataract).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to decrease&#xD;
             visual acuity by 3 lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing acuity to 20/40 or&#xD;
             worse if the eye was otherwise normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Media opacity or otherwise that would prevent either fixation or ability to obtain&#xD;
             adequate images as determined by the examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of major ocular surgeries (including vitrectomy, cataract extraction, scleral&#xD;
             buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within 4 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
