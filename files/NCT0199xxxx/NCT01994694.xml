      People with ADHD often engage in risky behaviors, such as dangerous driving, substance abuse&#xD;
      and gambling. Current behavioral economy theories differentiate between risk perception and&#xD;
      risk attitude. This study aims to measure both risk taking and risk perception in adults with&#xD;
      and without ADHD. It is hypothesized that people with ADHD show decreased risk perception,&#xD;
      accounting for their risky behavior. In contrast, it is hypothesized that people with ADHD do&#xD;
      not show increased risk attitude, namely, they are not risk seeking.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with ADHD are found to be engaged in risky behavior and tend to take risks such as&#xD;
      dangers driving, substance abuse, gambling and more. These tendencies are in line with&#xD;
      findings of poor decision making in individuals with ADHD. Even though none of the existing&#xD;
      theories of ADHD manage to explain the full spectrum of decision making among ADHD, yet this&#xD;
      population interpreted as risk seekers regardless causative correlation that link the&#xD;
      disorder to risk taking behavior. Studies regarding decision making under uncertainty have&#xD;
      uncovered common patterns of behavior that are inconsistent with the grasp that individuals&#xD;
      with ADHD are risk seekers. First, studies that used gambling tasks showed that subjects with&#xD;
      ADHD bet on smaller wages than non ADHD subjects. Second, when subjects with ADHD confronted&#xD;
      with risky options that showed similarity in its expected value or that the expected value&#xD;
      was beneficial compared to the safe one, they did not choose the risky options. Surprisingly,&#xD;
      when the risky options did not carry any gain or benefit they tend to choose the risky&#xD;
      options upon the beneficial or safer ones. Third, subjects with ADHD who preformed explicit&#xD;
      pure risk seeking tasks under two conditions, with and without feedback, differ from control&#xD;
      group only in the with feedback condition and were conservative in choosing risky&#xD;
      alternatives. All of the above questions upon the risk perception of people with ADHD in more&#xD;
      skeptical light and is being researched in this study in a direct and more comprehensive way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred adults with and with out ADHD will be recruited through addressing to&#xD;
      undergraduate students at the Hebrew University and Talpiot Collage in Israel, who will be&#xD;
      enrolled in special education course for teachers, and through addressing work colleagues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete the following questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD Adult Self Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) in order to measure the severity of ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Domain-specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT): The subjects will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      paper-and-pencil questionnaire in groups of 5-10 individuals or in private.of the DOSPERT&#xD;
      questionnaire consisted of a total set of 30 items assessing 3 scales (risk taking, risk&#xD;
      perception and expected benefits) in five domains of risk: financial, health/safety,&#xD;
      recreational, ethics, and social, 6 items in each domain. The set of 30 items was presented&#xD;
      three times in counterbalanced order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hebrew version of the DOSPERT scale was developed for this study using the method of&#xD;
      back-translation. Internal consistency for the 3 measures was good. Cronbach's alpha was&#xD;
      0.85, 0.83 and 0.86, for Risk Taking, Risk Perception and Expected Benefit perception,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We predict that: (a) higher level of ADHD symptoms will be associated with higher risk taking&#xD;
      ; (b) lower risk perception and higher benefit perception will be associated with higher risk&#xD;
      taking ; (c) higher level of ADHD symptoms will be associated with lower risk perception and&#xD;
      higher benefit perception ; (d) risk and benefit perceptions will mediate the relation&#xD;
      between level of ADHD symptoms and risk taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three measures will be analyzed: Risk Taking (defined as the willingness to engage in a risky&#xD;
      activity as a function of its perceived riskiness), Risk Perception (defined as the reported&#xD;
      level of risk taking), and Expected Benefits (define as the benefit responders expect to&#xD;
      obtain from engaging in each risky behavior). Correlations with the ASRS scores will be&#xD;
      examined. A mediation analysis will be conducted in order to examine the role of risk and&#xD;
      benefit perception as potential mediator of ADHD-related risk taking.&#xD;
