      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of an intervention addressed to health professionals to&#xD;
      improve the adequacy of lipid-lowering prescription in primary prevention of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and reducing expenditure in this respect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: a cluster randomized clinical trial, not blind; Data were obtained from medical&#xD;
      records and other primary care databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING: 279 primary health care teams in Catalonia (Spain), centers managed by Catalan&#xD;
      Health Institute (ICS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS: Population from 35 to 74 years, free of cardiovascular disease, who have been&#xD;
      started on lipid-lowering therapy during 2 consecutive years of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: Practitioners in the intervention group may have access, whenever they want and&#xD;
      through the computerized medical record program, to personalized information on their&#xD;
      assigned patients who have started treatment of cardiovascular primary prevention with&#xD;
      lipid-lowering. This information is updated monthly for 12 consecutive months.Information&#xD;
      will be presented in two different and complementary ways to each practitioner: asynchronous&#xD;
      information (the patient is not present when the practitioner receives the information) and&#xD;
      synchronous information (the patient is present when the practitioner receives the&#xD;
      information).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Variable RETIRA: new lipid-lowering treatments initiated during the year prior to&#xD;
                the intervention, seen as inadequate and withdrawn during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Variable EVITA: New lipid-lowering treatments started during the intervention&#xD;
                period and considered as inadequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Variable COST: total cost of the inadequate new lipid-lowering treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Variable RECORD: recording of the cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.Other variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Principal: intervention/control group assignment of health professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient variables: demographic and clinical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Professional variables: quality of care indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive analysis, agreggated at health professional level, will be&#xD;
      performed and subsequently multilevel analysis techniques will be used to estimate the effect&#xD;
      of intervention according to hierarchic data structure and, in particular, patient variables&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is the improvement in the appropriateness of prescribing of lipid-lowering therapy in primary prevention as recommended by the guide clinical practice intervention in the Institut Català de la Salut compared with clinical practice group.&#xD;
To answer the main objective of the study, two dependent variables were calculated:&#xD;
Variable RETIRA: new lipid-lowering treatments initiated during the year prior to the intervention, seen as inadequate and withdrawn during the intervention period&#xD;
Variable EVITA: New lipid-lowering treatments started during the intervention period and considered as inadequate</description>
