      This Clinical Trial is a pilot study being conducted to study the impact of a specific&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation program, Goal Management Training (GMT), in adult patients with&#xD;
      executive dysfunction and associated problems in everyday functioning. The intervention&#xD;
      program will also include relaxation training and psychoeducation regarding brain injury on&#xD;
      everyday functioning, emotional status, and executive functioning. Goal Management Training&#xD;
      focuses on teaching individuals strategies to compensate for executive functioning deficits&#xD;
      and is based on a theory of goal neglect resulting in disorganized behavior following frontal&#xD;
      lobe injury. It emphasizes strategies for self-monitoring and self-evaluation in everyday&#xD;
      life. Given its goal-oriented emphasis, focus on individual everyday difficulties, and&#xD;
      reports of improvements in self-reported executive failures and mood, GMT appears to be an&#xD;
      ideal intervention treatment for individuals with executive and functional deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the emphasis of goal-oriented rehabilitation on reducing the impact of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment on daily functioning, rather than attempting to restore cognitive abilities, a&#xD;
      reduction in subjective reports of psychological distress is anticipated. This hypothesis is&#xD;
      consistent with existing literature revealing reduced reports of annoyance and executive&#xD;
      difficulties on self-report inventories. Improvements on tests of sustained attention and&#xD;
      visuospatial problem-solving, as well as small effects on additional measures of planning,&#xD;
      are also anticipated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Executive functions (EF) are higher-order cognitive processes used particularly under novel&#xD;
      and complex conditions (Shallice, 1990) and comprise various abilities including devising&#xD;
      goals, elucidating alternative solutions, implementing goal-directed behaviors,&#xD;
      self-monitoring, and behavior modification and perseverance (Snyder, Nussbaum, &amp; Robins,&#xD;
      2009). According to Sohlberg and Mateer (2001; p.234), EF may be described as cognitive&#xD;
      abilities &quot;required to complete goal-directed [behavior] that is not overlearned, automatic,&#xD;
      and routine.&quot; As a result, executive dysfunction can impair one's ability to function&#xD;
      independently (Bolognani et al., 2007). Research has identified a positive relationship&#xD;
      between functional ability and EF (Hanks, Rapport, Millis, &amp; Deshpande, 1999). Additionally,&#xD;
      differential declines in EF are observed in normal aging after the age of 60 years (Treitz,&#xD;
      Heyder, &amp; Daum, 2007). As well, the profile of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease is&#xD;
      marked by a predominance of executive dysfunction, followed by memory deficits (Emre, 2003;&#xD;
      Emre, 2004; Verbaan et al, 2007). In addition to traumatic and acquired brain injuries,&#xD;
      executive dysfunction and functional deficits have been observed in individuals with&#xD;
      psychiatric illnesses such as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; e.g., Willcutt,&#xD;
      Doyle, Nigg, Faraone, &amp; Pennington, 2005), psychostimulant and opioid abuse (e.g.,&#xD;
      Verdejo-Garcıa, Lopez-Torrecillas, Aguilar de Arcos, &amp; Perez-Garcıa, 2005;&#xD;
      Fernández-Serranoa, Pérez-García, &amp; Verdejo-García, 2011), bipolar disorder (e.g., Frangou,&#xD;
      Donaldson, Hadjulis, Landay, &amp; Goldstein, 2005; Maalouf et al., 2010), and geriatric&#xD;
      depression (Lockwood, Alexopoulos, van Gorp, 2002). The prominence of executive dysfunction&#xD;
      in individuals with acquired brain injury and mental illness, and the associated costs on the&#xD;
      healthcare system, highlights a role for cognitive rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive rehabilitation refers to interventions aiming to enhance or support cognitive&#xD;
      abilities following brain injury, with an emphasis on achieving functional changes. It is a&#xD;
      structured, goal-oriented, collaborative process between the therapist and the patient (and,&#xD;
      where possible, caregivers/family) and is informed by medical and neuropsychological data&#xD;
      (Sohlberg &amp; Mateer, 2001). A recent meta-analysis of the effectiveness of cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation following acquired brain injury revealed a significant effect on global&#xD;
      cognitive functioning, with time-since-injury acting as a moderating variable. Attention&#xD;
      training following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and language and visuospatial training for&#xD;
      aphasia were identified as effective treatments (Rohling, Faust, Beverly, &amp; Damaskis, 2009).&#xD;
      In their review of intervention approaches for executive dysfunction, Boelen, Spikman, and&#xD;
      Fasotti (2011) describe three approaches used in previous studies. First, compensatory&#xD;
      strategies emphasize teaching patients cognitive strategies to offset cognitive deficits.&#xD;
      Second, restorative strategies aim to repair cognitive functions. Third, behavioral therapy&#xD;
      interventions seek to modify behavior through means such as token economies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An example of the compensatory approach to executive dysfunction is Goal Management Training&#xD;
      (GMT). GMT is a cognitive rehabilitation strategy based on Duncan's (1986) theory of goal&#xD;
      neglect resulting in disorganized behavior following frontal lobe injury. It emphasizes&#xD;
      strategies for self-monitoring and self-evaluation in everyday life, including pausing,&#xD;
      identifying the task at hand, outlining the goals and listing the required steps, completing&#xD;
      the task, and evaluating the successful completion of the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the relationship between disorganized behavior and functional dependence, the use of&#xD;
      GMT in patients with executive dysfunction is highly relevant. Levine et al. (2000) compared&#xD;
      the effectiveness of GMT and motor skills training (MST) in patients with TBI who were living&#xD;
      independently in the community. The GMT group exhibited improved performance on paper and&#xD;
      pencil tasks (e.g., proofreading) and slowed speed of task completion suggested increased&#xD;
      attention to task demands. Improvements on the MST trained tasks were noted for the MST&#xD;
      group. Fish and colleagues (2007) evaluated the effect of a &quot;content-free&quot; cueing strategy&#xD;
      (i.e., text messages reading STOP!), the first stage in GMT, to compensate for goal-neglect&#xD;
      following brain injury. The authors reported significant improvements in goal-directed&#xD;
      behavior with the addition of &quot;content free&quot; cues and conclude that the provision of cues&#xD;
      improves goal management by increasing self-monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GMT has also been evaluated in normal aging, given the relationship between reduced executive&#xD;
      functioning, functional difficulties, and aging. Van Hooren and colleagues (2007) evaluated&#xD;
      69 Dutch adults aged 55 years or older for the impact of a structured 12-session GMT program&#xD;
      on cognitive functioning, self-reported mood, and self-reported cognitive complaints and&#xD;
      failures. Their GMT program included psychoeducation regarding cognitive functioning and&#xD;
      functional difficulties and their study design utilized a randomized wait-list control group.&#xD;
      The results revealed reduced annoyance, improved management of cognitive failures, and&#xD;
      decreased anxiety in the treatment group, relative to controls. No improvement on objective&#xD;
      measures of cognitive functioning was noted. In another wait-list controlled study evaluating&#xD;
      GMT in normal aging, Levine and colleagues (2007) reported decreased self-report of executive&#xD;
      failures and improved performance on simulated real-life tasks in 49 healthy older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to group studies, GMT has been evaluated in single case studies. Schweizer et al&#xD;
      (2008) provided seven, weekly, two-hour sessions of GMT to a patient with focal damage to the&#xD;
      cerebellum. Evaluation of the treatment included pre-, post-, and long-term (i.e., 4 months&#xD;
      post-intervention) administration of attention, executive functioning, and self-report&#xD;
      measures. Although modest improvements on objective measures of executive functioning were&#xD;
      observed, the patient endorsed significant improvements in functional abilities (i.e., return&#xD;
      to work). Similarly, Levine and colleagues (2000) observed improvements in meal preparation,&#xD;
      following two sessions of GMT, in a patient in the chronic stage of recovery from&#xD;
      meningo-encephalitis. The GMT sessions focused on the five stages of GMT using the patient's&#xD;
      recipes as training examples. The effect of GMT on meal preparation was maintained at a&#xD;
      six-month follow-up evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the first controlled, partially randomized, study of GMT was completed with&#xD;
      patients in the chronic stage of recovery from a focal brain injury and who were exhibiting&#xD;
      persistent executive dysfunction (Levine et al., 2011). Significant improvements in sustained&#xD;
      attention, behavioral consistency, and problem-solving were reported for the GMT group, with&#xD;
      no significant effects found for the control group. However, in contrast to previous studies&#xD;
      (Levine et al., 2007; van Hooren et al., 2007), no change on self-report measures of everyday&#xD;
      executive functioning was observed. The authors attribute the lack of change in subjective&#xD;
      report to two possible factors: 1) an absence of collateral ratings and 2) reduced insight&#xD;
      due to executive dysfunction or improved insight resulting in increased item endorsement. The&#xD;
      authors conclude that GMT is an effective intervention for executive dysfunction, which&#xD;
      produces improvements in both trained and untrained behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal management training has been described as a unique cognitive rehabilitation technique,&#xD;
      given its theoretical basis in goal neglect following frontal lobe damage and its emphasis on&#xD;
      real-life behaviors (Levine et al., 2000). The authors also reveal that, for rehabilitation&#xD;
      strategies to generalize to other behaviors, generalization must be a component of the&#xD;
      intervention itself. This conclusion is consistent with Sohlberg and Mateer's (2001)&#xD;
      suggestion that clinicians should &quot;program generalization&quot; by training overlearning and&#xD;
      general strategies for various locations and tasks, emphasizing individual difficulties,&#xD;
      incorporating significant others in the rehabilitation process, and planning for obstacles.&#xD;
      It has been recommended that rehabilitation for executive dysfunction emphasize the&#xD;
      achievement of independence in functional activities and generalization to everyday&#xD;
      activities (Boelen, Spikman, &amp; Fasotti, 2011). Given its goal-oriented emphasis, focus on&#xD;
      individual everyday difficulties, and reports of improvements in self-reported executive&#xD;
      failures and mood, GMT appears to be an ideal intervention for individuals with functional&#xD;
      and executive function impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a GMT group,&#xD;
      emphasizing compensatory strategies for executive dysfunction (e.g., goal neglect and&#xD;
      attentional lapses), as well as relaxation training and psychoeducation regarding brain&#xD;
      injury, in a sample of adult outpatients with identified executive dysfunction and associated&#xD;
      functional deficits. Specific objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of the short-term efficacy of GMT on self- and collateral-report of everyday&#xD;
           functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of the short-term efficacy of GMT on neuropsychological outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of the long-term (i.e., 1 year) efficacy of GMT on self- and&#xD;
           collateral-report of everyday functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identification of neuropsychological measures sensitive to cognitive change following&#xD;
           GMT, through the use of a more extensive battery of neuropsychological tests, compared&#xD;
           to previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluation of the long-term (i.e., 1 year) efficacy of GMT on neuropsychological outcome&#xD;
           measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Identify the primary mediator of change in GMT by comparing a control group receiving&#xD;
           two sessions of relaxation training and psychoeducation relative to a treatment group&#xD;
           receiving the complete GMT program (including relaxation training and psychoeducation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES Given the emphasis of goal-oriented rehabilitation on reducing the impact of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment on daily functioning, rather than attempting to restore cognitive&#xD;
      abilities, a reduction in subjective reports of psychological distress is anticipated. This&#xD;
      hypothesis is consistent with existing literature revealing reduced reports of annoyance and&#xD;
      executive difficulties on self-report inventories (van Hooren et al., 2007; Levine et al.,&#xD;
      2007). Previous research has identified improvement on sustained attention and visuospatial&#xD;
      problem-solving tasks following GMT (Levine et al., 2011). The proposed battery of&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests includes a greater number of neuropsychological measures evaluating&#xD;
      different neuropsychological functions. Improvements on tests of sustained attention and&#xD;
      visuospatial problem-solving, as well as small effects on additional measures of planning,&#xD;
      are also anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Participants Group Assignment Participants will be randomly assigned to a GMT&#xD;
      Treatment or Control Group. The GMT cognitive rehabilitation intervention program will be&#xD;
      administered in group format, consisting of 8 sessions, including structured psychoeducation,&#xD;
      relaxation training, and stepwise learning of GMT. The Control Group program will also be&#xD;
      administered in group format, consisting of two sessions, including structured&#xD;
      psychoeducation and relaxation training. Participants assigned to the Control condition will&#xD;
      be offered the opportunity to complete the full GMT program following the completion of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intake: A screening interview with the patient and their significant other will be conducted&#xD;
      to gather essential background demographic and medical information, including self- and&#xD;
      collateral-report of cognitive, emotional, and functional status. Participants referred&#xD;
      without a baseline neuropsychological assessment will undergo a standardized&#xD;
      neuropsychological battery. For patients referred with a brief cognitive screen, additional&#xD;
      neuropsychological measures will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GMT Treatment Group: A modified (i.e., including psychoeducation and relaxation training) GMT&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation intervention program will be administered in group format. Each&#xD;
      group will consist of six participants to ensure sufficient time to address both group and&#xD;
      individual functional difficulties. Although more cost-effective, larger groups of patients&#xD;
      with executive dysfunction are not planned, given the prominence of organizational and&#xD;
      attention deficits among patients with executive dysfunction. The modified GMT intervention&#xD;
      will consist of seven group sessions and, similar to van Hooren et al (2007), an individual&#xD;
      session with a neuropsychologist on Session 5. Sessions will be held twice weekly. The&#xD;
      manualized group sessions will include: (1) structured psychoeducation introducing&#xD;
      participants to the brain and executive functioning, the relationship between stress and&#xD;
      cognitive functioning, and relaxation training; (2) stepwise learning of GMT, including&#xD;
      education regarding attentional lapses and goal neglect, as well as in-session practice&#xD;
      targeting individual everyday functional deficits with the goal of maximizing generalization.&#xD;
      Homework assignments targeting individual functional deficits will be assigned following each&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: Participants randomly assigned to the Control condition will participate in&#xD;
      two group sessions emphasizing psychoeducation and relaxation training. The proposed Control&#xD;
      condition goes beyond the current standard of care, which does not include any cognitive or&#xD;
      psychological intervention beyond neuropsychological and medical assessment. In keeping with&#xD;
      the GMT Treatment group, the Control groups will consist of six participants. Sessions will&#xD;
      be scheduled along side the GMT Treatment sessions (i.e., two sessions in one week)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may be included in the study if they are identified as having EF&#xD;
             impairments, secondary to an acquired brain injury, and are between the ages of 18 and&#xD;
             65 years. Informed consent will be gathered from each participant. Eligible&#xD;
             participants will be informed about the purpose of the study, the associated risks and&#xD;
             benefits, and their option to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty.&#xD;
             Potential risks include subtle discomfort when initially participating in relaxation&#xD;
             exercises, which typically resolves with familiarity, and mild distress during&#xD;
             neuropsychological assessment. These issues sometimes arise during standard clinical&#xD;
             practice and the neuropsychologists involved are experienced in assisting people in&#xD;
             reducing their distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with significant memory impairment, receptive language deficits, active&#xD;
             psychosis, severe depression (i.e., Beck Depression Inventory - II [BDI-II] ≥ 30), or&#xD;
             a diagnosis of dementia will be excluded from participating in the study.. A minimum&#xD;
