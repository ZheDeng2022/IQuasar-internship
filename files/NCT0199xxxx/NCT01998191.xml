      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is avoidable mortality?&#xD;
&#xD;
      As emphasized by the recent Francis Report into care at the Mid-Staffordshire hospital,&#xD;
      avoidable mortality is an important measure of safety and quality of healthcare. Measures of&#xD;
      risk-adjusted mortality (SHMI and HSMR) based on population mortality statistics have&#xD;
      previously been criticized for overestimating harm. It is difficult to determine within these&#xD;
      measures the degree to which deaths could have been prevented with adequate medical care. To&#xD;
      assess the quality of healthcare, it is more useful to focus on deaths that have objective&#xD;
      evidence of being related to adverse events or complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events are defined as injuries or complications that occur as a result of health care&#xD;
      management and not as a result of the patient's pathology, causing prolonged hospital stay,&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Avoidable mortality can be defined as a death where an adverse event&#xD;
      or events has occurred that contributed to or precipitated this death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What methods are there for measuring avoidable mortality?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The avoidable nature of an inpatient death has traditionally been assessed through&#xD;
      retrospective case record review. The best means of performing such a review is unclear. The&#xD;
      ideal review system would maximize the adverse event detection rate but be efficient, timely&#xD;
      and pragmatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two types of case note review: implicit (or holistic) and explicit. The implicit&#xD;
      review involves a trained expert reading a case note in full and accessing any further&#xD;
      supplementary information. Current methods of using experienced reviewers to provide holistic&#xD;
      assessment of case notes are intuitively sound. However the process of recruitment, training&#xD;
      and reviewing notes is prolonged. Implicit review is subjective and can result in lower&#xD;
      levels of inter-rater reliability than explicit methods. . It may be insensitive to detecting&#xD;
      differences in care quality at a hospital level . Hogan and colleagues recently used holistic&#xD;
      retrospective record review to assess the incidence of hospital avoidable mortality in&#xD;
      England finding a rate of 5.2% of mortality cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explicit systems, such as the Global Trigger Tool, have also been used to detect adverse&#xD;
      events. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) developed a Global Trigger Tool for&#xD;
      Measuring Adverse Events (GTT), which has been validated for use in the United Kingdom (UK)&#xD;
      as the Acute Trigger Tool. The GTT is a reliable and valid method for detecting adverse&#xD;
      events in hospitals with the highest sensitivity for harm detection of any review method and&#xD;
      with a good level of inter-rater agreement and specificity It has been used to track the rate&#xD;
      of adverse events over time and compare hospital event rates. The trigger tool has been used&#xD;
      in combination with more in depth or &quot;deep dive&quot; questions to investigate preventable&#xD;
      hospital mortality. Kaiser Permanente (KP) developed a quantitative method where nurses with&#xD;
      physician guidance can more efficiently review notes to determine the avoidable nature of&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explicit and implicit case review methods have been compared before in order to assess&#xD;
      quality of care. This study is novel in that it will compare sensitivity and specificity for&#xD;
      determining preventability of mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who should act as an avoidable mortality reviewer?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the limited number of available expert reviewers, it would be useful to demonstrate&#xD;
      that other reviewers have similar reliability in assessing avoidable death. Trained nurses&#xD;
      are a potential resource for case note review. They have basic clinical skills and knowledge.&#xD;
      However a more protocol driven method may safeguard against errors due to decreased&#xD;
      appreciation of clinical events. Therefore explicit criteria for review maybe more likely to&#xD;
      demonstrate greater inter-rater reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the purpose of this study?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess what the most efficient and reliable case note review method is for&#xD;
      detecting avoidable death, so that it could be applied on a regular basis to investigate&#xD;
      excess mortality in hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also evaluate if appropriately trained nurses can reliably detect avoidable deaths&#xD;
      and whether the specificity and sensitivity of their review is comparable to experienced&#xD;
      physician reviewers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: EXPLICIT CASE REVIEW METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      A modified Acute Trigger Tool (ATT); the UK version of IHI Global Trigger Tool will be used.&#xD;
      (Appendix 1) Each reviewer will scan the records and look for specific triggers. Once&#xD;
      identified the pertinent portions of the record will be analysed using the &quot;deep-dive&quot;&#xD;
      questions that have been validated by KP. (Appendix 2) These questions aim to determine&#xD;
      whether preventable harm occurred leading to death. If not found the reviewer should ignore&#xD;
      the trigger and search for further triggers. Positive triggers do not indicate adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If adverse events are identified without triggers, these should also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of adverse events detected, the reviewers will then judge the preventability of&#xD;
      the death using a 6-point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be extracted to a pre-formatted data sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For nursing review instances of harm will be reviewed and validated by a physician on the&#xD;
      team, if the nurse review is in doubt&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: IMPLICIT CASE REVIEW METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implicit review will be a two-stage process. The reviewers will read the notes and judge&#xD;
      whether any adverse events occurred or whether there were any errors in the care pathway that&#xD;
      are deemed to be preventable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reviewers will be asked to assess all aspects of the patients' care and the entire record&#xD;
      including nursing notes and drug charts. Demographic information will be collected as well as&#xD;
      co-morbidities and functional impairments For each case where an adverse event lead to death&#xD;
      reviewers would then judge the preventability of the death using the 6-point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be extracted using a structured data collection form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STANDARDISED DETERMINATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event implies unintended harm to a patient. These should also include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Event where the perspective of the patient would be that harm occurred to them (NB this&#xD;
           does not include psychological harm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Event was not the natural progression of the disease process; i.e. as part of the&#xD;
           medical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Events which are present on admission, provided that it was harm related to medical&#xD;
           care, e.g. delayed diagnosis in outpatients&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both methods the reviewers will have opportunity to discuss questions with the expert&#xD;
      reviewer and research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all adverse events leading to death the timing, and contributory factors as assessed by&#xD;
      the reviewers will be logged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STANDARDISED SEVERITY SCORING OF ADVERSE EVENT (NCC MERP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Category E: Temporary harm to the patient and required intervention Category F: Temporary&#xD;
      harm to the patient and required initial or prolonged hospitalization Category G: Permanent&#xD;
      patient harm Category H: Intervention required to sustain life Category I: Patient death&#xD;
&#xD;
      STANDARDISED TRAINING&#xD;
&#xD;
      All nurses and physician reviewers involved in the study shall complete the ATT training,&#xD;
      which will comprise web-based seminars and practice notes. They will be assessed using&#xD;
      example case notes to ensure a satisfactory level of detection is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training in implicit case note review will also be employed using an iterative process with&#xD;
      example notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once an acceptable standard has been reached for all reviewers the review process will&#xD;
      commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLINDING&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reviewers will be blinded to the results of previous assessments so as not to bias the&#xD;
           result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research team will be blinded as to who reviewed the notes and by which method when&#xD;
           collecting the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All reviewers will be given a randomly generated identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation of reviewers and notes will be performed using a random number generator. All&#xD;
      notes and reviewers will be assigned a random number and then allocated to groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL GROUP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each reviewing group acts a control for the other in this study. The case notes will be&#xD;
      assessed by both teams using different methods and in order to not introduce bias due to&#xD;
      increased learning the teams will change review methods also when the notes are crossed over.&#xD;
