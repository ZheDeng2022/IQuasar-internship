      Consumption of carbohydrate containing foods or sugary drinks brings about changes to the&#xD;
      blood glucose levels. After a meal or drink, blood glucose levels rise until it reaches a&#xD;
      peak concentration usually after 30 minutes. When the body senses the increase in blood&#xD;
      glucose, a hormonal process involving insulin takes place to ensure that the glucose is taken&#xD;
      up from the blood for storage and where it is needed for energy in the body. This process&#xD;
      then brings about a decrease in the concentration of glucose until it reaches approximately&#xD;
      the starting concentration. The original concentration of glucose is attained approximately 2&#xD;
      hours after eating or drinking a carbohydrate food or sugary drink respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different carbohydrates and sugary drinks have different effects on blood glucose response&#xD;
      depending on the amount as well as the type of carbohydrate. Those that give rise to a high&#xD;
      glucose response compared to a reference carbohydrate (usually glucose) are said to be high&#xD;
      glycaemic index (GI) foods and those with a lower glucose response compared to a reference&#xD;
      carbohydrate (usually glucose) are said to be low glycaemic index (GI) foods.(1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that diets that give rise to a high glucose response are associated with a&#xD;
      number of abnormalities like increased metabolic syndrome (2). Metabolic syndrome mostly&#xD;
      comprises of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance which gives an increased risk of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes. (3) It also gives rise to other conditions like high blood pressure (arterial&#xD;
      hypertension), elevated blood insulin levels (hyper-insulinemia), elevated amounts of fat in&#xD;
      the liver (fatty hepatosis) and elevated amounts of lipids in the blood (dyslipidemia). After&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes become clinically apparent, the risk of cardiovascular disease also rises.&#xD;
      (4) Research has also shown that foods/drinks which raise blood glucose levels gradually (low&#xD;
      GI) rather than rapidly (high GI) have health benefits which include reducing the risk of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (5). In vitro studies have shown that polyphenols found in fruits,&#xD;
      vegetables and plant based foods have a positive effect on carbohydrate metabolism and can&#xD;
      lower the blood glucose levels. (6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will determine whether the presence of polyphenols in the diet has any lowering&#xD;
      effect on the blood glucose levels and hence the glycaemic index of foods. This will be&#xD;
      determined by asking volunteers to consume polyphenol rich drink/food together with white&#xD;
      bread and determine the glycaemic response. The GI of bread will be determined initially as a&#xD;
      reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be done by measuring blood glucose response to white bread alone as reference&#xD;
      and then to white bread with test sample containing polyphenols and then determine GI and see&#xD;
      how the GI of bread will be affected. Other analyses to be done are plasma insulin, glucagon,&#xD;
      gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon like peptides-1 (GLP-1) as they all relate&#xD;
      to glycaemic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis is that glucose metabolism will be affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Only healthy participants undertook the study (Hence metabolic syndrome participants not&#xD;
           part of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Only glucose and insulin were analysed in the plasma (hence GIP, GLP-1 and glucagon not&#xD;
           part of end points)&#xD;

      The world health organisation has reported that over 220 million people suffer from diabetes&#xD;
      worldwide and that by the year 2030, this number will be doubled. The WHO also reports that&#xD;
      in 2004, about 3.4 million people died from high blood sugar (WHO fact sheet number 312,&#xD;
      January 2011). About 90% of all diabetes cases is due to type II diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is&#xD;
      largely due to overweight and lack of physical activity characterised by high glucose levels&#xD;
      (hyperglycaemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the human diet, the source of blood glucose are carbohydrates. Dietary carbohydrate is&#xD;
      important to maintain glycaemic homeostasis and provides the most of the energy in the diets&#xD;
      of most people. The control of blood glucose is a hormonal process and it is very important&#xD;
      to human physiology. Hormonal processes involve the release of insulin from the β- cells of&#xD;
      the pancreatic cells which stimulates the uptake of glucose after a meal, to other tissues&#xD;
      either for utilisation (glycolysis) or to be stored in the liver as glycogen (glycogenesis).&#xD;
      When blood glucose falls below normal, glucagon is secreted from the pancreatic α-cells and&#xD;
      it promotes liver glucose production by inducing the generation of glucose from non&#xD;
      carbohydrate substrates such as amino and fatty acids (gluconeogenesis) and the generation of&#xD;
      glucose from glycogen (glycogenolysis). In addition to insulin and glucagon, there are gut&#xD;
      hormones which also play a role in controlling plasma glucose concentrations in the body. The&#xD;
      two important peptide hormones are called Glucagon like peptides-1 (GLP-1) and Gastric&#xD;
      Inhibitory Polypeptide (GIP). They are said to have incretin activity (promotion of glucose&#xD;
      dependent insulin secretion). GIP is secreted from the upper small intestines by the K cells&#xD;
      and its primary function is to stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion by acting on&#xD;
      pancreatic islets. It also stimulates glucagon and it is said to respond to the presence of&#xD;
      nutrients (Seino et al., 2010). GLP-1 is secreted from the lower intestine and colon by the L&#xD;
      cells following exposure to ingested nutrients. It also stimulates insulin secretion and&#xD;
      biosynthesis but inhibits glucagon. GLP-1 is said to have other health and disease related&#xD;
      functions (Marathe et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the glucose homeostasis hormonal control fails, it entails high blood glucose levels&#xD;
      (postprandial hyperglycaemia) which can lead to metabolic syndrome which includes obesity,&#xD;
      impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), hypertension and dyslipidemia. Disturbance of glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis can also lead to other symptoms such as inflammation and oxidative stress at the&#xD;
      whole body level as well as disturbances of the functionality in several organs as well as&#xD;
      diabetes (Hanhineva et al). Therefore, as much as carbohydrates are required in the human&#xD;
      body as a major source of energy, too much in the diet can have adverse health effects&#xD;
      especially the one with high glycaemic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed mechanism adapted from (Aston, 2006) of how carbohydrates may affect human&#xD;
      health is that when there is a continual presence of high glycaemic index foods in the diet,&#xD;
      this gives rise to postprandial glucose rise as well as high insulin demand to act on the&#xD;
      high blood glucose levels in the blood. This is by the action of the hormones GIP and GLP-1&#xD;
      which stimulates insulin release when they sense the presence of nutrients. Postprandial&#xD;
      glucose rise and high insulin demand may lead to insulin resistance which is the major&#xD;
      component of metabolic syndrome. High insulin demand may also lead to β-cell failure which&#xD;
      may also result in hyperglycaemia which is also a cause of insulin resistance. Insulin&#xD;
      resitance and hyperglycaemia are risk factors for metabolic syndrome and diabetes type 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific evidence suggest that postprandial hyperglycaemia in humans has a major role to&#xD;
      play in health priorities like type 2 diabetes and blood glucose control. It has been&#xD;
      reported that about 90% of all diabetes cases consist of type 2 diabetes. Apart from type I&#xD;
      and type 2 diabetes, there are other related conditions which include pre-diabetes (impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) as well as metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      (obesity, hypertension and insulin resistance). It has been reported that pre-diabetes and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (Coutinho et al., 1999). The glycaemic index was originally proposed with the aim of&#xD;
      managing diabetes. However, recent studies have shown that the GI has potential in the&#xD;
      prevention of type 2 diabetes as well as in the treatment of metabolic syndrome. Research has&#xD;
      shown that high GI diets are associated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (Hodge et al., 2004) and (Steven et al., 2002). More research by (Mckeown et al., 2004) and&#xD;
      (Scaglioni et al., 2004) have shown that high GI diet is associated with a number of&#xD;
      abnormalities like increased metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In the same way, a&#xD;
      low GI diet is said to improve insulin sensitivity but more research is needed to support&#xD;
      this. A few studies like that of (Frost et al., 1996) have shown this to be the case. However&#xD;
      it was observed that it was difficult to know whether this was as a result of improved&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, or improved insulin secretion or due to reduced rate of glucose&#xD;
      absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having anything in the diet that can either slow down the digestion and absorption of&#xD;
      carbohydrates can help reduce the risk (Barclay et al., 2008). Among others, two potential&#xD;
      solutions are that of consumption of low glycaemic index foods or having ingredients in the&#xD;
      diet that can reduce the glycaemic index of foods as well as postprandial blood glucose&#xD;
      levels. The presence of inhibiting components in the diet that can reduce postprandial&#xD;
      glucose can also be a solution to reducing the risk. Drugs like carbose are currently used in&#xD;
      some countries for the management of type 2 diabetes which act by inhibiting carbohydrate&#xD;
      digestive enzymes. However, the use of acarbose has side effects such as nausea, flatulence&#xD;
      and diarrhoea. It has been reported that polyphenols also have the potential to inhibit the&#xD;
      rise in blood glucose by hindering the rapid absorption of glucose (Hanhineva et al.,&#xD;
      Williamson, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review by (Hanhineva et al.) reported that research using animal models as well as a&#xD;
      limited number of human studies, have shown that polyphenols and polyphenol rich foods or&#xD;
      beverages have the potential to affect postprandial glycaemic responses and fasting glycaemia&#xD;
      as well as an improvement of acute insulin secretion and sensitivity. Other possible&#xD;
      mechanisms as reported in the review by (Hanhineva et al.), include pancreatic β- cells&#xD;
      stimulation to secrete insulin as well as activation of insulin receptors, modulation of the&#xD;
      release of glucose from the liver as well as of intracellular signalling pathways and gene&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent review by (Williamson, 2013) concluded that it is very possible that the effects of&#xD;
      polyphenols in the diet will affect glycaemic index of foods as well as postprandial glucose&#xD;
      responses in humans. The two mechanisms highlighted by which this can be achieved being the&#xD;
      inhibition of sugar metabolising enzymes as well as transporters. This potential action of&#xD;
      polyphenols can thus be compared to that of acarbose which acts by the same mechanism and&#xD;
      research in chronic intervention studies has shown that it reduces diabetes risk (Chiasson J.&#xD;
      et al., 2002). The review by Williamson, 2013 also mentioned the possibility of different&#xD;
      mechanisms being inhibited at the same time would give the most promising effects. Therefore,&#xD;
      the most effect would be observed when more than one of the suggested pathways was inhibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research has utilised available information from literature on in vitro studies carried&#xD;
      out and we came up with a food polyphenol rich mixture (PRM) containing polyphenols that&#xD;
      showed the highest inhibition towards carbohydrates digestion and absorption at different&#xD;
      stages. The polyphenol rich breakfast food to be used as the test food will comprise of Green&#xD;
      tea and a combination of four fruit extracts. For the test, the PRM is consumed together with&#xD;
      bread containing 50g available carbohydrates and the control meal is composed of bread,&#xD;
      sugars (fructose, sucrose and glucose) present in the fruit extracts with water. The&#xD;
      polyphenol rich mixture constituents have been analysed in our laboratory for total&#xD;
      polyphenol contents, specific polyphenols and for inhibitory potential to make sure that the&#xD;
      test sample has the capacity to inhibit in vitro before they can be used in humans. The&#xD;
      results obtained are good and justifies their use in the human study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the University of Leeds Mathermatical and Physical Sciences (MAPs)&#xD;
      ethical commitee with application number MEEC12-037. A total of 16 volunteers will need to&#xD;
      complete the study and should be healthy and their fasting blood glucose levels fall within&#xD;
      the healthy range of 4.3-5.9mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers are scheduled to attend 4 visits, once per week for 4 weeks. During each of&#xD;
      the four visits, the volunteer comes fasted in the morning and the fasting blood glucose is&#xD;
      collected by a trained nurse. The volunteer is then given a test meal and blood samples are&#xD;
      collected at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120,150 and 180 minutes after the first bite of the test&#xD;
      meal. On the first and last visit, they are saved with the reference meal which is composed&#xD;
      of bread, water and sugars to compensate those found in the fruit extracts. On the third and&#xD;
      fourth days, they consume test meals of either the low dose or high dose of green tea and&#xD;
      fruit extracts in addition to bread. The blood samples are processed accordingly to obtain&#xD;
      plasma and stored in the -80°C. Plasma samples will be analysed for concentrations of&#xD;
      glucose, insulin, glucagon, GIP and GLP-1. The results will be used to plot the area under&#xD;
      the curve and results obtained after consuming test meals will be compared to those obtained&#xD;
      after consumption of control meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Only healthy participants undertook the study (Hence metabolic syndrome participants not&#xD;
           part of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Only glucose and insulin were analysed in the plasma (hence GIP, GLP-1 and glucagon not&#xD;
           part of end points)&#xD;
