&#xD;
          -  Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in each eye of 20/40 or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to any study related&#xD;
             procedures and to comply with all study requirements.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ocular trauma within the past six months, or ocular surgery or laser treatment within&#xD;
             the past three months (e.g., laser treatment for glaucoma or retina).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of ocular infection, inflammation, cystoid macular edema, clinically&#xD;
             significant blepharitis or conjunctivitis at (Screening/ Qualification), or a history&#xD;
             of herpes simplex keratitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular medication of any kind within 30 days of Screening/ Qualification&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Cannot demonstrate proper delivery of the eye drop.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donations or blood loss, within the past 3 months, that would put the patient at&#xD;
             risk with the multiple blood samples required in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory tests at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant systemic disease (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, myasthenia&#xD;
             gravis, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular or endocrine disorders) which might interfere&#xD;
             with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any investigational study within the past 30 days prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Changes of systemic medication that could have a substantial effect on IOP within 30&#xD;
             days prior to screening, or anticipated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to status of preclinical safety program, women of childbearing potential who are&#xD;

             birth control for at least the last two months. An adult woman is considered to be of&#xD;
             childbearing potential unless she is one year post-menopausal or three months&#xD;
             post-surgical sterilization. All females of childbearing potential must have a&#xD;
             negative urine or serum pregnancy test result at the screening examination and must&#xD;
             not intend to become pregnant during the study.&#xD;
