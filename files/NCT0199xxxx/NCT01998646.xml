  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      single ascending oral doses of ASP4058 in non-elderly, healthy male and female subjects. This&#xD;
      study will also explore the effect of food on the PK of ASP4058.The food-effect crossover&#xD;
      group was open-label treatment with no placebo control.&#xD;

      Subjects will remain in the clinic for 9 days. Subjects will return to the clinic for&#xD;
      follow-up on days 12 and 30 to collect additional safety information.&#xD;
