    <textblock>
      It is a clinicaltrial Phase III , randomized, double -blind , 4-arm (390 each one):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 1560 children and will use 3 batches of vaccine produced by Bio -&#xD;
      Manguinhos with viral bulk of GSK combined measles , mumps and rubella applied in healthy&#xD;
      children 12-15 months of age, and 01 batch of MMR to reference( GSK ), applied in healthy&#xD;
      children aged 12-15 months old . The vaccine is administered as MMR 1st dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hypotheses are tested :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Consistency of production ( equivalence between batches )of 3 batches of vacines(TV1,&#xD;
           TV2 , TV3 Bio- Manguinhos). Noninferiority vaccine Bio TV (Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro), ie,&#xD;
           the measles, mumps and rubella in Brazil is as immunogenic and safe as the measles,&#xD;
           mumps and rubella reference, already used in routine NIP (production&#xD;
           Bio-Manguinhos/FIOCRUZ with viral concentrate, bulk, GSK).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The MMR vaccine (Bio-TV) will have the same composition (vaccine strains) and the same&#xD;
           method of production of MMR (TV-GSK): Wistar RA27 / 3 rubella, Schwarz strain of measles&#xD;
           vaccine, and strain RIT 4385 - derived from the Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As 2nd dose, children receive the vaccine tetraviral measles-mumps-rubella-varicella,&#xD;
           aged 15-18 months, according to the guidance of the National Immunization Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Noninferiority vaccine Bio TV (Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro):the measles, mumps and rubella&#xD;
           vaccine in Brazil is as immunogenic and safe as the measles, mumps and rubella&#xD;
           reference, already used in routine NIP (production Bio-Manguinhos/FIOCRUZ with viral&#xD;
           concentrate, bulk, GSK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Returns for blood sampling will be scheduled for 51 days, ranging from 42 to 60 days after&#xD;
      dose of MMR vaccine dose and after tetraviral. We will colect the firt blood sample before&#xD;
      the first vaccination too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will describe the major adverse events observed after vaccination , comparing their&#xD;
      frequency in groups of MMR vaccine with the Brazilian reference vaccine .&#xD;

      Status:Not yet recruiting: participants are not yet being recruited&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents or guardians, potential participants to the study, will be identified by the field&#xD;
      staff of the project and invited to an interview host, which will be presented in the study&#xD;
      objectives, the necessary procedures (vaccine, blood collection and pre-vaccination&#xD;
      postvaccination, interviews, etc..), their frequency, duration, benefits and risks of the&#xD;
      study. It will also read and discussed the Informed Consent Form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be made Serology, pre-and post-vaccination, using the technique of enzyme immunoassay&#xD;
      (ELISA DadeBehring / SIEMENS) for measles, rubella, mumps and varicella, with titration of&#xD;
      specific IgG antibodies in the Laboratory of Respiratory Virus / IOC / Fiocruz;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Titration of neutralizing antibodies to measles and mumps, pre and post vaccination (by&#xD;
      Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test, PRNT) in samples that are successful seronegative. Will&#xD;
      be held at LATEV / Bio-Manguinhos / Fiocruz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control of adverse events after application of vaccine will be made by means of annotations&#xD;
      that should be completed by a responsible journal and analyzed by the doctor. They will be&#xD;
      have a number phone 24 hours to contact with the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitors will visit the initiation of the study (day 0), regular visits during the study&#xD;
      and a visit closing soon after completion of the study. Monitors should review the FRC,&#xD;
      comparing them with source documents to verify the accuracy of data collection, assess&#xD;
      adherence to good clinical practice and ensure that the study data are complete, accurate and&#xD;
      integers. Monitors should make sure of the existence of time, space and qualified personnel&#xD;
      in the days of monitoring visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consistency of production batches (equivalence) .Upper and lower limits of the confidence&#xD;
      intervals of 95% of the difference in seroprotection results for each of the three pairs of&#xD;
      contrasting antigens lots (three batches compared in pairs) between -10% and +10%, two-tailed&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . ratio of the geometric mean titers for each of the antigens between 0.5 and 2. The 3 lots&#xD;
      will be considered to be consistent in terms of TMG to a particular vaccine component, if all&#xD;
      three 95% CI of the ratio of two-tailed paired TMG are between 0.5 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inferiority&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference seroprotection for each of the antigens in the vaccines under test and&#xD;
           reference vaccines or greater - 10%, one-tailed analysis. More precisely, the lower&#xD;
           limit of 95% of the difference between the seroprotection rates in the vaccine test and&#xD;
           reference vaccine should be greater than 10% (e.g. 4%, -3%, etc. .)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ratio of the geometric mean titers for each of the antigens ≥ 0.5 (for vaccines and&#xD;
           vaccine Bio-Manguinhos reference).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of non-inferiority will take into account three batches of vaccines TV1, TV2,&#xD;
      TV3 and that will be compared together with the reference vaccine, if any consistency of&#xD;
      production batches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure is performed in the 2nd serology after vaccination.&#xD;
