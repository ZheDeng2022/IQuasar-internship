    <textblock>
      The aims of the cohort will be to quantify impact of cancer treatments toxicities , and to&#xD;
      generate predictors of chronic toxicity in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will include four specific aims :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a database of chronic treatment related toxicity in a cohort of 13250 women&#xD;
           with stage I-III breast cancer (= non metastatic), whatever these treatments are&#xD;
           (surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy …)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe incidence, clinical presentation, and outcome of chronic toxicities over a&#xD;
           maximum of 8 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe the psychological, the social and the economic impacts of chronic&#xD;
           toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To generate predictors for chronic toxicities in order to prevent them, based upon&#xD;
           biological criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected impact of these toxicities, when identified, will be to improve quality of life&#xD;
      and to decrease health cost, by the early identification of patients at high risk of&#xD;
      toxicity. Such early identification could lead to prevent toxic effect by: a. developing&#xD;
      prevention strategies, b. substituting toxic treatment by a non (less) toxic one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, such cohort will offer a quantification of the impact of treatment toxicity, that could&#xD;
      be further used to quantify medical usefulness of strategies that aim at decreasing treatment&#xD;
      toxicities (implementation of predictive biomarker for resistance, cytotoxic-free regimen&#xD;
      etc…)&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIM I: TO DEVELOP A TOXICITY DATABASE ON A COHORT OF 20,000 WOMEN WITH STAGE I-III&#xD;
      (NON METASTATIC) BREAST CANCER&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection criteria The cohort will include female patients with non-metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      (stage I-III) without any selection based on their characteristics (except stage) or&#xD;
      treatment. They may be included in other concomitant clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have to sign informed consent and will have to benefit from social security.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of selection criteria is related to the fact that the cohort aims at investigating&#xD;
      toxicity in the whole population of breast cancer from a public health perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The cohort plans to include 13250 women in 13 years. A cohort of 13250 patients&#xD;
      will allow to detect a two fold increased in the risk of a specific toxicity in a homogenous&#xD;
      subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As illustration, the study present a 90% power to detect whether a variable (age as example)&#xD;
      observed in 50% of patients is associated with an increased risk of toxicity (heart toxicity)&#xD;
      in a specific subgroup (Her2+++).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the cohort The13250 patients will be recruited in 20 cancer centers, maximum&#xD;
      in France. The project will start with 14 centers and will further be expanded to 6&#xD;
      additional centers. These patients will be followed for at least 5 years in the context of&#xD;
      the cohort. After 5 years, additional specific data will then be captured each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included at the time of diagnosis, before any cancer specific treatment.&#xD;
      After having signed informed consent, the patient will fill a first questionnaire for&#xD;
      demographics (adapted from French DREES reference study) and living conditions, and a set of&#xD;
      validated questionnaires related to QoL (BR 23) and special psychological dimensions. In&#xD;
      addition, blood samples will be collected at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The toxicities (events) will start to be collected 3 months after the end of &quot;acute&quot;&#xD;
      treatment (surgery/adjuvant/chemotherapy/radiation therapy). Toxicity data will also be&#xD;
      collected at the time of the last chemotherapy. Toxicities will be collected each 6 months,&#xD;
      alternatively by a dedicated nurse and by the patient herself. Three sets of toxicities will&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First, predefined and previously described toxicities will be collected on dedicated&#xD;
           items in the case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second, unknown toxicities will be captured by the use of a patient's notebook where&#xD;
           each patient will collect events and doctor' visits (general practitioner or organ&#xD;
           specialist). This will allow capturing events that have not previously been associated&#xD;
           with cancer treatment toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, objective measurements by paraclinic exams will be done. This includes yearly&#xD;
           blood tests and a heart ultrasonography at 1 and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the data collection, a baseline blood sample for genetic analyses will be&#xD;
      done, and serum samples will be collected at baseline and yearly during 5 years (serum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome data will also be collected and will include metastatic relapse (+ site),&#xD;
      locoregional relapse (+ site) and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM II: TO DESCRIBE INCIDENCE, CLINICAL PRESENTATION, BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND&#xD;
      OUTCOME OF CHRONIC TOXIC EVENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This specific aim will follow three goals :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First, the investigators will describe the incidence of predefined chronic toxicities&#xD;
           according to the treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second, the investigators will aim at identifying new treatment-related toxicities. This&#xD;
           information will be captured through a dedicated notebook where each patient will report&#xD;
           all health and social related events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, the investigators will also assess the outcome of each adverse event, and try&#xD;
           to develop some hypotheses to be addressed in further clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM III: TO DESCRIBE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND THE SOCIAL IMPACTS OF TOXIC EVENTS This&#xD;
      specific aim will be split in two parts: a. to describe the psychological and the social&#xD;
      impact to the patient, b. to describe the impact at the population level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe psychological and social impact for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using robust well validated methods, subjective and objective dimensions of wellbeing will be&#xD;
      investigated, that is: a. Quality of life b. Living conditions c. Psychosocial issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life Global perception of quality of life will be assessed through both SF-36,&#xD;
      QLQ-C30 and BR 23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social impact Living conditions will be assessed through a questionnaire derived from the&#xD;
      French DRESS reference study on living conditions. The initial questionnaire was designed by&#xD;
      DRESS to investigate the social, economical, professional condition two years after the&#xD;
      diagnosis of cancer: back or abandonment of the initial professional/social activity,&#xD;
      conversion, income trends, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological impact This part will focus on psychological functioning, including&#xD;
      psychological impact of chronic toxicities and psychological impact of cancer itself.&#xD;
      Psychological impact is mainly expected on emotional issues, cognitive disorders, body image&#xD;
      and sexual disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the impact on the society This sub-aim will mainly focus on medico-economics and&#xD;
      will assess the global impact of treatment toxicity on health economy. The quantification of&#xD;
      costs related to toxicities is a major challenge since it could allow to identify avoidable&#xD;
      major source of expenses and could allow better tailoring treatment accordingly. Specific&#xD;
      partnerships are being developed with the French social security and other public/private&#xD;
      partners in order to accurately quantify toxicity-related cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM IV TO DEVELOP PREDICTORS FOR CHRONIC TOXICITIES In the present specific aim, the&#xD;
      goal will be to develop molecular/biologic predictors for toxic events. In as many cases as&#xD;
      possible, the investigators will split the cohort into a discovery set and a test set, or&#xD;
      will identify a cross-validating series before doing analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, the goal is to develop multiparametric scores to predict the occurrence of&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding molecular predictors, it is planned that 20 ml blood will be collected yearly. One&#xD;
      sample at baseline will be dedicated to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and&#xD;
      validation of candidate genetic variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of tests are already planned. First, we will investigate conventional biological&#xD;
      parameters including endocrine tests (cortisolemia, TSH, estradiol levels, mullerian&#xD;
      hormone…), metabolic test (including lipidemia), hematologic tests, liver function, immune&#xD;
      function (assessed by lymphocyte counts). Second, more recent and under investigation tests&#xD;
      will be added including troponin (heart failure), mullerian hormone, bone resorption markers&#xD;
      (bone loss), RANK / RANKL, osteoprotegerin (bone loss).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, it is planned to use the baseline sample for the discovery of genetic tests and to&#xD;
      use the serum for the discovery of biochemical predictors.&#xD;
