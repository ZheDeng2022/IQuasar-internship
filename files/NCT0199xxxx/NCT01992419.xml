      The purpose of this study is to measure an improvement in the detection rate of cardiac&#xD;
      arrest (CA) in the Dispatch Center as a result of debriefings and repeated trainings for&#xD;
      non-medical operators who receive emergency calls.&#xD;

      1. . Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
           The performance of phone-guided chest compressions is recommended to minimize the No&#xD;
           Flow risk (1). Pre-arrival instructions and dispatch-assisted chest compressions are the&#xD;
           first link in the chain of survival, determining the effectiveness of subsequent links.&#xD;
           This first link is only possible if a prior detection of cardiac arrest was made.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Dispatch Center of the Fire Brigade of Paris receives more than 7,000 calls per day,&#xD;
           including 8-10 calls for cardiac arrest. The establishment of specific training and&#xD;
           experience feedback with emergency dispatchers should improve the detection of cardiac&#xD;
           arrest (CA) by the same dispatchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main objective is to measure an improvement in the detection rate of CA in the&#xD;
           Dispatch Center as a result of debriefings and repeated trainings for non-medical&#xD;
           operators who receive emergency calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary objective is to identify risk factors for CA non-detection by those&#xD;
           emergency dispatchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Experimental design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Observational prospective non-randomized controlled study. Type &quot;before and after&quot;&#xD;
           study. Three observation periods are defined over a total period of 20 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Different actions before and during each period:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Period 1 Period 2 Period 3 Algorithm available to emergency dispatchers + + + New&#xD;
           algorithm - - + Basic training for new operators - + + Daily briefing +/- +/- +&#xD;
           Systematic Debreafing - - + Specific course before period - - + Table leaders training -&#xD;
           - + Heads of room training - - +&#xD;
&#xD;
           Period 1 is preceded and accompanied by the diffusion of a decision algorithm available&#xD;
           to emergency dispatchers&#xD;
&#xD;
           Period 2 is accompanied by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Short briefings, twice daily, in the presence of operators on duty that day&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Debriefing immediately after the call with some operators (but not systematically,&#xD;
                depending on their availability).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Period 3 is preceded by information to the Dispatch Center managers (heads of room and&#xD;
           table leaders) and a short course about detection of CA (1 hour) for all operators.&#xD;
           During this same period, a daily briefing for operators is established.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study is based on the three CA call periods' audio recordings&#xD;
&#xD;
           For each period, all calls related to CA on the field were listened to and evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each call had a double audition:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  one audition by an instructor, responsible for managing calls in the Dispatch&#xD;
                Center, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  one audition by two emergency physicians experienced in the management of emergency&#xD;
                calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The second listening physician helped to verify, correct, and complete the variables&#xD;
           collected during the first listening&#xD;
&#xD;
           The variables collected during listening were:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;detectability of the CA&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  detection or not of the CA&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the causes of non-detection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the occurrence of dispatch-assisted chest compression&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the time between the start of the call and the time the operator pronounces the&#xD;
                words &quot;cardiopulmonary Resuscitation&quot; or &quot;CPR&quot; or &quot;chest compressions&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the time between the start of the call and the first real chest compression&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  causes for non-realization of chest compressions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the presence or absence of a public defibrillator&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other variables collected - Variables corresponding to the Utstein style:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Epidemiological variables (age, sex, location, background)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Specific backup system variables: time alert - use of an AED&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Specific first aid and medical management variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  type of rhythm detected by AED on the arrival of rescuers&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Success of first AED's shock (loss of ventricular fibrillaton (VF)5 seconds&#xD;
                     after shock)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Number of shocks administered by the AED in the first 10 minutes of support by&#xD;
                     rescuers&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Recovery of a palpable pulse in the presence of rescuers, before the arrival&#xD;
                     of the medical team&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Resuscitation undertaken by the medical team YES/NO&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Injection of adrenaline: YES/NO&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Transport to the hospital with beating heart: YES/NO&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Released resuscitation YES/NO&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Survival to one year after the CA&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Quality of survival (CPC score) at 6 months, 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
           Main judgment criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Detection of CA by the emergency dispatcher:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Detection is considered positive if the dispatcher formalized the presence of&#xD;
                     a CA , either on the software, or orally with the words &quot;CPR&quot; or &quot;chest&#xD;
                     compression&quot; at any time during the recorded call.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  It is considered negative if the dispatcher never suggested, neither orally&#xD;
                     nor in writing, the possibility of the presence of a CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Median time between the start of the emergency call and the pronunciation of&#xD;
                     the words &quot;chest compressions,&quot; by the dispatcher&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Median time elapsed between the start of the emergency call and the actual&#xD;
                     start of chest compressions by caller&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Evaluation of the ventilation mode (hand on abdomen YES/NO, count the interval&#xD;
                     between two ventilatory movements YES/NO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. . Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size We need 100 patients in each period group to observe an absolute 20% difference&#xD;
      in the rate of CA detection, compared with the detection rate of the control group (period 1)&#xD;
      estimated at 60%, with an alpha risk = 0.05 and an 80% power in bilateral situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Description of patient characteristics and outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of these periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of detection rate between the reference period (P1) and each of the other&#xD;
           periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of subjects included in each period allows the realization of a χ² test with&#xD;
           an alpha risk retained at 5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjust the detection rate on the significantly different variables between the groups&#xD;
           (age, sex, no flow, time of rescuer arrival)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The period 1 and 2 will be grouped and compared with period 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Search variables associated with successful detection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multivariate logistic regression analysis type&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of the evolution of the detection rate over time&#xD;
