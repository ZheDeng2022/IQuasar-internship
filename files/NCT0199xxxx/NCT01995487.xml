      The BioNIR study aims to show that the BioNIR ridaforolimus eluting stent is non-inferior to&#xD;
      the Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stent for the primary clinical endpoint of target lesion&#xD;
      failure (TLF) at 12 months; that it is non-inferior to the Resolute for the secondary&#xD;
      endpoint of angiographic in-stent late loss at 13 months; and that it is more cost-effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BioNIR is a prospective, multi-center, single-blind, two-arm, randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
      The population will consist of subjects undergoing PCI for angina (stable or unstable),&#xD;
      silent ischemia, NSTEMI, and recent STEMI. Complex lesions are allowed. There is no limit to&#xD;
      the number of lesions per vessel or individual lesion length; however, the total planned&#xD;
      stenting in the coronary tree cannot exceed 100mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by the presence of medically treated diabetes vs. no&#xD;
      medically treated diabetes, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) vs. non-ACS, and by site. Lesions&#xD;
      planned to be treated must be declared and recorded at time of randomization. Planned staged&#xD;
      procedures, if necessary, must be declared immediately post procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up will be performed at 30 days, 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years post&#xD;
      randomization. 200 patients at participating North American sites will be consented for&#xD;
      planned angiographic follow-up at 13 months after enrollment, with 100 of these patients&#xD;
      consented to undergo planned IVUS at baseline and at 13 months following randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is Target Lesion Failure (TLF) at 12 months, defined as the composite of&#xD;
      cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion&#xD;
      revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Secondary Endpoints to be evaluated at 30 days, 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5,&#xD;
      except as noted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Device, Lesion, and Procedure Success at time of baseline procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TLF at 30 days, 6 months, and 2, 3, 4 and 5 years defined as the composite of cardiac&#xD;
           death, target vessel-related MI, or ischemia-driven TLR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major adverse cardiac events (MACE; the composite rate of cardiac death, any MI or&#xD;
           ischemia-driven TLR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target vessel failure (TVF; the composite rate of death, target vessel related MI or&#xD;
           ischemia-driven TVR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All-cause mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myocardial Infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target Vessel Related MI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ischemia-driven TLR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ischemia-driven TVR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stent Thrombosis (ARC definite and probable)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiographic Sub-Study Secondary Endpoint to be evaluated at 13 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Angiographic in-stent and in-segment late loss&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVUS Sub-Study Secondary Endpoint to be evaluated at 13 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-stent percent neointimal hyperplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stent mal-apposition&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key component of this trial will be a prospective assessment of health care resource&#xD;
      utilization, costs and cost effectiveness. A separate cost effectiveness assessment plan&#xD;
      describes the data collection and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Consideration: From recent US trials of best in class DES (Xience V, Promus&#xD;
      Element and Resolute), the 1-year TLF rate in patients with non-complex lesions not&#xD;
      undergoing routine angiographic follow-up is approximately 3.8%. Using the assumption of the&#xD;
      more-comers' design, the 1-year event rate will be conservatively increased by 50% (assuming&#xD;
      enrollment rate for complex patients/lesions is 50% with double the standard event rate) -&#xD;
      thus 5.8%. Therefore, with a one-sided 95% upper bound of the confidence interval of 3.3% (a&#xD;
      relative 57% margin) and 1:1 randomization, enrolling 1810 patients (905 per group) provides&#xD;
      90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority. Assuming 95% follow-up rate at 1 year,&#xD;
      approximately 1906 patients will be enrolled (953 in each group).&#xD;
