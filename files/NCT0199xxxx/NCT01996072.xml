  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperparathyroidism is a significant medical and public health problem in the world&#xD;
      and affects approximately 100,000 new patients in the United States alone. If left untreated&#xD;
      this can lead to renal stones, osteoporosis, fatigue, and depression. The best treatment for&#xD;
      primary hyperparathyroidism is surgical parathyroidectomy. However surgical parathyroidectomy&#xD;
      can be difficult due to the variant location of the parathyroid glands. Up to 5% of patients&#xD;
      leave the operating room without surgical cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hyperparathyroidism is an ideal disease to investigate intraoperative fluorescent&#xD;
      imaging. This would allow surgeons to identify the parathyroid glands and resect the&#xD;
      suspicious parathyroid glands. Folate receptor (FR) has been found to be over-expressed in&#xD;
      parathyroid tissue and not thyroid issues. An ideal surgical treatment would combine&#xD;
      FR-specific fluorescent tracers with intraoperative imaging. It is important to note that FR&#xD;
      is expressed only in the proximal tubules of the kidneys, activated macrophages, and in the&#xD;
      choroidal plexus. Thus, the false positive detection rate is expected to be extremely low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group well known to us in the Netherlands has completed a pilot study utilizing a&#xD;
      folate-FITC conjugate in 12 patients with ovarian cancer. Another group of investigators in&#xD;
      Mayo have subsequently performed this study on 20 more patients without any serious adverse&#xD;
      events (personal communication). They report excellent sensitivity and specificity with this&#xD;
      technique with only grade 1 side effects (allergic reaction). All side effects reversed when&#xD;
      the injection was halted. Patients with a history of allergic reactions to insect bites&#xD;
      should not participate (fluorescein is derived from the firefly insect, folate is an&#xD;
      essential vitamin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fluorescent contrast agent (folate-FITC or EC17) will be used to determine if it will&#xD;
      localize to the primary tumor nodule(s) or mass(es) of patients undergoing parathyroid&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
