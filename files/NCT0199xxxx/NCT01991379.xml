    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The first three patients will be enrolled at Dose Level 1. If dose level 1 is not found to be tolerable, then the next cohort will be enrolled at dose level -1. If dose level -1 is not found to be tolerable, then the study may be terminated based on discussions with the sponsor and the combination may be deemed intolerable. If 0/3 patients or 1/6 patients experience a DLT on dose level 2, this will be the RP2D.</description>

    <measure>Best Response Rate (phase II portion)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Response Rate (CR+PR, RECIST 1.1). Response rate (RECIST 1.1) will be determined as the proportion of evaluable patients who have complete response or partial response defined by the RECIST 1.1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate (RR) (phase 1b portion)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria and by CHOI criteria RR will be estimated as the proportion of patients who have complete response or partial response for each criterion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimate among all patients enrolled. Patients who have not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study will be censored at the time of the last follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>RR by CHOI criteria (phase II portion)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>

    <description>Pts will be treated with the combination therapy of MEK162 &amp; imatinib. The phase Ib portion of the study, pts will receive imatinib at 400 mg once daily &amp; MEK162 at the standard 3+3 escalation doses. Phase Ib expansion cohort, pts will receive the RP2D: imatinib 400 mg once daily (standard of care first line imatinib dose) &amp; MEK162 at the RP2D twice daily. The phase II portion of the study, pts will receive imatinib at 400 mg once daily &amp; MEK162 at the RP2D. The MEK162 RP2D was originally determined based on the phase Ib escalation data &amp; it was established as 45 mg BID. After the completion of the phase Ib dose expansion &amp; initiation of phase II, the MEK162 RP2D was reduced to 30 mg BID30 for better long term tolerability. Patient's will now begin MEK162 at the revised RP2D of 30 mg BID. 1 cycle is 28 days. If no progression of the tumor is seen, pts will continue on therapy. Pts who have progression of disease will proceed directly to second line therapy as per standard of care.</description>
