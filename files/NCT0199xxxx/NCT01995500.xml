  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NIREUS study aims to demonstrate angiographic non-inferiority for the BioNIR&#xD;
      Ridaforolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (hereafter referred to as BioNIR) in comparison&#xD;
      to the Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stent (hereafter referred to as Resolute).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial hypothesis is that the BioNIR is non-inferior to the Resolute for the primary&#xD;
      endpoint of angiographic in-stent late loss at 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-blind, two-arm, 2:1 randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by the presence of medically treated diabetes vs. no&#xD;
      medically treated diabetes and by site. Lesions planned to be treated must be declared and&#xD;
      recorded at time of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiographic follow-up will be performed at 6 months. Clinical follow-up will be performed at&#xD;
      30 days, 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years post randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Endpoint is in-stent late loss at 6 months as measured by the angiographic core&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiographic Secondary Endpoints to be evaluated at 6 months are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-segment late loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up percent diameter stenosis (in-stent and in-segment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Binary restenosis (in-stent and in-segment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length and patterns of angiographic restenosis (Mehran classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Secondary Endpoints to be evaluated at 30 days, 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5&#xD;
      years, except as noted, are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Device, Lesion, and Procedure Success at time of baseline procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target lesion failure (TLF; the composite of cardiac death, target vessel-related MI, or&#xD;
           ischemia-driven TLR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major adverse cardiac events (MACE; the composite rate of cardiac death, any MI or&#xD;
           ischemia-driven TLR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target vessel failure (TVF; the composite rate of death, target vessel-related MI, or&#xD;
           ischemia-driven TVR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall Mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myocardial Infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target Vessel Related MI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ischemia-driven TLR&#xD;

             randomization and enzyme levels (CK-MB or Troponin) demonstrating that either or both&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Non-target vessel PCI are allowed prior to randomization depending on the time&#xD;
             interval and conditions as follows:&#xD;

             changes, no prolonged chest pain, no TIMI major or BARC type 3 bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
             b. Less than 24 hours prior to Baseline Procedure: i. Not allowed (see exclusion&#xD;
             criteria #3). c. 24 hours-30 days prior to Baseline Procedure: i. PCI of non-target&#xD;
