  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in 70-90 percent of primary breast tumors and in 75&#xD;
      percent of breast metastases. There is evidence to suggest that Androgen Receptor (AR) may be&#xD;
      a target in patients with advanced breast cancer. Breast cancer patients whose tumors do not&#xD;
      express the ER, PR or HER2 (triple negative) have very few options for treatment. Orteronel&#xD;
      is being developed as an endocrine therapy for relevant hormone-sensitive cancers such as&#xD;
      prostrate cancer and breast cancer. Triple-negative metastatic breast cancer patients with AR&#xD;
      expression could potentially benefit from anti-androgen therapy like orteronel.&#xD;

      This open-label multicenter study will be conducted in 2 stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lead-in Phase: The first 6 patients treated will be evaluated to confirm the safety and&#xD;
           feasibility of this regimen. After all 6 patients complete at least 4 weeks of&#xD;
           treatment, and if no prohibitive toxicities are identified, continuous study treatment&#xD;
           will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous Study Treatment: Patients will continue to be enrolled into both cohorts&#xD;
           based on their tumor specificities with a total of 31 patients in Cohort 1&#xD;
           (ER-/PR-/HER2-/AR+) and 55 patients in Cohort 2 (ER+ and/or PR+/AR+).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated every eight weeks for response to treatment. All patients who&#xD;
      respond to treatment (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) or have stable disease&#xD;
      (SD) will continue to receive orteronel until they develop progressive disease (PD) or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure&#xD;

             correlative testing is optional. If tissue is not available, a patient will not be&#xD;
             eligible for enrollment into the study. Patients may enroll based on local laboratory&#xD;
             AR assessment, but will need to submit tissue for confirmation at the central&#xD;
             laboratory.&#xD;
