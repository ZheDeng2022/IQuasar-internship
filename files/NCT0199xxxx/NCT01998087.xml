  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Croatia, between 95% and 99% of mothers initiate breastfeeding, but by 3 months a third&#xD;
      have stopped, and by six months only half are still providing any human milk for their&#xD;
      babies. Exclusive breastfeeding rates are even lower, with only about 9% of Croatian mothers&#xD;
      exclusively breastfeeding at 6 months, despite the WHO recommendation of 6 months of&#xD;
      exclusive breastfeeding. Currently, in Croatia, no breastfeeding information or other&#xD;
      pregnancy and parenting related written information is routinely provided to expectant&#xD;
      couples. In our study we would like to find out whether providing written breastfeeding&#xD;
      information in pregnancy and breastfeeding focused support phone calls during pregnancy and&#xD;
      after the birth of the baby result in better outcomes than providing general&#xD;
      pregnancy/parenting information and support phone calls. This will be tested by randomising&#xD;
      women, attending their primary health care provider for routine antenatal visits between 20&#xD;
      and 32 weeks, to an intervention focused on promoting and supporting breastfeeding, to an&#xD;
      intervention focused on general pregnancy and parenting issues, and to a non-intervention&#xD;
      control group. Women will be followed-up for 6 months after the birth of their baby and data&#xD;
      will be collected at 3 and 6 months on breastfeeding rates, breastfeeding self-efficacy,&#xD;
      breastfeeding difficulties, social support and attitudes toward infant feeding.&#xD;
