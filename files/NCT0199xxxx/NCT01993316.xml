      Neurofeedback can be described as a form of biofeedback which is based on recording brain&#xD;
      activity; usually by using scalp EEG. Neurofeedback has been used for 40 years as a&#xD;
      therapeutic treatment for many neurological conditions including epilepsy, attention deficit&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder and also to improve mental performance in healthy subjects.&#xD;
      Participants can &quot;see&quot; their brain activity via the EEG readings and receive positive&#xD;
      feedback (visual or auditory) to help them consciously shape their brain waves into the&#xD;
      desired patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sLORETA, which is speciliazed computer program to analyze EEG results, will be used in&#xD;
      conjuntion with EEG to study the effect of neurofeedback on the brain activity of healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will investigate the effect of neurofeedback training using sLORETA, which&#xD;
      is a specific method to measure brain waves. We will measure the effect on both brain&#xD;
      hemispheres both before and after neurofeedback training.&#xD;

      NeuroFeedback can be described as a form of Biofeedback that is based on recordings of brain&#xD;
      act ivity reflected by imaging techniques such as real-time fMRI (Johnston at al, 2010) but&#xD;
      mainly using scalp EEG recordings (Angelakis et al., 2007). This method based on classical&#xD;
      and operant learning paradigm and has been applied for the last 40 years as a therapeutic&#xD;
      method to a range of clinical conditions such as epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity&#xD;
      disorder and the locked-in syndrome (Kübler et al., 2009; Vernon, Frick, &amp; Gruzelier, 2004) ,&#xD;
      and to optimise performance in healthy subjects (Egner &amp; Gruzelier, 2003). Participants can&#xD;
      experience their real time brain activity in the form of animated visual or auditory stimuli&#xD;
      (the feedback) co-vary with a specific property of the recorded activity. By being reinforced&#xD;
      for obtaining goals, participants learn to volitionally modulate their brain activity. The&#xD;
      feedback continuously represents brain activity with a minimum delay, which in modern&#xD;
      equipment is on the order of a few tens of millisecond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sLORETA is a widespread linear, discrete, instantaneous, full-volume inverse solution&#xD;
      proximity for brain electromagnetic measurements (Pascual-Marqui, Esslen, Kochi, &amp; Lehmann,&#xD;
      2002; Pascual-Marqui, 2002). Whereas EEG is a measure of electric potential variations on a&#xD;
      two dimensional surface, sLORETA estimates the current density in a three dimensional space&#xD;
      that results in the potential divergence on the scalp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG Tomography directed bio-feedback correlates the physiological signal with a continuous&#xD;
      feedback signal; however, the physiological signal is deﬁned as the current density in a&#xD;
      speciﬁed region of interest (ROI) calculated by means of sLORETA algorithm. This allows the&#xD;
      continuous feedback signal to become a function of the intracranial current density and to&#xD;
      co-vary with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first LORETA neuro-feedback study designed to assess the possibility of using this&#xD;
      protocol on a healthy subjects, Condego (2004) et al recorded current density from their&#xD;
      subjects' anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and feedback it to the subject as the size of a&#xD;
      disk presented on a computer screen. Larger size of a disk represented higher current density&#xD;
      recorded from the subject's ACC. The subjects were instructed to make the circle size as&#xD;
      larger they can, therefore reinforced for higher ACC activity. The results of this study&#xD;
      supported the effect of LORETA neuro-feedback protocol on the subject's performance on a&#xD;
      sustained attention task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This supports the 'LORETA neurofeedback' effect on cognitive performance yet there is still&#xD;
      no direct evidence for the effect of LORETA neurofeedback on the excitability of the neural&#xD;
      tissue itself. One such direct evidence can be achieved by single pulse TMS measure of the&#xD;
      motor cortex plasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ros et al (2010) demonstrated the effect of unipolar neurofeedback protocol on the&#xD;
      exitability of the motor cortex. In their study, the recording electrode had been positioned&#xD;
      in C3 (10-20 system) above the motor cortex and the subjects participated in a neurofeedback&#xD;
      protocol. Motor cortex plasticity was measured on both hemispheres before and after the&#xD;
      train. The results indicated higher plasticity under the training electrode compared to both&#xD;
      before train and compared to the homologue location on the opposite hemisphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study goal&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will investigate the specific effect of M1 training using sLORETA&#xD;
      neurofeedback to the excitability of the motor cortex on both hemispheres before and after&#xD;
      training, compared to the effect of superior parietal gyrus (SPG) training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A double blind active controlled, mixed design. The differential protocol effect will&#xD;
      be investigated both before and after application. Furthermore, Comparison will be held&#xD;
      between the trained hemisphere and the untrained hemisphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Depicted in figure 1, our design will be analyzed as a 2×2×2, with&#xD;
      target for train (M1, SPG) as one between subject factor and further, side of motor&#xD;
      excitability assessment ( Left / Right) and before/after NBF training as two within subject&#xD;
      factors. ANOVA will be calculated for the triple interaction effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Protocol Participants will be randomly assigned to either rM1 (right primary motor&#xD;
      cortex) active treatment group or rSPG (right superior parietal gyrus) active treatment group&#xD;
      (see figure 1). The experimenter will program train protocol for every subject separately.&#xD;
      The neurofeedback therapist will select the protocol by its associated subject number.&#xD;
      Therefore the participant and the therapist will be both blind to the experimental condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the first session, the underlying principles of EEG bio-feedback will be explained to&#xD;
      the participants and they will be kindly asked to sign informed consent version that can be&#xD;
      found on the ethics committee application form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recordings and sessions will be carried out in a comfortably dimmed light, sound&#xD;
      attenuated room in the Beer-Sheva Psychiatric Center. Lighting and temperature will be held&#xD;
      constant for the duration of the experiment. Participants will be invited to the lab for one&#xD;
      session for the completion of all the research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timeline of the session depicted in figure 2. Initially, before neurofeedback training&#xD;
      (T0) the subjects will complete the MRT task (Shepard &amp; Metzler, 1971) thereafter, we will&#xD;
      test for both hemispheres motor cortex excitability (MEP) using single pulse TMS paradigm&#xD;
      (described below). After MEP, three-minute eyes-opened and three-minute eyes-closed EEG&#xD;
      baselines will be recorded. Following, the subject will participate in a&#xD;
      sLORETA-neurofeedback protocol (described below). Immediately (T1) after neurofeedback&#xD;
      session, we will repeat the assessments conducted at T0 according to reversed timeline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrophysiology data acquisition EEG recordings will take place at both the initiation and&#xD;
      at the end of the research protocol. We will place a 19 electrode EEG hat on the participants&#xD;
      sculpt attached to an EEG amplifier. All equipment and materials that will be used are&#xD;
      approved for clinical and research use and are been routinely used in the hospital in&#xD;
      variable treatments protocols and therefore can be considered safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be prepared for EEG recording using a measure of the distance between the&#xD;
      nasion and inion to determine the appropriate cap size for recording (Electrocap, Inc; Blom &amp;&#xD;
      Anneveldt, 1982). The head will be measured and marked prior to each session to maintain&#xD;
      consistency. The ears and forehead will be cleaned for recording with a mild abrasive gel to&#xD;
      remove any oil and dirt from the skin. After ﬁtting the caps, each electrode site will be&#xD;
      injected with electrogel and prepared so that impedances between individual electrodes and&#xD;
      each ear will be less than 5KΩ. Training will be conducted using the 19-leads standard&#xD;
      international 10/20 system. Preparation process should take no more than 20 minutes and will&#xD;
      cause no distress to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS, motor cortex plasticity assessment All measurements will be carried out with monophasic&#xD;
      Magstim 2000 magnetic stimulator (Magstim, Whitland, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate the TMS parameters of both hemispheres, first right (trained) and then left&#xD;
      (untrained) hemisphere, to investigate hemispheric effects of NFB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting motor threshold (RMT) intensity will be defined as the lowest stimulator output&#xD;
      intensity capable of inducing MEPs of at least 50 µV peak-to-peak amplitude in the FDI muscle&#xD;
      in at least half of 10 trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active motor threshold will be defined as the intensity needed to evoke an MEP of about 200&#xD;
      µV during a 5-10% maximum voluntary contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSE will be quantified by the amplitude of the MEP elicited by a single test TMS pulse. The&#xD;
      test pulse intensity will be set to yield average MEP amplitude of 1 mV at baseline (T0), and&#xD;
      will be kept constant throughout the experiment.&#xD;

      EEG Biofeedback protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording amplifier: Mitsar-EEG 201© Electrode positioning: 19 electrodes positioning&#xD;
      according to the standard 10/20 system using EEG cap with gel electrodes routinely used in&#xD;
      the hospital for EEG evaluation and EEG-biofeedback therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROI: right M1 (fixed Talairach coordinates : 34,-18, 35) right SPG (fixed Talairach&#xD;
      coordinates : 24, -55, 50) Frequency goals: Elevating hi-alpha frequency, threshold will be&#xD;
      set for each subject individually to the first quartile of hi-alpha current density&#xD;
      distribution over the first 120 seconds of the training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual stimuli: An emotionally neutral movie (nature scenes). Reinforcement method: The&#xD;
      current source density in the ROI will be co varied with the picture quality by means of&#xD;
      white visual noise that will be added to the picture. As the participant will get closer to&#xD;
      the pre-defined threshold (see above), vision will become more clear. According to the&#xD;
      neurofeedback hypothesis a clearer image in a video presentation will reinforce the last&#xD;
      change in brain activity in the trained region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures are considered safe and are standard and routinely used for treatment and&#xD;
      research with minimal side effect symptoms reported over the last 40 years of applying this&#xD;
      therapeutic method.&#xD;
