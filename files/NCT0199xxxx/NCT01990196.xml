  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer death&#xD;
      in men. The purpose of this research study is to compare prostate cancers treated with&#xD;
      hormone therapy versus prostate cancers treated with hormone therapy plus drugs that directly&#xD;
      target cancer cells.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most prostate cancers respond to hormone therapy, also known as chemical castration.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, castration resistance may occur in certain prostate cancers. Castration&#xD;
      resistance or hormone refractory prostate cancer means that the cancer continues to progress&#xD;
      as seen by progressively rising PSA and/or or an increase in tumor mass on bone scan, X-ray,&#xD;
      CT scan or MRI despite previous hormonal therapy. The researchers are interested in&#xD;
      understanding mechanisms of castration resistance in prostate cancer by analyzing prostate&#xD;
      tissue before radical prostatectomy (from prostate biopsy tissue) and after radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy (whole prostate specimen). They will look at the &quot;molecular signature&quot; of&#xD;
      prostate cancer cells after hormone therapy to identify the key steps that the cancer cells&#xD;
      undergo to become resistant to hormone therapy. In addition, the researchers will use other&#xD;
      medications in addition to hormone therapy in order to block some of the key biochemical&#xD;
      steps that are thought to mediate treatment resistance. This research will provide crucial&#xD;
      information for the development of therapies that can improve the clinical outcome of&#xD;
      patients with advanced prostate cancer.&#xD;
