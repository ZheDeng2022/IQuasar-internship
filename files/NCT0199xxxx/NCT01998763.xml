      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Based on inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, 400 eligible volunteers, who were 20-45 years, with 25-hydroxyvitamin D&#xD;
      between 12.5-50 nmol/L and BMI between 18.5-28 kg/m2, were enrolled and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      placebo or 2000 IU/d vitamin D3 arm, after taking placebo for one week. The study protocol&#xD;
      was approved by the Ethics Committee of Huadong Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University,&#xD;
      Shanghai and all participants provided written informed consents.In this 2-arm RCT we aimed&#xD;
      to systematically investigate the effect of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. vitamin D3 supplement on serum 25(OH)D levels and the modifying factors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. genetic and non-genetic variants on vitamin D bioavailability;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. vitamin D3 supplementation on metabolic profiles and circulating bone-turnover markers&#xD;

      At present time, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and the tolerable upper intake level&#xD;
      (UL) for vitamin D are 200 IU/day and 800 IU/day for Chinese aged 11-50 years, respectively.&#xD;
      On the other hand, the RDA and UL for vitamin D for the same age group in USA are 600IU/day&#xD;
      and 4000IU/day, respectively. Indeed, recent epidemiological studies suggested that serum&#xD;
      25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration ≥75 nmol/L appeared to be optimal for preventing&#xD;
      cardiometabolic diseases and improving bone health. To achieve this goal, a daily intake of&#xD;
      1000 IU or equivalent amount from other sources, is needed, which is twice as much as the RDA&#xD;
      recommended by Chinese Nutrition Society. Except for those individuals with hypersensitive&#xD;
      conditions, daily intake less than 10,000 IU of vitamin D have not shown overt adverse&#xD;
      effects based upon the studies conducted in Western populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since vitamin D metabolic rate and its relationship with health outcomes may vary across&#xD;
      different ethnical groups and most available data so far were from Caucasians populations, it&#xD;
      remains to be elucidated whether the findings from Western population could apply directly to&#xD;
      Asian peoples like Chinese. Recently, our group has conducted the first relatively&#xD;
      large-scale study in Asian to evaluate the association between 25(OH)D and risk of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. It was found that the geometric mean of plasma 25(OH)D in these Chinese adults aged&#xD;
      50-70 years from Beijing and Shanghai (n=3210) was 40.36 nmol/l and percentage of vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency [25(OH)D &lt;50 nmol/l] and insufficiency (50 ≤ 25(OH)D &lt; 75 nmol/l) were 69.2% and&#xD;
      24.4%, respectively. Comparing the lowest with the highest 25(OH)D quintile (≤28.7 nmol/l vs.&#xD;
      ≥57.7 nmol/l), the odds ratio for metabolic syndrome (MetS) was 1.52 (95% CI 1.17-1.98, P for&#xD;
      trend = 0.0002), after multiple adjustment. Significant inverse associations also existed&#xD;
      between 25(OH)D and most of MetS components, plus HbA1c. Moreover, low plasma 25(OH)D level&#xD;
      was found to be associated with increased insulin resistance index (homeostasis model&#xD;
      assessment of insulin resistance, HOMA-IR) in those overweight and obese individuals (BMI ≥24&#xD;
      kg/m2),. (Lu et al., Diabetes Care, 2009). According to the data from 2002 China National&#xD;
      Nutrition Survey, high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency also exited in Chinese children&#xD;
      aged 1-3 years and approximate 82% of them had circulating 25(OH)D ≤ 50nmol/L. In consistent&#xD;
      with our finding, a report from a population-based Korea study showed that the association&#xD;
      between 25(OH)D and insulin resistance was modified by BMI status (Choi et al.,The Journal of&#xD;
      Nutrition,2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our recent genetic study, it was found that genetic variants at GC and NADSYN1/DHCR7 were&#xD;
      significantly associated with circulating 25(OH)D levels while marginal association between&#xD;
      CYP2R1-rs2060793 and 25(OH)D levels was observed only in the Shanghai subpopulation (Lu et&#xD;
      al., Human Genetics 2011). In addition, we developed a genetic risk score (GRS) to evaluate&#xD;
      the combined effect of three SNPs (rs4588, rs1790349 and rs2060793) from GC, NADSYN1/DHCR7&#xD;
      and CYP2R. Notably, the average plasma 25(OH)D concentration in individuals with 5-6 risk&#xD;
      allele was 11.4 nmol/l lower than those without risk allele. Indeed, previous studies&#xD;
      suggested that intake of 100 IU vitamin D could only raise circulating 25(OH)D by 2.5 nmol/l,&#xD;
      implicating that 450 IU of extra vitamin D is required for these high risk individuals. The&#xD;
      possible interpretations for such a high prevalence of poor vitamin D nutrition among Chinese&#xD;
      may be due to the factors: (1) unlike United States and other Western countries, few, if any,&#xD;
      vitamin D enriched or fortiﬁed foods are available in China; (2) Chinese, particularly women,&#xD;
      like to have pale skin color, who therefore frequently utilize sunscreen and umbrella to&#xD;
      prevent sun exposure. (3) approximate 318 million people are living in Heilongjiang, Shaanxi,&#xD;
      Jilin, Shanxi, Liaoning, Qinghai, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Hebei provinces, the&#xD;
      areas with latitude N37°, which was previously showed to prevent skin synthesizing sufficient&#xD;
      vitamin D during winter time. Collectively, all of these factors suggest that large&#xD;
      proportions of Chinese may suffer vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency whereas the current&#xD;
      RDA in China might be too low to provide adequate vitamin D for people's health. In order to&#xD;
      fill up this gap, therefore, it is essential to study the bioavailability following vitamin D&#xD;
      intervention and also identify the effects of genetic variants and other factors on vitamin D&#xD;
      metabolism and associated health outcomes. Ultimately, the current study will provide&#xD;
      important evidence for establishing optimal vitamin D requirement for Chinese people.&#xD;
