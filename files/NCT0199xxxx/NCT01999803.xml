Serious Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Device Events will also be presented in separate tabulations.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of ALS classified as definite, or probable with or without&#xD;
             additional laboratory evidence, according to the revised World Federation of Neurology&#xD;
             (WFN) El Escorial criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If patients are being treated with riluzole, they must have been on a stable dose for&#xD;
             at least the past 30 days prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is, in the opinion of the investigator, medically fit to undergo the&#xD;
             surgery required for stereotactic implantation of the catheter and infusion pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Impaired respiratory function judged to pose a risk to the patient during anaesthesia&#xD;
             for the device implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hypertension defined as blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg diastolic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Values for coagulation parameters including platelet count, normalised prothrombin&#xD;
             complex (PK-INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) outside normal ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ophthalmological examination (fundus photography, visual acuity and perimetry) with&#xD;
             any clinically significant findings that imply safety concerns for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of structural brain disease other than ALS, including tumours and hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. An MRI of the brain and cervical spine, and an Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) of&#xD;
             the brain with findings of tumours or potential sources of pathological bleedings, or&#xD;
             abnormality that may interfere with the assessments of safety or efficacy or that&#xD;
             would, in the judgment of the investigator, represent a surgical risk to the patient.&#xD;
             If an MRI and/or MRA has been performed within 1 month prior to screening, the results&#xD;
             from that examination can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any disorder that precludes a surgical procedure (e.g., signs of sepsis or&#xD;
             inadequately treated infection), alters wound healing (e.g., including bleeding&#xD;
             disorders), or renders chronic i.c.v. delivery or device implants medically&#xD;
             unsuitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Presence of risk for increased or uncontrolled bleeding and/or risk of bleeding that&#xD;
             cannot be not managed optimally due to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. anatomical factors at or near the implant site (e.g., vascular abnormalities,&#xD;
             neoplasms, or other abnormalities), ii. underlying disorders of the coagulation&#xD;
             cascade, platelet function, or platelet count (e.g., haemophilia, Von Willebrand's&#xD;
             disease, liver disease, or other medical conditions) iii. administration of any&#xD;
             antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication in the preoperative period&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A personal history of thromboembolic disease. A family history of thromboembolic&#xD;
             disease will prompt a laboratory assessment to exclude hereditary liability before the&#xD;
             patient is declared eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Presence of additional risk factors for thromboembolism such as obesity (BMI &gt; 35) or&#xD;
             use of oestrogens including combined contraceptive pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of CSF or an implanted Central Nervous&#xD;
             System (CNS) catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Clinically significant abnormalities in haematology or clinical chemistry parameters&#xD;
             as assessed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Serological evidence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) or Human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Ongoing medical condition that according to the investigator would interfere with the&#xD;
             conduct and assessments in the study. Examples are medical disability (e.g., severe&#xD;
             degenerative arthritis, compromised nutritional state, peripheral neuropathy) that&#xD;
             would interfere with the assessment of safety and efficacy of investigational product&#xD;
             or device performance, or would compromise the ability of the patient to undergo study&#xD;
             procedures (e.g., MRI), or to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug or device within&#xD;
             3 months prior to screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. For women only: pregnant, breast feeding and/or for fecund women unwillingness to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception during the trial such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception&#xD;
                  that do NOT contain oestrogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Placement of an intrauterine device.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.&#xD;
