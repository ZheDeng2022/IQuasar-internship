  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While thyroid cancer is generally associated with a favourable prognosis, there is a&#xD;
      discrepancy with how important if not traumatic its impact can be on patients. Quality of&#xD;
      life (QoL) decreases in the year following a thyroid cancer diagnosis, constituting an&#xD;
      optimal period for a preventive intervention. The goal of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of offering an interdisciplinary team-based care approach for newly diagnosed thyroid&#xD;
      cancer patients, including a dedicated nurse who will provide important psychoeducational&#xD;
      elements identified in previous focus group studies of thyroid cancer patients, i.e.,&#xD;
      information on: the physical illness; the emotional impact of being newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      thyroid cancer; surgery and its' short- and long-term consequences; radioactive iodine&#xD;
      treatments and its associated safety precautions, nutrition and dietary considerations; and&#xD;
      how the cancer diagnosis can be an opportunity to make important lifestyle changes and&#xD;
      establish new life-priorities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will conduct a 2-arm Randomized Controlled Trial comparing an&#xD;
      Interdisciplinary Team-Based Care Approach to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research question will be: Does adding the Interdisciplinary Team-Based Care&#xD;
      Approach (ITCA-ThyCa) to usual care (EG) increase levels of overall QoL among newly diagnosed&#xD;
      thyroid cancer patients, compared with those receiving usual care (UC), at 9 months&#xD;
      post-randomization (i.e., after all of the dedicated-nurse meetings are administered) as&#xD;
      judged by scores on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-General (FACT-G)?&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: The EG will report higher scores of overall QoL on the FACT-G than the UC&#xD;
      at 9 months post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions: The investigators plan to evaluate ITCA-ThyCa effects on&#xD;
      secondary outcomes such as level of: physical health (SF-36 Physical Health subscale), mental&#xD;
      health (SF-36 Mental Health subscale), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness&#xD;
      Therapy-Fatigue; FACIT-F), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale;&#xD;
      HADS), and negative illness perception (Illness Perception Questionnaire - Revised (IPQ-R).&#xD;
      The investigators also plan to explore ITCA-ThyCa effects on satisfaction with care (16&#xD;
      questions of the NRC Picker satisfaction survey measuring patient satisfaction with care) and&#xD;
      healthcare service use (types of professionals consulted, frequency of visits, and time&#xD;
      elapsed between referral and first consultation). Hypotheses: The EG will report a higher&#xD;
      level of physical and mental health on the SF-Physical and Mental Health subscales,&#xD;
      respectively; and a lower level of fatigue on the FACIT-F, anxiety and depression on the&#xD;
      HADS, and negative illness perception on the IPQ-R; compared with the UC at 9 months&#xD;
      post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the abovementioned changes will be present throughout the treatment, namely at 7-10&#xD;
      days and 5 months post-randomization (i.e., immediately after each of the meetings planned&#xD;
      with the dedicated nurse).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the abovementioned changes will persist at 12 months post-randomization (i.e.,&#xD;
      corresponding to 6 months after all anti-cancer treatments are completed and 3 months after&#xD;
      all dedicated-nurse meetings have been administered).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility and acceptability (9 first months of the trial):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan on testing the feasibility and acceptability of the 2-arm RCT of&#xD;
      ITCA-ThyCa during the first 9 months of the trial (once the investigators start recruiting,&#xD;
      after the first 3-6 months dedicated to hiring our personnel and developing the manual of our&#xD;
      approach). During this phase, the investigators will aim to address the following research&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can the investigators recruit a sufficient number of patients (i.e., a minimum of 60&#xD;
           patients over 6 months or 10/month) and retain a sufficient proportion of thyroid cancer&#xD;
           patients (i.e., at least 80% at 7-10 days, 5 months or 9 months post-randomization) in&#xD;
           both trial arms?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is ITCA-ThyCa acceptable to at least 80% of EG thyroid cancer patients? Secondary pilot&#xD;
           study questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Which evaluation time should be primary post-randomization, based on an acceptable&#xD;
           retention rate of 80%?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What variance estimates can be used to inform calculation of sample size for the full&#xD;
           study?&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the design remains the same following this pilot, the investigators aim to roll in the&#xD;
      pilot data in the full trial.&#xD;

    <description>The delivered intervention will be to provide patients with an interdisciplinary team-based approach defined as care provided by a variety of professionals, each having their own domain of expertise, defined roles and responsibilities, who work together and meet to discuss patient needs and develop comprehensive treatment plans. Team composition will include physicians, a dedicated nurse, and allied professionals (e.g., dieticians, social workers, psychologists). The dedicated nurse will have a central integrative role in this interdisciplinary team and will provide patients with information about their illness and treatment, symptom management, emotional support, and reference to other resources when needed</description>

Second meeting: information on radioactive iodine treatments and its associated safety precautions, nutrition and dietary considerations. Third meeting: how the cancer diagnosis can be an opportunity to make important lifestyle changes and establish new life-priorities. The dedicated nurse, in collaboration with the Department of Nursing and ENT, will develop and implement an interdisciplinary team-based approached developed for this study according to guidelines of the Programme québécois de lutte contre le cancer (PQLC).</description>
