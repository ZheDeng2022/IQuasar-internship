      Hypothesis: 4 days of antibiotic therapy, as compared to 8 days, is equally effective and&#xD;
      results in decreased antibiotic exposure among surgical ICU patients with early VAP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens in intensive care units (ICUs)&#xD;
      worldwide has reached epidemic proportions. In some cases, the choice of potential therapy is&#xD;
      limited or even non-existent. Antibiotic prescription, through selection pressure, represents&#xD;
      the main mechanism by which resistance emerges. Limitations in the development of new&#xD;
      antibiotics underscores the importance of adherence to the principles of antibiotic&#xD;
      stewardship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common serious infection in mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated, critically ill patients. Approximately one half of antibiotic prescription in the&#xD;
      ICU is related to VAP, including prophylactic, empiric, and definitive therapy. The&#xD;
      development of evidence-based algorithms for the rational use of antibiotics in the&#xD;
      management of patients with both suspected and confirmed VAP is pivotal to decreasing the&#xD;
      emergence of MDR pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shortening the duration of antimicrobial therapy for VAP represents one strategy to curtail&#xD;
      the emergence of MDR pathogens. Although current guidelines recommend a treatment course of&#xD;
      8-14 days, both clinical and microbiologic resolution (MR) of infection typically occur much&#xD;
      sooner [10, 11]. In one study of ICU patients ventilated for &gt; 5 days who developed VAP, 8&#xD;
      days of antimicrobial therapy was equally as effective as 14 days, provided VAP was not&#xD;
      caused by a non-lactose fermenting gram negative bacillus. Favorable results following&#xD;
      shorter courses of therapy for VAP have been observed, albeit in small, uncontrolled series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One subset of patients for whom a decreased duration of antimicrobial therapy may be&#xD;
      particularly effective is those who develop VAP ≤ 5 days after intubation (early VAP). Early&#xD;
      VAP comprises approximately one half of cases of pneumonia diagnosed in the ICU. Furthermore,&#xD;
      as compared to patients who develop late VAP, patients who develop early VAP are more likely&#xD;
      to be infected with community-acquired pathogens sensitive to narrow spectrum antibiotics.&#xD;
      Finally, nearly all cases of early VAP caused by sensitive pathogens demonstrate MR after&#xD;
      relatively short (3-5 days) courses of therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Surgical patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. VAP, defined as clinical suspicion plus a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture showing&#xD;
             ≥105 cfu/mL of at least one pathogen. The quantitative microbiology threshold will be&#xD;
             lowered to ≥104 cfu/mL if the patient was being treated with antibiotics to which the&#xD;
             pathogen is sensitive at the time of the BAL. Clinical suspicion of VAP is defined as&#xD;
             at least one point for ≥ 2 variables in the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS,&#xD;
             described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ventilated ≤ 5 days at the time that the BAL was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Hospital LOS ≤ 5 days at the time that the BAL was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &lt; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior episode of VAP for the index admission (the patient may have had prior BALs sent&#xD;
             for culture, but these cannot have met the above mentioned diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
             VAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. VAP caused by a MDR pathogen: Early VAP is rarely caused by a MDR pathogen; in a&#xD;
             recent analysis of our surgical ICU, 94% of cases of early VAP were caused by a highly&#xD;
             sensitive pathogen (MSSA 39%, H flu 35%, S. pneumo 16%, E. coli 9%) (Pieracci in&#xD;
             press). Patients with early VAP caused by the following MDR pathogens will be&#xD;
             excluded: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-intermediate&#xD;
             Staphylococcus aureus (VISA), pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vancomycin-resistant&#xD;
             enterococcus (VRE), Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and&#xD;
             extended-spectrum beta lactamase producing gram negative bacilli.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Antibiotic therapy for ≥ 5 of the last 10 days preceding the BAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Septic shock, defined as evidence of tissue hypoperfusion after adequate volume&#xD;
             expansion, due to infection, and requiring ≥ 1 vasopressor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Current or recent (within 30 days) use of immunosuppressive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Length of stay ≥ 48 hours in a transferring facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Inpatient hospitalization within 30 days of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Legal arrest or incarceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Moribund state in which death is imminent.&#xD;
