  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing physical activity in older adults has important implications for treating obesity&#xD;
      related metabolic conditions, however the interaction of aging- and obesity-related declines&#xD;
      in physical function may make adding structured exercise particularly challenging for this&#xD;
      group. Given these challenges, an alternative prescription to traditional structured&#xD;
      exercise, may be short bouts of intermittent walking scattered throughout the day - this may&#xD;
      be an effective strategy to increase physical activity, reduce sedentary behavior, and&#xD;
      improve glycemic control in overweight/obese older adults. The purpose of this project is to&#xD;
      determine how interrupting sedentary time with short bouts of moderate intensity walking&#xD;
      affects important metabolic outcomes in older, overweight adults. It would also be of&#xD;
      interest to compare the effects of short, frequent interruptions in sedentary behavior to a&#xD;
      traditional exercise prescription (continuous 30 min walking bout) on metabolic outcomes&#xD;
      (e.g., glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and 24 h fat oxidation). Thus, the overall aims&#xD;
      of the proposed research are to 1) Determine the effect of performing short bouts of&#xD;
      moderate-intensity intermittent walking (IW) on glucose and insulin metabolism compared to&#xD;
      uninterrupted sitting (US) in older overweight and obese adults. 2) To compare the effects of&#xD;
      interrupting sedentary time (IW) vs. a traditional exercise prescription (continuous 30 m&#xD;
      walk (CW)) on metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that interrupting sedentary time with intermittent walking will&#xD;
      improve glucose and insulin metabolism compared to uninterrupted sitting and it will be as&#xD;
      effective at improving metabolism as a single continuous 30 min walk.&#xD;
