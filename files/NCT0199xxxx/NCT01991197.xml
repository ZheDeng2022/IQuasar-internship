  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if sitagliptin (Januvia®) improves&#xD;
      psoriasis severity after 16 weeks of treatment in 20 participants with both psoriasis and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. We will compare the change in psoriasis severity in 20 participants&#xD;
      treated with Januvia® to 20 participants treated with 16 weeks of a comparator drug&#xD;
      (gliclazide, Diamicron®). Participants will be recruited from two centres and after a 4 week&#xD;
      washout period will be followed prospectively for 36 weeks. Participants will be stratified&#xD;
      by centre, psoriasis severity and obesity status after which they will be randomly allocated&#xD;
      to Arm A or Arm B. Participants will be treated with either Januvia® and Diamicron® matched&#xD;
      placebo capsules (Arm A), or Diamicron® and Januvia® matched placebo tablets (Arm B) for 16&#xD;
      weeks and then proceed to an open-label phase where all participants will receive Januvia®&#xD;
      for a further 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the research participants and the investigators will be unaware of the trial arm to&#xD;
      which the research participant has been allocated (double-blind study). Research participants&#xD;
      will be prohibited from making any changes to the dose of medications used to treat&#xD;
      psoriasis. If a participant's plasma glycated haemoglobin level (HbA1c) (reflects a&#xD;
      participant's glucose control over the previous 3 months) is above 64mmol/mol eight weeks&#xD;
      after commencing one of the study investigational medicinal products (IMPs) insulin therapy&#xD;
      will be used to improve glycaemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at 9 study visits over 40 weeks. Participants will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires, have a medical history recorded and physical examination, blood sampling and&#xD;
      skin biopsies taken (in a small number of willing participants at 3 visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following endpoints will be analysed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in psoriasis severity at 16 and 32 weeks; changes in validated quality of life&#xD;
      scores; incidence of adverse events; incidence of discontinuation of one of the study IMPs,&#xD;
      time to relapse of psoriasis; changes in cardiovascular disease risk factor profiles; changes&#xD;
      in cytokines, hormones, expression of immune proteins in blood and skin biopsies; and genetic&#xD;
      profiles that predicts best response to sitagliptin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that sitagliptin therapy decreases psoriasis severity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease affecting approximately 2% of the world's&#xD;
      population. It is characterised by keratinocyte hyperproliferation, by aberrant keratinocyte&#xD;
      differentiation and by cutaneous inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is expressed on keratinocytes and its activity is upregulated&#xD;
      in psoriasis. DPP-4 inhibition suppresses keratinocyte proliferation and restores partially&#xD;
      keratinocyte differentiation. The main site of DPP-4 activity is cluster of differentiation&#xD;
      antigen 26 (CD26). CD26 is a marker of T cell activation and is a key molecule in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. One case of DPP-4 inhibitor therapy improving psoriasis&#xD;
      severity has been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agents used to treat psoriasis target commonly the underlying inflammation. C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP) is a sensitive, systemic marker of inflammation. In people with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2DM) DPP-4 inhibitor therapy decreases CRP concentrations. Serum CRP concentrations&#xD;
      correlate with psoriasis severity and interventions that decrease the CRP concentration may&#xD;
      decrease also psoriasis severity. Medications that improve insulin resistance may decrease&#xD;
      also systemic inflammation and improve psoriasis. We have shown previously, in psoriasis&#xD;
      patients without T2DM (both lean and obese), that the fasting insulin concentration and the&#xD;
      homeostatic model of insulin resistance (measures of insulin resistance) correlate strongly&#xD;
      with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI, a measure of psoriasis severity: r=0.48,&#xD;
      p&lt;0.001; r=0.49, p&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DPP-4 inhibitors prevent also the degradation of insulin secretagogues, such as glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide-1 (GLP-1), thereby ameliorating hyperglycaemia without causing hypoglycaemia. Due to&#xD;
      this effect DPP-4 inhibitors are effective for the treatment of T2DM. Other interventions&#xD;
      which increase GLP-1 receptor activation, such as roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and GLP-1&#xD;
      analogue therapy, can improve also psoriasis severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have reported previously a significant improvement in two patients with psoriasis and&#xD;
      diabetes treated with the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide. In a subsequent open study of 7&#xD;
      patients with both psoriasis and type 2 diabetes we found a significant reduction in&#xD;
      psoriasis severity and a significant improvement in quality of life following treatment with&#xD;
      liraglutide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name and Description of the Investigational Medicinal Products(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four investigational medicinal products will be used in this clinical trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Januvia® 50 mg film-coated tablets, which are film-coated tablets for oral ingestion&#xD;
           that contain 50mg of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Januvia® matched placebo tablets, which are tablets that are identical appearance and&#xD;
           composition to Januvia® 50mg tablets with the exception of not containing sitagliptin,&#xD;
           the active ingredient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Capsules containing Diamicron® 80mg tablets, which are tablets for oral ingestion that&#xD;
           contain 80mg of the sulphonylurea gliclazide; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Diamicron® matched capsules, which will be identical in appearance and composition to&#xD;
           capsules containing Diamicron® 80mg tablets with the exception of not containing the&#xD;
           Diamicron® 80mg tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks and benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 1% of people who take Januvia® tablets experience upper respiratory tract infection&#xD;
      (no greater incidence than with placebo), hypoglycaemia (no greater incidence than with&#xD;
      placebo), headache or limb pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefits of DPP-4 inhibition include decreased risk of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      and decreased risk of bone fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ADVANCE trial participants allocated randomly to receive Diamicron modified release&#xD;
      (MR)® tablets (n=5,571), when compared to their counterparts allocated to standard glucose&#xD;
      control (n=5,569), experienced a greater incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (0.7 events per&#xD;
      100 patients per year versus 0.4 events per 100 patients per year), a greater incidence of&#xD;
      hospitalisation (44.9% versus 42.8%) and less of a decrease in weight (0.7kg in the&#xD;
      difference).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, ADVANCE trial participants who were allocated to receive Diamicron MR®&#xD;
      experienced improved glycaemic control (mean glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 6.5% versus 7.3%),&#xD;
      improved blood pressure control (mean systolic blood pressure 135.5mmHg versus 137.9mmHg) and&#xD;
      a decreased incidence of new or worsening nephropathy (4.1% versus 5.2%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated benefits of Januvia® or Diamicron® therapy in psoriasis patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes thus justify the potential risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of and justification for the route of administration, dosage, dosage regimen and&#xD;
      treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a two centre, forty week, prospective, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, cross-over clinical trial of oral Januvia® (sitagliptin) tablets and oral&#xD;
      Diamicron® (gliclazide) capsules in 40 people with type 2 diabetes and psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first four weeks participants who are in receipt of sulphonylurea or incretin therapy&#xD;
      will stop taking this medication. During this period research participants will not receive&#xD;
      either investigational medicinal product (IMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this four week washout period research participants will be stratified by centre, by&#xD;
      psoriasis severity (PASI 7-10, 10.1-13 or &gt;13) and by obesity status (BMI 18-24.9kg/m2,&#xD;
      25-29.9kg/m2 or &gt;30kg/m2) after which they will be allocated randomly, in a 1:1 ratio using&#xD;
      blocks, either to Arm A or to Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants allocated to Arm A will receive an eighteen week supply of Januvia®&#xD;
      50mg tablets (DPP-4 inhibitor) and will receive a six week supply of Diamicron® matched&#xD;
      placebo capsules (during visit 2). The research participants will be instructed to ingest&#xD;
      orally two Januvia® 50mg tablets once daily for 16 weeks (until visit 5) and to ingest also&#xD;
      one Diamicron® matched placebo capsule once daily for 4 weeks (until visit 3). If a&#xD;
      participant has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 50ml/min/1.73m2 the&#xD;
      participant will be instructed to ingest orally one Januvia® 50mg tablet once daily (in&#xD;
      addition to one Diamicron® matched placebo). After four weeks research participants allocated&#xD;
      to Arm A will receive a further six week supply of Diamicron® matched placebo capsules,&#xD;
      provided that they have not experienced any severe hypoglycaemic episodes. At this stage they&#xD;
      will be instructed to ingest orally one capsule twice daily for 4 weeks (until visit 4).&#xD;
      After four weeks research participants allocated to Arm A will receive a further ten week&#xD;
      supply of Diamicron® matched placebo capsules, provided that they have not experienced any&#xD;
      severe hypoglycaemic episodes, and will be instructed to ingest orally two capsules twice&#xD;
      daily for 8 weeks (until visit 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants allocated to Arm B will receive an eighteen week supply of Januvia®&#xD;
      matched placebo tablets and will receive a six week supply of capsules each containing a&#xD;
      Diamicron® 80mg tablet (sulphonylurea, during visit 2). The research participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to ingest orally two Januvia® matched placebo tablets once daily for 16 weeks&#xD;
      (until visit 5) and to ingest also one capsule containing a Diamicron® 80mg tablet once daily&#xD;
      for 4 weeks (until visit 3). If a participant has an estimated glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      (eGFR) less than 50ml/min/1.73m2 the participant will be instructed to ingest orally one&#xD;
      Januvia® matched placebo tablet once daily (in addition to capsules containing Diamicron®&#xD;
      80mg tablets). After four weeks research participants allocated to Arm B will receive a&#xD;
      further six weeks supply of capsules containing a Diamicron® 80mg tablet, provided that they&#xD;
      have not experienced any severe hypoglycaemic episodes. At this stage they will be instructed&#xD;
      to ingest orally one capsule twice daily for 4 weeks (until visit 4). After four weeks&#xD;
      research participants allocated to Arm B will receive a further ten weeks supply of capsules&#xD;
      containing a Diamicron® 80mg tablet, provided that they have not experienced any severe&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic episodes, and will be instructed to ingest orally two capsules twice daily for&#xD;
      8 weeks (until visit 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Januvia® 50mg tablets will be identical in appearance to the Januvia® matched placebo&#xD;
      tablets. Similarly the capsules containing a Diamicron® 80mg tablet will be identical in&#xD;
      appearance to the Diamicron® matched capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be advised to take Diamicron® / Diamicron® matched capsules immediately&#xD;
      prior to food intake/main meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial sixteen weeks of treatment all research participants (in both Arm A and Arm&#xD;
      B) will progress to the open-label phase of the trial, and will receive an eighteen week&#xD;
      supply of Januvia® 50mg tablets (DPP-4 Inhibitor) and will be instructed to ingest orally two&#xD;
      tablets once daily for sixteen weeks (unless the eGFR is &lt;50ml/min/1.73m2 in which case the&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to ingest orally one tablet once daily for the sixteen&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the research participants nor the investigators will be aware of the trial arm to&#xD;
      which the research participant has been allocated (double-blinded study). After sixteen weeks&#xD;
      both the research participants and the investigators will be aware that the research&#xD;
      participants are receiving Januvia® 50mg tablets (open-label extension). Research&#xD;
      participants will be prohibited from making any changes to the dose of medications used to&#xD;
      treat psoriasis. If a participant's plasma glycated haemoglobin level (HbA1c) is above&#xD;
      64mmol/mol eight weeks after commencing one of the study IMPs insulin therapy will be used to&#xD;
      improve glycaemic control. Participants who are already in receipt of metformin therapy will&#xD;
      continue to take this medication. Every effort will be made not to make any (other) changes&#xD;
      to the participant's current regimen of anti-psoriasis or anti-diabetes medications for the&#xD;
      duration of their involvement in the study. Participants who require insulin therapy will be&#xD;
      referred to the diabetes centre for standard initiation of insulin therapy and for monitoring&#xD;
      of capillary glucose levels. Any other medications that are considered necessary for the&#xD;
      participant's welfare and will not interfere with the study medication may be given at the&#xD;
      discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Januvia® is licensed to improve glycaemic control for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The&#xD;
      Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) states that the dose of Januvia® is 100mg once daily&#xD;
      (using tablets for oral ingestion). For research participants with moderate kidney disease&#xD;
      (CrCl &lt; 50 ml/min or eGFR &lt; 50 ml/min/1.73m2), the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC)&#xD;
      states that the dose of Januvia® is 50mg once daily (using tablets for oral ingestion). In&#xD;
      keeping with this all participants with an eGFR &lt; 50ml/min/1.73m2 who are due to receive&#xD;
      Januvia® will receive 50mg once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of Diamicron® to be used in the study (80mg per day initially and increasing to&#xD;
      320mg per day in successive steps) is consistent with the doses stated in the SPC for the&#xD;
      marketed product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor therapy decreases psoriasis severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of Trial Conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, with the guidelines of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki (see Appendix 2), with the International Conference of Harmonisation&#xD;
      Tripartite Guideline on Good Clinical Practice, with all applicable regulatory requirements&#xD;
      and with data protection legislation (Data Protection Act 1988 and Data Protection Amendment&#xD;
      Act 2003)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population to be studied will be psoriasis patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enrol 40 research participants in total. Research participants will be recruited&#xD;
      from two centres: St Vincent's University Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin 4 and Adelaide and Meath&#xD;
      Hospital, Tallaght, Dublin 24. These hospitals provide outpatient dermatology services.&#xD;
      Psoriasis patients attending these centres who have a psoriasis area and severity index&#xD;
      (PASI) greater than 7 and who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes will be will be&#xD;
      considered potentially eligible research participants and will be invited to attend for a&#xD;
      screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification and Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible research participants will be identified through use of patient&#xD;
      databases in St Vincent's University Hospital and in Adelaide and Meath Hospital and through&#xD;
      review of healthcare records in St Vincent's University Hospital and in Adelaide and Meath&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible research participants will be recruited in one of two ways by the study&#xD;
      investigators or suitably qualified designee. One of these two ways will be during a clinic&#xD;
      visit by the study investigators or suitably qualified designee. The other of the two ways&#xD;
      will be mailing a letter of invitation. Before a potential research participant is mailed a&#xD;
      letter of invitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A record of all medication taken by study participants in the month before visit 1 and&#xD;
      concomitant medication a participant takes throughout the study will be recorded on the&#xD;
      appropriate page of the Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment compliance of research participants will be measured by pill counts. Research&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to bring opened, unopened and empty investigational medicinal&#xD;
      product packages to each visit in order to allow the assessment of compliance with study&#xD;
      treatment. A record of all investigational medicinal product dispensed and returned will be&#xD;
      documented on the investigational medicinal product dispensing and accountability log. Blood&#xD;
      taken during stages when the participant is expected to be taking drug therapy will be used&#xD;
      for future determination of plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin concentrations. These&#xD;
      concentrations will also be used to help ascertain compliance with the allocated treatment&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for measurement of laboratory parameters will be taken between the hours of&#xD;
      0800 and 1200 after a greater than 12 hour overnight fast (with the exception of the&#xD;
      Screening Visit when participants can attend in a non fasting state) and before ingestion of&#xD;
      the study investigational medicinal product. The blood will be taken by a senior clinician,&#xD;
      or suitably qualified designee, with competence and experience in the procedure of&#xD;
      venepuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      73.5ml of blood will be drawn from the research participants during Visit 2, 60ml of blood&#xD;
      will be drawn during visits 3, 4, 6 &amp; 7, 67.5 mls during visits 5 &amp; 8, and 30ml of blood will&#xD;
      be drawn during visit 1 and visit 9. Blood will be drawn into vacutainer tubes containing&#xD;
      either ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), lithium heparin, sodium fluoride, clot&#xD;
      activator or a DPP4 inhibitor cocktail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each research participant will be asked to give a blood sample for genetic analysis at the&#xD;
      2nd Visit. These genetic samples will be analysed to try determine the genetic, and/or&#xD;
      epigenetic, profile that predicts best response to DPP-4 inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood will be stored for future DNA extraction using the protocols detailed in the&#xD;
      Molecular Medicine Ireland Guideline for Standardised Biobanking (First Edition 2010). This&#xD;
      involves drawing blood into a blood tube containing EDTA and storing the blood tube at -20°C&#xD;
      in secure, dedicated freezers in the Research Laboratories in the Education and Research&#xD;
      Centre in St Vincent's University Hospital. The blood will be stored within 12 hours of blood&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood that has been stored for future DNA extraction will be destroyed once the DNA analyses&#xD;
      are complete. Disposal of this material will be in accordance with current practice in this&#xD;
      unit and with the written protocols in place in this unit. Disposal will involve the use of&#xD;
      solid plastic waste containers which will be sent for incineration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To protect the research participant's identity, a unique identification code will be assigned&#xD;
      by the Investigator, or authorised designee, to each participant's genetic sample and used in&#xD;
      lieu of the participant's name. This coded form of identification, instead of the&#xD;
      participant's name, will appear on all documents/databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and baseline clinical data will be summarized using descriptive statistics by&#xD;
      treatment group. Similarly, the primary and secondary efficacy variables will be summarized&#xD;
      using descriptive statistics by treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from research participants who are not allocated to either arm of the study and who do&#xD;
      not receive a supply of either investigational medicinal product will be excluded from&#xD;
      statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T tests (or the appropriate alternative for non-parametric data), using two-sided tests, will&#xD;
      be used to test for significant differences between the sets of data obtained. The&#xD;
      independent samples T test will be used to assess for differences between the effects of the&#xD;
      test product (Januvia®) compared to the differences of the comparator product (Diamicron®).&#xD;
      Chi square analyses will be used to test for significant differences in categorical variables&#xD;
      between the sets of data obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses will be performed on those research participants who:&#xD;
&#xD;
      complete the visit 6 assessment; have severe psoriasis; have non-severe psoriasis; are male;&#xD;
      are female; are obese; and are older than 45 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Packaging and Labelling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study medication will be labelled and stored in accordance with Annex 13 of the EU&#xD;
      guidelines of good manufacturing practice in respect of investigational medicinal products&#xD;
      for human use, the SPC and hospital procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study assessments will then be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit (Visit 1, week -4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Checking against inclusion and exclusion criteria to confirm suitability to participate&#xD;
           in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Demographic information;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obtaining a detailed medical history (previously diagnosed illnesses etc);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Obtaining a detailed medication history for the previous 6 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measurement of weight, blood pressure and heart rate;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Performing a urine based pregnancy test (women of child bearing potential only);&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Assessment of PASI; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Blood sampling for laboratory examination as specified in Table 2; Laboratory Parameters&#xD;
           above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (Visit 2, Day 0) The potential research participant will return for the baseline&#xD;
      visit three to five weeks after the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Completion of quality of life questionnaires by the research participant (Dermatology&#xD;
           Life Quality Index (DLQI); EuroQol five item questionnaire (EQ-5D); Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
           Depression Scale (HADS); and Stanford HAQ 8-Item Disability Scale (HAQ-8);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recording of adverse events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recording of changes in concomitant medication;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measurement of height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Early Withdrawal visit All research participants who withdraw early from the study will be&#xD;
      advised to agree to attend an early withdrawal visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a separate section in the CRF to be completed if the research participant&#xD;
      withdraws early from the study before week 36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research participant's involvement in this study will end following the completion of the&#xD;
      End of Study Visit (or Early Withdrawal visit if applicable). Once participants have&#xD;
      completed their involvement in this study they will be provided with standard treatment by&#xD;
      their usual healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive assessments of any apparent toxicity experienced by the research participant&#xD;
      will be performed throughout the course of the study from the time of participant's signature&#xD;
      of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) considered related to Study Drug at the End of Study Visit (or Early&#xD;
      Withdrawal Visit, if applicable) will be followed until the participant is stable or the AE&#xD;
      is resolved or the participant is lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any medical condition, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date&#xD;
      before the Baseline Visit and not related to a protocol-associated procedure, is not an AE.&#xD;
      It will be considered to be pre-existing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete and appropriate data on all Adverse Events experienced (observed, volunteered or&#xD;
      elicited) during the reporting period will be reported on an ongoing basis in the Adverse&#xD;
      Event Form pages of the Case Report Form. The investigator will classify the severity of an&#xD;
      adverse event. The investigator will systematically assess the relationship of the adverse&#xD;
      event to the investigational medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Information about all SAEs will be collected and&#xD;
      recorded on the SAE Report Form. Each SAE must be reported by the Investigator, or an&#xD;
      authorised designee, to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and scientific judgement will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is&#xD;
      appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately&#xD;
      life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation, but may jeopardise the research&#xD;
      participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the&#xD;
      definition above. These will be considered also serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of Population and Method of Estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enrol 40 research participants in total in the two sites. The primary objective of&#xD;
      the research project is to determine the change in the psoriasis area and severity index&#xD;
      (ΔPASI) during 16 weeks of treatment with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (Januvia®, 100mg&#xD;
      daily, or 50mg daily for participants with moderate kidney disease) in psoriasis patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes. This will be compared to the ΔPASI in psoriasis patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes during 16 weeks of treatment with a comparator (Diamicron® 80mg to 320mg daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mittal et al. have determined previously the effect of twelve weeks of pioglitazone therapy&#xD;
      (which lowers glucose levels) on the decrease in PASI in 41 psoriasis patients commencing&#xD;
      acitretin therapy18. The decrease in the PASI was 64.2% (95% confidence interval (CI)&#xD;
      49.2%-79.3%) in those treated with pioglitazone compared to a decrease of 51.7% (95% CI,&#xD;
      38.7%-64.7%) in those treated with placebo (p=0.04).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data, and assuming a 33% dropout rate, we have calculated that we will require&#xD;
      40 research participants to detect a greater than 5% difference in the change in PASI with&#xD;
      80% power at the 5% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unit of randomisation will be the individual research participant. After stratification&#xD;
      by centre, by psoriasis severity (PASI 7-10, 10.1-13 or &gt;13) and by obesity status (BMI&#xD;
      18-24.9kg/m2, 25-29.9kg/m2 or &gt;30kg/m2) 40 research participants will be assigned randomly,&#xD;
      in a ratio of 1:1 using blocks of 2, to receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Januvia® tablets followed by Januvia® tablets; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diamicron® capsules followed by Januvia® tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve this we have prepared 9 randomisation lists using a web-based random&#xD;
      generator programme. One copy of this document will be used for each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant the investigator, or authorised designee, will chose the appropriate&#xD;
      list and will add the participant's identifier to the list in chronological order. This list&#xD;
      will be thereby used to determine the study treatment which the participant will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random allocation will occur at visit 2 (baseline visit) once all screening procedures&#xD;
      required at visit 1 (screening visit) have been completed, once it has been confirmed that&#xD;
      the participant satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria and once the participant&#xD;
      completes the four week run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification numbers will be assigned chronologically in consecutive, ascending order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before initiating this study the Study Protocol, Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC),&#xD;
      Patient Information Leaflet and Informed Consent Form, applicable advertising, and any other&#xD;
      written information to be given to participants will be reviewed and approved by a properly&#xD;
      constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC/IRB). A signed and&#xD;
      dated statement that all documents submitted for review have been approved by the IEC/IRB&#xD;
      will be given to the Sponsor or designee before the study can commence at a site. The&#xD;
      membership and the constitution of the IEC/IRB who approved the documents will be also&#xD;
      supplied to the Sponsor or designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
