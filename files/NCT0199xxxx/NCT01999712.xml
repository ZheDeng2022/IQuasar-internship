  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a portable mechanical pump that helps the left&#xD;
      side of the heart of patients with severe heart failure that are awaiting heart&#xD;
      transplantation or are not transplant candidates. However, while LVAD supports the left side&#xD;
      of the heart, the right side must work on its own. Sometimes the right side does not recover,&#xD;
      a condition called right ventricular failure (RVF). This complication increases mortality,&#xD;
      prolongs hospitalization, requires additional procedures, and increases costs. Several risk&#xD;
      factors and scores have been proposed to identify patients at risk for RVF. However, these&#xD;
      methods have proven inadequate; one out of three patients is still experiencing right&#xD;
      ventricular failure after LVAD surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography, an established noninvasive method to see the heart without radiation or&#xD;
      risk, has a lot of potential to identify patients at risk for RVF. The questions we will tray&#xD;
      to answer with this American Heart Association funded project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can echocardiography before scheduled LVAD surgery predict who is going to develop RVF&#xD;
           and poor quality of life so we can better select patients for LVAD surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can echocardiography before scheduled LVAD surgery tell us the course of right&#xD;
           ventricular function after implantation so we can potentially take additional measures&#xD;
           and prevent RVF?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer these questions, we will record images of the heart with echocardiography before&#xD;
      LVAD surgery in 120 LVAD recipients at Emory University. We will then follow the patients for&#xD;
      90 days to detect any symptoms and signs of clinical RVF and poor quality of life and record&#xD;
      the course of right ventricular function with echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, it is estimated that 150,000 to 250,000 patients in US are potential LVAD&#xD;
      recipients with 2,000 devices implanted in 2012. LVAD can improve survival and quality of&#xD;
      life in suitable patients. However, implantation requires a major surgical procedure with&#xD;
      associated risks and considerable resources. Thus, careful patient selection is necessary to&#xD;
      minimize risk for patients and maximize benefit for patients and society. Our long-term goal&#xD;
      is to use echocardiography as a tool to (1) optimally select patients for LVAD and offer&#xD;
      alternatives to patients at increased risk for complications and (2) potentially, inform&#xD;
      earlier LVAD implantation in patients with weakening right ventricular function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite (1) improved outcomes and lower rates of right ventricular failure (RVF) with the&#xD;
      newer, continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) over pulsatile-flow devices and&#xD;
      (2) development of clinical prediction scores to identify patients at risk for RVF post LVAD,&#xD;
      RVF still occurs in 20% to 40% of recipients, even with the newer devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, 2000 LVADs were implanted in U.S. and the number is rapidly increasing. Post-LVAD&#xD;
      outcomes depend critically on right ventricular (RV) function. RVF can lead to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced survival and progression to transplant (Tx) and worse post-Tx outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significantly higher rates of resources utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term poor exercise capacity and quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      True echocardiographic quantification of RV function has only recently been considered in RVF&#xD;
      prediction post LVAD; however these studies were retrospective and had inconsistent&#xD;
      population and outcome definitions. Also, despite promising results in a retrospective study,&#xD;
      preoperative RV mechanics have not been prospectively evaluated as RVF predictors to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we plan to enroll a total of 120 LVAD candidates to evaluate standard and&#xD;
      mechanics-based echocardiographic measures of RV function for prediction of (1) RVF within 90&#xD;
      days; (2) QoL at 90 days; and (3) RV recovery at 90 days post LVAD implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: We will perform echocardiography within 7 days of planned LVAD surgery to evaluate the&#xD;
      association of prespecified RV parameters with (1) RVF within 90 days and (2) QoL at 90 days.&#xD;
      Our main hypotheses is an RV echo score will predict RVF within 90 days post LVAD with&#xD;
      clinically relevant discrimination (C&gt;0.85) and positive and negative predictive values&#xD;
      (&gt;80%). Our secondary hypothesis is that the RV score will predict poor QoL at 90 days with&#xD;
      clinically relevant discrimination and predictive values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: We will repeat echocardiograms at 30 and 90 days post LVAD surgery to examine the&#xD;
      association of baseline RV function with RV recovery. Our hypothesis is that the RV score&#xD;
      will predict RV function recovery post LVAD and that RV mechanics will have incremental value&#xD;
      for prediction of these outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results may help improve LVAD outcomes and reduce resource utilization by facilitating&#xD;
      shared decision-making and selection for LVAD vs. alternatives; provide insights into RV&#xD;
      function recovery; and inform reassessment of LVAD timing.&#xD;
