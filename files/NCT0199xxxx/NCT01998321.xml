      the Purpose of this study was to evaluate the short term outcome of patient specific&#xD;
      instrument (PSI) in cases of bilateral simultaneous total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis with sever varus&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of knee Osteoarthritis is variable and it is very high in Far East 47.0% and&#xD;
      70.2% in men and women respectively, while it is 17.2% and 82.8% in male and females&#xD;
      respectively in Middle East. The incidence of bilateral knee Osteoarthritis is 48%. TKA is&#xD;
      the standard treatment for Osteoarthritis. Many authors prefer bilateral simultaneous TKA can&#xD;
      be performed for straight forward cases of Knee Osteoarthritis, although it has higher&#xD;
      complication rate that could be discouraging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee Osteoarthritis could be associated with articular deformities such as varus, valgus,&#xD;
      flexion deformity and rarely recurvatum. These deformities could be associated with bone&#xD;
      loss, ligamentous laxity, leg length discrepancy, bilateral shortening and disfigurement.&#xD;
      These deformities need to be corrected during TKA and this make the procedure more difficult&#xD;
      especially in severe cases with associated problems as described above. Some patients with&#xD;
      knee Osteoarthritis present late when the condition becomes bilateral with sever articular&#xD;
      deformity. Late presentation is a common feather in developing countries and low income&#xD;
      countries and also in Middle and Far East.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the progression of Knee Osteoarthritis patient's condition deteriorates gradually, both&#xD;
      local and generally with increasing loss of cartilage and bone leading to deformities and&#xD;
      joint laxity. This general condition with the increasing disability leads to high risk of&#xD;
      associated obesity and comorbidities. The late presentation is multifactorial and complex to&#xD;
      explain. There are obvious reasons such as economic constrain, late referral, lake of&#xD;
      experienced surgeons and high demand and expectation such as full flexion in Middle and Far&#xD;
      East. There are other unexplained reasons such as fear of surgeries, misconception about TKA&#xD;
      and psychological factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unilateral TKA for patients with bilateral knee Osteoarthritis with sever articular&#xD;
      deformities is not beneficial to the patients, as it does not allow correction of the&#xD;
      deformities and easier rehabilitation, and may not be satisfying for the patient because&#xD;
      patient left with a straight knee after TKA and a deformed knee in the other side that leads&#xD;
      to difficult rehabilitation and may force the TKA to get the same deformity to adapt to the&#xD;
      other knee. With this dissatisfaction the patient may refuse to have the other knee done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bilateral simultaneous TKA in patient with sever articular deformities is beneficial to the&#xD;
      patients as it allows correction of the deformities and easier rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However bilateral simultaneous TKA for such complex cases is a very demanding procedure and&#xD;
      could be associated with a higher rate of complications such as fat embolism , mortality,&#xD;
      infection, bleeding, deep venous thrombosis, and general complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSI could be useful for bilateral simultaneous TKA because it eliminates the use of&#xD;
      intramedullary guides and may reduce operative time, bleeding and risk of complications such&#xD;
      as fat embolism or infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to review the outcome of using PSI in bilateral simultaneous TKA for&#xD;
      patient with sever articular deformities which is common in middle east region.&#xD;
