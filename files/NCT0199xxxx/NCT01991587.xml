  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase I/II trial conducted in a single centre, observer-blind, randomized, dose-ranging,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single&#xD;
      intramuscular injection of plant-based Seasonal Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine&#xD;
      administered to healthy adults 18-49 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of one hundred and twenty (120) subjects will be randomized in four (4) groups of 30&#xD;
      subjects to receive one injection of either a low, a medium, or a high dose level of VLP of&#xD;
      the quadrivalent VLP influenza vaccine or the placebo preparation (100 millimolar (mM)&#xD;
      phosphate buffer + 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) + 0.01% Tween 80).&#xD;

      The Phase 1 portion of this study will be a dose escalation, cohort staggering (slow&#xD;
      enrollment) for the 3 dose levels (low, medium or high dose level) with a placebo-controlled&#xD;
      group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: A first cohort of thirteen subjects (13) subjects will be randomized, of these&#xD;
           ten (10) will be dosed with the lowest dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine and three&#xD;
           (3) will receive a placebo. The 7-day safety data after the immunization will be&#xD;
           collected and reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of the&#xD;
           Principal Investigator (PI), the Sponsor's Medical Officer and one external medical&#xD;
           expert, prior to permitting immunization with the medium dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: A second cohort of thirteen subjects (13) subjects will be randomized; of&#xD;
           these, ten (10) will be dosed with the medium dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine and&#xD;
           three (3) will receive a placebo. The 7-day safety data after the immunization will be&#xD;
           collected and reviewed by the DSMB, prior to permitting immunization with the highest&#xD;
           dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: A third cohort of fourteen subjects (14) subjects will be randomized; of these&#xD;
           ten (10) dosed with the high dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine and four (4) will&#xD;
           receive a placebo. The 7-day safety data after the immunization will be collected and&#xD;
           reviewed by the DSMB. If the 7-day post-immunization safety data of this cohort is&#xD;
           satisfactory according to the DSMB review, the Phase 2 portion of the study will&#xD;
           proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 portion of this study will be an observer-blind, randomized, dose-ranging study&#xD;
      of the 3 different vaccine doses or a placebo. Therefore, the remaining 20 subjects per&#xD;
      vaccine dose will be dosed with the remaining 20 subjects of the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three (3) and 21 days after immunization, key safety (Day 3) and immunogenicity (Day 21) data&#xD;
      will be collected and analyzed. All subjects will be followed for safety until Day 201&#xD;
      (6-month follow up), regardless the phase of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric&#xD;
             illness. &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;

          2. Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition or any history of excessive alcohol use or&#xD;
             drug abuse which, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject incompetent&#xD;
             to provide informed consent or unable to provide valid safety observations and&#xD;
             reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition or immunodeficiency including&#xD;
             history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, Hepatitis B or C, or the&#xD;
