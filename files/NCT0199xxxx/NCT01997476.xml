  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is, to develop a standard of care protocol using the combination of&#xD;
      EUS, ePFT, and sEUS during one endoscopic session (instead of the three separate endoscopic&#xD;
      sessions). The desired outcome is to diagnose CP and to establish an acceptable protocol for&#xD;
      performing this combined technique. It is expected that combining these procedures will&#xD;
      eliminate redundant portions of the procedures, reduce repeat visits to the hospital, reduce&#xD;
      total recovery time for the patient, and will decrease the associated costs of separate&#xD;
      procedures. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is an irreversible, disease in which the pancreas&#xD;
      becomes fibrotic ( thickened and scarred). Symptoms almost always include pain, and as the&#xD;
      pancreas becomes progressively more fibrosed (thickened), pancreatic hormonal function is&#xD;
      compromised with diarrhea and weight loss. However, while most physicians can readily&#xD;
      diagnose patients with severe CP, early CP or &quot;minimal-change&quot; CP is difficult to detect,&#xD;
      often due to the lack of radiologic findings, laboratory tests and classic symptoms. As a&#xD;
      result, clinicians are searching for diagnostic tools which will allow for earlier, accurate&#xD;
      detection of this disease, with the hope that appropriate therapy can be initiated before&#xD;
      extensive thickening and scarring of the pancreas occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic tools to evaluate the pancreas include Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS),&#xD;
      hormone-stimulated endoscopic pancreatic function tests (ePFT) and Secretin stimulated&#xD;
      Endoscopic Pancreas Function Test (sPFT) using pancreatic fluid (containing bicarbonate)&#xD;
      obtained from the duodenum (the part of the intestine where the stomach opens into the small&#xD;
      bowel). EUS is increasingly being used as a diagnostic and treatment tool in pancreatic&#xD;
      disease. Currently, hormone-stimulated ePFT is considered the best way to diagnose chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis (long-lasting inflammation and scarring of the pancreas), and removes the need&#xD;
      for biopsy or surgery. It is also sensitive in detecting mild disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These procedures are standard of care (the normal care you would receive) for the evaluation&#xD;
      of CP. The purpose of this study, is to develop a standard of care protocol using the&#xD;
      combination of EUS, ePFT, and sEUS during one endoscopic session, instead of three separate&#xD;
      endoscopic procedures.&#xD;

      Combined EUS, e-PFT and sEUS Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endoscopic procedures for this study will be performed by a single endoscopist at each&#xD;
      center. It is expected that the combined EUS, ePFT and sEUS will be completed in less than 75&#xD;
      minutes. Patient sedation will be accomplished via standard conscious (Midazolam, Fentanyl&#xD;
      and/or Meperidine) sedation or monitored (Propofol) sedation as per the study investigator&#xD;
      and America Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) and American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiology (ASA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mechanical-radial EUS echoendoscope with color Doppler assessment capability will be passed&#xD;
      via standard technique and the pancreas examined from the gastric and duodenal stations.&#xD;
      Representative EUS images will be recorded on digital videotape/digital snapshot from the&#xD;
      head, body and tail per the CRF. See Appendix B. These images will then become part of the&#xD;
      patient's electronic medical record. The echoendoscope will be used to measure specific&#xD;
      parenchymal (hyperechoic foci with shadowing, hyperechoic strands with shadowing, lobular&#xD;
      contour, cysts, calculi) and ductal (main ductal diameter, irregularity, hyperechoic margins,&#xD;
      stones and the presence of visible side branches) abnormalities. It is expected that this&#xD;
      evaluation will be completed in approximately 10 minutes. Prior to secretin administration&#xD;
      (baseline MPD diameters), the pancreatic duct diameter will be measured in the head, body,&#xD;
      and tail using endosonographic calipers. The investigator will provide an initial assessment&#xD;
      of the presence or absence of chronic pancreatitis prior to secretin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the echoendoscope will be used to aspirate the gastric and duodenal lumens dry. The&#xD;
      gastric and duodenal samples will then be discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the gastric and duodenal lumens have been aspirated dry, patients will be given a test&#xD;
      dose of human secretin of 0.2 mcg (0.1mL) through an indwelling catheter in a peripheral vein&#xD;
      to assess for a possible allergic response. Patients will be monitored at all times for&#xD;
      evaluation of hemodynamic instability. If after one minute there is no evidence of an&#xD;
      allergic reaction, the remaining full dose of secretin 0.2 mcg/kg IV will be given over one&#xD;
      minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning at time 4 minutes after the completion of secretin intravenous infusion, the&#xD;
      pancreatic duct diameter will be measured in the head, body, and tail using endosonographic&#xD;
      calipers. Measurements of the pancreatic duct will occur sequentially at 4, 8, and 12 minutes&#xD;
      following the conclusion of secretin administration. Representative images will also be&#xD;
      obtained of each measurement at each time point. The echoendoscope will be used to measure&#xD;
      specific parenchymal (hyperechoic foci with shadowing, hyperechoic strands with shadowing,&#xD;
      lobular contour, cysts, calculi) and ductal abnormalities. The investigator will perform a&#xD;
      follow-up assessment of chronic pancreatitis using additional data on post-secretin&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ePFT portion of the examination will then commence. The echoendoscope will be removed and&#xD;
      a forward-viewing gastroscope placed into the stomach. Stomach contents will then be&#xD;
      aspirated dry. The forward-viewing gastroscope will then be placed across the pylorus into&#xD;
      the distal duodenum. Beginning time 15 minutes following the completion of the secretin&#xD;
      infusion, duodenal samples (5-10 mL) will be collected through the suction channel of the&#xD;
      echoendoscope. The samples will be collected in a standard endoscopic collection container&#xD;
      and placed on ice. At time 30 and 45 minutes after the completion of secretin administation,&#xD;
      samples will obtained in a similar fashion and placed in separate containers on ice. The&#xD;
      procedure will then be completed and the patient brought to the same day recovery suite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the procedure, the samples will be brought immediately to the hospital&#xD;
      chemistry laboratory where they will be evaluated for bicarbonate concentration using the&#xD;
      hospital autoanalyzer or frozen at -70 degrees Celsius if analysis is delayed. Using the&#xD;
      autoanalyzer for this technique generally requires a three-fold dilution of the fluid&#xD;
      contents. The highest bicarbonate concentration from the 3 samples will be considered the&#xD;
      peak concentration. The diagnostic cut-off for pancreatic exocrine disease will be set at &lt;&#xD;
      80 mEq/L (80 mEq/L or greater indicates normal function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient participation in the study will be completed at the time of completion of their&#xD;
      combined function testing. A telephone call will occur by the PI or designee to each patient&#xD;
      within 3-7 days of study drug administration will serve as follow-up and complete the CRF.&#xD;
