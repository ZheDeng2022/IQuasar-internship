      To evaluate quantitative magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) as a potential non-invasive,&#xD;
      radiation-free diagnostic tool for evaluating esophageal wall remodeling (thickness and&#xD;
      stiffness) and response to treatment in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) presenting with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and food&#xD;
      impaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE) is a form of chronic inflammation affecting the esophagus which&#xD;
      often results in wall thickening and esophageal stiffening and is associated with&#xD;
      complications, such as esophageal tears and strictures (narrowings). Chronic dysphagia and&#xD;
      acute food impaction (swallowed food stuck in the esophagus) are common symptoms of EoE and&#xD;
      are associated with esophageal wall thickening and stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current diagnostic techniques such as endoscopy with biopsy give only limited information&#xD;
      about changes in the esophageal wall in eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE). In routine clinical&#xD;
      practice, repeat endoscopic evaluation with biopsy is commonly performed about 3-6 months&#xD;
      after initial therapy for eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE). However, follow-up endoscopy with&#xD;
      biopsy has drawbacks as it is invasive, costly and typically requires deep sedation or&#xD;
      general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to evaluate quantitative MRI as a potential non-invasive diagnostic option for&#xD;
      evaluating esophageal wall remodeling in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE).&#xD;

    <description>To assess noninvasive quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based biomarkers in the evaluation of esophageal wall remodeling and response to treatment in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed eosinophilic esophagitis presenting with dysphagia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)findings will be correlated with the endoscopic appearance of the esophagus, histologic findings, and clinical symptoms.</description>

    <description>An upper endoscopy with biopsy at the time of diagnosis(which is a standard procedure to diagnose eosinophilic esophagitis. This will be done with sedation or general anesthesia, also a standard procedure. At the time of the anesthesia a small amount of blood will be drawn to measure markers of inflammation and fibrosis. This procedure will take approximately 45 minutes to complete. This endoscopy with biopsy will be repeated in 6 months.&#xD;
Subjects will also complete a magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)scan with 2 weeks of the initial clinical endoscopy with biopsy, prior to the initiation of your medical treatment. This MRI will be repeated in 6 months. Each magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)scan will take approximately 2 hours to complete.</description>
