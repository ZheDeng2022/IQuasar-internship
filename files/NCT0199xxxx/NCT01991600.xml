      Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency in the world today, affecting&#xD;
      more than 60% of the global population (www.who.int/nut/ida.htm). The two main strategies for&#xD;
      the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency involve fortification of food with iron, or&#xD;
      direct supplementation with iron tablets. Simple iron salts (e.g. ferrous sulphate) are well&#xD;
      absorbed but at supplemental levels (and potentially at lower levels, as used in food&#xD;
      fortificants) can induce free radical activity resulting in gastrointestinal side effects and&#xD;
      systematic oxidative stress. As a result, supplementation has poor compliance and improvement&#xD;
      in iron status is compromised. Ferric salts are less inclined to produce side effects and&#xD;
      although they are relatively well absorbed at fortification levels in food, they are poorly&#xD;
      absorbed at the higher supplemental doses. Because certain components of food, such as&#xD;
      organic acids, can facilitate ferric iron absorption, we now wish to determine whether&#xD;
      dietary organic acids may similarly enable efficient absorption of supplemental ferric iron&#xD;
      while preventing the formation of non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) which is a proxy for free&#xD;
      radical activity. Our strategy is to use an iterative process between in vitro and in vivo&#xD;
      experimentation, aimed at identifying the best choice of organic acid and the optimal ratio&#xD;
      of iron:organic acid. The study was a cross-over, single-dose comparison against&#xD;
      standard-of-care therapy (namely ferrous sulphate) in mildly iron deficient anaemic women.&#xD;
      Both the investigational products and the active comparator were administered as a single&#xD;
      dose on 2 different occasions, i.e. the investigational products on the first study visit and&#xD;
      the active comparator 14 days later on the second study visit.&#xD;

      The study was a first-in-human iron absorption study of ferric iron oxide-organic acid&#xD;
      preparations (Fe-OAs). The study design was cross-over, single-dose, single-blinded&#xD;
      comparison against standard-of-care therapy (namely ferrous sulphate) in mildly iron&#xD;
      deficient anaemic women. Methyl-cellulose capsules containing single doses of Fe-OAs (60 mg&#xD;
      elemental iron equivalent) were given to four subjects per test mixture to determine iron&#xD;
      absorption and bioavailability. The study was initially designed in 2 parts (A and B). Part A&#xD;
      was an iterative process to determine the best choice of organic acids and the optimal ratio&#xD;
      of iron to organic acid that allowed efficient iron absorption, while part B was a comparison&#xD;
      of absorption of the two most promising Fe-OA preparations against the standard-of-care&#xD;
      therapy (namely ferrous sulphate). Following this iterative-based study we had a candidate&#xD;
      Fe-OA preparation that showed nearly equivalent bioavailability to ferrous sulphate and we&#xD;
      decided to stop the study at the end of Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1 of the study (Part A), the participants were given one methyl-cellulose capsule&#xD;
      containing one of the Fe-OA preparations to be taken on an empty stomach or with a light&#xD;
      breakfast consisting of water and 2 slices of white bread with jam. Participants were blinded&#xD;
      to which test preparation they received. Serial serum iron levels were obtained at baseline&#xD;
      and then 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 210 and 240 minutes after ingestion of the iron dosage.&#xD;
      Fourteen days later the participants returned for the second study visit where they ingested&#xD;
      one ferrous sulphate tablet with a light breakfast, and the same visit protocol was followed.&#xD;
      Each subject acted as her own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bioavailability of iron from the Fe-OA preparations was determined by measuring&#xD;
      erythrocyte incorporation of labelled iron 14 days following a single oral dose. Each Fe-OA&#xD;
      preparation was labelled with 2 mg of the stable isotope 58Fe per single dose of the Fe-OA&#xD;
      material. Ferrous sulphate was used as a reference for oral iron therapy and to determine&#xD;
      individuals who were non-iron absorbers. Non-iron absorbers were defined as those who had no&#xD;
      significant net area under the curve (AUC) for serum iron following ferrous sulphate oral&#xD;
      ingestion (i.e. this was defined as a serum iron increase ≤ 5 μM). The data obtained for&#xD;
      these individuals were excluded from the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bioavailability of ferrous sulphate was determined using short-term changes in serum iron&#xD;
      levels using published algorithms.&#xD;

    <description>The active comparator was the standard-of-care therapy for iron deficiency anaemia (namely ferrous sulphate). Generic uncoated ferrous sulphate tablets BP 300 mg containing 60mg elemental iron were purchased from a local pharmacy. The route of administration was oral. Each participant ingested one ferrous sulphate tablet (60 mg Fe) on one of the study visits.</description>

    <description>Fifteen different ferric iron oxide-organic acid preparations were investigated. Most organic acids used were generally recognised as safe (GRAS) and all were used at dietary equivalent levels. The dosage was 58 ± 6 mg elemental iron equivalent (average of all compounds). The route of administration was oral using methyl-cellulose capsules. On one of the study visits, each participant ingested a single dose, equivalent to ca. 60 mg iron, of the Fe-OA preparation allocated to her.</description>
