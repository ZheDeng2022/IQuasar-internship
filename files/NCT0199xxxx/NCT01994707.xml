  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to definitively show if human myocardium can be remotely&#xD;
      preconditioned. In the writings there are no experiments that would prove that the remote&#xD;
      preconditioning protocol effects on the higher protection of the human myocardial cells,&#xD;
      against the ischemia-reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 patients referred for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure with use of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass are planned will be included to the research. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized (1:1) to one of two groups: remote preconditioning or &quot;placebo&quot; intervention. On&#xD;
      the day of surgery, after induction of anesthesia remote preconditioning will be elicited by&#xD;
      3 cycles of 5min inflation (ischemia) and 5 min deflation (reperfusion) of blood pressure&#xD;
      cuff on the right arm. In the control group the blood pressure cuff is going to be placed on&#xD;
      the upper limb but the preconditioning protocol will not be carried out. On cannulation for&#xD;
      CPB, right atrial appendage and myocardial biopsies of the left ventricular will be&#xD;
      harvested. The investigators will study: (1) resistance of myocardium to hypoxia/reperfusion&#xD;
      injury in in vitro experiments, assessed in isolated right atrial pectinate muscle trabeculae&#xD;
      (2) induction of apoptosis and status of mitochondria in myocardium after the period of&#xD;
      ischemia, and reperfusion in vitro (3) amount of myocardial necrosis in-vivo induced by&#xD;
      period of ischemia and reperfusion during CABG as assessed by postoperative myocardial&#xD;
      necrosis markers release (4) the systolic function of the myocardium at the postoperative and&#xD;
      the kidney function in the postoperative period evaluated by the creatinine clearance; (5)&#xD;
      induction of apoptosis and status of mitochondria in myocardium after the period of ischemia,&#xD;
      and reperfusion during coronary artery bypass grafting, assessed in myocardial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is going to be an ability to define does the remote preconditioning influence on the&#xD;
      occurrence of apoptosis in the human myocardium in the in vivo conditions and does it&#xD;
      influence on the postoperative course in patients undergoing cardiac surgery procedures. The&#xD;
      investigators will try to study if remote preconditioning modify induction of apoptosis and&#xD;
      its structure in response to injury. In case the effect of remote preconditioning is not&#xD;
      measurable in ex-vivo assessment, the future attempt at implementing this phenomenon in&#xD;
      clinical practice may be futile and should not be continued until the effect can be confirmed&#xD;
      in controlled experimental setting.&#xD;

      The investigators will study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resistance of isolated right atrial pectinate muscle trabeculae to simulated&#xD;
           hypoxia/reperfusion in functional organ bath model&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Resistance of isolated right atrial pectinate muscle trabeculae to induction of&#xD;
           apoptosis by simulated hypoxia/reperfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Resistance of mitochondria in isolated right atrial pectinate muscle trabeculae to&#xD;
           changes induced by simulated hypoxia/reperfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously we will assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Amount of myocardial necrosis in vivo induced by period of ischemia and reperfusion&#xD;
           during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) as assessed by postoperative myocardial&#xD;
           necrosis markers release profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Myocardial function in vivo after the period of ischemia and reperfusion during CABG as&#xD;
           assessed by hemodynamic measurements (thermodilution method), oxygen supply/consumption&#xD;
           and inotropic support requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Induction of apoptosis and status of mitochondria after the period of ischemia, and&#xD;
           reperfusion during CABG as assessed in left ventricular myocardial biopsies The&#xD;
           investigators will try correlate the in vitro and in vivo findings from the same&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The study will be conducted both in vivo and ex-vivo. Patients referred for CABG&#xD;
      for stable coronary artery disease will be recruited and randomized (1:1) by random digit&#xD;
      generator to one of two groups: remote preconditioning or &quot;placebo&quot; intervention. Only&#xD;
      patients in who at least 3 coronary artery bypass grafts with use of cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      (CPB) are planned will be included. On the day of surgery, after induction of anesthesia and&#xD;
      before the skin incision remote preconditioning will be elicited. The &quot;placebo&quot; group will&#xD;
      have the pressure cuff placed on the right arm but no inflations will be performed. To obtain&#xD;
      blinding, the inflations will occur under surgical drapes, and will be performed by the same&#xD;
      person every time, who will be involved in random sequence generation, and remote&#xD;
      preconditioning application, but not in the care of the patient, or other research related&#xD;
      tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consented patients will have preoperative echocardiography, electrocardiography and blood&#xD;
      tests including fool blood count, creatinine, BUN, and liver function test performed as part&#xD;
      of their routine preoperative care. Additionally troponin T and CK-MB levels will be&#xD;
      assessed. Furthermore patients will have performed electrocardiography on 1st day after&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be standardized and consist of midazolam 15mg orally 1h before surgery,&#xD;
      etomidate 0.2mg/kg, fentanyl 5g/kg and pancuronium 0.1mg/kg iv for anesthesia induction,&#xD;
      propofol 0.5-1.0 mg/kg/h and fentanyl 4g/kg/h infusion for anesthesia maintenance. No&#xD;
      anesthetic gases will be used. Full hemodynamic monitoring will be used with Swan-Ganz&#xD;
      catheter (not routine in CABG patients). First hemodynamic measurements and oxygen&#xD;
      supply/consumption calculations will be performed preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional in vitro assessment. On cannulation for CPB, right atrial appendage, which is&#xD;
      routinely removed and discarded for venous cannula placement will be harvested in all&#xD;
      patients. The tissue will be was transferred in ice cold Krebs-Henseleit solution to the&#xD;
      isolated organ laboratory in our department. One pectinate muscle trabecula will be harvested&#xD;
      for baseline assessment of apoptosis or mitochondria (see below). Another single trabecula&#xD;
      less than 1mm in diameter will be mounted in the organ chamber - Schuler Organbath (Hugo&#xD;
      Sachs Elektronik, March-Hugstetten, Germany (HSE)) containing Krebs-Henseleit solution. It&#xD;
      will be oxygenated via glass frit with carbogen (95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide) and&#xD;
      maintained at 37°C. The trabecula will be driven with 1Hz 50ms square stimuli using platinum&#xD;
      field electrodes and the potential of 150% of the threshold for given preparation. The&#xD;
      stimulator Type 215 (HSE) will be used. The contraction force will be measured with F30&#xD;
      isometric force transducer Type 372 (HSE). The signal will be enhanced with TAM A PlagSYS&#xD;
      transducer amplifier module Type705 (HSE) and recorded using PowerLab/4SP system and Chart&#xD;
      software (AD Instruments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trabecula will be gradually stretched to 90% of optimal tension according to&#xD;
      Frank-Starling relationship and left for 30min of stabilization and washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60min ischemia will be simulated by substituting oxygen in carbogen with argon (95% argon, 5%&#xD;
      carbon dioxide) and replacing Krebs-Henseleit solution with one containing no glucose or&#xD;
      pyruvate. On reoxygenation the carbogen will be added again and the tissue bath solution will&#xD;
      be replaced with one used initially. The tissue will be was washed several times and left for&#xD;
      120min of reoxygenation period with washout every 15 min. This functional model of hypoxia&#xD;
      reoxygenation has been used in our laboratory before [12-14]. Replacement of oxygen with&#xD;
      argon results in the drop of tissue bath oxygen partial pressure from 475±52mmHg to&#xD;
      51±1.8mmHg (p&lt;0.001) [37-39]. It is accompanied by significant and rapid decline in isometric&#xD;
      contraction force. During reoxygenation the contraction force returns initially and next we&#xD;
      observe slow decline of muscle inotropism which we interpret as development of reoxygenation&#xD;
      injury. At the end, we will use 10-4 M norepinephrine ((-)-Arterenol Bitartrate) to test for&#xD;
      stunning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contraction force will be recorded continuously. Contractility will be expressed in&#xD;
      percent of the initial contraction force for given preparation. The investigators will&#xD;
      compare the maximal recovered contraction force, the contraction force after 30min and 120min&#xD;
      of reoxygenation and the contraction force produced by adding 10-4M norepinephrine at the end&#xD;
      of reoxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also look for the signs of ischemic contracture development defined as&#xD;
      an increase of resting tension of the trabecula. This increase, if present, starts shortly&#xD;
      after the onset of hypoxia and continues steadily throughout the whole hypoxia period. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare the increase in resting tension (in mN/mg tissue mass) at the end&#xD;
      of hypoxia, that is at the time of maximal contracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements, and in particular recovery of function will be compared between trabeculae&#xD;
      from remotely preconditioned and &quot;placebo&quot; patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two atrial trabeculae from the same appendage, one harvested at baseline, and another&#xD;
      subjected to functional experiment (60 min hypoxia + 120 min reoxygenation) will be studied&#xD;
      each time for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  apoptosis induction - Caspase 3 and cleaved Caspase 3, PARP and cleaved PARP expression&#xD;
           measured with Western-Blot, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  apoptosis induction - assessed with TUNEL and immunohistochemistry staining for Caspase&#xD;
           3, cleaved Caspase 3, PARP and cleaved PARP, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  state of mitochondria (electron microscopy) As we plan to randomize 120 patients (see&#xD;
           below) the material for apoptosis and mitochondria studies will be randomly taken from&#xD;
           60 patients (30:30) for Western Blot, 40 patients (20:20) for immunohistochemistry and&#xD;
           TUNEL, and 20 patients (10:10) for electron microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Western Blot (2 trabeculae, baseline and after hypoxia/reoxygenation, from 30 remotely&#xD;
      preconditioned and 30 &quot;placebo&quot; patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Western Blot immunoassay the trabeculae will be placed in liquid nitrogen&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry (2 trabeculae, baseline and after hypoxia/reoxygenation, from 20&#xD;
      remotely preconditioned and 20 &quot;placebo&quot; patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expression of Caspase 3, cleaved Caspase 3, PARP and cleaved PARP proteins in tissue sections&#xD;
      will be detected immunohistochemically. Trabeculae will be fixed overnight in 10%&#xD;
      neutral-buffered formalin (phosphate buffer), subsequently passed through graded alcohol&#xD;
      solutions, processed three times in xylene, and finally embedded in paraffin blocks. The&#xD;
      documentation of immunohistochemical reactions will be performed with SSC-DC58AP camera&#xD;
      (Sony) coupled with Nikon Eclipse E400 optical microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick and labeling) (2 trabeculae, baseline&#xD;
      and after hypoxia/reoxygenation, from 20 remotely preconditioned and 20 &quot;placebo&quot; patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue sections will be deparaffinized in 2 changes of xylene for 5 minutes each, and&#xD;
      hydrated with 2 changes of 100% ethanol for 3 minutes each, and 95% ethanol for 1 minute. The&#xD;
      documentation of immunohistochemical reactions will be performed with SSC-DC58AP camera&#xD;
      (Sony) coupled with Nikon Eclipse E400 optical microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electron microscopy (2 trabeculae, baseline and after hypoxia/reoxygenation, from 10 remotely&#xD;
      preconditioned and 10 &quot;placebo&quot; patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trabeculae will be placed in cacodyl buffer with 2% glutaraldehyde. The mitochondria will be&#xD;
      micrographed with JEOL-JEM 100CX transmission electron microscope (JEOL Inc, Peabody, Mass)&#xD;
      with magnification x16000. The electron micrographs will next be saved and mitochondria size&#xD;
      and structure will be analyzed using Image ProPlus software (Media Scanalytics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in vivo trial The operation will be performed with the use of CPB in normothermia by&#xD;
      experienced cardiac surgeon. Intermittent warm-blood (37°C) antegrade cardioplegia&#xD;
      (miniplegia) will be used for myocardial protection. As only patients requiring at least 3&#xD;
      coronary bypass grafts will be recruited, we expect aortic crossclamp time to last at least&#xD;
      30 minutes. After cross clamp removal the proximal anastomoses will be performed using side&#xD;
      biting clamp. The patient will be weaned off CPB, hemostasis will be secured and the chest&#xD;
      will be closed over chest tubes. Just before closing the chest 16G needle-true cut biopsy of&#xD;
      the left ventricular myocardium will be obtained from the apex area. The investigators expect&#xD;
      the reperfusion time from the cross-clamp removal to obtaining the biopsy to last at least 40&#xD;
      min. The exact ischemia (cross-clamp) time, and reperfusion time (until obtaining the biopsy)&#xD;
      will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The myocardial biopsies will be harvested and assessed in the same way as atrial trabecule.&#xD;
      The investigators will randomly perform Western blotting in 60 (30:30) biopsies harvested on&#xD;
      liquid nitrogen, immunohistochemistry including TUNEL in 40 (20:20) harvested on 10% neutral&#xD;
      buffered formalin, and electron microscopy in 20 (10:10) harvested on cacodyl buffer with 2%&#xD;
      glutaraldehyde. The methods of assessing Caspase3, cleaved Caspase 3, PARP, cleaved PARP,&#xD;
      TUNEL and mitochondria have been described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the operation patient will be transferred to ICU and treated as per routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of clinical observation will be the postoperative release of cardiac&#xD;
      troponin T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure serum concentration of cardiac Troponin T&#xD;
      (electrochemiluminescence &quot;ECLIA&quot;, Roche) preoperatively and next 72h from cross-clamp&#xD;
      removal. At the same time points the level of creatine kinase isoenzyme MB will be assessed&#xD;
      (enzymatic assay, Roche). The area under the curve of the marker level over time will be&#xD;
      compared between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the myocardial function all patients will have pulmonary artery catheter (Swan Ganz&#xD;
      catheter) inserted preoperatively. Full hemodynamic assessment (thermodilution method) as&#xD;
      well as oxygen metabolism status based on arterial and mixed venous gas analysis will be&#xD;
      performed preoperatively and next 48h after aortic cross-clamp removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from measuring cardiac index we will calculate left and right cardiac work indices. The&#xD;
      oxygen delivery index and extraction ratio will be calculated. The lactate levels will also&#xD;
      be measured. The investigators will also assess the need for inotropic support at the same&#xD;
      time points using so called inotropic index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have postoperative electrocardiogram on day 2 and 4 as per postoperative&#xD;
      care routine and additionally on 1st day after operation. Similarly other routine&#xD;
      postoperative tests that are performed as part of the routine postoperative care will be&#xD;
      performed, monitored and used to look for the differences in postoperative course. This&#xD;
      includes echocardiography as well as creatinine (eGFR).&#xD;
