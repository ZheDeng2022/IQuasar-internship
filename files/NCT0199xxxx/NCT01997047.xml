    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is the commonest cause of death in children worldwide, killing 1.5 million children&#xD;
      under the age of 5 years, every year. This is more than the number of children dying from&#xD;
      AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. The current diagnostic and management protocols for&#xD;
      managing serious respiratory diseases in children are 30 years old and are greatly in need of&#xD;
      updating. The successful establishment of useful clinical management criteria for children&#xD;
      with respiratory diseases will have benefits for children in low resource regions around the&#xD;
      world. The goals of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if children with respiratory distress can be reliably diagnosed under&#xD;
           low-resource conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the clinical tests that best differentiate pneumonia from wheezy diseases.&#xD;
           These will be used to establish updated diagnostic criteria for common pediatric lung&#xD;
           diseases that broaden the current pneumonia algorithm by adding another for wheezy&#xD;
           illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ultimate objective is to improve the management and outcome of acute respiratory&#xD;
           conditions in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigators also wish to test the efficacy of a locally developed cell phone oximeter&#xD;
           probe in a low resource setting.&#xD;

      Study organisation. This is a prospective observational study run simultaneously in four&#xD;
      Indian public hospitals (King George Medical University, Lucknow; Regency Hospital, Kanpur;&#xD;
      Vanivilas Hospital, Bangalore; Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, Bangalore). The study&#xD;
      started in Oct 2012 to cover the Indian respiratory viral season. In order to maintain high&#xD;
      standards of data collection, a post-graduate research coordinator is employed at each&#xD;
      hospital. Because of the use of standardised scoring systems and the need for accurate&#xD;
      clinical data collection, a member from the Canadian team spent a week at each centre&#xD;
      familiarising local research team members with the study protocol and standardised scoring&#xD;
      systems. This was followed by a one week trial period of data collection and electronic&#xD;
      transmission of files to Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic definitions and standardised scores. The primary problem facing any study of&#xD;
      pneumonia is accurate diagnosis. The overlap of clinical and radiological findings between&#xD;
      severe viral infections, asthma and bacterial pneumonia can make it difficult to determine&#xD;
      which febrile tachypneic children have wheezy diseases and which ones would benefit from&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment. In many low-resource areas, this is further complicated by infectious&#xD;
      diseases, such as malaria and dengue, which can have similar presentations. Early WHO&#xD;
      tachypnea-based diagnostic protocols were intentionally over-sensitive to ensure that all&#xD;
      children with bacterial pneumonia received antibiotics. Later attempts were made to improve&#xD;
      the detection of wheezy diseases, by adding audible wheeze or acute bronchodilator response&#xD;
      to the basic criteria. However, these were shown to be imprecise, particularly amongst the&#xD;
      sickest children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators chose to formalize the diagnostic method described by Sachdev et al who&#xD;
      classified patients into four groups (pneumonia, wheezy disease, mixed and non-respiratory)&#xD;
      based on consultant review of a detailed history and examination plus a chest radiograph&#xD;
      (CXR). Investigators recorded 29 items from a protocol that included history, examination,&#xD;
      CXR and oximetry (see table). In order to combine results from data collection between&#xD;
      centres, standardised scoring systems for conscious level and auscultation findings were&#xD;
      used. For chest radiographs, a modification of the recently updated system recommended by the&#xD;
      WHO was used. During the one week preparatory period, the system was explained to all&#xD;
      involved ER physicians and pediatricians using examples and practice interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol. All children below 5 years age who present to the emergency rooms of the&#xD;
      study hospitals with cough or difficulty breathing of less than 5 days, are identified. If&#xD;
      their initial respiratory rate met WHO criteria for pneumonia, the study is explained by a&#xD;
      native speaker of their primary language and they are invited to enter the study. Families&#xD;
      are not paid to enrol but the study covers the cost of a CXR for every child plus travel&#xD;
      expenses for outpatients to return for review on day four. After enrolment, twenty nine&#xD;
      features of the child's history, examination and CXR are assessed by the ER physician and&#xD;
      recorded by the study coordinator(Table 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reviewing the data, the ER physician is asked to place the child into one of four&#xD;
      diagnostic categories: pneumonia, wheezy disease (asthma and bronchiolitis), mixed (evidence&#xD;
      of pneumonia and wheeze) and non-respiratory (malaria, dengue etc). The ER physician is&#xD;
      solely responsible for subsequent management decisions. All study patients are reviewed four&#xD;
      days later by a qualified pediatrician who is blinded to the ER physician's CXR&#xD;
      interpretation and diagnosis. Based on a review of the clinical data at presentation, plus&#xD;
      subsequent course over 4 days and a second examination, the pediatrician places the patient&#xD;
      into one of the four diagnostic categories. This is considered the child's final diagnosis&#xD;
      for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Logistic regression analysis will be used to determine which of the&#xD;
      initial clinical variables had the best predictive power for pneumonia and asthma. The best&#xD;
      cut-off values for continuous variables were established using receiver operating curve&#xD;
      analysis. For each predictive variable, sensitivity, specificity plus positive and negative&#xD;
      predictive value will be calculated from conventional tables using standard equations. When&#xD;
      the predictive value of combining variables is tested, investigators will link them as 'A&#xD;
      and/or B'. This increases sensitivity but decreases specificity, compared to using 'A and B.'&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be displayed as mean +/- one standard deviation. Categorical&#xD;
      variables will be displayed with box and whisker plots where the whiskers represent full&#xD;
      range.&#xD;

    <description>All children enrolled in the study, fulfill WHO criteria for pneumonia on day one. After assessing 29 different variables at presentation (day 1), including CXR, oximetry, pulse, respiratory rate, a qualified pediatrician makes the primary study diagnosis on day 4. Based on the results and review of progress, the consultant places the child into one of four diagnostic groups - pneumonia, wheezy disease, mixed and non-respiratory. These are the principal reference diagnoses for the rest of the analyses.</description>
