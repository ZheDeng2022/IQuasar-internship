  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of a wearable therapeutic ultrasound&#xD;
      device to reduce pain and increase mobility for subjects with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50 million people in the U.S. suffer from some form of chronic pain, and 60% of these&#xD;
      Americans are under 65 and have limited mobility because of knee or hip Osteoarthritis (OA).&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals currently dominate the treatment options due to widespread insurance coverage&#xD;
      and convenience. However, there are a myriad of public health problems associated with&#xD;
      analgesic use, including costs, untoward side effects, and addiction potential with opioid&#xD;
      analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound therapy for pain and healing has been approved by the U.S. FDA and has been in use&#xD;
      around the globe for the last 60 years. Traditionally, ultrasound-mediated pain treatment has&#xD;
      been delivered in clinics and has been limited to short and confined periods of 5-15 min at&#xD;
      acoustic intensities from 1-4 W/cm2 over a course of weeks to months. Over the past decade,&#xD;
      research has increasingly focused on lower-intensity therapeutic ultrasound (30-1000 mW/cm2)&#xD;
      delivered over extended 1-8 hr periods. (mW = milliwatt) Recent animal studies using&#xD;
      low-intensity therapeutic ultrasound (LITUS) have demonstrated successful inflammation&#xD;
      reduction, reduced cartilage degeneration, and tendon and fracture healing. It is believed&#xD;
      that using a lower-intensity ultrasonic treatment regimen over extended treatment periods&#xD;
      works with the body's natural healing process and minimizes acoustic insult as compared with&#xD;
      traditional, higher intensity treatments. This study proposes to evaluate clinically the&#xD;
      first wearable low intensity ultrasound system for noninvasive treatment of arthritis pain.&#xD;
      This technology has the potential to measurably increase the quality of life for millions of&#xD;
      people who suffer from osteoarthritis pain by providing a safe, effective, and easy-to-use&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study will test the versatile ultrasound therapy system in a clinical study that&#xD;
      will enroll up to 60 patients with mobility-impairing knee OA. The goal of the study is to&#xD;
      establish statistically significant data that daily 4 hour LITUS treatment decreases&#xD;
      participant pain (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]) and improves patient mobility (measured by an&#xD;
      accelerometer worn by each participant) over placebo devices.&#xD;
