      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerated dose of heated&#xD;
      cisplatin that can be given to patients with lung tumors. The safety of this drug will also&#xD;
      be studied.&#xD;

      Surgery and Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, chest surgery will be performed&#xD;
      to try to remove as many tumors as possible. The chest surgery is not being performed&#xD;
      specifically for this research study and would be performed as part of your standard of care&#xD;
      treatment even if you didn't take part in this study. You will be given a separate consent&#xD;
      form to sign that explains the details and risks of chest surgery in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the chest surgery, you will receive amifostine by vein to help prevent possible side&#xD;
      effects, such as ear and/or kidney damage. The chest will then be closed with a plastic tube&#xD;
      left in place. Then, the chest wash will begin. During the chest wash, a pump that is&#xD;
      connected to the plastic tube pushes the heated cisplatin into the chest and then pulls it&#xD;
      out to recirculate the cisplatin. The surgeon will also wash over the closed area of the&#xD;
      surgical site with heated cisplatin. The heated cisplatin will be recirculated in and out of&#xD;
      the chest over 60 minutes while the surgeon gently presses on the chest wall to help the&#xD;
      cisplatin reach all areas in the chest. The plastic tube the heated cisplatin will be pumped&#xD;
      through will stay in place after the surgery to drain the extra fluid. These are the same&#xD;
      plastic tubes that would be present even if you did not agree to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgery, extra blood (about ½ teaspoon each time) and fluid from the chest area&#xD;
      will be collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing when you begin to receive the first&#xD;
      infusion of the heated cisplatin, then 30 and 60 minutes after the infusion has started, and&#xD;
      again 24 hours after receiving the heated cisplatin. The blood and fluid from the chest area&#xD;
      will be collected through already placed catheters, so no additional needle sticks will be&#xD;
      required. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a chance that the surgeon may decide during the surgery that the chest wash will not&#xD;
      be performed, for example if the disease has spread to or attached to certain organs. If this&#xD;
      occurs, your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you after the surgery is&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-5, 11, and 14, (Day 1 being the day after surgery):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 month after the surgery is complete, you will have a follow-up visit and the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a hearing test at the 1 month visit only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recommended that you have follow-up visits at MD Anderson at 3 and 6 months after&#xD;
      surgery. In addition to blood draws (about 1-3 teaspoons), you will have an MRI, CT, or&#xD;
      PET-CT scan to check the status of the disease. These 3 and 6 month visits after surgery may&#xD;
      be performed at your local doctor's office and/or laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on study for up to 6 months. You will be taken off study if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study doctor learns that the disease has come back or gotten worse at the 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up visit, you may be eligible to have the operation with heated cisplatin wash&#xD;
      repeated. If you are eligible for to have the surgery repeated, your active participation on&#xD;
      this study will end and then you will be given a new consent form to sign in order to be&#xD;
      re-enrolled back onto this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Cisplatin is FDA-approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced bladder cancer, metastatic testicular cancer, metastatic ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, metastatic appendiceal cancer, and abdominal&#xD;
      mesothelioma. The use of a heated cisplatin wash during chest surgery in patients with lung&#xD;
      tumors is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to&#xD;
      work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

Dose limiting toxicity may occur at any time during the initial hospitalization before discharge following the HITC. The dose limiting toxicity is defined two ways. Hematologic DLT is defined as Grade IV neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. Non-hematologic DLT is any Grade III or IV non-hematologic toxicity excluding Grade III nausea or vomiting, Grade III hepatic toxicity which returns to Grade I within four weeks of the HITC, or before hospital discharge, or Grade III fever occurring after the HITC.</description>

Catheters connected to an extracorporeal perfusion circuit. Starting dose of hyperthermic cisplatin 120 mg/m2. Perfusion continued for 60 minutes after adding the cisplatin at a target temperature of 41 C (+0.5 C). In order to limit the systemic toxicity of cisplatin, amifostine administered intravenously over 15 minutes beginning 30 minutes after cisplatin perfusion. Patient response to amifostine continuously monitored by anesthesiologist. Infusion may be stopped and/or restarted based on blood pressure.</description>
