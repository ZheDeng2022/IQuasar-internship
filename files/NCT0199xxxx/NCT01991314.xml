  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anaemia is common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affecting at least 20%&#xD;
      patients at any one time. Hepcidin, a recently described anti-microbial peptide synthesized&#xD;
      by the liver, is a key regulator of iron homeostasis. It interferes with absorption of iron&#xD;
      into enterocytes, macrophages and hepatocytes by binding to ferroportin. Hepcidin levels rise&#xD;
      when total body iron levels rise and protect against iron overload; conversely, in iron&#xD;
      deficiency, levels are low. Hepcidin levels also rise under the influence of interleukins&#xD;
      (IL)-6 and -1, a factor likely to contribute to iron deficient erythropoesis in active IBD.&#xD;
      Whether hepcidin levels predict resistance to oral iron therapy in IBD is unknown, though it&#xD;
      may impair its immediate oral absorption. Adult IBD patients who are anaemic report quality&#xD;
      of life and fatigue scores comparable to those seen in malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBD diagnosed in adolescence interferes with growth, education and employment as well as&#xD;
      psychosocial and sexual development. Not surprisingly, adolescents with IBD have a high&#xD;
      prevalence of psychological distress, particular depression. Limited historical, and our own&#xD;
      data suggest that children and adolescents with IBD are more anaemic than adults, and less&#xD;
      often treated with oral iron. What is not clear is whether the apparent under-utilisation of&#xD;
      oral iron in paediatric care is because of a perceived lack of benefit or doctors' concerns&#xD;
      about possible side effects including worsening disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these questions, the investigators propose a comparative study of 6 weeks of oral&#xD;
      iron supplementation in adolescents and adults with iron deficiency anaemia in IBD. Patients&#xD;
      will be given oral iron supplementation. Before and after iron therapy, the investigators&#xD;
      shall assess haemoglobin concentrations; IBD activity; quality of life (QOL), perceived&#xD;
      stress, mood and fatigue; iron metabolism, including serum hepcidin.&#xD;

      Methods Before and after iron therapy, we assessed haemoglobin concentrations; iron status&#xD;
      markers; serum hepcidin concentration; IBD activity; iron tolerance; and QOL, perceived&#xD;
      stress, mood, coping and fatigue using psychometric questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients. Patients aged 13 - 18 years were defined as adolescents, and those aged ≥ 19 years&#xD;
      as adults. Between January 2012 and April 2015, patients with IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC),&#xD;
      Crohn's disease or IBDU (IBD unclassified) diagnosed by standard clinical, radiological and&#xD;
      pathological criteria) who within the next month were due to attend the adult, young people's&#xD;
      and paediatric IBD clinics at Barts and the Royal London Hospitals, Barts Health Trust or the&#xD;
      paediatric IBD clinic at Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust, London, UK, were screened for the&#xD;
      result of their haemoglobin concentration at their previous clinic attendance. Those found to&#xD;
      be anaemic were sent a letter of explanation about, and invitation to participate in, the&#xD;
      trial. They were telephoned 1-2 weeks after this letter was sent to them and asked about&#xD;
      current and previous iron therapy: those apparently eligible (see below) and verbally&#xD;
      consenting to participate were then seen by a trial doctor or research nurse either at their&#xD;
      next clinic appointment, or on another mutually convenient occasion. Informed written consent&#xD;
      from the patients or their parents, as appropriate, was obtained at this meeting, and&#xD;
      patients who remained eligible on the basis of their iron therapy history and clinical, and&#xD;
      haematological criteria were enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of iron deficiency anaemia: Anaemia was defined by age and sex-adjusted World&#xD;
      Health Organisation criteria (males &lt;13.0 g/dl; females and children aged 13 years &lt;12.0&#xD;
      g/dl) (WHO 2001). For inclusion in the trial, patients had to be both anaemic and have&#xD;
      transferrin saturation &lt;18%. They also had to report either tolerance of previous course(s)&#xD;
      of oral iron, or to be naïve to this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Patients were excluded if they did not meet the haematological inclusion&#xD;
      criteria on the admission-to-study blood test ('screening failures'), if they had been given&#xD;
      oral or intravenous iron within 3 months, or if they had previously been intolerant of oral&#xD;
      iron. Other exclusion criteria were age &lt;13 years, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, anaemia&#xD;
      caused by drugs used to treat IBD, haemoglobinopathy, presence of stoma or ileoanal pouch,&#xD;
      severely active IBD requiring hospital admission from clinic, severe cardiopulmonary,&#xD;
      hepatic, renal or other disease, pregnancy, breast-feeding, use of cholestyramine, and&#xD;
      inability to speak English well enough to complete the consent form or psychometric&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory and funding considerations: The trial was approved by the Southampton National&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee (number 10/H504/90 and EUDRACT number 2010-023797-39) and was&#xD;
      necessarily registered as a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medical Product (CTIMP) with&#xD;
      the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (number 14620/0035/001-0001) and&#xD;
      ClinTrials.Gov. The trial was sponsored by Barts Health NHS Trust. The trial was kindly&#xD;
      funded by a grant from Core and British Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology&#xD;
      and Nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial protocol and treatment. At enrolment, demographic data including age, sex, disease&#xD;
      type, education, marital status, smoking habit, weight and height were recorded. Disease&#xD;
      type, location, behaviour and extent, using Montreal classifications (Silverberg 2005) and&#xD;
      previous surgeries were noted from medical records. Patients completed six psychometric&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess mood, fatigue and quality of life (QOL): the Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HADS-A and HADS-D)(Zigmond 1983, Bjelland 2002), the recent and general&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Questionnaires (PSQ-R and PSQ-G) (Levenstein 1993), the Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (Kroenke 2001), the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations&#xD;
      (CISS)(Endler 2000), the Big Five Inventory (BFI) (Ramstedt or one of the John refs - check&#xD;
      which is right), the Multi-dimension Fatigue Inventory (MFI) (Smets 1995) and the Short&#xD;
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ)(Irvine 1996). Symptomatic disease activity&#xD;
      was assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) for patients with Crohn's disease (Harvey&#xD;
      1998), and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) for those with ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (Walmsley 2001). Blood was collected for blood count, including haemoglobin, iron studies and&#xD;
      hepcidin, and C-reactive protein (CRP); and a stool sample was obtained for faecal&#xD;
      calprotectin, as an objective measure of disease activity (Kopylov 2014). Patients were given&#xD;
      6 weeks treatment with 200mg oral ferrous sulphate (Wockhardt Ltd, Ranbaxy Ireland Ltd) twice&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one week, patients were telephoned to assess tolerance to treatment: those intolerant&#xD;
      of or non-adherent to oral iron were withdrawn from the trial and asked to attend for repeat&#xD;
      blood tests, questionnaires and faecal calprotectin as end of trial measures. After 6 weeks&#xD;
      of iron treatment, the above measurements were repeated and adherence assessed by counting of&#xD;
      returned iron tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures. The primary outcome measure was mean increase in haemoglobin concentration&#xD;
      in the adolescent and adult groups after 6 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcome measures in&#xD;
      the two groups were tolerance of oral iron; changes in disease activity (HBI, SCCAI, CRP,&#xD;
      faecal calprotectin), SIBDQ, HADS-A, HADS-D, PSQ-R, PSQ-G, PHQ-9, CISS, BFI and MFI scores,&#xD;
      and relation of serum hepcidin at baseline to haemoglobin response to oral iron. The SCCAI&#xD;
      was used for scoring clinical disease activity in the three adolescent patients with IBDU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assays Haemoglobin, iron studies and routine biochemistry were measured in the haematology&#xD;
      and biochemistry laboratories at the Royal London and Chelsea and Westminster Hospitals.&#xD;
      Serum for hepcidin assays was stored at -800 C until assay in duplicate in the University&#xD;
      Birmingham by mass spectrometry (Ward 2008). The mass spectrometer was calibrated at each&#xD;
      assay but because it is not serviced annually, the Research &amp; Development Department at Barts&#xD;
      Health NHS Trust insists on the statement herein that the hepcidin assay did not meet strict&#xD;
      GCP compliance regulations. Stool samples were stored at -800 C until the end of recruitment:&#xD;
      they were then extracted and quantified for calprotectin in duplicate by ELISA (ACCUSAY&#xD;
      Calprotectin, Launch Diagnostics, Ltd, Longfield, UK) in the Clinical Immunology laboratory&#xD;
      at Royal London Hospital.&#xD;
