    <textblock>
      Ferumoxytol is an example of a 'smart' magnetic resonance contrast agent that consists of&#xD;
      ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIOs) and is avidly taken up by&#xD;
      macrophages. Through a previous work, the investigators have established that USPIOs can&#xD;
      identify inflammation in the wall of abdominal aortic aneurysms and that this is associated&#xD;
      with a three-fold increase in the rate of aneurysm growth. The utility of ferumoxytol for&#xD;
      imaging cardiovascular inflammation in other areas of the body has yet to be established but&#xD;
      Dr Alam has established uptake of USPIOs in the penumbra and infarct zone of the myocardium&#xD;
      in patients with a recent myocardial infarction. The investigators wish to assess USPIO&#xD;
      uptake in patients with recent acute myocardial infarction and identify the time course and&#xD;
      determinants of cellular tissue inflammation. This will be the first clinical study to&#xD;
      examine the ability of USPIOs to image myocardial inflammation following acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary atherosclerosis is responsible for the initiation of acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      with plaque rupture leading to acute coronary thrombosis and myocardial infarction. Current&#xD;
      treatment in the acute phase involves re-establishing vessel patency by percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention supported by anti-thrombotic therapy. Thereafter, statins,&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockade all have prognostic benefit but no&#xD;
      treatments have been successfully developed to target post-infarction inflammatory pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Necrotic cardiac muscle elicits an inflammatory cascade that serves to clear the infarct of&#xD;
      dead cells and matrix debris. Human cardiac muscle has negligible regenerative capacity and&#xD;
      ultimately inflammation leads to replacement of damaged tissue with a fibrotic scar.&#xD;
      Enhancing reparative mechanisms following the inflammatory reaction to myocardial infarction&#xD;
      may reduce cardiomyocyte injury, attenuate adverse remodelling and improve clinical outcome.&#xD;
      A better understanding of the early post-infarct healing phase will also facilitate cell&#xD;
      therapy strategies to engraft stem cells or stimulate regeneration. In order to achieve this&#xD;
      goal, the investigators must better characterise the inflammatory processes that follow&#xD;
      infarction and myocardial necrosis in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory cell mediated injury and healing in the infarcted myocardium&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutrophils Inflammation within the infarcted myocardium is associated with induction of&#xD;
      endothelial adhesion molecules and enhanced permeability of the microvasculature. Up&#xD;
      regulation of chemokines including interleukin (IL)-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein&#xD;
      (MCP)-1 attracts neutrophils and monocytes to the site of injury. Early reperfusion therapy&#xD;
      amplifies this inflammatory cell influx and accelerates the healing response through&#xD;
      proliferative and maturation phases. Neutrophil adhesion to endothelium of infarcted&#xD;
      myocardium occurs within minutes of reperfusion. Ischaemic cardiomyocytes are further injured&#xD;
      by adherent neutrophils that release reactive oxygen species and destructive proteases&#xD;
      including human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and proteinase 3. HNE has a wide range of&#xD;
      substrates including matrix components elastin, fibronectin, and collagen types III and IV.&#xD;
      Activated neutrophils also occlude microvessels and increase endothelial permeability&#xD;
      contributing to myocardial oedema. Capillary plugging and obstruction by activated&#xD;
      neutrophils contributes to failure of microvascular perfusion and increased infarct size&#xD;
      within the 'no-reflow' zone. Neutrophil depletion reduces this phenomenon and infarct size&#xD;
      following reperfusion in pre-clinical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monocyte-derived Macrophages&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of monocytes into the infarcted myocardium is followed by maturation and&#xD;
      differentiation into macrophages: a process dependent on growth factors such as&#xD;
      macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). Macrophages have multiple roles within the&#xD;
      infarct including (i) phagocytic clearance of dead cells and debris, (ii) production of&#xD;
      growth factors and cytokines that stimulate fibroblast growth and angioneogenesis, and (iii)&#xD;
      matrix turnover through the production of matrix metalloproteases and their inhibitors.&#xD;
      Macrophages are resident within 24 h of infarction and persist for up to 4 weeks. During this&#xD;
      period, macrophages regulate infarct healing with the initial development of granulation&#xD;
      tissue and subsequent scar formation. Murine studies suggest that distinct monocyte subsets&#xD;
      regulate these different processes. Monocytes arriving within the first 3 days mature into&#xD;
      macrophages that scavenge necrotic debris through inflammatory mediator expression,&#xD;
      proteolysis and phagocytosis while monocytes arriving later on give rise to macrophages which&#xD;
      promote reparative processes such as angioneogenesis and extracellular matrix deposition.&#xD;
      Apoptosis is the primary mechanism determining longevity of neutrophils within sites of&#xD;
      inflammation and infarction. Engulfment and clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages&#xD;
      produces potent anti-inflammatory signals including release of transforming growth factor&#xD;
      (TGF)-β. Combined with clearance of pro-inflammatory matrix fragments, these processes drive&#xD;
      the switch to tissue repair and resolution of the post-infarct inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCP-1 expression is increased in ischaemic myocardium following reperfusion and this accounts&#xD;
      for a substantial proportion of the monocyte chemotactic activity. MCP-1 knockout mice&#xD;
      exhibit delayed macrophage infiltration in the healing infarct with a prolonged inflammatory&#xD;
      phase and delayed replacement of injured cardiomyocytes with granulation tissue. The MCP-1&#xD;
      deficient mice have similar size infarcts but attenuated remodelling compared to wild types.&#xD;
      MCP-1 mRNA levels are increased 40-fold within non-infarcted myocardium and blockade of MCP-1&#xD;
      signalling with a deletion mutant of MCP-1 markedly reduced macrophage infiltration both&#xD;
      within the infarct and non-infarcted myocardium. Widespread myocardial inflammatory cell&#xD;
      infiltration beyond the non-infarcted zone has been observed in human autopsy specimens.&#xD;
      Blockade of MCP-1 signalling is associated with improved survival rates and reduced left&#xD;
      ventricular dilatation as well as reduced tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α gene expression in&#xD;
      the non-infarcted myocardium. These studies indicate that macrophage activity outside the&#xD;
      infarct zone may contribute to adverse myocardial remodelling following myocardial&#xD;
      infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammatory response to myocardial infarction is necessarily complex to coordinate the&#xD;
      development of a healing scar from infarcted tissue. The role of the macrophage differs&#xD;
      depending on differentiation and location within the myocardium. Therapeutic manipulation of&#xD;
      this healing process will only come from understanding mechanisms and targeting reparative&#xD;
      pathways. Indiscriminate immunosuppressive therapy in this setting may result in harm as&#xD;
      observed in trials with methylprednisolone in acute myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Tracking Cellular Inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron oxide particles can be used as a contrast medium in magnetic resonance imaging since&#xD;
      they can alter the magnetic properties and relaxation of tissues after application of&#xD;
      radiofrequency pulses. Such contrast media consist of an iron oxide core within a dextran&#xD;
      coat. They can be classified as &quot;superparamagnetic iron oxide particles&quot; (SPIOs) consisting&#xD;
      of particles over 30 nm in diameter, or &quot;ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles&quot;&#xD;
      (USPIOs) which are under 30 nm in diameter. USPIOs are taken up by cells of the liver,&#xD;
      spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes. They have the capacity to extravasate through&#xD;
      capillaries and be phagocytosed by tissue inflammatory cells of the reticuloendothelial&#xD;
      system. These cells are predominately macrophages, but neutrophils have also been shown to&#xD;
      take up USPIOs. This model of USPIO-enhanced MRI can highlight areas of inflammation in&#xD;
      models of vertebral osteomyelitis, aortic atherosclerosis, arthritis-induced hyperperfusion,&#xD;
      autoimmune encephalomyelitis, nephritis and nephropathy, cerebral ischaemia and renal&#xD;
      ischaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Data in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have undertaken preliminary proof-of-concept studies examining the&#xD;
      possibility of using USPIOs to image the myocardium in patients having sustained a recent&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction. To date, the investigators have studied 16 patients following ST&#xD;
      segment elevation myocardial infarction treated with reperfusion therapy and undertaken&#xD;
      serial magnetic resonance imaging scans. By undertaking T2* maps of the myocardium before and&#xD;
      24-h after USPIO administration, the investigators calculated the R2* value (the inverse of&#xD;
      T2*) and represented this as a colour-coded R2* map. This demonstrated a 2-3 fold increase in&#xD;
      the R2* value in the infarct and peri-infarct area. As a negative control, the investigators&#xD;
      have observed little or no change in the R2* value in myocardium remote from the site of&#xD;
      ischaemia or skeletal muscle. The liver demonstrates marked uptake of USPIOs with a 3-4 fold&#xD;
      increase in R2* value.&#xD;
