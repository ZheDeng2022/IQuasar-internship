  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is a recessively inherited disorder due to systemic storage of abnormal&#xD;
      metabolites (ceramide trihexocide, in particular) caused by lack of the lysosomal enzyme&#xD;
      α-galactosidase. Though X-linked, in patient series there are often equal numbers of males&#xD;
      (hemizygotes ) and females (heterozygotes, probably caused by a mutation in one allele and an&#xD;
      inactivation on the other allele in the X chromosomes), and many clinical features are&#xD;
      shared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal storage in endothelial and smooth muscle cells explains morbidity, including a&#xD;
      shortened life expectancy. This is due to age dependent ischaemic manifestations that affect&#xD;
      heart, kidney and brain. Angiofibroma is an early cutaneous manifestation, and painful&#xD;
      acro-paresthesias express juvenile neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cornea verticillata is an almost obligate ophthalmic finding. The brown-yellow Bowman&#xD;
      membrane related corneal deposits and teleangiectatic conjunctival vessels are early&#xD;
      ophthalmic slit-lamp markers of the disorder; further there can be subtle lens opacities.&#xD;
      Fundus vessel tortuosity is observed in many patients, in particular of the retinal venules,&#xD;
      but best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is usually normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the introduction of enzyme substitution therapy in 2001, ophthalmic examinations were&#xD;
      scheduled as regular part of the general evaluation of the Fabry patients at Rigshospitalet,&#xD;
      Denmark. A 10-year ophthalmic state of arts was part of oral presentations at a Copenhagen&#xD;
      conference in December 2011. In contrast to the common occurrence of systemic vascular&#xD;
      sequels, only one patient in the series had suffered severe visual loss; this was unilateral&#xD;
      and occurred years before institution of the enzyme therapy. In 2013, however, another young&#xD;
      male presented a similar retinal event. Sporadic cases of visual loss are reported in the&#xD;
      literature, but in larger Fabry series ocular vascular catastrophes appear the exception to&#xD;
      the rule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the introduction of enzyme substitution, we found it of interest to present our&#xD;
      nationwide Danish experience. We focused on retinal vessel morphology and the relation to&#xD;
      systemic morbidity.&#xD;

      (Cox 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal storage in endothelial and smooth muscle cells explains morbidity, including a&#xD;
      shortened life expectancy (Frost &amp; Tanaka 1966; Desnick et al. 1976; deVeber et al.1992;&#xD;
      Hughes &amp; Mehta 2005; Nguyen et al. 2005; Sodi et al. 2007). This is due to age dependent&#xD;
      ischaemic manifestations that affect heart, kidney and brain. Angiofibroma is an early&#xD;
      cutaneous manifestation, and painful acro-paresthesias express juvenile neuropathy (Cox 2005;&#xD;
      Cleary et al. 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cornea verticillata is an almost obligate ophthalmic finding. The brown-yellow Bowman&#xD;
      membrane related corneal deposits and teleangiectatic conjunctival vessels are early&#xD;

      Fundus vessel tortuosity is observed in many patients, in particular of the retinal venules,&#xD;
      but best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is usually normal (Ballantyne &amp; Michaelson 1970; Lou&#xD;
      et al. 1970; Sher et al. 1979; Utsumi et al. 2009).&#xD;

      and occurred years before institution of the enzyme therapy (Andersen et al. 1994). In 2013,&#xD;
      however, another young male presented a similar retinal event. Sporadic cases of visual loss&#xD;
      are reported in the literature (Sher et al. 1978,1979; Tuupurainen et al. 1981; Sakkuraba et&#xD;
      al. 1986; Utsumi et al. 2009), but in larger Fabry series ocular vascular catastrophes appear&#xD;
      the exception to the rule (Orssaud et al. 2003; Hughes &amp; Mehta 2005; Nguyen et al. 2005; Sodi&#xD;
