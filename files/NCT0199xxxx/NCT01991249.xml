    <textblock>
      Acute leukemias are a heterogeneous group of hematologic malignancies. They result from&#xD;
      clonal expansion of immature cells whose number is greater than 20% in bone marrow. Childhood&#xD;
      acute leukemias are the most common pediatric malignancies. In Europe and the United states,&#xD;
      they represent about 35% of childhood cancers. 80% of them are acute lymphoblastic leukemia&#xD;
      (ALL) and 15-20% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Current treatments allow a cure in about&#xD;
      80% of ALL, while this level is only 50% in AML.Acute leukemia diagnosis is based on the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary exploration of leukemia cells by different techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cellular: cytology, immunophenotyping and cytochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytogenetic: conventional (karyotype) and molecular (FISH) cytogenetic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Molecular: RT-PCR and RQ-PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytogenetic studies are performed at time of acute leukemia diagnosis. Indeed, the WHO 2008&#xD;
      classification of acute leukemia is based largely on the presence of recurrent cytogenetic&#xD;
      and molecular abnormalities. The most frequent chromosomal aberrations have been associated&#xD;
      with specific clinical and biological characteristics and are now used as diagnosis and&#xD;
      prognostic markers. These chromosomal abnormalities affect genes involving in the&#xD;
      leukemogenesis process. These rearrangements are of several types:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fusion genes causing :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Repression of transcriptional activity of genes involved in differentiation of&#xD;
                hematopoietic cells (AML1-ETO, PML-RARA…)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Deregulation of signal transduction pathway (eg BCR-ABL chimeric protein with&#xD;
                constitutive tyrosine kinase activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changing in the state of chromatin condensation resulting changes of transcription&#xD;
                (MLL gene rearrangements in 11q23, MOZ en 8p11…)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deregulation of genes expression: chromosomal rearrangements can sometimes induce&#xD;
           deregulation of adjacent genes to the breakpoint. For example, inv(3)(q21q26) or&#xD;
           t(3;3)(q21;q26) induce over expression of transcriptional factor EVI-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of function due to deletion of variable size in genomic regions containing genes&#xD;
           with a role in the differentiation, apoptosis, or cell proliferation (eg IKZF1, PAX5…)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the karyotype, which allows to have a global view of the genome; FISH, a&#xD;
      targeted technique, is used to highlight invisible abnormalities on karyotype (cryptic&#xD;
      abnormalities) or the time of karyotype failure. However, conventional and molecular&#xD;
      cytogenetic techniques do not highlight any abnormalities (eg different partners involved in&#xD;
      the formation of fusion genes in particular for MLL gene rearrangement, mutations) hence our&#xD;
      interest in next generation sequencing.Indeed, the high throughput targeted sequencing&#xD;
      messenger RNAs (RNA-seq) has the avantage of allow identification of different types of&#xD;
      mutations in a single test, with exception of epigenetic mutations. The importance of RNAs&#xD;
      sequencing rather than DNA genomic is the one hand, a very significant decrease in the volume&#xD;
      of sequences to analyze because transcribed mRNA genes represent about 5% of the genome size&#xD;
      and secondly, a better identification of chimeric genes. The RNA-seq has used as a research&#xD;
      tool in hematologic malignancies. The purpose of this project is to use innovative technology&#xD;
      to develop a new diagnostic and prognostic new tool in hematological malignancies. 50 acute&#xD;
      leukemias will be tested and results will be analyzed according to three criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantity, quality and relevance of information provided for the diagnosis, monitoring&#xD;
           and therapeutic management compared to a conventional strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period required to obtain results and methods to decrease the analysis time so that&#xD;
           results can be integrated into therapeutic decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Economic evaluation, which will calculate the cost of this diagnosis option and assess&#xD;
           the cost/benefit ratio In future, other innovative approaches will be implemented (study&#xD;
           of imbalances genomic abnormalities by array-CGH, transcriptome analysis with&#xD;
           micro-array, and study of methylome) to identify the &quot;molecular signature&quot; of each&#xD;
           leukemia and set of informative abnormalities for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of&#xD;
           disease and monitoring of residual disease.&#xD;
