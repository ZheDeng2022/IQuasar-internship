      Evaluate the feasibility of using FDOPA-PET/MRI pediatric patients with CNS tumors. Positive&#xD;
      results in this small study would provide the data needed to expand the study to validate the&#xD;
      use in a larger population of pediatric patients. Validating the use of FDOPA-PET imaging as&#xD;
      an early predictor for response to anti-angiogenic therapy could greatly impact the standard&#xD;
      of care for treating and evaluating pediatric brain tumors and provide a useful biomarker for&#xD;
      assessing experimental therapeutics.&#xD;

          -  Urine protein should be screened by dipstick analysis. If protein ≥ 2+ on dipstick,&#xD;
             then Urine Protein Creatinine (UPC) ratio should be calculated. If UPC ratio &gt;1,&#xD;

        Note: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24 hour urine protein excretion- a&#xD;
        UPC ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1 gm. UPC ratio is&#xD;
        calculated using of the following formulae:&#xD;
&#xD;
        [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] - if both protein and creatinine are reported in mg/dL&#xD;
        [(urine protein x 0.088]/[urine creatinine] - if urine creatinine is reported in mmol/L&#xD;
