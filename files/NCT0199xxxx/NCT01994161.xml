      This trial is an prospective, government-funded registration study that will observe the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of intracranial stenting for preventing stroke during a mean&#xD;
      follow-up of 12 months in patients with symptomatic stenosis of a major intracranial artery&#xD;
      (MCA, carotid, vertebral, basilar). This trial will be launched by Xuanwu Hospital, Capital&#xD;
      University of Medical Science, with 20 collaborators participating. Enrollment will begin in&#xD;
      2013, and it aims to have a sample size of 840 subjects in 2 years. The trial is scheduled to&#xD;
      complete in 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As we know, SAMMPRIS is flawed with defect in design, heterogeneity in experience and&#xD;
      credentials of operators and high rate of complication; Whether the interventional therapy&#xD;
      for symtomatic intracranial artery stenosis is effective or not remained resolved. This trial&#xD;
      has been modified based on SAMMPRIS in order to acquire the data for China: Technique,&#xD;
      experience, and credential of the operators are closely related with perioperative&#xD;
      complications in PTAS. The investigators select 50 large-scale medical centers for&#xD;
      participation on the basis of geographical distribution. All the participants are ranked as&#xD;
      top in China. They have the most experienced surgeons or interventionist in China, and are&#xD;
      fully qualified for this trial. This will guarantee the success and safety of technique,&#xD;
      maintain the continuity of operator's experience, and make the complication rate as low as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;

      Title:Clinical Registration Trial of Intracranial Stenting for Patients With Symptomatic&#xD;
      Intracranial Artery Stenosis:A Prospective Multi-center, Registry Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is an prospective, government-funded registration study that will observe the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of intracranial stenting for preventing stroke during a mean&#xD;
      follow-up of 3 years in patients with symptomatic stenosis of a major intracranial artery&#xD;
      (MCA, carotid, vertebral, basilar). This trial was launched by Xuanwu Hospital, Capital&#xD;
      University of Medical Science, with 40 collaborators participating. Enrollment will begin in&#xD;
      2013, and it aims to have a sample size of 840 subjects in 2 years. The trial is scheduled to&#xD;
      complete in 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMMPRIS (Stenting vs. Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in&#xD;
      Intracranial Stenosis) hasn't received the expected results; But, it does not mean that&#xD;
      angioplasty with stent on intracranial treatment come to a full stop. On the contrary, a&#xD;
      discrepancy on reported data between multi-centre RCT and most single center studies urges us&#xD;
      for thorough investigation in future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As we know, SAMMPRIS is flawed with defect in design, heterogeneity in experience and&#xD;
      credentials of operators and high rate of complication; Some questions about SAMMPRIS have&#xD;
      been raised, and remained unresolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial has been modified based on SAMMPRIS in order to acquire the data for China:&#xD;
      Technique, experience, and credential of the operators are closely related with perioperative&#xD;
      complications in PTAS. The investigators select 40 large-scale medical centers for&#xD;
      participation on the basis of geographical distribution. All the participants are ranked as&#xD;
      top in China. They have the most experienced surgeons or interventionist in China, and are&#xD;
      fully qualified for this trial. This will guarantee the success and safety of technique,&#xD;
      maintain the continuity of operator's experience, and make the complication rate as low as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMMPRIS was stopped ahead of schedule due to the safety concern. More than half of the PTAS&#xD;
      patients were lost for follow-up at 1 year, and the remaining were followed up with a mean&#xD;
      duration less than 1 year. It leaves the question of long-time follow-up data open. Base on&#xD;
      SAMMPRIS, the investigators' trial will conduct a systematic follow-up system. Upon&#xD;
      recruitment, all the patients' neurological and imaging examination will be determined at&#xD;
      baseline, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months , 12 months after surgery, respectively.&#xD;
