             or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours before the start of ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Men of fathering potential must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid&#xD;
             conception throughout the study [and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Patients must agree to blood sampling to participate in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;

             years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin&#xD;
             cancer, superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or DCIS. Patients&#xD;
             with prior malignancies that are not considered to be an active problem may be&#xD;
             enrolled at the discretion of the investigator, regardless of time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients&#xD;
             with a history of symptomatic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive&#xD;
             sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [eg,&#xD;
             Wegener's Granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g.&#xD;
             Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases (for up to&#xD;
             1 month before or after any dose of ipilimumab).&#xD;

             inhibitor or agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL 2, interferon, or other non-study&#xD;
             immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; other&#xD;
             investigation therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids in the previous 4&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined above in Section 4.1, who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception to avoid&#xD;
                  pregnancy for their entire study period and for at least 26 weeks after cessation&#xD;
                  of study drug, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for&#xD;
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious) illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception throughout treatment and for at least 26 weeks after ipilimumab is&#xD;
             stopped. Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during&#xD;
             the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Before&#xD;
             study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during&#xD;
             study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. All&#xD;
             WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test before first receiving ipilimumab. If the&#xD;
             pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive ipilimumab and must not be&#xD;
             enrolled in the study.&#xD;
