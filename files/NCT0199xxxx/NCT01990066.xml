    <textblock>
      Implementation of a home based exercise program to reduce functional decline, cancer related&#xD;
      fatigue (CRF) and improve quality of life in the elderly gynecologic oncology patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can prevention of CRF and loss of function improve QOL in the elderly gynecologic oncology&#xD;
      patient undergoing chemotherapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Support:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue and its impact on QOL is a major concern with the elderly patient receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy. When compared to younger adults QOL is more important than gain in survival for&#xD;
      elderly patients. (Eyigor, et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends exercise as the most effective&#xD;
      intervention for cancer related fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single institution randomized controlled study to evaluate a home based exercise&#xD;
      program in elderly gynecologic oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention group or to the control group receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group will receive a home exercise program 3 days weekly consisting of 30mins of&#xD;
      strength and aerobic activity, utilizing a follow along exercise DVD and patient log to&#xD;
      assist with compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups will be compared by 1) objective PT assessment with the Berg Balance and 6&#xD;
      minute walk test (before or after) Cycle 1 and 6, 2) subjective nursing assessment with the&#xD;
      NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) and FACIT- F (Functional Assessment&#xD;
      of Chronic Illness Therapy: Fatigue) prior to Cycle 1 (baseline),4 (midpoint), and following&#xD;
      cycle 6 (completion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PT directed home exercise program may improve CRF, functional decline, and QOL in elderly&#xD;
      gynecologic oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;
