  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In anemia of chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease, patients suffer from low hemoglobin levels, which contribute to feelings of malaise&#xD;
      and fatigue. The current accepted practice is often to administer erythropoietin-stimulating&#xD;
      agents (ESAs), which act like the body's natural hormones to stimulate the production of red&#xD;
      blood cells from bone marrow. Although ESAs are widely used in CKD, recent evidence suggests&#xD;
      that they are not as safe as previously thought. In this study, we seek to test a decision&#xD;
      aid to be used when a patient visits his or her nephrologist at Vanderbilt. The objective of&#xD;
      the decision aid is to reduce patient confusion, improve their satisfaction with their care,&#xD;
      improve their knowledge of kidney disease, and ultimately bring more clarity to patients&#xD;
      about a controversial but ubiquitous drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision aid will be about 1 page long and will include questions and information that&#xD;
      might help the patient be more active and informed regarding the choice of a course of ESA&#xD;
      therapy. We will ask patients to answer questions before and after their clinic visits&#xD;
      regarding their satisfaction and confidence in their treatment and their knowledge of kidney&#xD;
      disease; we will ask some of the same questions 3 months after the clinic visit. We will&#xD;
      compare patients who are counseled using the decision aid to patients who are not. We&#xD;
      anticipate total experiment running time to be approximately 5 months to recruit and follow&#xD;
      up on all patients.&#xD;
