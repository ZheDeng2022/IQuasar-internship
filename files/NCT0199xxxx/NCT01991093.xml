  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin-clopidogrel reduces the risk of cardiovascular episodes&#xD;
      after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with acute coronary syndromes.&#xD;
      However, a significant number of patients experience recurrent events while on such therapy.&#xD;
      The individual response to dual antiplatelet therapy is not uniform, and consistent findings&#xD;
      across multiple investigations support the association between a lower degree of platelet&#xD;
      inhibition, high on-treatment platelet reactivity, and the occurrence of atherothrombotic&#xD;
      events [1, 2]. Particularly in diabetic patients, clopidogrel resistance is more prevalent&#xD;
      compared with non-diabetics [3,4], which seems to contribute to the increased&#xD;
      atherothrombotic risk in these patients compared with those without diabetes mellitus (DM)&#xD;
      [5]. A number of platelet function instruments have now become available that are simple to&#xD;
      use and can be utilized as point-of-care (POC) instruments in order to monitor antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy and potentially assess the risk of a recurrent event [6].&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of a new POC device, the multiple electrode&#xD;
      aggregometry (Multiplate, Dynabyte, Munich, Germany) to detect clopidogrel resistance and&#xD;
      predict the clinical outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coronary&#xD;
      artery disease (CAD) in comparison with the light transmittance aggregometry (LTA), which is&#xD;
      considered the gold standard of platelet function testing [7]. 280 patients with T2DM between&#xD;
      20 and 75 years of age treated with oral and/or parenteral hypoglycaemic therapy for at least&#xD;
      1 month and angiographically established coronary artery disease on the grounds of a previous&#xD;
      ST elevation, non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome or unstable angina treated with&#xD;
      clopidogrel 75 mg/day in combination with daily per os aspirin therapy for at least 7 days&#xD;
      after documentation of CAD, will be recruited. Patients' enrollment will take place in the&#xD;
      Second University Department of Cardiology of the &quot;Attiko&quot; University Hospital in Athens,&#xD;
      Greece. Baseline assessment will include recording of demographic data, medical history,&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors, hematological parameters, number of diseased vessels, number of&#xD;
      stented vessels, previous myocardial infarction (MI), previous revascularization, ejection&#xD;
      fraction and concomitant medications. Patients with renal (creatinine levels &gt; 2.5 mg/dl) or&#xD;
      hepatic (bilirubin level &gt; 2 mg/dL) insufficiency, malignant disease, use of drugs known to&#xD;
      affect platelet function, history of bleeding diathesis, platelet count &lt; 100x109/L and a&#xD;
      hematocrit &lt; 28% will be excluded. The protocol will be approved by the institutional review&#xD;
      board of &quot;Attiko&quot; University Hospital and all patients will give written informed consent&#xD;
      before undergoing any study procedure or receiving any study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet function measurements will be performed on study enrollment. Patients will be&#xD;
      identified either as poor or good responders to clopidogrel. The primary end-point will be&#xD;
      defined as a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      stent thrombosis, ischemic stroke, urgent rehospitalization for acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
      and/or revascularisation during 1-year follow-up period. Episodes of major bleeding according&#xD;
      to PLATO criteria will be recorded during follow-up [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of the two methods to detect clopidogrel resistance will be evaluated and the&#xD;
      potential correlation between response to antiplatelet treatment and clinical outcome will be&#xD;
      assessed. In parallel, patients with similar characteristics, but treated with prasugrel or&#xD;
      ticagrelor, will be used as control group of the same sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet Function Analysis Platelet function analysis will be performed in the Laboratory of&#xD;
      Haematology and Blood Bank Unit of &quot;Attiko&quot; University Hospital. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected from an antecubital vein 2 to 4 h after antiplatelet therapy intake. The first 2 to&#xD;
      4 ml of blood will be discarded to avoid spontaneous platelet activation and platelet&#xD;
      function tests will be performed within two hours of sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) The whole blood specimen will be collected in 3.8%&#xD;
      trisodium citrate and centrifuged at 200 g for 10 minutes to obtain platelet-rich plasma&#xD;
      (PRP). The remaining specimen will be re-centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 minutes to obtain&#xD;
      platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The platelet count will be adjusted to between 200,000/μl and&#xD;
      300,000/μl with PPP. Aggregation will be performed using a Biodata-PAP-4 aggregometer&#xD;
      (Bio/Data Corporation, PA, USA). The 100% line will be set using PPP and a 0% baseline&#xD;
      established with PRP before addition of the agonist. The agonist used will be ADP 2.0×10-5 M&#xD;
      (Bio/Data Corporation, PA, USA). Test procedure will be performed as previously described&#xD;
      [9]. In brief, 0.45 mL PRP is transferred into a cuvette incubated at 37 °C for 3 minutes.&#xD;
      Then 0.05 mL of the agonist is added into the PRP and the aggregation pattern is allowed to&#xD;
      generate for 6 minutes. Platelet aggregation was determined as the maximal percent change in&#xD;
      light transmittance from baseline using PPP as a reference. Cut-off value of &gt; 59%&#xD;
      aggregation following 20 microM ADP stimulation will be defined as that indicating of high&#xD;
      on-treatment platelet reactivity [10]. Other tested parameters will be late aggregation and&#xD;
      the degree of disaggregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) Platelet aggregation in whole blood will be assessed by&#xD;
      MEA using an impedance aggregometer (Multiplate, Dynabyte, Munich, Germany). Samples will be&#xD;
      collected into 3.2% citrate tubes and analyzed within the period of half to two hours after&#xD;
      blood collection according to manufacturer's instructions. Platelet aggregation will be&#xD;
      induced by ADP in final concentration 6.5 μM. Each disposable test cell contains two pairs of&#xD;
      electrodes, thus enabling two simultaneous measurements. Aggregation will reported as area&#xD;
      under the curve (AUC), an integrated measure of aggregation velocity and maximal aggregation.&#xD;
      Cut-off value for HRPR by MEA (&gt; 468 arbitrary aggregation units/min in response to ADP by&#xD;
      Multiplate analyzer) was defined according to the recently published consensus statement on&#xD;
      the definition of high on-treatment platelet reactivity to adenosine diphosphate [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this prospective cohort study, the primary end point will be defined as a composite&#xD;
           of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis,&#xD;
           ischemic stroke, urgent rehospitalisation for acute coronary syndrome and/or&#xD;
           revascularisation during the 1-year follow-up period. Episodes of major bleeding&#xD;
           according to PLATO criteria will be recorded during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Descriptive statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
           They will be presented as means ± SD, medians and interquartile ranges (IQR), or&#xD;
           percentages when appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison of baseline data (demographic data, medical history, cardiovascular risk&#xD;
           factors, hematological parameters, number of diseased vessels, previous myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, previous revascularisation, ejection fraction and concomitant medications)&#xD;
           between responders and non-responders to clopidogrel:&#xD;
&#xD;
           First, we will use the Shapiro-Wilk test to check for the normality of data&#xD;
           distributions. Continuous variables will be compared by means of the two-sample&#xD;
           Student's t test (when the distribution is found normal) or by means of the&#xD;
           non-parametric two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test (when the distribution&#xD;
           is found non-normal). Categorical variables will be compared using the Pearson's&#xD;
           chi-squared test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Agreement of the two methods in detecting resistance to clopidogrel:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Agreement between &quot;Multiplate&quot; and &quot;ADP-induced LTA&quot; will be determined by kappa&#xD;
           statistics and the respective p-values. Kappa values of &lt; 0.20 are considered to&#xD;
           indicate poor agreement, 0.21 to 0.40 indicate fair agreement, 0.41 to 0.60 indicate&#xD;
           moderate agreement, 0.61 to 0.80 indicate good agreement, and &gt;0.81 indicate very good&#xD;
           agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Correlation of laboratory resistance with clinical outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Logistic regression analysis will be used in order to evaluate whether the methods of&#xD;
           detecting resistance to clopidogrel (&quot;Multiplate&quot; and &quot;ADP-induced LTA&quot;) are associated&#xD;
           with the clinical outcome (end-point). To evaluate whether these associations are&#xD;
           independent, certain covariates that are well-known risk factors (ie., cardiovascular&#xD;
           risk factors, number of diseased vessels, previous myocardial infarction, previous&#xD;
           revascularisation, etc) will be included in the multivariable logistic regression&#xD;
           models. The crude and the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95%&#xD;
           confidence intervals (CIs) will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Level of significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
           For hypothesis testing, a probability level of &lt; 0.05 will be considered as&#xD;
           statistically significant. All statistical tests will be two-sided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Statistical software:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stata software will be used for all statistical analyses (Stata Corp., College Station,&#xD;
           TX, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study sample size calculation, we hypothesize that clopidogrel resistance CR(+) is&#xD;
      more prevalent among T2DM patients compared with non-DM patients [12, 13]; at the same time,&#xD;
      the DM group of patients with clopidogrel resistance suffer an increased likelihood of&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events [14]. It has been shown that 13% of the general population of&#xD;
      T2DM patients suffer a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) [including death secondary&#xD;
      to cardiovascular cause, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-segment&#xD;
      elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (UA) and stroke]; this number&#xD;
      increases to 38% among T2DM patients with clopidogrel resistance who remain on clopidogrel&#xD;
      treatment [15]. The sample size needed to detect this difference in adverse event rates -&#xD;
      between CR(+) and CR(-) diabetic patients - with a two-sided a risk of 5% and a b risk of 20%&#xD;
      (power of 80%) will have to be 101 patients [40 in CR(+) group and 61 in CR(-) group]. If we&#xD;
      assume an attrition rate of 10%, the sample size should be further increased to 111 patients&#xD;
      [44 in CR(+) group and 67 in CR(-) group]. Finally, taking under consideration that&#xD;
      clopidogrel resistance among T2DM patients can be estimated to reach approximately 40%&#xD;
      [16-18], the initial sample of all diabetic patients should be 2.5 times larger, or 278&#xD;
      patients (111 clopidogrel-resistant and 167 clopidogrel-sensitive). The statistical software&#xD;
      G*Power 3.1.3 (Kiel, Germany) was used for sample size calculation.&#xD;
