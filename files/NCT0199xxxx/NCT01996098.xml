      The purpose of this study is studying icotinib following chemotherapy to see how well it&#xD;
      works compared to chemotherapy in treating patients with resected stage IIA-IIIA NSCLC&#xD;
      harboring EGFR mutation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for routine use in patients with fully resected stage&#xD;
      IIA-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) show great efficacy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutation. Icotinib is a novel EGFR-TKI developed by a group of&#xD;
      Chinese scientists. In the phase III ICOGEN trial, icotinib had non-inferiority efficacy to&#xD;
      gefitinib with better safety. In phase II trial, chemotherapy followed by 6-month gefitinib&#xD;
      as adjuvant therapy can confer longer disease-free survival compared with chemotherapy alone&#xD;
      in patients with resected stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations.&#xD;
      This study is to studying 6-month or 12-month icotinib following chemotherapy to see how well&#xD;
      it works compared to chemotherapy in treating patients with resected stage IIA-IIIA NSCLC&#xD;
      harboring EGFR mutation.&#xD;
