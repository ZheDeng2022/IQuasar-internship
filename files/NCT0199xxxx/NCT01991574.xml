  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ferric hydroxide adipate is a ferric iron supplement containing iron hydroxide and a dietary&#xD;
      organic acid that was developed at MRC Human Nutrition Research. We aim to determine if the&#xD;
      ingestion of ferric hydroxide adipate with food induces a reduction in urinary phosphate&#xD;
      concentration, compared with the administration of placebo plus the same food on a different&#xD;
      occasion. We hypothesise that ferric hydroxide adipate binds some phosphate ions in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, which prevents part of the phosphate load in a meal from being&#xD;
      absorbed. On another visit, calcium will be given with the same food, as a positive control,&#xD;
      since this element is well known to restrict dietary phosphate absorption through the&#xD;
      formation of insoluble calcium phosphates in the gut lumen. We will compare urinary phosphate&#xD;
      concentrations after co-ingestion of the calcium salt and food versus urinary phosphate&#xD;
      following ferric hydroxide adipate and the same food. Additionally, the calcium data will be&#xD;
      compared with placebo data, since a significant reduction in urinary phosphate concentrations&#xD;
      after calcium treatment will confirm the suitability of the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, iron absorption from the ferric hydroxide adipate treatment will be determined by&#xD;
      labelling this preparation with 58Fe and measuring day 14 erythrocyte 57Fe:58Fe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is: Three-way cross-over volunteer absorption study. Volunteers will not be&#xD;
      told which treatment they receive (placebo, ferric hydroxide adipate, or supplemental&#xD;
      calcium). Researchers co-ordinating the study on a day to day basis will be aware of&#xD;
      treatment allocation, but analysts will not be told which samples correspond to which&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
