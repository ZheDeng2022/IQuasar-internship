  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white&#xD;
           blood cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and&#xD;
           then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating&#xD;
           Lymphocytes, or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 400 patients with&#xD;
           melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this trial, we are determining if there is a difference in the response between&#xD;
           patients who have received prior anti-PD1 treatment to those who have not received this&#xD;
           prior ant-PD1 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine if there is a difference in the rate of response between patients who have&#xD;
      received prior anti-PD1 and those who have not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years of age who have metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Work up stage: Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
           Blood and urine samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery: Surgery or biopsy will be performed to obtain tumor from which to grow white&#xD;
           blood cells. White blood cells will be grown from the tumor in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis: Participants will have leukapheresis to collect additional white blood&#xD;
           cells. (Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells&#xD;
           from the patient.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment: Participants will receive standard dose chemotherapy to prepare their immune&#xD;
           system to accept the white blood cells. Participants will receive an infusion of their&#xD;
           own white blood cells grown from tumor. They will also receive aldesleukin for up to&#xD;
           five days to boost the immune system s response to the white blood cells. They will stay&#xD;
           in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side&#xD;
           effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every&#xD;
           6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2&#xD;
           days.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes can mediate&#xD;
           the regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered along with high-dose&#xD;
           aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy&#xD;
           preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a series of consecutive trials using this chemotherapy preparative regimen alone or&#xD;
           with 2 Gy or 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) objective response rates using RECIST&#xD;
           criteria were 49%, 52%, and 72%, respectively. Of the 20 complete regressions seen in&#xD;
           this trial, 19 are on-going at 70 to 114 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The chemotherapy alone preparative regimen required in-patient treatment and was&#xD;
           associated with significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia requiring multiple&#xD;
           transfusions and treatment for febrile neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With amendment D, to determine if there is a difference in the rate of response between&#xD;
           patients who have received prior anti-PD1 and those who have not; both groups will&#xD;
           receive non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative regimen followed by autologous&#xD;
           young TIL and administration of high dose aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the toxicity of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluable metastatic melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No contraindications to high-dose aldesleukin administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with metastatic melanoma will have lesions resected and after TIL growth is&#xD;
           established, patients will receive ACT with TIL plus aldesleukin following high dose&#xD;
           chemotherapy preparative regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 64 patients may be enrolled over 4-5 years.&#xD;

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Measurable metastatic melanoma with at least one lesion that is resectable for TIL&#xD;
             generation and at least one other lesion that can be measured by RECIST criteria.&#xD;

             NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are less than 1 cm in diameter and&#xD;
             asymptomatic are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with stereotactic&#xD;
             radiosurgery must be clinically stable for 1 month after treatment for the patient to&#xD;
             be eligible. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to 70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign the Informed Consent&#xD;

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in&#xD;
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV&#xD;
                  seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus are less responsive to&#xD;
                  the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody.&#xD;
                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the&#xD;
                  presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the&#xD;
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time&#xD;
             the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients toxicities must have&#xD;
             recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia or vitiligo).&#xD;
             Patients must have progressive disease after prior treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks,&#xD;
             as long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects must be co-enrolled in 03-C-0277&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the&#xD;
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in&#xD;
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune&#xD;
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible&#xD;
             to its toxicities).&#xD;
