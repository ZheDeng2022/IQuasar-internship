      Overall, this study will determine (1) the effect of vaccine type (FluMist vs. TIV) on&#xD;
      immunization rates, (2) assess the feasibility of school immunization clinics, and (3) inform&#xD;
      a larger study to understand the effects of these two vaccines on reducing influenza.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Our study partnership (Public Health Agency of Canada [PHAC] / Canadian Institutes of Health&#xD;
      Research [CIHR] Influenza Research Network [PCIRN], Public Health Ontario [PHO], and PCCHU),&#xD;
      with the support of Ontario's Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care [MOHLTC], will conduct an&#xD;
      open-label randomized trial in elementary schools within the geographic boundaries of PCCHU&#xD;
      during the 2013-14 influenza vaccination campaign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to address the four study objectives in our comparison of LAIV vs. TIV via SBII, we&#xD;
      will use multiple methodologies: questionnaires, interviews, and household surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall study design PCCHU implemented SBII in elementary schools from 2000 to 2010, and we&#xD;
      have approval from the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board (KPRDSB) to renew this&#xD;
      program for the upcoming influenza season (2013-14). Ten schools (each school having an&#xD;
      average of 300 students) will be recruited to participate in this study. The schools will be&#xD;
      randomized on a 1:1 basis (i.e., five schools in each arm) to having its students offered (at&#xD;
      no cost) 0.2 mL of LAIV or 0.5 mL of TIV at SBII clinics organized by PCCHU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (LAIV): Healthy children and adolescents between Junior Kindergarten (JK) and&#xD;
      Grade 8 in the intervention schools will be immunized with LAIV (FluMist influenza vaccine)&#xD;
      recommended for the 2013-14 the influenza season. A 0.2 ml dose of the vaccine will be&#xD;
      administered intranasally. TIV will also be available for children whose parents decline LAIV&#xD;
      but would still like their child immunized against influenza, and for children who, according&#xD;
      to 2012-13 NACI recommendations, have contraindications for LAIV: severe asthma (defined as&#xD;
      currently on oral or high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids or active wheezing) or medically&#xD;
      attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to vaccination; receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing&#xD;
      therapy because of the association of Reye's syndrome with aspirin and wild-type influenza&#xD;
      infection; and immune-compromising conditions due to underlying disease and/or therapy, as&#xD;
      the vaccine contains live attenuated virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control (TIV): Healthy children and adolescents between JK and Grade 8 in schools assigned to&#xD;
      TIV will be immunized with inactivated influenza vaccine (Vaxigrip vaccine) recommended for&#xD;
      the 2013-14 influenza season. A 0.5 ml dose of the vaccine will be administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly. Children with one or more of the following contraindications, according to&#xD;
      NACI recommendations, will not be eligible for vaccination with TIV: an anaphylactic reaction&#xD;
      to a previous dose; an anaphylactic reaction to any of the vaccine components, with the&#xD;
      exception of egg; or Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) within six weeks of a previous influenza&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children in either arm of the study who are younger than 9 years of age and have not&#xD;
      previously received influenza vaccines require two doses; following the dose administered at&#xD;
      school, they will be given a reminder letter to inform their parent/guardian that a second&#xD;
      dose can be received at healthcare settings including their family physician's office or a&#xD;
      community-based public health clinic, four weeks after the first dose as per influenza&#xD;
      immunization recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of this study, the vaccines will only be offered to children enrolled at&#xD;
      participating schools; other groups such as school staff, and students' parents and siblings&#xD;
      may obtain TIV at no cost at the settings listed above or LAIV from a physician or pharmacy&#xD;
      (paid for privately).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To determine whether offering LAIV vs. TIV via SBII leads to higher vaccine&#xD;
      coverage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A web-based questionnaire will be sent to all parents/guardians of students in&#xD;
      participating schools for whom we have contact information, to ask, among other questions,&#xD;
      about vaccination status of their child, and if the child was vaccinated, where this&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures: All parents/guardians who provided an email address will be contacted in&#xD;
      January 2014 via email with an invitation to complete an online (or paper-based, if&#xD;
      preferable) Parents' Vaccination Questionnaire on behalf of their child. Prior to beginning&#xD;
      the questionnaire, the parent/guardian will access a screen which describes the purpose of&#xD;
      the questionnaire, which data are being collected, and why. They will also be informed that&#xD;
      all questions (except for whether or not their child was vaccinated, and with which influenza&#xD;
      vaccine) are optional, and that completion of the questionnaire implies consent. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will include questions about student demographics, presence of chronic&#xD;
      conditions and other important risk factors for influenza, receipt of influenza vaccines&#xD;
      during previous influenza seasons, and receipt of influenza vaccines outside of the school&#xD;
      setting (e.g., doctor's office, pharmacy, PCCHU community-based clinic) during the current&#xD;
      influenza season. We will also request health card numbers and permission for future linkage&#xD;
      to provincial health administrative data sets housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative&#xD;
      Sciences (ICES) to assess healthcare utilization, in order to determine which of TIV and LAIV&#xD;
      is associated with fewer physician and emergency room visits. In cases where the health card&#xD;
      number is not provided or is incorrect, the first and last name, sex, and birthdate of the&#xD;
      student will be used for linkage. In April 2014, the questionnaire will be sent out again to&#xD;
      parents/guardians of children who, based on the questionnaire sent in January, had not&#xD;
      received influenza vaccine, to capture anyone whose vaccination status changed between&#xD;
      January and April, and to also provide another opportunity for parents who did not yet&#xD;
      complete the questionnaire. After the email with the questionnaire web link is sent out in&#xD;
      both January and April 2014, two email reminders will be sent over the next three weeks. For&#xD;
      parents/guardians who provide their phone number to the study team, an RA will also remind&#xD;
      them by telephone to complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: The number of students at each school for whom the Parents' Vaccination&#xD;
      Questionnaire is completed will serve as the denominator for the vaccine coverage&#xD;
      measurement, and the number of students who receive LAIV or TIV and have the questionnaire&#xD;
      completed by their parent/guardian will serve as the numerator. Separate estimates of vaccine&#xD;
      coverage will be calculated for healthy children and those with chronic conditions that place&#xD;
      them at elevated risk of serious influenza infection. As a secondary measure of immunization&#xD;
      rates, we will use vaccination data obtained by PCCHU at the beginning of January 2014, of&#xD;
      the number of doses (by vaccine type) given during the school-based clinics (numerator). We&#xD;
      will ask each principal for the number of students at their school as of November 1, 2013, to&#xD;
      use as the denominator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: To calculate the sample size required to detect a 10% increase in coverage with&#xD;
      LAIV compared to TIV (i.e., primary outcome), we used the sample size calculation for two&#xD;
      proportions based on 80% power and an alpha level of 0.05 (two-sided). The unit of&#xD;
      randomization will be the school level while the unit of analysis will be the individual&#xD;
      students in the schools. To account for the clustering effect of schools, we inflated the&#xD;
      sample size by 20% (i.e., variance inflation factor), resulting in a sample size of 451&#xD;
      students/group. We anticipate that we should have an adequate sample size since we only need&#xD;
      a response rate of 30% (902/3000), and we hope that with the incentives that we will have a&#xD;
      response rate of over 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Bivariate analysis of statistical significance of continuous variables will be&#xD;
      performed using two-tailed Student's t-tests. Proportions will be compared using Chi-Square&#xD;
      tests or Fisher's exact tests. We will identify predictors of the outcome (vaccinated or not)&#xD;
      using stepwise regression methods. To account for the clustering effect in schools, we will&#xD;
      use generalized estimating equations or mixed models to determine statistical significance of&#xD;
      continuous or dichotomous variables adjusted for covariates and interaction terms. The&#xD;
      exposure of interest will be the vaccine type (LAIV or TIV). The null hypothesis will be&#xD;
      rejected fixing the probability of type I error at 0.05 and a type II error at 0.20.&#xD;
      Two-tailed probability distributions will be used for all statistical analyses unless&#xD;
      specified. Variables will be excluded from the model if they lead to complete separation of&#xD;
      data, have &gt;10% missing values, exhibit collinearity, or have no observations in one group.&#xD;
      We will also examine the residuals to identify if model assumptions are invalid or are&#xD;
      affected by influential observations. We will use STATA version 10.0 (2007, StataCorp, LP,&#xD;
      College Station, TX) to analyze the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To assess the acceptance of administering LAIV vs. TIV via SBII based on school&#xD;
      administrator, public health, and parent/guardian perceptions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: In order to assess perceptions of the LAIV and TIV SBII programs, we will&#xD;
      interview school management staff, and public health managers, and administer questionnaires&#xD;
      to parents/guardians of students in the participating schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria: Interviewees must be members of the management staff&#xD;
      (principal, vice principal) of the participating schools, or PCCHU manager or immunization&#xD;
      nurse, and have been involved in some aspect of the coordination of the SBII clinic. The&#xD;
      Parents' Vaccination Questionnaire will be used to gauge parental perceptions of the&#xD;
      different vaccine types, and will be administered to all parents/guardians for whom we have&#xD;
      contact information, regardless of whether or not their child was vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews with school management staff immediately following the SBII clinic days to&#xD;
           understand their experiences with coordinating the program, any facilitators/barriers to&#xD;
           its continued existence, and also experiences/interactions with parents regarding this&#xD;
           program. The Information Letter and preliminary interview guide are outlined in&#xD;
           Appendices H and I. These interviews will take place over the telephone in November or&#xD;
           December, 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews with public health immunization staff (manager(s) and nurses) to gauge&#xD;
           perceptions of the program, and of administration of LAIV vs. TIV, based on logistical&#xD;
           factors including time to coordinate the program, communication with parents, and staff&#xD;
           time. These interviews are scheduled to take place in November or December, 2013;&#xD;
           however, if the public health staff are unavailable at this time due to conducting&#xD;
           vaccination clinics, we will conduct these telephone interviews in January 2014 instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions related to parent/guardian experiences with SBII clinics, as well as their&#xD;
           perceptions of LAIV vs. TIV, specifically regarding safety, effectiveness, and&#xD;
           acceptability (invasiveness, concerns about administration, adverse events, etc.), will&#xD;
           be included in the Parents' Vaccination Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: The outcome of this study component is stakeholder (school staff, public health, and&#xD;
      parents) perceptions of the LAIV and TIV SBII programs, specific to coordination,&#xD;
      facilitators/barriers, and overall experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: We anticipate that we will interview approximately one principal or&#xD;
      vice-principal from each of the 10 schools, as well as five PCCHU managers or staff members.&#xD;
      However, the number of interviews conducted with each of these stakeholder groups will&#xD;
      ultimately be based on the number of individuals who were involved in planning of the SBII&#xD;
      clinics; therefore, fewer or more interviews may be conducted, as appropriate. The Parents'&#xD;
      Vaccination Questionnaire will be used to gauge parental perceptions of the different vaccine&#xD;
      types, and will be administered to all parents/guardians for whom we have contact&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The interviews will be imported into qualitative analysis software (N-Vivo&#xD;
      Version 10.0) to aid in data organization, review, coding, and analysis, and to facilitate an&#xD;
      exploration of themes that emerge from the data. Themes will be analyzed by type of vaccine&#xD;
      given, and other factors including the school's population size. At least two team members&#xD;
      will read each transcript once to get an overall sense of the data, and then again to&#xD;
      identify major topics or issues in the data. Consensus decision-making will be used when&#xD;
      needed to arrive at mutually agreed-upon coding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the two-proportion z-test to compare the proportion of parents/guardians with&#xD;
      children in the LAIV group and those with children in the TIV group, based on perceptions of&#xD;
      vaccine safety and effectiveness, and overall preference for vaccine type. We will also&#xD;
      assess these outcomes for parents/guardians who did not vaccinate their children this season.&#xD;
      To account for multiple comparisons, we will adjust the p values using Benjamini-Hochberg's&#xD;
      method for controlling false discovery rates (FDR), which controls for the number of&#xD;
      comparisons falsely declared significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To compare the costs associated with delivering LAIV vs. TIV via SBII&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: To obtain costing data associated with coordination of the LAIV and TIV SBII&#xD;
      programs, principals at participating schools and immunization program managers at PCCHU will&#xD;
      be interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria: We will use the same criteria, as for Objective 2, since the&#xD;
      cost data will be obtained during interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study process: During the interviews with school board and school management staff, and&#xD;
      public health managers, we will ask about the costs associated with administering LAIV and&#xD;
      TIV, including but not limited to training costs, equipment costs, and staff resource use&#xD;
      (nursing time for coordinating the campaign, communication with parents/guardians, delivery&#xD;
      of vaccine and post-vaccination monitoring, as well as data entry clerk time, where&#xD;
      appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: The outcome of this component of the study is the costs that PCCHU, participating&#xD;
      schools, and the MOHLTC incurred in order to deliver LAIV and TIV through SBII programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: We anticipate that we will interview approximately one principal or&#xD;
      vice-principal from each of the 10 schools, as well as the immunization program manager at&#xD;
      PCCHU. However, we may need to conduct additional or fewer interviews, depending on how many&#xD;
      individuals are able to provide us with costing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4: To inform a future RCT to evaluate the direct and indirect benefits (protection&#xD;
      against influenza) of LAIV vs. TIV via SBII&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: From each of the 10 study schools, 25 vaccinated students and their households&#xD;
      will participate in the Household Surveillance Study, involving surveillance for&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed influenza during the 2013-2014 influenza season, to assess the effect of&#xD;
      LAIV and TIV on influenza incidence. The purpose of this component is to generate parameter&#xD;
      estimates (e.g., incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza, intraclass correlations) to&#xD;
      inform a future RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria: Households will be eligible for the Household Surveillance&#xD;
      Study if: i) they include a child who was vaccinated against influenza at one of the 10&#xD;
      school-based clinics; and (ii) all household members consent/assent to participating.&#xD;
      However, as stated above, we will only maintain inclusion criterion (ii) if feasible.&#xD;
      Additionally, the students selected from each school must have received the vaccine to which&#xD;
      their school was assigned (e.g., a student at an LAIV-assigned school must have received&#xD;
      LAIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures: Once consent/assent has been obtained for the household, the HRA will also&#xD;
      collect and record baseline data from each household member, including demographics, risk&#xD;
      factor status, and current influenza vaccination status. We are collecting this information&#xD;
      to be able to describe the baseline characteristics of our population, as is reported on a&#xD;
      standard basis in scientific publications. In addition, we will need to control for&#xD;
      demographic and risk factor variables when we are analyzing trends in the data, to better&#xD;
      compare the effects of each type of vaccine. Each individual will be asked the baseline&#xD;
      questions in turn, and in private, to help encourage honesty. Each household will be provided&#xD;
      with either paper or electronic diaries for recording daily symptoms as well as a digital&#xD;
      thermometer (which they will be taught to use). They will also be supplied with Copan flocked&#xD;
      nasal swabs, and will be taught by the HRA how to self-swab nasally. Participating households&#xD;
      will be asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Complete the daily diary to record whether any household member has cold, influenza, or&#xD;
      acute respiratory illness symptoms, illness history (e.g., hospitalizations related to lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections and pneumonia, physician visits for respiratory illness),&#xD;
      medical history (e.g., medication use), and missed days of school or work due to acute&#xD;
      respiratory infection. The diary will be available in both paper and electronic form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Have any household member exhibiting any one of the three symptoms for influenza (cough,&#xD;
      sore throat, fever) or at least two other related symptoms perform an intranasal self-swab as&#xD;
      soon as symptoms appear (within 48 hours), and call a Research Assistant (RA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection for the Household Surveillance study will begin when the weekly percentage of&#xD;
      tests positive for influenza from the Peterborough area (tested via PHO) exceeds 5%, while&#xD;
      the end date will be when the weekly percentage of tests positive for influenza from the&#xD;
      Peterborough area falls below 5%, indicating the end of the 2013-14 influenza season. Once&#xD;
      the study begins, an RA will contact each household to let them know to start recording their&#xD;
      data daily in the symptom diaries. For households who opt for paper diaries, the RA will&#xD;
      provide them with paper copies of the symptom diary to complete on a daily basis. The RA will&#xD;
      contact each of these households twice weekly by telephone to obtain the data for each&#xD;
      household member, and will record this directly into FluidSurveys. Weekly emailed reminders&#xD;
      will also be sent to these participating households. Those households who opt for electronic&#xD;
      diaries will receive a daily link to the patient diary in FluidSurveys. This email will be&#xD;
      sent to the main contact of each household, who will fill out the form for each household&#xD;
      member. The SRC will monitor diary entries, and if no entries are submitted for a household&#xD;
      for three consecutive days, an RA will call that household to remind them to complete the&#xD;
      diary. If any individual is experiencing at least two cold or influenza symptoms or any one&#xD;
      of the three specific symptoms for influenza [cough, sore throat, fever]), the SRC will let&#xD;
      the RA know to contact the individual to: i) remind them to self-swab; and ii) arrange a&#xD;
      household visit to take a nasal swab of that individual within 48 hours of the symptom onset&#xD;
      (as reported by the individual). Thus there should be two swabs per episode. A repeat swab&#xD;
      will be collected 7 days after the collection of the initial swab (indicating a new episode)&#xD;
      if the individual has at least one additional symptom, as well as the initial 2 symptoms; or&#xD;
      if the individual has at least two new symptoms (different from the initial two symptoms and&#xD;
      the first two have resolved).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RAs will collect all nasal swabs during household visits, and transport them to the&#xD;
      regional laboratory in Peterborough, where they will be stored in a freezer until transported&#xD;
      to the central laboratory in Toronto where testing will take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, the RA will request that the parent/guardian for each participating&#xD;
      household complete the Parents' Vaccination Questionnaire for their child, if they have not&#xD;
      yet done so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The Household Surveillance study will include 25 vaccinated students and their&#xD;
      households, from each of the 10 participating schools. The students must have been vaccinated&#xD;
      during the SBII clinic at their school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory testing: The specimens will be tested by means of a reverse-transcriptase&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to detect the presence of influenza A or B virus. We&#xD;
      will estimate primary and secondary attack rates, based on the proportion of household&#xD;
      contacts in whom influenza developed (as determined by RT-PCR assay), as well as rates of&#xD;
      acute respiratory illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHO has a regional laboratory in Peterborough so all the specimens will be dropped off there&#xD;
      and sent along with the routine clinical specimens to the central laboratory in Toronto for&#xD;
      PCR testing. We will test the specimens in batches since real-time results are not required&#xD;
      for the purposes of this study. We will culture the specimens that test positive for&#xD;
      influenza on PCR and explore strain identification by the National Microbiological Laboratory&#xD;
      at a future date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: To calculate influenza incidence among household members, we will count only&#xD;
      the first infection by a specific influenza type/subtype (i.e., A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B) as the&#xD;
      numerator (age-specific), while the denominator is age-specific uninfected person-days. If a&#xD;
      participant is swabbed more than once within 14 days, and if the same virus is detected on&#xD;
      more than one occasion in this time frame, only the first episode detected will be used in&#xD;
      the analysis. This will be calculated for both influenza and non-influenza viruses. We will&#xD;
      calculate incidence using events per 1000 person-days and estimate differences in rates&#xD;
      assuming a Poisson distribution.&#xD;

        Children in schools randomized to LAIV cannot receive this vaccine if they have any of the&#xD;
        following contraindications: severe asthma (defined as currently on oral or high-dose&#xD;
        inhaled glucocorticosteriods or active wheezing) or medically attended wheezing in the 7&#xD;
        days prior to vaccination; receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy because of the&#xD;
        association of Reye's syndrome with aspirin and wild-type influenza infection; or&#xD;
        immune-compromising conditions due to underlying disease and/or therapy, as the vaccine&#xD;
        contains live attenuated virus. These children will receive TIV instead, unless they have a&#xD;
        contraindication to receiving TIV. Children in schools assigned to TIV cannot receive this&#xD;
        vaccine if they have any of the following contraindications: an anaphylactic reaction to a&#xD;
        previous dose; an anaphylactic reaction to any of the vaccine components, with the&#xD;
        exception of egg; or Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) within six weeks of a previous influenza&#xD;
        vaccination.&#xD;
