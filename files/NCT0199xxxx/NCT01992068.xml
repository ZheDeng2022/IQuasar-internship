      The purpose of this study is to prospectively assess the feasibility of high-resolution&#xD;
      manometry to identify radiation-induced changes in esophageal motility and contractility or&#xD;
      &quot;function&quot; in patients undergoing radiation therapy for the treatment of locally advanced&#xD;
      lung cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As there is no standard of care to evaluate/visualize the effects of radiation therapy (RT)&#xD;
      -induced esophageal injury, this is routinely assessed by patient reported accounts, and the&#xD;
      symptoms are then managed supportively (e.g. with pain medicines, parenteral nutrition,&#xD;
      feeding tubes etc). Manometry has been frequently used to study the effects of RT on&#xD;
      gastrointestinal function in the setting of numerous malignancies, including colorectal,&#xD;
      cervical and prostate cancers. What is often seen after RT is decreased sphincter function in&#xD;
      the anorectal region leading to problems with continence and fecal urgency, however there has&#xD;
      not been as rigorous of an evaluation of esophageal function after RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One study performed more than 15 years ago included only 4 patients with lung cancer and&#xD;
      concluded that mucosal irritation was likely the primary cause of RT-associated esophageal&#xD;
      injury and no abnormalities in motility were seen. Radiation is known to cause long-term&#xD;
      esophageal injury including stricture, and there is manometric evidence of impaired motility&#xD;
      long-term after RT. The recent introduction of high-resolution manometry permits more&#xD;
      extensive evaluation of the effects of RT on esophageal function.&#xD;
