      The principal aim of this study is to prospectively assess if Clinical Specialist Radiation&#xD;
      Therapist (CSRT) led telephone follow up after treatment with lung Stereotactic Body&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy (SBRT) has an impact on patient symptom burden as assessed by Edmonton&#xD;
      Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) scores.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of this study is a randomized control trial. The study population will include&#xD;
      patients treated with lung SBRT at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre (OCC) over a specified 1&#xD;
      year time period who have consented to participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consent to the study will be randomized into either the control group or&#xD;
      intervention group. Simple randomization will be completed using a computer-generated random&#xD;
      number table. Baseline ESAS scores will be collected on the last day of radiation treatment&#xD;
      for both groups. Patients in the intervention group will be telephoned by the CSRT 4-6 weeks&#xD;
      after completion of their treatment to assess any symptoms. The CSRT will advise the patient&#xD;
      on how to manage their side effects and address any anxieties the patient may feel based on&#xD;
      published response care paths such as Cancer Care Ontario's Symptom Management Guide.&#xD;
      Referrals to the attending radiation oncologist will be made if the patients response in the&#xD;
      physical items of ESAS such as pain, nausea and shortness of breath increases to above 2 from&#xD;
      their baseline or if they require medical management for a side effect such as esophagitis.&#xD;
      If there is an increase in the emotional symptom scores to greater than 2, the CSRT will&#xD;
      discuss supportive options and facilitate a referral to social work with the patients'&#xD;
      permission. Each telephone call will be logged on a standard template. A second follow up&#xD;
      telephone call will be made at 12 weeks post treatment if required in order to address&#xD;
      treatment related side effects that were identified during the first call and any&#xD;
      interventions that were recommended. When the patient returns to clinic for their first&#xD;
      regularly scheduled follow-up appointment, ESAS will be completed as well as a questionnaire&#xD;
      to assess their opinions regarding their follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will have the standard follow up plan as outlined earlier (CT&#xD;
      of the chest, abdomen and pelvis prior to follow-up with the radiation oncologist 4 months&#xD;
      after the completion of their treatment) and will be asked to complete a questionnaire to&#xD;
      assess their opinions regarding follow up during their clinic appointment. In order to&#xD;
      control for an &quot;attention effect&quot; that may be seen in the intervention group, patients in the&#xD;
      control group will get a placebo or sham telephone call initiated by a research assistant 4-6&#xD;
      weeks after completion of their treatment. This telephone call will simply confirm their&#xD;
      follow up appointment and should the patient bring up any issues, they will be referred to&#xD;
      the appropriate nursing telephone line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Any patient treated with lung SBRT over a specified one year time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who are not 18 years of age or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients whose first language is not English and require translation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who have poor hearing and find it difficult to carry on a telephone&#xD;
           conversation.&#xD;
