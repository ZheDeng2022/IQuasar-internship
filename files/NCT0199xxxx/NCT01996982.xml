    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive, nonrandomized, noninvasive, single-group, single-center pilot study of&#xD;
      a Core Cooling System (CCS) device for reducing core body temperature in ICU patients at&#xD;
      University Medical Center Brackenridge (UMCB) and Seton Medical Center Austin (SMCA). The&#xD;
      proposed research on human subjects will provide data that will be used to improve a&#xD;
      specialized human heat transfer technique/device. By stimulating specialized blood vessels&#xD;
      (arteriovenous anastomoses) AVAs in the palm of the hand, it is possible to greatly increase&#xD;
      local blood flow and thus greatly increase the potential for effective heat transfer between&#xD;
      the environment and body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this trial is that the Core Cooling System (CCS) will prove to be a&#xD;
      practical, safe, and effective method to raise or lower body temperature in critically ill&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to manipulate body core temperatures quickly and effectively would impact a&#xD;
      number of fields, with truly transformative potential. By far the best way to effect a change&#xD;
      in body temperature is perfusion with cooled or warmed blood because the vasculature of the&#xD;
      human body equilibrates magnificently well with the body and especially the body core tissues&#xD;
      due to the diffuse microcirculation. This process is quite invasive, however, and noninvasive&#xD;
      techniques to date have mostly revolved around various surface heat transfer mechanisms that&#xD;
      ultimately rely on relatively inferior conduction heat transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grahn, et al., at Stanford University have identified a new technique to increase the rate of&#xD;
      heat transfer between the skin and the body core by up to a factor of ten by harnessing the&#xD;
      convective power of the circulatory system in a completely noninvasive way [1, 2]. Our system&#xD;
      is derivative of the Stanford device, but different in many significant ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A well-understood and thus modifiable system capable of rapid artificial heat transfer has&#xD;
      almost limitless potential applications, including treatment of acute brain trauma (where the&#xD;
      single greatest challenge to treatment is inducing immediate hypothermia), athletic&#xD;
      performance enhancement, military operations, and enhancement of industries in which workers&#xD;
      are subject to extreme thermal stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the Technology/Device:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technology works as a two-step process, consisting of first stimulating the blood flow to&#xD;
      the AVAs and second cooling the glabrous skin through which blood is flowing. Accordingly,&#xD;
      the device consists of two components: first a blood flow stimulation source, and second a&#xD;
      surface heat exchanger to chill the glabrous skin and thereby the blood flowing through it&#xD;
      that subsequently flows back to the body core, where it cools those tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two separate means of stimulation will be tested in the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) - An FDA-approved TENS unit sends a&#xD;
           current via surface electrodes through the skin to stimulate the nerves that control the&#xD;
           state of AVA vasoconstriction. This stimulation will create a vasodilation effect in the&#xD;
           AVAs, allowing an increase in blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild thermal stimulation along the skin overlying the cervical spine to send a control&#xD;
           signal to vasodilate the AVAs and provide an increased blood flow to glabrous skin. An&#xD;
           FDA-approved electric heating pad is used for this purpose at a temperature of 42°C or&#xD;
           lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cooling will be accomplished by applying water perfusion bladders to the hands and feet. The&#xD;
      water will recirculate through the bladders to a holding tank with an internal pump, and a&#xD;
      thermoelectric cooler regulates the water temperature. The water temperature will be at 20°C&#xD;
      or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Incentive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AVA structures in glabrous (non-hairy) skin are one component of the body's natural&#xD;
      thermoregulatory system. The anatomy and morphology of AVAs have been described to a great&#xD;
      extent in the literature, e.g. Sherman [6]. Putative pre-AVA sphincters are thought to be the&#xD;
      primary controllers of perfusion through AVAs, regardless of the level of AVA vasodilation.&#xD;
      If the AVAs are completely dilated, but the sphincters closed, blood will pool in the dilated&#xD;
      AVAs, but the flow of blood, which is essential for heat exchange with the core, will be&#xD;
      minimal. In contrast to perfusion of capillaries, which is largely regulated by local&#xD;
      conditions, flow through AVAs appears to be mostly centrally mediated, controlled primarily&#xD;
      by the vasoconstrictor tone imparted by rich sympathetic innervation [7-10]. The sympathetic&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor tone, which appears to oscillate in a characteristic manner over time, is&#xD;
      controlled by the central nervous system's homeostatic centers that respond to various&#xD;
      centrally located core temperature receptors. The complete inner workings of this control&#xD;
      system and its effector mechanisms are not completely understood or quantified, and other&#xD;
      factors influence AVA blood flow to some degree, such as local skin temperatures, the&#xD;
      presence of vasoactive metabolites, level of exercise, and stimulation of various peripheral&#xD;
      thermal sites. Recent work in the Diller lab has indicated the potential inherent in the&#xD;
      latter. The lab has identified regions of the skin that may be non-energetically thermally&#xD;
      stimulated (heating over a small area so as not to warm a significant volume) to induce AVA&#xD;
      vasodilation. We hypothesize these sites contain important thermoafferent sensors that impact&#xD;
      the central component (hypothalamic) of the governing controller.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to induce mild hypothermia from a normothermic state represents the application&#xD;
      of greatest interest to our research group. If optimally developed, a device capable of&#xD;
      inducing only a 2-4°C decrease in body core temperature could have a huge impact in treatment&#xD;
      of various medical disease states and/or emergencies, including cardiac arrest, severe brain&#xD;
      injury, and stroke. It is well known that tissue death due to traumatic physical injury&#xD;
      and/or ischemia can be decreased with therapeutic hypothermia because of the temperature&#xD;
      dependence of cellular metabolism and the complex, destructive biochemical processes that&#xD;
      occur in damaged tissues [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to have a great effect in various animal models;&#xD;
      however, translation of these results to the clinical domain has been very difficult. Aside&#xD;
      from any possible interspecies physiological differences, researchers are able to produce&#xD;
      injury and cool the core of the research animals in a very controlled manner, and most&#xD;
      importantly, cooling is induced very soon after injury. From these experiments, it has been&#xD;
      suggested that a &quot;window of opportunity&quot; exists of about 90 minutes post injury, after which&#xD;
      little to no therapeutic effect occurs from mild hypothermia. Moreover, this 90-minute&#xD;
      threshold may itself be a stretch, and cooling within a 60-minute window may be most&#xD;
      appropriate. Clinically, cooling within the former and surely the latter windows has almost&#xD;
      never been achieved. There are a number of reasons for this: the time between injury and&#xD;
      mobilization of the patient, transportation to an emergency care facility, initial assessment&#xD;
      of the patient in the hospital setting, and most importantly for physiological science, a&#xD;
      lack of fast and effective methods to cool the body core. Due to simple size and geometry,&#xD;
      the human body is much more difficult to heat or cool than, for example, the rat model. This&#xD;
      is especially true for conductive heat transfer mechanisms (which is what most current&#xD;
      noninvasive therapeutic hypothermia implementations are based on) because of the relatively&#xD;
      small ratio of surface area to thermal mass volume [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope that the problem of rapid core temperature manipulation can be drastically improved&#xD;
      upon, specifically by utilizing convective heat transfer through AVAs of glabrous skin. In&#xD;
      these experiments, we believe an optimized combinatorial protocol utilizing large coverage of&#xD;
      glabrous regions (both palms plus soles of the feet), manipulation of mean skin temperature,&#xD;
      and especially optimized stimulation of peripheral thermoafferent sensors located in regions&#xD;
      of the body such as along the spine, can allow for mild hypothermia induction in spite of the&#xD;
      conflict with the thermoregulatory controller. We especially hope that manipulation of&#xD;
      important thermoafferents will allow us to &quot;trick&quot; the controller and bypass its effective&#xD;
      vasoconstrictive signal.&#xD;
