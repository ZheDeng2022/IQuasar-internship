  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune system plays an important role in the fight against cancer. According to certain&#xD;
      studies, Levels of cytokines secreted by the immune cells were found as predictors of&#xD;
      prognosis and survival among cancer patients, as well as disease recurrence. Previous&#xD;
      studies, including meta-analyses, reported that chronic emotional stress or depression were&#xD;
      associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Practicing relaxation was found&#xD;
      to decrease psychological symptoms among cancer patients, such as depression, anger,&#xD;
      hostility and anxiety symptoms, as well as physical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wheatgrass juice is an extract squeezed from the mature sprouts of wheat seeds (Triticum&#xD;
      aestivum). Currently, there are only a few laboratory and medical studies that examine the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of wheatgrass consumption. Controlled clinical trials have found that&#xD;
      wheatgrass juice may reduce chemotherapy-induced myelotoxicity, accompanied by fever and&#xD;
      infection without harming the chemotherapy effectiveness among breast cancer patients6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the differences in immune measures (serum and micro-particles levels of the&#xD;
           cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12), and in physical and psychological well-being&#xD;
           measures (anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue, nausea) at three time points and between&#xD;
           two intervention methods (biofeedback-assisted relaxation and wheatgrass consumption)&#xD;
           and between the intervention groups vs. a control group, among colorectal cancer&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the mediating role of optimism, perceived control and well-being measures&#xD;
           (anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue, nausea) among colorectal cancer patients in the&#xD;
           relations between the interventions (biofeedback-assisted relaxation and wheatgrass&#xD;
           consumption) and the immune measures (serum and micro-particles levels of cytokines&#xD;
           IL-6, IL-8 IL-10 and IL-12 ), and the mediating role of well-being measures on the&#xD;
           relations between optimism and perceived control with immune measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Participants will include 120 colorectal cancer patients aged 18+, with Eastern&#xD;
      performance status of ≤ 2 and disease stage II or III, who receive adjuvant chemotherapy of&#xD;
      Capcitabine or FU-5 treatment, conjoined with Oxaliplatin, or Capcitabine alone following&#xD;
      curative surgery at Rambam Health Care Campus. The estimated number of participants was&#xD;
      calculated based on Green's equation (1991): 50+8X 7 A comparison between the two treatment&#xD;
      groups, as well as a comparison between each treatment group and the control group (80&#xD;
      subjects) will allow inclusion of up to four background parameters in each of the&#xD;
      regressions, according to Green's equation.&#xD;

      The immune system plays an important role in the fight against cancer. According to certain&#xD;
      studies, Levels of cytokines secreted by the immune cells were found as predictors of&#xD;
      prognosis and survival among cancer patients, as well as disease recurrence1.&#xD;
      Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were found to be negative prognostic&#xD;
      factors in different cancer types, including colorectal cancer, while IL-12 was found in&#xD;
      several studies to be a positive prognostic factor. However, inconclusive results were found&#xD;
      for the role of IL-12 and anti-inflammatory cytokines in cancer prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies, including meta-analyses, reported that chronic emotional stress or&#xD;
      depression were associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines2; furthermore,&#xD;
      there is some, albeit inconclusive, evidence that they may predict lower survival rates3.&#xD;
      Moreover, there is further evidence that personal resources such as optimism and control&#xD;
      perceptions may have an effect on psychological and physical well-being (i.e., low level of&#xD;
      psychological or physical symptoms in reaction to stressful events) and dysregulate immune&#xD;
      functions such as levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practicing relaxation was found to decrease psychological symptoms among cancer patients,&#xD;
      such as depression, anger, hostility and anxiety symptoms, as well as physical symptoms,&#xD;
      including fatigue, insomnia and pain. In addition, relaxation may reduce nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      following chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies of cancer patients have reported positive associations between&#xD;
      relaxation-based interventions and immune measures, such as an elevated rate of T-cell&#xD;
      subpopulations as well as increased IL-4 production and decreased IL-10 production4.&#xD;
      Similarly, biofeedback-assisted relaxation was associated with enhanced natural killer cell&#xD;
      activity, lymphocyte responsiveness, and the number of peripheral blood lymphocytes5.&#xD;
      However, results are not always conclusive, and the few studies investigating the&#xD;
      relationship between relaxation training and immune measures have often included small and&#xD;
      uncontrolled samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wheatgrass juice is an extract squeezed from the mature sprouts of wheat seeds (Triticum&#xD;
      aestivum). Currently, there are only a few laboratory and medical studies that examine the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of wheatgrass consumption. These studies tend to report positive effects&#xD;
      with minimal side effects among patients with arthritis, thalassemia and ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
      Lab research has demonstrated that wheatgrass consumption caused a prolonged latent period of&#xD;
      skin cancer in mice. Controlled clinical trials have found that wheatgrass juice may reduce&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced myelotoxicity, accompanied by fever and infection without harming the&#xD;
      chemotherapy effectiveness among breast cancer patients6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the lack of studies examining the effects of wheatgrass consumption on immune and&#xD;
      well-being measures, as well as limited data from few studies regarding the effects of&#xD;
      biofeedback-assisted relaxation on immune parameters, the aims of the current study are as&#xD;
      follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the differences in immune measures (serum and micro-particles levels of the&#xD;
           cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12), and in physical and psychological well-being&#xD;
           measures (anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue, nausea) at three time points and between&#xD;
           two intervention methods (biofeedback-assisted relaxation and wheatgrass consumption)&#xD;
           and between the intervention groups vs. a control group, among colorectal cancer&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the mediating role of optimism, perceived control and well-being measures&#xD;
           (anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue, nausea) among colorectal cancer patients in the&#xD;
           relations between the interventions (biofeedback-assisted relaxation and wheatgrass&#xD;
           consumption) and the immune measures (serum and micro-particles levels of cytokines&#xD;
           IL-6, IL-8 IL-10 and IL-12 ), and the mediating role of well-being measures on the&#xD;
           relations between optimism and perceived control with immune measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Participants will include 120 colorectal cancer patients aged 18+, with Eastern&#xD;
      Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2 and disease stage II or III, who&#xD;
      receive adjuvant chemotherapy of Capecitabine (Xeloda) or FU-5 treatment, conjoined with&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin, or Capecitabine alone following curative surgery at Rambam Health Care Campus.&#xD;
      The estimated number of participants was calculated based on Green's equation (1991): 50+8X 7&#xD;
      (The Regression Model requires 50 participants + 8 participants for each variable). Possible&#xD;
      parameters that will be monitored using the regression analysis will be: age, gender, blood&#xD;
      Albumin level, morbidity (including: diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke,&#xD;
      arthritis), optimism and control perception. A comparison between the two treatment groups,&#xD;
      as well as a comparison between each treatment group and the control group (80 subjects) will&#xD;
      allow inclusion of up to four background parameters in each of the regressions, according to&#xD;
      Green's equation. Due to the large number of background parameters that can be potential&#xD;
      confounding variables, only parameters with significant association to the dependent&#xD;
      variables will be included. In the univariate statistical analysis, analysis of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA) will be conducted in order to compare the study groups. In addition, a comparison of&#xD;
      outcome parameters before and after the intervention period will be conducted using paired&#xD;
      t-tests and Repeated measure analysis. As the calculated sample size and the statistical&#xD;
      power are sufficient for the regression analysis (multivariate statistical analysis), they&#xD;
      are also suitable for the univariate statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following recruitment, participants will be randomly divided into 2 intervention groups:&#xD;
      biofeedback-assisted relaxation or wheatgrass consumption. The control group will consist of&#xD;
      subjects who were not interested in participating in the active intervention, but agreed to&#xD;
      contribute blood samples during chemotherapy treatments for the purpose of the study. This&#xD;
      study design was selected as expected recruitment rate will not allow for a random allocation&#xD;
      for test and control groups. However, this control will enable us to compare immune&#xD;
      parameters of patients who refused to participate in this study, with those who were&#xD;
      allocated to each group, in order to neutralize the effect of the oncology treatment and to&#xD;
      compare the groups. In addition, each treatment group can be evaluated for immune and&#xD;
      well-being parameters, each subject's pre-treatment status serving as a control for his&#xD;
      post-treatment status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at baseline (the onset of chemotherapy), and then again 3 and&#xD;
      6 months later for measuring the levels of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12) in the serum&#xD;
      and in micro-particles. Well-being will be assessed at the same 3 time points via&#xD;
      questionnaires, including emotional and physical symptoms: anxiety, depression, pain, nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting, and chronic fatigue levels. Demographical and medical information will be taken&#xD;
      from the medical records. The two study interventions will continue for 6 months (the&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment period). (1) Biofeedback-assisted relaxation intervention group:&#xD;
      participants will receive biofeedback devices to practice relaxation at home. Four sessions&#xD;
      will be conducted with a psychologist specializing in biofeedback therapy. During these&#xD;
      sessions, relaxation techniques will be learned and practiced. (2) Wheatgrass intervention&#xD;
      group: Each patient will be supplied with frozen wheatgrass juice divided into daily doses of&#xD;
      60 cc. Patients will be asked to drink one dose every morning on an empty stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study importance and potential contribution This is a first study to examine the possible&#xD;
      effects of biofeedback-assisted relaxation vs. wheatgrass juice on immune and well-being&#xD;
      parameters among colorectal cancer patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first&#xD;
      study to investigate the possible effects of biofeedback-assisted relaxation on serum levels&#xD;
      of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using a randomized controlled design with three time&#xD;
      points and a homogenous sample in terms of disease parameters, type of treatment and&#xD;
      functional status will allow us to obtain valid results regarding the psychological and&#xD;
      physical parameters of well-being and pro-inflammatory biomarkers. Possible verification of&#xD;
      the study hypotheses will add to the theoretical knowledge on the effects of personal&#xD;
      resources and psychological well-being on immune measures and may suggest potential ways to&#xD;
      improve well-being as well as cancer-related symptoms, and even disease course among&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients&#xD;
