      Primary Objective: To evaluate if low BRCA1 protein expression has a preferential effect on&#xD;
      response when metastatic breast cancer patients are treated with DNA damaging chemotherapy&#xD;
      agent, compared to historical controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To evaluate if low BRCA1 protein expression has a preferential effect on&#xD;
      tumor progression when metastatic breast cancer patients are treated with DNA damaging&#xD;
      chemotherapy agent, compared to historical controls&#xD;

    <description>Evaluating if low BRCA1 protein expression has a preferential effect on response when metastatic breast cancer patients are treated with DNA damaging chemotherapy agent, compared to historical controls. Response rate is defined as the percentage of evaluable patients who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as measured by RECIST 1.1 on CT or PET/CT as the best overall response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival for patients with breast cancer with low BCRCA1 protein expression treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of Treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death, assessed up to an expected average of 100 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluating if low BRCA1 protein expression has a preferential effect on tumor progression when metastatic breast cancer patients are treated with DNA damaging chemotherapy agent, compared to historical controls. Progression free survival will be measured as the times from the start of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin to the time the patient is first recorded as having disease progression or dies. If a patient does not progress or die while being followed via tumor assessment, progression-free survival will be censored at the time of last disease assessment. The median progression free survival will be calculated in patients with low BRCA1 protein expression and intact BRCA1 protein expression. Median progression free survival will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier methodology</description>
