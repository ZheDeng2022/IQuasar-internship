      The objectives of the MEDIAN study are to evaluate the short-term and long-term safety and&#xD;
      nutritional benefits of Metanx® versus placebo in subjects with mild to moderate diabetic&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Short-term effects will be evaluated during the first 16 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment, and long-term effects will be evaluated over the duration of a 48 week&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
