  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety profile of ADACEL compared to&#xD;
      local adsorbed diphtheria and tetanus combined vaccine (local DT or local Td vaccine in&#xD;
      participants in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe diphtheria and tetanus seroprotection rates and pertussis booster response&#xD;
           rates induced by each of the study vaccines: ADACEL vaccine (in all study age groups),&#xD;
           local DT vaccine (in children), and local Td vaccine (in adolescents and adults).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To further describe in each group the immunogenicity of the study vaccines at baseline&#xD;
           and 1 month after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety of the study vaccines&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will receive a single booster dose of ADACEL (Tdap vaccine) or a single&#xD;
      booster dose of local DT or local Td vaccine, depending on the age subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity will be assessed before and 28 days post-vaccination; safety profile will be&#xD;
      assessed in all subjects up to Day 35 post vaccination.&#xD;
