  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of&#xD;
      ASLAN003 in healthy subjects&#xD;

      This is a single-centre, placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind study involving SAD and&#xD;
      MAD of ASLAN003 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A: SAD cohorts and 1 cohort to assess food effect of ASLAN003 PK.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B: MAD cohorts with one cohort being of healthy elderly subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a sentinel pair of subjects for each of SAD Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 who will be&#xD;
      dosed first and then the same dose will be given to the rest of the subjects in the&#xD;
      respective cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, 8 subjects will receive ASLAN003 under both fed and fasted conditions&#xD;
