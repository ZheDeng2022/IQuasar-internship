      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Infusing&#xD;
      the vaccine directly into a lymph node may cause a stronger immune response and kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients&#xD;
      who have stage IV melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intranodal Synchrovax SEM plasmid DNA vaccine in&#xD;
           patients with stage IV melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the immunological response, as measured by changes in frequency of T cells&#xD;
           specific against vaccine-encoded epitopes before and after treatment, in patients&#xD;
           treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the clinical response, as measured by lactic dehydrogenase levels and&#xD;
           radiologic assessment of lesions, in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Synchrovax SEM plasmid DNA vaccine by continuous intranodal infusion on days&#xD;
      1-4. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients with evidence of stable or responding disease are eligible for 4&#xD;
      additional courses of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of Synchrovax SEM plasmid DNA vaccine until&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that&#xD;
      at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 10 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-18 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
