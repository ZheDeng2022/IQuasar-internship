  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome, or non-small cell lung cancer. Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and&#xD;
      either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of MDX-CTLA-4 in patients previously and not previously vaccinated&#xD;
      with GM-CSF-based vaccines using lethally irradiated, autologous melanoma, ovarian cancer,&#xD;
      acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplasia or lung cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify preliminary evidence of biologic activity and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody IV over&#xD;
      90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 months in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed monthly until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients (12 per disease type; 36 previously treated with a&#xD;
      sargramostim (GM-CSF)-expressing autologous tumor cell vaccine and 12 not previously treated&#xD;
      with this vaccine) will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients previously vaccinated with GM-CSF-based vaccines using lethally irradiated,&#xD;
             autologous melanoma, ovarian cancer, acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplasia, or&#xD;
             non-small cell lung cancer cells; patients with acute myelogenous&#xD;
             leukemia/myelodysplasia or non-small cell lung cancer who have not been vaccinated&#xD;
             with an autologous, GM-CSF based vaccine&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any concurrent medical condition requiring the use of systemic steroids (use of&#xD;
