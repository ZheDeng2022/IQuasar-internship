  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a member of the human herpes virus family that infects more than&#xD;
      95 percent of the U.S. population. Most infections occur in childhood and cause no symptoms;&#xD;
      in adolescents and adults, EBV often causes infectious mononucleosis. It has also been&#xD;
      associated with certain forms of cancer. Chronic Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV) is a rare&#xD;
      disease, primarily of children and young adults, that leads to life-threatening infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to identify genetic mutations responsible for CAEBV. A secondary goal is to&#xD;
      learn more about the natural history of CAEBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will examine blood and tissue samples from up to 50 patients (age 3 and above) with&#xD;
      CAEBV and up to 150 of their relatives (age 1 and above). Autopsy samples may be included in&#xD;
      the study. Up to 300 anonymous blood samples from the NIH Clinical Center Blood Transfusion&#xD;
      Medicine will also be examined for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No more than 450 milligrams (30 tablespoons) of blood per 8 weeks will be drawn from adult&#xD;
      patients, and no more than 7 milliliters per kilogram of blood per 8 weeks will be drawn from&#xD;
      patients under age 18. Local health care providers will refer patients to the study and will&#xD;
      obtain the samples. Some patients may also be seen at the NIH Clinical Center. Those patients&#xD;
      will have a full medical history and physical examination, along with chest X-ray, blood&#xD;
      counts, blood chemistry, EBV serologies, and viral load. Other tests, such as CT scan or MRI,&#xD;
      may be performed if medically indicated. Patients will be asked to undergo leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro tests on the blood or tissue samples will include analysis for proteins or genes&#xD;
      that are involved in the immune response; cloning of portions of patient DNA; transformation&#xD;
      of B cells with EBV; measurement of the ability of patient blood cells to kill EBV-infected&#xD;
      cells; determination of lymphocyte subsets; and determination of antibodies to EBV or other&#xD;
      herpes viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a genetic cause for CAEBV is found, the investigators will be available to discuss the&#xD;
      results with patients in person or by telephone. Genetic indications of risk for other&#xD;
      diseases will also be discussed with patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV) have (a) an illness that began as a&#xD;
      primary infection with EBV or markedly elevated titers of antibodies to EBV, (b) histological&#xD;
      evidence of organ disease, and (c) elevated EBV DNA levels in the blood or EBV DNA or&#xD;
      proteins in affected tissues. This is primarily a disease of children and young adults. Many&#xD;
      of these patients develop hypogammaglobulinemia or pancytopenia and death is frequently due&#xD;
      to opportunistic infections or B or T cell lymphoproliferative disease. The primary goal of&#xD;
      this study is to identify genetic mutations responsible for CAEBV. The secondary goal of this&#xD;
      study is to learn more about the natural history of CAEBV. Blood samples or available tissues&#xD;
      (e.g. previous biopsy or autopsy material) from patients with CAEBV and their relatives will&#xD;
      be analyzed to identify disease genes that are mutated in this population. In addition, some&#xD;
      of the patients will be invited to come for evaluation at the NIH Clinical Center. At that&#xD;
      time medically indicated studies of disease progression will be performed. Serial virologic&#xD;
      and immunologic studies will be performed. Eligible relatives of patients will be studied to&#xD;
      compare the gene(s) associated with CAEBV in patients with the gene(s) in their relatives.&#xD;
      Knowledge gained from this study has the potential of providing insights into the immunologic&#xD;
      control of EBV infections. In addition, identification of the molecular mechanisms for CAEBV&#xD;
      may provide insights leading to improved treatments for this disease.&#xD;

        Patients with known or suspected CAEBV and their relatives will be recruited by referrals&#xD;
        from health care providers or self-referrals.@@@@@@&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        CAEBV PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study size: up to 150 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sex distribution: male and female&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age range: 1 year old and above&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with known or suspected CAEBV and their relatives will be recruited by referrals&#xD;
        from health care providers. The rarity of this disease will markedly limit the number of&#xD;
        patients available to study; therefore, we will enroll patients who are 1 year of age and&#xD;
        older. However, children under the age of 3 years old will be enrolled as samples- only&#xD;
        participants and not be evaluated at the Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient recruitment is irrespective of racial and ethnic group or gender. NIAID&#xD;
        investigators will be available to answer questions and discuss general aspects of CAEBV&#xD;
        and identified genes or modifier genes with participants or their providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility criteria: To be considered having CAEBV, a patient must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. a severe progressive illness that began as a primary EBV infection, or associated with&#xD;
             postive EBV-specific antibody titers (IgG-VCA, ; EA or EBNA) not otherwise explained&#xD;
             AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. evidence of major organ involvement such as lymphadenitis, hemophagocytosis,&#xD;
             meningoencephalitis, persistent hepatitis, splenomegaly, interstitial pneumonitis,&#xD;
             bone marrow hypoplasia, uveitis AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. detection of elevated levels of EBV DNA, RNA or proteins in affected tissues OR&#xD;
             elevated levels of EBV DNA in the peripheral blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (a) Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the patient&#xD;
        unsuitable for enrollment or could interfere with the patient participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        RELATIVES OF CAEBV PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study size: up to 150 relatives of CAEBV patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age range: 3 years and above&#xD;
&#xD;
        To determine the genetic basis for this syndrome, the evaluation of blood, saliva and/or&#xD;
        previously obtained tissue specimens from healthy relatives of CAEBV patients will serve as&#xD;
        controls. No tissue biopsies will be performed on healthy relatives. We will&#xD;
&#xD;
        perform some of the studies listed on samples from normal relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        UNRELATED VOLUNTEERS&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study size: up to 300 persons&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age range: 18 years and above&#xD;
&#xD;
        Panels of anonymous blood samples will be obtained through NIH Clinical Center Blood&#xD;
        Transfusion Medicine to determine if identified genetic changes are mutations or&#xD;
        polymorphisms.&#xD;
