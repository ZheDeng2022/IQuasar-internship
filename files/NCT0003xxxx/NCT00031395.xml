      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of clonidine alone or in&#xD;
      combination with methylphenidate for children 7-12 years of age with attention-deficit,&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder.&#xD;

      This trial will compare the benefits and side effects of two medications-clonidine and&#xD;
      methylphenidate (MPH)-used alone or in combination to treat ADHD in children. MPH is&#xD;
      FDA-approved for the treatment of ADHD symptoms in children, and clonidine is FDA-approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Stimulant medications such as MPH are known to&#xD;
      be safe and effective for the treatment of many ADHD symptoms. Such medicines, however, do&#xD;
      not cure the condition or improve all of the symptoms of ADHD, and the long-term&#xD;
      effectiveness of these medications is not well-known. In this study the participants will be&#xD;
      randomly selected to receive one of four treatments: 1.) clonidine; 2.) MPH; 3.) clonidine&#xD;
      and MPH; or 4.) a placebo (which is not an active medication, but a substance that is thought&#xD;
      to have no biological effect). The time participation in the study is 16 weeks.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children aged 7 through 12 in school.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must meet DSM IV criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD of any subtype [21].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each subject must also satisfy the following criteria regarding the severity of ADHD&#xD;
             symptoms: 1. ADHD must be viewed as clinically significant and worthy of treatment by&#xD;
             medications as judged by the parent and the site investigator. Operationally,&#xD;
             medication treatment will be considered indicated for any subject who has ADHD&#xD;
             symptoms that significantly interfere with academic or social functioning and that&#xD;
             have not improved (or are not expected to improve) sufficiently with&#xD;
             non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., modifying the classroom environment,&#xD;
             tutoring). 2. The site investigator's rating of global functioning on the C-GAS must&#xD;
             yield a score of 70 or below. Scores below 70 on the C-GAS are designated as&#xD;
             indicating abnormal function [22]. The score of 70 corresponds to the anchor point&#xD;
             description: &quot;Some difficulty in a single area, but generally functioning pretty&#xD;
             well.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screen of Intelligence using the vocabulary and block design subtests of the Wechsler&#xD;
             Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition indicates an estimated I.Q &gt; 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent/assent signed. We will not enroll any child who does not want to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The designated school for each subject agrees to participate in the study by&#xD;
             completing all required questionnaires and following all specified procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child must be able to swallow the tablets and capsules used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with tic disorder of any type or tic symptoms, a primary diagnosis of major&#xD;
             depression, pervasive developmental disorder, autism, any psychotic disorder, and&#xD;
             mental retardation (based on current DSM criteria) will be excluded. We will not&#xD;
             exclude subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder or&#xD;
             conduct disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of a known medical condition that would preclude the use of MPH or&#xD;
             clonidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known pregnancy. A urinary pregnancy test will be performed for all menstruating&#xD;
             female subjects. Female subjects of child bearing potential will be advised not to&#xD;
             become pregnant. In this circumstance, study medication will be tapered and&#xD;
             discontinued and the subject will be terminated from the study. A urinary pregnancy&#xD;
             test will be repeated at the end of the study. Subjects who request information&#xD;
             regarding possible birth control mechanisms will be referred to their primary care&#xD;
             physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known presence of impaired renal function. A routine urinalysis will be performed for&#xD;
             each subject to exclude signs of renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active cardiovascular disease/anomaly, which would be a contraindication for the&#xD;
             use of MPH or clonidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may not receive any other medication for the treatment of ADHD. Treatment&#xD;
             with MPH or other stimulants must be discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment and treatment with other medications to treat ADHD (e.g., antidepressants,&#xD;
             clonidine) must be discontinued for at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may not receive any other psychotropic medication (e.g., serotonin reuptake&#xD;
             inhibitors), anxiolytics (e.g., clonazepam) or hypnotics. Any such medication must be&#xD;
             discontinued at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous use of MPH or clonidine will be permitted.&#xD;
