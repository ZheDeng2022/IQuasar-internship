  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the genetic cause of Birt Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome and the&#xD;
      relationship of this disorder to kidney cancer. BHD is a rare inherited condition&#xD;
      characterized by papules, or bumps benign tumors involving hair follicles on the head and&#xD;
      neck. People with BHD are at increased risk of developing kidney cancer. Scientists have&#xD;
      identified the chromosome (strand of genetic material in the cell nucleus) that contains the&#xD;
      BHD gene and the region of the gene on the chromosome. This study will try to learn more&#xD;
      about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The characteristics and type of kidney tumors associated with BHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The risk of kidney cancer in people with BHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether more than one gene causes BHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The genetic mutations (changes) responsible for BHD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with known or suspected Birt Hogg-Dube syndrome, and their family members, may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a family history and review of&#xD;
      medical records, including pathology reports for tumors, and films of computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may undergo various tests and procedures, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of personal and family history with a cancer doctor, cancer nurses, kidney&#xD;
           surgeon, and genetic counselor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest and other x-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound (imaging study using sound waves)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI (imaging study using radiowaves and a magnetic field)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scans of the chest and abdomen (imaging studies using radiation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for blood chemistries and genetic testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin evaluation, including a skin biopsy (surgical removal of a small skin tissue sample&#xD;
           for microscopic evaluation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cheek swab or mouthwash to collect cells for genetic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical photography of skin lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      These tests will be done on an outpatient basis in either one day or over 3 to 4 days. When&#xD;
      the studies are complete, participants will receive counseling about the findings and&#xD;
      recommendations. Patients with kidney lesions may be asked to return periodically, such as&#xD;
      every 3 to 36 months, based on their individual condition, to document the rate of&#xD;
      progression of the lesions.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BHD is a rare, autosomal dominantly inherited disorder which confers susceptibility to&#xD;
           develop multifocal, bilateral renal cancer, spontaneous pneumothorax and&#xD;
           fibrofolliculomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BHD is caused by mutations in the FLCN gene located on Chromosome17&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defining the genetic and biochemical pathways leading to renal tumorigenesis in BHD may&#xD;
           lead to the development of new molecularly targeted drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the types and characteristics (including patterns of growth) of renal cancer&#xD;
           associated with BHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the risk of renal cancer, lung cysts and fibrofolliculomas in patients with&#xD;
           BHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the natural history of BHD related renal tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if other genes contribute to BHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify genotype / phenotype correlations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients suspected or known to have phenotype or genotype suggestive of Birt Hogg Dube,&#xD;
           such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with histologically confirmed fibrofolliculomas,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with clinical evidence of multiple skin papules consistent with&#xD;
                fibrofolliculomas, and/or a family history of spontaneous pneumothorax or kidney&#xD;
                cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a known germline FLCN mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A relative (related by blood) of an individual with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis&#xD;
           of BHD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These rare families will be recruited to genetically confirm diagnosis, determine size&#xD;
           and location of renal tumors, size at presentation, growth rate and metastatic potential&#xD;
           of renal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic testing will be offered to gain appreciation of the effect of mutations the BHD&#xD;
           gene and to assess the relative activity of various germline and somatic mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will determine if there is a relationship between mutation and disease manifestations&#xD;
           and phenotype.&#xD;
