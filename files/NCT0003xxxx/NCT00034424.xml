      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with a family history of testicular cancer may be at increased risk for the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic and clinical studies of patients with testicular cancer and their family members may&#xD;
      help clarify the cause of the disease and identify clinical features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize the clinical features of testicular cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify genes that may lead to increased risk of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine emotional and behavioral issues of members of families at increased risk of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males and females from a family with at least two cases of testicular cancer in blood&#xD;
      relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males with testicular cancer in both testicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males with testicular cancer who have an identical twin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must be at least 12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may take part in Part 1 or Parts 1 and 2 of this 2-part study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide a blood or cheek cell sample to obtain DNA for gene studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide permission for researchers to obtain their medical records for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete questionnaires about their personal and family medical history, exposure to&#xD;
           factors that might influence the risk of testicular cancer, and their feelings about&#xD;
           being a member of a family in which several members have testicular cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These data are collected from participants in their home communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants provide a medical history, have a complete physical examination,&#xD;
           including routine lab tests, and have an ultrasound test of the abdomen to look at the&#xD;
           kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Males have an ultrasound test of the testicles and scrotum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Females have an ultrasound test of the pelvis to look at the ovaries, uterus and&#xD;
           fallopian tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Males 18 years of age and older provide a semen sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants have computed tomography (CT) scanning of the chest, abdomen and&#xD;
           pelvis instead of kidney ultrasound. Children under 18 years of age may have magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging (MRI) instead of CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These data are collected from participants during a 2-day visit to the NIH Clinical&#xD;
           Center in Bethesda, MD. Travel costs are covered by the protocol.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) is the most common cancer in men aged 20-35, with an&#xD;
      increasing incidence since the mid-twentieth century.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A family history of TGCT is associated with an increased risk of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that there is genetic heterogeneity in familial TGCT, thereby creating&#xD;
      opportunities for both new susceptibility gene discovery and searching for&#xD;
      genotype/phenotype/cancer correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Search for genitourinary developmental anomalies and for testicular intraepithelial neoplasia&#xD;
      (TIN) cells which are thought to be the precursor of the vast majority of TGCT could help&#xD;
      clarify the etiology and identify clinical features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is both etiologic and clinical in its focus, and its goal is to acquire a&#xD;
      comprehensive understanding of both the genetic and non-genetic factors which contribute to&#xD;
      the risk of familial TGCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascertain new families with familial testicular germ cell tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterize the clinical features of familial TGCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the underlying genetic mechanism for susceptibility to TGCT in families; one&#xD;
      specific goal is to confirm, and then to clone, the hereditary testicular cancer gene which&#xD;
      has been mapped to chromosome Xq27.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate various parameters related to psychosocial and behavioral issues resulting from&#xD;
      being a member of a family at increased risk of TGCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single family member with bilateral testicular cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals of both genders from a family with at least two cases of documented GCT in blood&#xD;
      relatives (at least one of which is testicular in origin) and with at least one of the GCT&#xD;
      cases in their family willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men with a history of TGCT who have a monozygotic twin brother (the unaffected identical&#xD;
      sibling must also agree to participate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families will be deemed ineligible if critical informative family members lacking surviving&#xD;
      spouses and children are unable to provide germ line DNA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor children under age 12 will not be eligible for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      International collaboration between NCI's Clinical Genetics Branch and the International&#xD;
      Testicular Cancer Linkage Consortium (ITCLC), via contribution of DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-randomized cohort study with an estimated accrual of 75 and 100 new TGCT families over a&#xD;
      period of 5 years and approximately 40 families willing to visit the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals and family members will be asked to contribute baseline questionnaires as well as&#xD;
      questionnaires regarding lifestyle, feelings, attitudes and behavior that relate to being&#xD;
      part of a high-risk family, and DNA for gene mapping and cloning efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed, in-person, etiologically-oriented evaluation at the NIH Clinical Center includes a&#xD;
      comprehensive history and physical examination, laboratory testing, and ultrasound imaging of&#xD;
      the kidneys and gonads to identify the clinical features and seek clinically occult TGCT and&#xD;
      TIN. CT imaging studies of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be monitored prospectively for the development of outcomes of&#xD;
      interest by means of periodic mail and/or telephone contact. Cancer outcomes will be&#xD;
      documented through review of medical, vital, and pathology records. Tumor tissue will be&#xD;
      obtained whenever feasible.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be members of families with familial TGCT as defined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Definition of familial TGCT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The criterion establishing familial TGCT is the presence of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -at least two cases of documented GCT in blood relatives (at least one of which is&#xD;
        testicular in origin),&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a single family member with bilateral testicular cancer,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  men with a history of TGCT who are one in a set of identical siblings will also be&#xD;
             included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Case definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A case will be determined to have TGCT according to the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologic confirmation of a germ cell derived tumor arising in the testis.&#xD;
             Extragonadal germ cell tumors will also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Germ cell derived histologies including: seminoma, germinoma, embryonal carcinoma,&#xD;
             endodermal sinus (yolk sac) tumor, gonadoblastoma, choriocarcinoma, teratoma, and&#xD;
             mixed germ cell tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A case will be determined to have TIN on the basis of pathologic confirmation of&#xD;
             intratubular malignant germ cells (ITMGCs) as defined by Burke and Mostofi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals from participating families who are eligible for this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i) all TGCT cases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii) All GCT cases (including those of ovarian or extra-gonadal sites);&#xD;
&#xD;
        iii) all first-degree relatives of each TGCT case;&#xD;
&#xD;
        iv) the spouse(s) of every case if the spouse and case had children who are participating&#xD;
        in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        v) any blood relative not included in (ii - iii) above who genetically links two cases; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        vi) any blood relative with cancer other than TGCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        vii) family members as described in i) - v) above must be age 12 or greater in order to&#xD;
        participate&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Families will be deemed ineligible for participation in this study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        There are not at least two proven cases of GCT in the family, one of which is testicular in&#xD;
        origin, unless there is a family member with bilateral testicular cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Deceased TGCT cases lacking both archival sources of tissue for DNA extraction AND lacking&#xD;
        surviving spouses and children who are willing to paricipate in the study (unavailability&#xD;
        of such persons prohibits inferring the genotype of the deceased individual with TGCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Critical informative family members are unwilling to participate (i.e., unwilling to&#xD;
        provide written informed consent);&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women are excluded from participating while pregnant.&#xD;
