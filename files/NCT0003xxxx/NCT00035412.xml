  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of St. John's Wort as compared to&#xD;
      placebo (an inactive substance) in the treatment of outpatients with social phobia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social Phobia is a prevalent and debilitating condition, with a lifetime prevalence rate to&#xD;
      be 13.3 percent. Socially phobic patients have been found to be functionally impaired in the&#xD;
      areas of education, employment and social relationships, to have poorer quality of life, and&#xD;
      increased suicidal ideation and psychiatric comorbidity. Double-blind studies have found&#xD;
      benzodiazepines, selective and non-selective MAOI inhibitors, several SSRIs, and the&#xD;
      anticonvulsants pregabalin and gabapentin to be effective. However, side effects with these&#xD;
      compounds suggests the need for better tolerated compounds, e.g., in the paroxetine&#xD;
      multi-center trial (the only drug with an FDA approved indication), 27 percent reported&#xD;
      somnolence, 26 percent nausea, and 37 percent of males reported delayed ejaculation; 34&#xD;
      percent of patients discontinued the trial early. There has been considerable worldwide&#xD;
      interest in St. John's Wort (SJW) (Hypericum perforatum) as a treatment of mild to moderate&#xD;
      depression. There have been 23 randomized trials suggesting SJW is more effective than&#xD;
      placebo for the treatment of outpatients with mild to moderate depression. SJW is very well&#xD;
      tolerated with mild side effects observed in only 2.5 percent of cases in a large (3250&#xD;
      patients) drug monitoring study. Pharmacokinetic studies have found Hypericum to have&#xD;
      affinity for serotonin, dopamine and GABA alpha and GABA beta receptors, each of which have&#xD;
      been implicated in social phobia, thus there is a suggestion that SJW may be effective for&#xD;
      this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a 12-week, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to generate effect&#xD;
      size data that will be used to determine sample size needed to power a definitive study.&#xD;
      Forty patients will be randomized to either SJW (LI 160) or matching placebo. This will be a&#xD;
      flexible-dose design, starting at 300 mg tid to a maximum of 1800 mg total per day. An&#xD;
      intent-to-treat analysis will be employed. Subjects will be evaluated weekly for two weeks,&#xD;
      then bi-weekly thereafter. The primary outcome measure will be the change from baseline to&#xD;
      endpoint on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale.&#xD;
