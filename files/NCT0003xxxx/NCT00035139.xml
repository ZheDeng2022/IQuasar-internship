  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is the leading cause of acquired long term disability among&#xD;
      children and young adults. Deficits in attention and memory are common and persist for years&#xD;
      after moderate or severe TBI. The similarity between these symptoms and those of children&#xD;
      with AD/HD, the efficacy of methylphenidate in the treatment of AD/HD, and the efficacy of&#xD;
      methylphenidate in improving recovery of animals with brain injuries, support the need to&#xD;
      study methylphenidate effects in children with TBI. This investigation of methylphenidate in&#xD;
      children with moderate to severe TBI aims to: (1) Assess the acute effects of 2 different&#xD;
      dosages of methylphenidate on attention and reaction time when the medication is administered&#xD;
      to children early in recovery; (2) Assess the ability of 8 weeks of methylphenidate to&#xD;
      improve the rate of recovery of cognitive, memory, and attentional skills in children with&#xD;
      TBI; (3) Identify the frequency of common methylphenidate side effects in children with TBI.&#xD;

      During the first phase of the study which is of 8-days duration subjects will receive placebo&#xD;
      on some days and methylphenidate on others. During this phase of the study the effects of the&#xD;
      medication on children's performance on a computerized test of attention will be assessed.&#xD;
      Individuals who do not have significant methylphenidate side effects during the first phase&#xD;
      of the study will then participate in the second phase of the study. During the second phase&#xD;
      subjects will receive either methylphenidate or placebo for 8 weeks. Neuropsychological&#xD;
      measures of attention, memory, behavioral inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and motor&#xD;
      performance will be obtained at baseline and after the 8 week medication trial in order to&#xD;
      assess methylphenidate effects on the rate of recovery. Recovery will also be assessed using&#xD;
      an interview measure of adaptive behavior and cognitive functioning. A stimulant medication&#xD;
      side effect rating scale will be used to monitor for common methylphenidate adverse effects&#xD;
      throughout both phases of the study&#xD;
