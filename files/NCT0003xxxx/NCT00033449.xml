  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gefitinib when given&#xD;
      together with radiation therapy with or without cisplatin in treating patients with stage III&#xD;
      or stage IV head and neck cancer. Biological therapies such as gefitinib may interfere with&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy&#xD;
      x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor&#xD;
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining gefitinib and radiation therapy&#xD;
      with cisplatin may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the safety profile of daily oral administration of ZD1839 (&quot;Iressa&quot;,&#xD;
      AstraZeneca, Inc.) that can be given with concurrent irradiation alone or combined&#xD;
      concurrently with weekly cisplatin in previously untreated patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      HNSCC, AJCC clinical stage III-IVB, deemed not suitable for surgery. Hence, the&#xD;
      maximum-tolerated dose of ZD1839 will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To delineate and quantitate any dose-dependent local and or systemic toxicities of ZD1839&#xD;
      given concurrently with irradiation or combined concurrently with weekly cisplatin to&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced, HNSCC, AJCC stage III-IVB, deemed not suitable for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the feasibility and toxicity profile of protracted continuous daily dosing&#xD;
      of ZD1839 beginning 8 weeks after the completion of the head and neck radiation therapy for a&#xD;
      period not to exceed 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Secondary endpoints will include determination of the response rates, relapse-free&#xD;
      survival rates and overall survival rates for this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To perform correlative studies assessing the biological effects of ZD1839 within the&#xD;
      primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gefitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive oral gefitinib once daily beginning at least 7 days before and&#xD;
      continuing throughout radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are entered into 1 of 5 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level I: Patients undergo concurrent boost radiotherapy 5 days per week comprising once daily&#xD;
      radiotherapy for 3.5 weeks followed by twice daily radiotherapy for 2.5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level II: Patients receive escalated dose of gefitinib and undergo radiotherapy as in level&#xD;
      I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level III: Patients receive original dose of gefitinib, undergo standard fractionation&#xD;
      radiotherapy comprising once daily radiotherapy 5 days per week for 7 weeks, and receive&#xD;
      cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes at the beginning of each week of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level IV: Patients receive escalated dose of gefitinib as in level II and undergo&#xD;
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy as in level III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level V: Patients receive the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gefitinib, radiotherapy 5 days&#xD;
      a week for 6 weeks, and chemotherapy as in level III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with clinical or radiologic evidence of residual disease are required to undergo&#xD;
      neck dissection approximately 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients resume oral gefitinib daily beginning 8 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy&#xD;
      or chemoradiotherapy (12 weeks for patients who undergo neck dissection) and continuing for 2&#xD;
      years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients are enrolled sequentially beginning at level I until the MTD of&#xD;
      gefitinib is determined. The MTD is the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients&#xD;
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve additional patients receive the MTD of gefitinib in combination with radiotherapy with&#xD;
      or without cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 6 months for at least 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
