      Healthy volunteers will be screened under this protocol for possible participation in a study&#xD;
      testing a vaccine against HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults 18 to 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Participants must be in&#xD;
      good general health with no history of significant medical problems or abnormal laboratory&#xD;
      test results. Pregnant or breast-feeding women and people infected with HIV will not be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in this protocol will undergo the following tests and procedures within&#xD;
      8 weeks before the start of the experimental vaccine study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, including history of sexual activity and drug use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests to evaluate possible medical problems such as liver and kidney&#xD;
           function; to evaluate immune function; and to test for HIV, hepatitis and syphilis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who are identified through this screening protocol as possible candidates for an&#xD;
      HIV vaccine trial will be provided additional information about study options.&#xD;

      Study Design: The purpose of this study is to screen subjects to determine if they are&#xD;
      suitable candidates for HIV vaccine trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, HIV-negative subjects will be recruited and screened. The results of this study will&#xD;
      be used to determine if the subject meets eligibility requirements for participation in H1V&#xD;
      vaccine trials. Educational materials on vaccines will be reviewed with and provided to&#xD;
      subjects before enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Healthy adults&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects: Approximately 3,000&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline of Protocol: There are one or more visits to evaluate the subject for their&#xD;
      eligibility for an HIV vaccine trial. The evaluation will usually include laboratory studies,&#xD;
      physical assessment, and counseling on avoidance of HIV infection, pregnancy and other&#xD;
      HIV-related issues. Only those evaluations needed to determine eligibility for a particular&#xD;
      study will be done. Evaluations of blood and urine samples other than those described in this&#xD;
      protocol may be done if necessary for eligibility for a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is determined that the subject might be eligible for an HIV vaccine trial, the subject&#xD;
      will receive additional information about trial options by telephone, mail and/or visit with&#xD;
      study coordinator. Several visits may occur if needed to confirm eligibility for&#xD;
      participation in a vaccine clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Varies from about 2 weeks to six months for each subject&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of Trial: Principal Investigator and designated staff of the Vaccine Research&#xD;
      Center Regulatory, Affairs and Clinical Trials Core&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsoring Agency: Vaccine Research Center (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and&#xD;
      Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Sites: NIH Clinical Center [including satellite locations such as the VRC Mobile&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Unit (MCTU) or the VRC Clinic at Cedar Lane] and IRB-approved extramural&#xD;
      sites&#xD;
&#xD;
