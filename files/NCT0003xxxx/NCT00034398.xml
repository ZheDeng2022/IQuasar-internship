  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate how the brain generates tics in patients with Tourette's syndrome&#xD;
      and which areas of the brain are primarily affected. Tourette's syndrome is a&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics, and is associated with&#xD;
      behavioral and emotional disturbances, including symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity&#xD;
      disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This study will examine whether tic generation is&#xD;
      related to changes in brain cell receptors for a chemical messenger called gamma-aminobutyric&#xD;
      acid (GABA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with Tourette's syndrome between 21 and 65 years of&#xD;
      age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and&#xD;
      physical and neurological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to measure brain blood&#xD;
      flow. For this procedure, the subject receives an injection of H215O, a radioactive substance&#xD;
      similar to water. A special camera detects the radiation emitted by the H215O, allowing&#xD;
      measurement of the blood flow. Subjects will receive up to five injections of H215O during&#xD;
      the scanning. They will also be injected with another radioactive chemical, (11C) flumazenil,&#xD;
      which binds to GABA receptors, to measure the density and distribution of these receptors.&#xD;
      This will reveal which areas of the brain in patients with Tourette's syndrome have abnormal&#xD;
      binding of flumazenil compared with the brains of healthy control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the PET procedure, the subject lies on a table in the PET scanner. A small catheter&#xD;
      (plastic tube) is placed in an arm vein for injecting the radioactive tracers, and a mask is&#xD;
      placed on the face to help keep the head still during scanning. The mask has large openings&#xD;
      for eyes, nose and mouth, so that it does not interfere with talking or breathing. The entire&#xD;
      test takes about 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a separate day, participants will also undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a&#xD;
      diagnostic test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the brain.&#xD;
      For this procedure, the subject lies still on a stretcher that is moved into the scanner (a&#xD;
      narrow cylinder containing the magnet). Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises caused by&#xD;
      electrical switching of radio frequency circuits used in the scanning process. The scan lasts&#xD;
      about 45 to 60 minutes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if symptoms of Tourette's syndrome are due to&#xD;
      dysfunction of GABA-ergic neurons causing disinhibition originating in basal ganglia, and&#xD;
      involving thalamus, frontal and prefrontal cortices and contributing to tic generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major inhibitory neurotransmitter in central nervous system is gamma-aminobutyric acid&#xD;
      (GABA), which acts mainly through the GABA A receptors. Pathological processes involving&#xD;
      GABA-ergic neurons cause alterations in the density of GABA A receptors of the targeted&#xD;
      neurons. These changes can be visualized and measured with Positron Emission Tomography using&#xD;
      as a radioactive ligand [11C] flumazenil. We will examine changes in the density and&#xD;
      distribution of GABA A receptors in 17 adult patients with a DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric&#xD;
      Association 2000) diagnosis of a tic disorder and 17 control subjects. This study should&#xD;
      provide new information concerning localization and degree of dysfunction of GABA-ergic&#xD;
      neurons in areas involved in Tourette's syndrome, which, in turn, might open new&#xD;
      possibilities in pharmacological treatment of this disorder.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Patients will have clinically documented TS as defined by DSM-IV and evaluation of tics&#xD;
        severity using Yale Tic Scale. This criterion will be established by the preliminary&#xD;
        screening in the NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Patients (either male or female) will range in age from 18 to 65 years. Female patients&#xD;
        of child-bearing potential will have a pregnancy test prior to each PET and MRI scan and&#xD;
        specific interview prior to the study to ensure that pregnant patients will not participate&#xD;
        in the study. Patients will be asked to stop for two weeks prior to the exam any medication&#xD;
        that can influence the CNS. Fluoxetine will be stopped for four weeks. They will be asked&#xD;
        to abstain from alcohol for one week before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Seventeen normal controls will be included; controls will be screened in the NINDS&#xD;
        Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic, and will have neurological and physical examinations.&#xD;
        Controls with chronic illnesses, taking any medication that affects the CNS will be&#xD;
        excluded. They will be asked to abstain from alcohol for one week before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Patients younger than 18 years old and older than 65 will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Patients with MRI findings consistent with brain tumors, strokes, trauma or AVMs will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Patients with progressive neurological disorders other than TS will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. Patients with a history of significant medical disorders, or requiring chronic treatment&#xD;
        with other drugs, which, cannot be stopped, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E. Patients with cancer will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        F. Patients incapable of giving an informed consent will be excluded.&#xD;
