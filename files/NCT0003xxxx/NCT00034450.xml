  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      L-carnitine is a supplement (type of vitamin) that has been suggested to be decreased in&#xD;
      patients with cancer. We will identify patients that have terminal cancer and fatigue. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine if L-carnitine replacement improves fatigue in cancer&#xD;
      patients with L-carnitine deficiency.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fatigue is the most frequently reported symptom in patients with cancer. The causes of&#xD;
      fatigue are multifactorial and include the disease itself, antineoplastic therapies, anemia,&#xD;
      depression, and malnutrition. Our preliminary data suggest that micronutrient deficiencies,&#xD;
      specifically carnitine deficiency, may be an important factor in fatigue. Carnitine plays a&#xD;
      major role in energy metabolism. Systemic depletion is characterized by weight loss, fatigue,&#xD;
      muscle weakness, decreased tolerance to metabolic stress, and cardiomyopathy. We found&#xD;
      deficiency of the micronutrient carnitine in 17/27 patients with cancer. Symptoms of fatigue&#xD;
      and functional status improved significantly in those patients who received oral L-carnitine&#xD;
      supplementation. In addition, we observed similar results in 6/10 patients with end stage&#xD;
      AIDS presenting with carnitine deficiency. Objectives: a) To determine the effect of&#xD;
      L-carnitine therapy on symptoms of fatigue in patients with terminal cancer and serum&#xD;
      carnitine deficiency, and b) to determine the effect of L-carnitine therapy on performance&#xD;
      status, cognitive function, mood, quality of life, and motor activity in these patients.&#xD;
      Study Design: We propose to conduct a Phase Il developmental randomized double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study to determine the effect of the micronutrient L-carnitine on fatigue&#xD;
      and other outcomes in patients with terminal cancer. A sample of 130 patients with terminal&#xD;
      cancer, fatigue and serum carnitine deficiency will be recruited into the intervention study.&#xD;
      At the first visit, the patients will receive a baseline assessment of fatigue, performance&#xD;
      status, cognitive function, mood, and quality of life and motor activity. a) During weeks&#xD;
      1-4, patients will be randomized to receive L-carnitine, 2 g/day, placebo. b) During weeks&#xD;
      5-8, all patients will receive L-carnitine at a dose of 2 g/day, for a period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Measures will be repeated at 48 hs, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks. The primary endpoint will&#xD;
      be change in fatigue at 4 weeks. Analysis will evaluate group differences in the primary&#xD;
      endpoint and other outcomes. An interim analysis will be done once 15 patients have been&#xD;
      observed in each group at 4 weeks. Paired and unpaired data analyses between groups will be&#xD;
      conducted with the assistance of a statistician.&#xD;
