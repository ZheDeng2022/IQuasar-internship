      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether individuals with Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) who complete ventilation-feedback training combined with&#xD;
      a moderately-high intensity exercise and upper body strength program will demonstrate&#xD;
      significantly longer exercise duration on a constant work rate treadmill test when compared&#xD;
      to subjects who are randomly assigned to a moderately-high intensity exercise and upper body&#xD;
      strength training program without ventilation-feedback or ventilation-feedback only.&#xD;
      Secondary study objectives are to determine whether individuals with COPD who complete&#xD;
      ventilation-feedback training combined with a moderately-high intensity exercise and upper&#xD;
      body strength training program will demonstrate significantly: (a) greater exercise tolerance&#xD;
      and aerobic power; (b) lower perception of breathlessness during progressive and constant&#xD;
      work rate leg-cycle and treadmill exercise testing; (c) higher tidal volume and lower&#xD;
      breathing frequency during constant work rate and at any given workload during progressive&#xD;
      testing; (d) lower score on the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire indicating improved&#xD;
      quality of life; (e) higher transition focal score (less dyspnea) on the Transition Dyspnea&#xD;
      Index; (f) maintain a sustained breathing-pattern adjustment to exercise when compared to&#xD;
      subjects who are randomly assigned to a moderately-high intensity exercise and upper body&#xD;
      strength program without ventilation-feedback or ventilation-feedback only.&#xD;

      Statement of the Problem: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a term used to&#xD;
      characterize those individuals with chronic bronchitis or emphysema who have obstruction to&#xD;
      airflow on a spirogram. 1) Patients with COPD have a poor exercise capacity that is&#xD;
      reflective of their underlying disease. 2) The symptoms of lung disease triggered by simple&#xD;
      low-intensity activities of daily living such as dressing and undressing, bathing and&#xD;
      shopping are insufferable, consequently these patients become sedentary. An increasingly&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle leads to muscle deconditioning making physical activity even more&#xD;
      intolerable. 3) The cycle continues in a downward spiral. Pulmonary rehabilitation is&#xD;
      essential to assist persons with COPD to cope with their disease. The two primary objectives&#xD;
      of pulmonary rehabilitation are to control and alleviate the symptoms of the respiratory&#xD;
      illness and to assist the patient toward optimal capabilities in carrying out his/her&#xD;
      activities of daily living. 4) The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy of a unique&#xD;
      program of ventilation-feedback training combined with leg-cycle and walking exercise to&#xD;
      improve exertional endurance, perceived dyspnea and quality of life in persons with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Individuals with COPD who complete 12-weeks of ventilation-feedback training&#xD;
      combined with a moderately-high intensity exercise and upper body strength training program&#xD;
      will demonstrate significantly longer exercise duration on the treadmill constant work rate&#xD;
      (CWR) exercise test when compared to subjects who are randomly assigned to a moderately-high&#xD;
      intensity exercise and upper body strength training or a ventilation-feedback training only&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term Objectives- The primary objective of the proposed study is to determine whether&#xD;
      individuals with COPD who complete 12-weeks of ventilation-feedback training combined with a&#xD;
      moderately-high intensity exercise and upper body strength training program will demonstrate&#xD;
      significantly longer exercise duration on the treadmill CWR exercise test when compared to&#xD;
      subjects who are randomly assigned to a moderately-high intensity exercise and upper body&#xD;
      strength training program without ventilation-feedback or a ventilation-feedback program&#xD;
      only. The secondary objectives of the proposed research are to determine whether individuals&#xD;
      with COPD who complete ventilation-feedback training combined with a moderately-high&#xD;
      intensity exercise and upper body strength training or ventilation-feedback only program&#xD;
      will, when compared to subjects who are randomly assigned to a moderately-high intensity&#xD;
      exercise and upper body strength training program only, demonstrate significantly: (a)&#xD;
      greater work tolerance and aerobic power on maximal leg-cycle and treadmill exercise tests;&#xD;
      (b) lower perception of breathlessness during progressive and CWR leg-cycle and treadmill&#xD;
      exercise tests; (c) significantly higher tidal volume (VT) and lower breathing frequency&#xD;
      during CWR and at any given workload on the progressive leg-cycle and treadmill exercise&#xD;
      tests; (d) lower score on the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRDQ)5 indicating&#xD;
      better quality of life; and (e) higher transition focal score on the Transition Dyspnea Index&#xD;
      (TDI).6 In addition, six weeks after completing the training program all subjects will repeat&#xD;
      the treadmill CWR test. This will be done to assess whether the positive effects of the&#xD;
      ventilation-feedback training persist beyond the 12-week training period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term Objectives: If our hypothesis is correct, we will use the ventilation-feedback&#xD;
      technique to teach a more efficient breathing pattern during activities of daily living. In&#xD;
      time, the system will be miniaturized and portable thereby making this new technique readily&#xD;
      usable during pulmonary rehabilitation.&#xD;
