  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals may be prone to develop blood or lymph node cancers (leukemia or lymphoma)&#xD;
           for a variety of reasons, including genetic predisposition to these cancers,&#xD;
           environmental exposures or other medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies of people and families at high risk of cancer often lead to clues about their&#xD;
           cause that may also be important regarding the sporadic occurrence of these cancers in&#xD;
           the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying genetic or environmental factors that play a role in the development of&#xD;
           these diseases may be important in developing prevention trials, screening programs and&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the cancers and other conditions in families with blood or lymph node cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find and describe genes that may cause blood and lymph node cancer, and understand how&#xD;
           they work in families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use laboratory methods to try to determine if it is possible to identify who is at&#xD;
           highest risk of blood or lymph node cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test how genes act with other factors to alter the risk of disease, its severity or its&#xD;
           manifestations in families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals of any age with a personal or family history of a blood or lymph node&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with a personal or family history of medical conditions or environmental&#xD;
           exposures that may predispose to blood or lymph node cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants complete questionnaires about their personal and family medical history and&#xD;
           provide consent for researchers to review their medical records and pathology materials&#xD;
           related to their care and those of deceased relatives with blood or lymph node cancer,&#xD;
           tumors, or other related illnesses for whom they are the legally authorized&#xD;
           representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants donate a sample of blood or cheek cells, or a lock of hair for genetic&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may also be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center by one or more of the&#xD;
           following specialists: cancer doctor or blood specialist, medical geneticist, research&#xD;
           nurses or clinical social worker. They may have blood and urine tests and a cheek swab&#xD;
           or mouth wash to collect cheek cells. Some patients may also be asked to have x-rays and&#xD;
           routine imaging, such as CT scans or ultrasound tests, cell surface markers, skin&#xD;
           biopsy, and, with special consents, bone marrow biopsy, MRI or PET scans, apheresis or&#xD;
           fluorescein angiography and photography.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons may be prone to develop hematologic or lymphoproliferative cancer for a variety of&#xD;
      reasons including: inherited predisposition of benign, premalignant, or malignant conditions;&#xD;
      environmental exposures shared by family members; previous tumors or preneoplastic&#xD;
      conditions; immune deficiency; or stochastic processes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations of individuals and families at high risk of cancer often lead to etiologic&#xD;
      clues that may be important in the sporadic counterparts of these cancers in the general&#xD;
      population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of etiologically important genetic factors could inform chemoprevention&#xD;
      trials, screening programs, and treatment of hematologic and lymphoproliferative cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate and define the clinical spectrum and natural history of disease in syndromes&#xD;
      predisposing to hematologic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate potential precursor states of malignancy in families at risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      To quantify the risks of specific tumors in family members and define syndromic&#xD;
      constellations&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify, map, characterize, clone, and determine function of tumor susceptibility genes&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate and test associations of biomarkers with risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify genetic determinants, environmental factors, and gene-environmental interactions&#xD;
      conferring cancer risk in individuals and families&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify differences and similarities between the familial and sporadic condition&#xD;
&#xD;
      To educate and counsel study participants about their risk of hematologic malignancy&#xD;
      including prevention recommendations and early detection activities when known&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop syndrome-specific educational materials for medical professionals and high-risk&#xD;
      family members&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On referral, persons &gt;= 11 months will be included only because of personal history, and&#xD;
      persons &gt;/=18 years can also be included because of personal or family history of the&#xD;
      parameters listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a medical history of hematologic/lymphoproliferative malignancy of an unusual type,&#xD;
           pattern, or number or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  there are known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to hematologic malignancy, either&#xD;
           genetic or congenital factors (birth defects, metabolic phenotype, chromosomal anomalies&#xD;
           or Mendelian traits associated with tumors), environmental exposure or unusual&#xD;
           demographic features&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For familial neoplasms, two or more living affected cases among family members are&#xD;
                generally required&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study. Families are studied long-term using a cohort approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design and evaluation vary by the specific type of familial neoplasm being studied&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall approach to eligible families includes defining affection status,&#xD;
      characterization of disease, localization of genetic loci, identification of genes,&#xD;
      evaluation of phenotype/genotype correlations, estimation of risk of the disease associated&#xD;
      with carrier&#xD;
&#xD;
      status and identification of other risk factors that modify penetrance (genetic,&#xD;
      environmental, and host factors)&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        On referral, persons &gt;= 11 months will be included only because of personal history, and&#xD;
        persons &gt;=18 years can also be included because of personal or family history of the&#xD;
        parameters listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A medical history of hematologic/ lymphoproliferative malignancy of any unusual type,&#xD;
             pattern, or number; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to hematologic malignancy, either genetic&#xD;
             and/or congenital factors (birth defects, metabolic phenotype, chromosomal anomalies&#xD;
             or Mendelian traits associated with tumors), environmental exposure (medications,&#xD;
             occupation, radiation, diet, infectious agents, etc.), or unusual demographic features&#xD;
             (very young age of onset multiple tumors, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Personal and family medical history must be verified through questionnaires, interviews,&#xD;
        and review of pathology slides and medical records. For familial neoplasms, two or more&#xD;
        living affected cases among family members are generally required, although in selected&#xD;
        instances exceptions may be made, e.g., for WM, one cases plus a living 1st degree relative&#xD;
        with an autoimmune condition will qualify a family for further investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Disease-specific considerations. Familial aggregation of any hematologic cancer(s) is&#xD;
        eligible for study, Disease specific procedures are outlined in appendices:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Waldenstrom s macroglobulinemia (WM)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Non-Hodgkin s Lymphoma (NHL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Hodgkin disease (HD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Mixed/miscellaneous hematologic and lymphoproliferative diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand, and the&#xD;
        willingness to sign, a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
