      This study will examine and compare what happens in the brains of patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease with that of healthy normal subjects while they train to react as fast as possible to&#xD;
      the appearance of a visual signal. Particularly, we will measure the amount of the chemical&#xD;
      dopamine released in the brain as well as the electrical activity during training. Indeed,&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's disease frequently complain of slowness and early fatigue during&#xD;
      movements. These symptoms are believed to be related to a decrease of dopamine in the brain&#xD;
      which may be associated with abnormalities in cerebral electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with Parkinson's disease who are right-handed, do not have dementia, and are&#xD;
      not depressed may be eligible for this study. Healthy volunteers who match patients in age,&#xD;
      gender, handedness, and level of education will also be studied. Candidates will be screened&#xD;
      with a medical history, physical and neurological examinations, memory test, mood evaluation,&#xD;
      and urine toxicology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be required to stop taking any medications that can influence the&#xD;
      central nervous system and to abstain from alcohol consumption for 1 week before the&#xD;
      screening examination and during the study training period. Patients with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      will also be required to stop using antiparkinsonian medications for at least 12 hours before&#xD;
      the first visit and each training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have several 1-hour training sessions. During these sessions, they will sit&#xD;
      facing a computer screen at a distance of about 32 inches (80 centimeters) from their eyes.&#xD;
      Six permanent position markers will be displayed. A keyboard with six spatially compatible&#xD;
      response keys will be within reach of their right hand. Participants will respond as quickly&#xD;
      and as accurately as possible to the appearance of a stimulus (e.g., white circle) below one&#xD;
      of the markers by pressing the spatially corresponding key. About a second later, the next&#xD;
      stimulus will be displayed below one of the other markers, and so on. Reaction times and&#xD;
      accuracy will be recorded. After 3 to 10 minutes of practice (one block), there will be a&#xD;
      rest period during which the computer will display information about the subject's accuracy&#xD;
      of movements and reaction time. Then, a new block will start. There will be about 6 to 20&#xD;
      practice blocks per training session. The number of training session will vary between 3 and&#xD;
      6 depending on accuracy and reaction time during the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each training session, subjects will have encephalographic (EEG) recordings to measure&#xD;
      the electrical activity of the brain. In addition, they will have one or two positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) scans during the first training session, and some will also have&#xD;
      one or two PET scans during the last session. For the PET scan, the subject will be injected&#xD;
      with a substance called raclopride, which is taken up by the brain. The raclopride is tagged&#xD;
      with a radioactive substance so that it can be detected by the PET camera. The amount of&#xD;
      raclopride detected in the brain will provide an indirect measure of the amount of dopamine&#xD;
      released during training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before or after one of the training sessions, participants will undergo magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) to study brain anatomy. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to&#xD;
      produce images of the brain. The subject lies on a table in a space enclosed by a metal&#xD;
      cylinder (the scanner). The test takes about 45 to 60 minutes, during which the participant&#xD;
      must lie very still for 10 to 15 minutes at a time.&#xD;

      A dopaminergic system may play a role in some forms of motor learning. At a subcortical&#xD;
      level, studies in animals and humans suggest that the striatum and its dopaminergic&#xD;
      innervation participate in both the acquisition and retrieval of programs for sequential&#xD;
      movements. Moreover, as the activity of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons is modulated by&#xD;
      reward predictability, the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system has been proposed to participate&#xD;
      in reinforcement of learning. At a cortical level, it has been suggested that, in humans, the&#xD;
      dopaminergic system might modulate cortico-cortical connectivity during volitional movements.&#xD;
      The first purpose of work is to investigate the dynamic involvement of striatal dopamine (DA)&#xD;
      release during different phases of implicit motor sequence learning in patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD) compared with healthy subjects (HS) matched for age, gender,&#xD;
      handedness, and level of education. Indeed, PD is mainly known as a dopamine deficiency&#xD;
      disorder-nigral projections to the motor striatum being most affected-and patients suffering&#xD;
      from PD usually have difficulties in learning and execution of sequential motor tasks. The&#xD;
      second purpose of this study is to assess cortico-cortical connectivity during implicit motor&#xD;
      sequence learning in both HS and PD patients. Implicit motor sequence learning will be&#xD;
      studied using a probabilistic serial reaction time (SRT) task in which the sequence&#xD;
      presentation of the stimuli is based on a finite-state grammar. Implicit motor sequence&#xD;
      learning will be studied using a probabilistic serial reaction time (SRT) task in which the&#xD;
      sequence presentation of the stimuli is based on a finite-state grammar. Learning will be&#xD;
      assessed by improvement in reaction time. Striatal DA release will be assessed in vivo with&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) using a DA D2 receptor radioligand: [(11)C]raclopride.&#xD;
      Striatal [(11)C]raclpride binding potential (BP) will be measured in both HS and PD under 3&#xD;
      main conditions: at rest and during early and advanced learning phases of the SRT task. At&#xD;
      the same time, we will use EEG recording to test the effect of learning the SRT task on&#xD;
      cortico-cortical coherence in both HS and PD patients. This study should provide new&#xD;
      information on the (path)physiological role of dopamine in the formation of motor memory.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be asked to stop using antiparkinsonian medications for at least 12-18 hours&#xD;
        prior to examination (4 days for cabergoline).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will also be asked to stop other medications that can influence the central&#xD;
        nervous system for one week prior to examination, also for the same time period they will&#xD;
        be asked to abstain from alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with early PD (score on Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale [257] less than 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The PD cohort will comprise only non-demented, non-depressed, right-handed patients with&#xD;
        right upper limb involvement and with parkinsonian symptoms and signs primarily&#xD;
        akineto-rigid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If resting tremor is present, only patients with mild or moderate tremor (UPDRS [256]&#xD;
        tremor ratings 1 or 2 in the right upper limb) will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The criterion will be established by the preliminary screening in the NINDS Human Motor&#xD;
        Control Outpatient Clinic.&#xD;
