      This study is designed to determine whether a medicine that can produce temporary amnesia&#xD;
      (midazolam) can be used to block the memory of treatment with spinal manipulation. This is&#xD;
      important since any study that is designed to determine whether spinal manipulation is&#xD;
      effective would be better if patients were not aware of whether or not they were treated.&#xD;
      This would allow a true assessment of treatment effects without the complication of a strong&#xD;
      placebo effect that manipulative treatment may produce.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been growing recognition of the high frequency with which Americans utilize&#xD;
      complementary and alternative health care providers and that annually about 10% of the&#xD;
      population is treated by a chiropractor. While chiropractors employ several types of&#xD;
      treatment, spinal manipulation is the most important and unique of these therapies. Over 90%&#xD;
      of the spinal manipulations performed in the U.S. are done by chiropractors with most of the&#xD;
      remainder performed by osteopathic physicians. The annual number of chiropractic visits in&#xD;
      the U.S. has been estimated at approximately 100 per 100 person-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal manipulation and chiropractic have been controversial at least partially due to a&#xD;
      paucity of clinical scientific evidence of benefit. For example, reviews of the literature on&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials (RCT's) of manipulative treatment for back pain have variably&#xD;
      found evidence of benefit or insufficient evidence of benefit. A review of the existing&#xD;
      clinical trials of spinal manipulation for neck pain concluded that most of the five existing&#xD;
      RCT's were of relatively poor quality and that, despite some evidence for very short-term&#xD;
      benefit, studies of higher quality will be needed in order to determine whether there is&#xD;
      clinical benefit for this condition. This issue is important since neck pain is the second&#xD;
      most common reason for presentation to chiropractors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several difficulties in researching the effects of spinal manipulation. Most of the&#xD;
      conditions that are treated (i.e., back and neck pain) do not have a well-defined&#xD;
      pathophysiology. Therefore, it is not possible to study treatment by evaluating the effects&#xD;
      of treatment on physiological variables. The lack of a proven pathophysiology also leads to&#xD;
      heterogeneous study populations with large variability in response to treatment. This makes&#xD;
      it necessary to use large experimental populations in order to detect any effects of&#xD;
      treatment. There is heavy reliance on subjective outcome measures in neck and back pain&#xD;
      research, making these clinical trials particularly sensitive to placebo or &quot;nonspecific&quot;&#xD;
      effects. The use of blinded subjects is the accepted method of dealing with these issues, but&#xD;
      blinding is particularly difficult to achieve when investigating physical interventions,&#xD;
      particularly those where the therapist can't be blinded as to whether s/he is delivering an&#xD;
      actual or sham treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present proposal is in response to a request for applications for pilot studies to&#xD;
      establish the methodological feasibility and strengthen the scientific rationale for&#xD;
      proceeding to full-scale RCTs on the use of chiropractic or osteopathy to manage or treat&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injuries and disorders. One of the stated goals of this request for&#xD;
      applications is to refine the control strategy for studies of manipulative therapy. The&#xD;
      proposed study will examine whether an amnestic agent, midazolam, can be used to blind&#xD;
      subjects to their experimental group in a double-blind, pilot RCT. This proposal is similar&#xD;
      to a study by Sloop et al who used diazepam to produce amnesia in a study of spinal&#xD;
      manipulation for chronic neck pain. The present study will utilize an agent with more&#xD;
      specific amnestic effects and will also address several methodological problems with their&#xD;
      study. If successful, the methods employed in this pilot study may permit a high degree of&#xD;
      blinding in full scale RCT's of spinal manipulation.&#xD;

        This study will enroll patients with chronic neck pain (more than 3 months duration) with&#xD;
        or without occipitally-based head pain and without signs of radiculopathy or myelopathy.&#xD;
        They must have pain of at least moderate intensity (by their report and by a score of at&#xD;
        least 3 out of 10 on a visual analogue pain scale) on at least four days out of a week and&#xD;
        have had some limitations of activity on a weekly basis due to their neck pain. These&#xD;
        subjects should not have had spinal manipulative treatment for at least two years and&#xD;
        should not have had any adverse reactions to manipulative treatment or to benzodiazepines.&#xD;
        They may not be regular users of benzodiazepine medications. They also should not be&#xD;
        currently enrolled in an ongoing physical therapy program, though they may be taking&#xD;
        analgesics, anti-inflammatories or other medications for their problem. They may continue&#xD;
        with any ongoing exercise program. Subjects will also be excluded if they are pregnant,&#xD;
        lactating or plan to be pregnant, if they have significant cardiac or pulmonary disease or&#xD;
        if they plan on relocating during the course of the study. The subjects will also be&#xD;
        evaluated by a trained and experienced manipulative practitioner (see below) for the&#xD;
        presence of lesions which would be amenable to manipulation and by a medical physician for&#xD;
        the absence of any contraindications to manipulative treatments.&#xD;
