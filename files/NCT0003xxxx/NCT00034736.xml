    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study to determine the efficacy of levofloxacin compared with the&#xD;
      &quot;standard of care&quot; (antibiotic medication commonly used for the treatment of infection in&#xD;
      question) in treating community acquired pneumonia in children aged 6 months to 16 years. The&#xD;
      study consists of 4 phases: a 1-day screening period when patients will be tested for&#xD;
      eligibility for the study; 10-day treatment, blood collection, and evaluation period; a&#xD;
      post-treatment period beginning 1 to 3 days after the last dose of the study medication; and&#xD;
      a post-study period 10 to 17 days after the last dose of study medication to assess whether&#xD;
      the patient has been cured of pneumonia. Patients will be divided into 2 groups based upon&#xD;
      age and then randomly assigned to receive up to 10 days of either levofloxacin or another&#xD;
      antibiotic. The patients in Group 1 will be randomly assigned to levofloxacin or&#xD;
      amoxicillin/clavulanate. The patients in Group 2 will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      levofloxacin or either ceftriaxone plus erythromycin lactobionate or clarithromycin. Safety&#xD;
      evaluations will include laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital sign measurements,&#xD;
      and recording of adverse events, including any adverse events affecting muscles or bones.&#xD;
      Efficacy assessments include whether the patient was cured of pneumonia based on signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of pneumonia reported before the start of the study. Additionally, at both the&#xD;
      post-therapy and the post-study visits, responses will be evaluated by patients' signs and&#xD;
      symptoms and by microscopic examination of the bacteria identified at the start of the study.&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the treatment with levofloxacin will be effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of children aged 6 months to 16 years with community acquired pneumonia and wil be&#xD;
      well tolerated by the patients. Levofloxacin 10 mg/kg once or twice daily,&#xD;
      amoxicillin/clavulanate 22.5 mg/kg twice daily, ceftriaxone 25 mg/kg twice daily plus&#xD;
      erythromycin lactobionate 10 mg/kg every 6 hours or clarithromycin 7.5 mg/kg twice daily,&#xD;
      either intravenously or by mouth for up to 10 days.&#xD;
