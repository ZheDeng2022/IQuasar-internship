    <textblock>
      This protocol is a joint project of the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control and the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases. It is designed to collect plasma from healthy employees of the Department of&#xD;
      Defense who have been vaccinated against anthrax. The collected plasma will be pooled to make&#xD;
      an anthrax-fighting antibody solution called anthrax immune globulin intravenous (AIGIV).&#xD;
      This solution will be used for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Animal experiments to test its effectiveness in preventing the development of anthrax&#xD;
           after inhalation exposure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treating people severely ill with anthrax who are not improving with standard antibiotic&#xD;
           therapy; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treating people exposed to spores of the bacteria that cause anthrax to try to prevent&#xD;
           development of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age who have received at least four doses of&#xD;
      the anthrax vaccine and who meet the criteria for blood donors may be eligible to participate&#xD;
      in this study. Volunteers will be recruited from Department of Defense civilian and military&#xD;
      employees. Candidates will be screened with an interview and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a health history screen for donating plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of heart rate, blood pressure and temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fingerstick to check hemoglobin level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and other infectious diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test for anthrax antibody levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasmapheresis to collect blood plasma (the liquid part of the blood)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In plasmapheresis, whole blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm vein. The blood&#xD;
      flows into a cell separator machine, where it is spun to separate the plasma from the blood&#xD;
      cells. The plasma is collected in a plastic bag in the machine, while the rest of the blood&#xD;
      is returned to the donor through the needle in the arm. During the procedure, the donor is&#xD;
      given a blood thinner called citrate to prevent the blood from clotting while it is in the&#xD;
      cell separator machine. The procedure lasts from 60 to 90 minutes. Only a small fraction of&#xD;
      the body's total plasma is removed, and it is quickly replaced by the body with no long-term&#xD;
      health effects. Participants may be requested to donate plasma as often as every 3 to 4 days&#xD;
      or as infrequently as once a month for a maximum of six donations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhalational anthrax infection is associated with a 60-100% mortality rate, depending on the&#xD;
      rapidity with which appropriate antimicrobial therapy is initiated. Experiments using an&#xD;
      animal model of inhalational anthrax suggest that adjunctive therapy with equine-derived&#xD;
      anti-anthrax antisera may be associated with higher survival rates, however no human-derived&#xD;
      antisera are currently available. The purpose of this protocol is to provide a mechanism for&#xD;
      obtaining high-titer anti-anthrax immunoglobulin by plasmapheresis of human volunteers who&#xD;
      have recently received a course of anthrax vaccination. Volunteers are Department of Defense&#xD;
      (DoD) employees and military personnel who are within 3 to 12 weeks of having received a&#xD;
      fourth or greater dose of AVA if four to six total inoculations were given, or within 6&#xD;
      months of the last dose if seven or more AVA inoculations were given. All vaccinees were&#xD;
      vaccinated as a requirement of their tour of duty and will otherwise meet all blood donor&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, in accord with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements and&#xD;
      American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) standards. Plasmapheresis will be accomplished&#xD;
      using licensed apheresis devices and standard collection techniques, and products will meet&#xD;
      all blood safety testing requirements currently mandated by the FDA. Plasma components&#xD;
      collected under this protocol will be stored in the frozen state as fresh frozen plasma (FFP)&#xD;
      until a protocol for administration of these components to human patients critically ill with&#xD;
      inhalational anthrax infection has been reviewed and approved by the IRB's of NIH, CDC, and&#xD;
      USAMRIID. Following this approval, products will undergo standard Cohn-Oncley fractionation&#xD;
      into a concentrated immunoglobulin preparation suitable for intravenous use, to be designated&#xD;
      anthrax immune globulin intravenous (AIGIV). Intravenous administration of products derived&#xD;
      from plasma collected under this protocol, whether as single-donor FFP or as AIGIV, will&#xD;
      occur under a Phase I/II trial involving an Investigational New Drug (IND) exemption, with&#xD;
      the IND held by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The plasma products&#xD;
      collected under this protocol will also be used in pharmacokinetic, dose finding, and&#xD;
      efficacy studies in animals, and to establish a repository of reference serum standards at&#xD;
      the CDC. This study represents a collaborative effort between the DTM/NIH, CDC, and DoD.&#xD;
