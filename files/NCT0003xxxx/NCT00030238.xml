    <textblock>
      This study will examine the health effects of calcium supplements in overweight adults.&#xD;
      Overweight adults often eat a diet low in calcium. Some studies have found low calcium intake&#xD;
      in people who have some of the medical problems often seen in overweight adults. This study&#xD;
      will see if extra calcium improves the health of overweight adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers in general good health 18 years of age or older who are overweight (body mass&#xD;
      index equal to or greater than 25 kilograms per square meter of body surface) may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding may not participate. The study&#xD;
      includes four visits, described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be screened for participation in the study with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and blood and urine tests. At home, they will collect a 24-hour urine sample;&#xD;
      fill out questionnaires to assess their average calcium intake; and record their food intake&#xD;
      for 7 days. Those enrolled in the study will continue with the next 3 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a physical activity questionnaire, have their food diary reviewed,&#xD;
      and meet with a dietitian for nutritional counseling. Triceps fold thickness and waist and&#xD;
      hip circumferences will be measured three times. Body composition will be analyzed by a DEXA&#xD;
      study. For this procedure, the subject lies on a flat table while a small dose of X-rays is&#xD;
      passed through the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to take either calcium carbonate (1500 mg/day) or&#xD;
      placebo capsules twice a day by mouth for 2 years. (The placebo looks like the calcium&#xD;
      capsules but contains no calcium.) They will receive a 6-month supply of study capsules&#xD;
      during visit 2 and return to NIH every 6 months for the next supply. They will also be sent&#xD;
      questionnaires by mail every 3 months to complete information about health problems and how&#xD;
      often the study capsules are being taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 is scheduled after participants have taken the study capsules for 1 year; visit 4 is&#xD;
      scheduled after 2 years (the end of the study). At each of these visits, participants will&#xD;
      have a DEXA scan, blood and urine tests, blood pressure measurements, and measurements of&#xD;
      height, weight, waist and hip circumference. They will complete questionnaires about their&#xD;
      medical history, side effects of the study medications, dietary calcium intake, and physical&#xD;
      activity, and they will meet with one of the study investigators to talk about any concerns&#xD;
      regarding the study. At the fourth visit, participants will answer some additional questions&#xD;
      about their study participation and return the Diet History Questionnaire that was mailed to&#xD;
      them before the visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 97 million people in the United States are overweight or obese, and therefore&#xD;
      have an increased risk for a number of other obesity-related co-morbid conditions (such as&#xD;
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, and Type 2 Diabetes) as well as for all-cause mortality. The&#xD;
      total cost attributable to obesity amounted to $99.2 billion in the US in 1995 and this&#xD;
      figure, like the prevalence of increased body mass, is rising at an alarming rate. At the&#xD;
      same time calcium intake in the US adult population is far below the RDA (recommended daily&#xD;
      allowance) and much below the daily optimal calcium intake recommended by the 1994 NIH&#xD;
      consensus conference. An analysis of the NHANES III database suggests a strong inverse&#xD;
      association between relative risk of obesity and calcium intake. Further, both prospective&#xD;
      studies in animal models, and retrospective analyses of human studies suggest calcium&#xD;
      supplementation may play a role in minimizing yearly weight gain, and may possibly induce&#xD;
      small weight losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test the relationship between calcium intake and body weight, we propose to&#xD;
      conduct a 2-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of calcium&#xD;
      supplementation (1500 mg/day of supplementary calcium vs. placebo) in adults with a BMI&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 25 kg/m(2). We will study the effects of supplemental calcium on&#xD;
      body weight, body composition, and obesity-related comorbid conditions, such as insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and lipids. The effects of such supplementation on blood pressure will also be&#xD;
      systematically evaluated. A control group of untreated, healthy, adults will also be enrolled&#xD;
      for comparisons to study subjects.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Volunteers will qualify if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Good general health. Individuals taking medication for obesity-related co-morbid&#xD;
             conditions will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body Mass Index greater than or equal to 25 kg/m(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For women with childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test at the initial&#xD;
             evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Normal fasting serum Ca (2.05-2.55 mmol/L) and serum phosphorous levels (2.3 - 4.3&#xD;
             mg/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA: (Normal Weight Subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will qualify if the meet the following criteria&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Body Mass Index 1-24.99 kg/m(2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For women with childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test at the initial&#xD;
             evaluation. Since these subjects have to undergo DXA (dual Energy X-ray&#xD;
             Absorptiometry) scan screening in their second visit, for safety purposes, pregnant&#xD;
             women will be excluded from participation in the study.&#xD;

                  condition that in the opinion of the investigators would impede competence or&#xD;
                  compliance or possibly hinder completion of the study;&#xD;
