  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore the brain activities involved in&#xD;
      performing learned automatic movements. Automatic movements are performed without&#xD;
      concentrating on the details of the movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult volunteers are eligible for this study. Candidates will have a medical history&#xD;
      and brief physical examination and will fill out a questionnaire. Women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential will have a urine pregnancy test. Pregnant women will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform certain tasks involving movement of the right or left hand while&#xD;
      undergoing MRI scanning. They will undergo scanning twice-before and after practicing the&#xD;
      movement tasks. Before the second scan, participants will practice the following tasks for 1&#xD;
      week:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tapping task - subjects use their left index finger to tap a button at a certain&#xD;
           frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequential movement task - subjects perform sequential finger-tapping movements with&#xD;
           their right hand, in which they tap buttons with their fingers at a certain frequency in&#xD;
           a 25-second period. There are two sequences of different lengths, referred to as&#xD;
           sequence-4 and sequence-12, based on the number of movements in each unit of the&#xD;
           sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual distraction task - 14-letter sequences consisting of the letters A, G, L, and O&#xD;
           will be presented and subjects will be asked to identify the number of times they see a&#xD;
           target letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dual tasks - after completing all the above tasks, subjects perform the following dual&#xD;
           tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tapping and visual task&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence-4 finger tap and visual task&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence-12 finger tap and visual task&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tapping and sequence-4 finger tap&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tapping and sequence-12 finger tap&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the participants can perform the dual tasks correctly 90 percent of the time, the&#xD;
      movements will be considered automatic, and the subjects will undergo MRI scanning. MRI uses&#xD;
      a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the brain. For the procedure, the&#xD;
      subject lies still on a stretcher that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder&#xD;
      containing the magnet). Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises caused by electrical&#xD;
      switching of radio frequency circuits used in the scanning process. The scan will last about&#xD;
      1.5 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A general characteristic of the motor system is that people can perform some learned&#xD;
      movements automatically. The underlying neural correlates of automatic movement have been&#xD;
      investigated, but are not fully understood. In the present study, in order to investigate the&#xD;
      brain activities contributing to the phenomenon, we use a specially designed dual task&#xD;
      paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. Forty healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects are asked to perform motor tasks (squeezing of hand or sequential movement of&#xD;
      fingers) while listening to an auditory distraction task, or to execute two different motor&#xD;
      tasks simultaneously. fMRI is obtained during their performance of these tasks. By analyzing&#xD;
      fMRI results, we will explore the brain regions especially devoted to the automatic&#xD;
      movements.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Forty normal adult volunteers will be included. Volunteers will be recruited from people&#xD;
        who are registered as HMCS Normal Volunteers. All subjects participating in MR studies&#xD;
        should have a valid Clinical Center Medical Record Number. Procedures for the functional&#xD;
        fMRI experiment will follow the Standard Operating Procedures of HMCS Neuroimaging group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with pacemakers, cardiac, or neural defibrillators, intracranial aneurysm clips,&#xD;
        intraorbital metallic structures, insulin pumps, cochlear implants, and other metallic&#xD;
        objects will not be scanned. We will not scan pregnant women because the safety of high&#xD;
        magnetic fields to the fetus is not established. Therefore, we will administer a urine&#xD;
        pregnancy field for any female of childbearing potential prior to functional MRI scan. If&#xD;
        the result from a urine pregnancy test is not available for some reason, a medical doctor&#xD;
        will judge based on the proper information prior to the scanning. We will also exclude&#xD;
        children because the study will be too complex for them.&#xD;
