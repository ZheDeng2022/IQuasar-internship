  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out whether it is safe to treat patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer with the drug Thalidomide before removing the&#xD;
      tumor (radical retropubic prostatectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers also want to learn if Thalidomide can shrink or slow the growth of the prostate&#xD;
      cancer before the surgery&#xD;

      1. To determine the efficacy (rate of tumor reduction and PSA decline) of pre-operative&#xD;
           treatment with thalidomide in patients with locally advanced prostate carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the safety and toxicity (excessive bleeding, wound healing problems) of&#xD;
           preoperative therapy with thalidomide in patients with locally advanced prostate&#xD;
           carcinoma who undergo RRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To obtain qualitative measurements of thalidomide's effect in vivo on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. endothelial cells / neo-vascularity /angiogenic growth factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Assessment of neovascularity (MVD)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Dual fluorescent labeling technique to evaluate apoptosis in CD-31 positive&#xD;
                     cells (TUNEL)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  bFGF, VEGF, EGF and TGF expression by PCa epithelium and prostatic stroma&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Modulation of endothelial markers (serum: E-selectin and Thrombomodulin)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Modulation of serum VEGF and urine bFGF levels, and Changes in tumor blood&#xD;
                     flow&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. epithelial compartment:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (TUNEL)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Proliferation (PCNA)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. quality of life&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prostatic adenocarcinoma without evidence of regional or distant metastases, clinical&#xD;
             stage T1c-T2c with Gleason score &gt; 7 on initial biopsy and PSA &gt; 10 ng/dl or clinical&#xD;
             stage T3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative bone scan and CT abd/pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical candidate for radical prostatectomy and ECOG performance status of &lt; 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have no other concurrent malignancies (or within the past 5 years, with&#xD;
             the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer or treated superficial transitional cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the bladder).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral granulocyte count &gt; 1,500/mm3, platelet count of &gt; 100,000/mm3 and Hb&gt; 10.0&#xD;
             gm/dl, adequate hepatic function with a bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg % and SGPT &lt; 2.5x the upper&#xD;
             limits of normal, and adequate renal function defined as serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg% or&#xD;
             creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with biochemical hypothyroidism will have their thyroid hormone replaced&#xD;
             concurrent with starting the study. Patients with clinical hypothyroidism should have&#xD;
             their thyroid replaced prior to starting this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent indicating that patients are aware of the investigational nature of&#xD;
             the study, in keeping with the policies of the institution. The only approved consent&#xD;
             form is appended to this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing and able to travel to UT-MDACC for re-evaluation as necessary&#xD;
             per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be counseled about the possibility that thalidomide may be present in&#xD;
             the semen and must use a latex condom every time they have sexual intercourse with a&#xD;
             woman during therapy and for 4 weeks after discontinuing thalidomide, even if they had&#xD;
             a successful vasectomy.&#xD;

             is considered hormonal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of substantial non-iatrogenic bleeding diathesis and patients&#xD;
             with macroscopic hematuria or active GI bleeding are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled cardiac, respiratory, hepatic, renal, neurologic or&#xD;
             psychiatric disorder are excluded from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with NCI grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy of any cause (clinically&#xD;
             detectable), or receiving anti-convulsive medications are not eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving sedative/hypnotic agents which cannot be discontinued (if&#xD;
