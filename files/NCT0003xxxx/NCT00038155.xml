  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization for an acute medical condition often results in functional decline in older&#xD;
      adults. This loss of function often is not reversed after hospital discharge. Our general&#xD;
      hypothesis is that patients will benefit from rehabilitation that occurs simultaneously with&#xD;
      the medical management of acute conditions and when linked with a home exercise program that&#xD;
      can be implemented after discharge from the hospital. This approach differs from the&#xD;
      traditional approach of addressing rehabilitation needs after acute conditions have resolved&#xD;
      and providing rehabilitation services for selected patients in institutional settings, such&#xD;
      as subacute units or nursing homes. The feasibility of the program will be assessed by&#xD;
      documenting the participation of subjects during the inpatient phase and adherence of&#xD;
      subjects with the home-based program. Fifty subjects will be recruited from individuals who&#xD;
      are 60 years of age or older who have been admitted to the Birmingham Veterans Affairs&#xD;
      Medical Center (VAMC) for treatment of an acute medical condition. Subjects will be either&#xD;
      unable to ambulate, require assistance for ambulation, or be unable to ambulate a functional&#xD;
      distance (150 feet) at a functional velocity (30m/min). Subjects will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      a physical rehabilitation group (PR) or to a control group (CON). During hospitalization,&#xD;
      subjects in the PR group daily will have one 45-minute morning rehabilitation session and one&#xD;
      30-minute evening rehabilitation session. Both sessions will include ambulation and transfer&#xD;
      training. The longer morning session will also include resistance exercise. Subjects in the&#xD;
      CON group will have medial care as it is currently provided. During the six months after&#xD;
      discharge, subjects in the PR group will perform a home-based exercise program consisting of&#xD;
      ambulation and resistance exercises. The program will be monitored and progressed by an&#xD;
      exercise physiologist who will visit subjects weekly for the first month after discharge,&#xD;
      every other week for the second and third months after discharge, and monthly in the fourth,&#xD;
      fifth, and six months after discharge. This study is designed to test the feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of a practical and potentially cost-effective rehabilitation program.&#xD;

      Specific Objectives of the Project&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the feasibility of inpatient rehabilitation during hospitalization followed by a&#xD;
      home-based exercise program in older persons who are limited in ambulation when admitted to&#xD;
      the hospital. Feasibility will be determined by our ability to identify, recruit and enroll&#xD;
      subjects, by the ability of subjects to complete two sessions of rehabilitation each day&#xD;
      during the inpatient phase, and by subject adherence to the home-based program. Adherence to&#xD;
      the home-based program will be assessed through regular visits and review of activity logs.&#xD;
      Criteria for feasibility will be successful recruitment of fifty study subjects meeting&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, participation in at least 80% of scheduled inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation sessions and in at least 80% of prescribed home exercise sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the impact of a standardized twice daily inpatient rehabilitation program on&#xD;
      ambulation, ability to perform transfers and self-care, and muscle strength at hospital&#xD;
      discharge in older adults hospitalized for an acute medical condition. We will study&#xD;
      individuals who have either lost the ability to ambulate independently (within the two weeks&#xD;
      before hospitalization), or have limited ability to ambulate (less than 150 feet at a&#xD;
      functional velocity). The primary outcome measure for this objective will be the Timed Up and&#xD;
      Go (TUG) test (41). Ambulation, transfers, and self-care also will be assessed using the&#xD;
      locomotion, mobility and self care subscales of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM)&#xD;
      (15, 22-24). The Microfit 2 hand-held dynamometer (HHD) will be used to test muscle strength&#xD;
      of six lower extremity muscle groups and three upper extremity muscle groups (44). An&#xD;
      important outcome assessment will be the proportion of subjects that regain independence in&#xD;
      ambulation by hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effect of a combined program of inpatient rehabilitation with a progressive&#xD;
      home-based exercise training program during the six months following discharge on ambulation,&#xD;
      ability to perform transfers and self care, walking endurance, and mobility within the home&#xD;
      and community. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test will be the primary outcome measure.&#xD;
      Ambulation, ability to perform transfers and self-care, and muscle strength also will be&#xD;
      assessed using the measures described for the second specific objective. The Six Minute Walk&#xD;
      Test (6 MWT) will be used to evaluate walking endurance, while a life-space assessment will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate mobility within the home and the community (42).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized, controlled clinical trial, involving a physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation (PR) group, and a control (CON) group. Fifty subjects who meet the study&#xD;
      criteria will be randomly assigned to PR or CON. PR will receive an intensive rehabilitation&#xD;
      program consisting of progressive ambulation, transfer training, and resistance exercise&#xD;
      during hospitalization. A similar home exercise program will be prescribed during the six&#xD;
      months post-hospitalization. The CON group will receive routine medical care as it is&#xD;
      currently provided.&#xD;
