  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SCH66336 is a drug that has been designed to block the growth of tumor cells and encourage&#xD;
      tumor cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized study where patients will receive study drug or no drug. Participants in&#xD;
      this study are scheduled to have surgery to remove head and neck cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically-confirmed stage II, III and IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and&#xD;
             neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's tumor is fully resectable and does not require radiotherapy to the entire&#xD;
             buccal mucosa or patients who are to be treated with definitive radiation therapy as&#xD;
             long as adequate (&gt;2cm^3) of tissue can be obtained post-therapy with SCH66336.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status of &lt;/= 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory values (performed within 14 days prior to administration of SCH 66336):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. White blood cell count greater than 3.0 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelet count greater than or equal to 150 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10 gm/dL (100 gm/L). Patients may have&#xD;
                  received transfusions and/or erythropoietin to attain this value. However, they&#xD;
                  must have been stable without treatment for at least one week in order to be&#xD;
                  eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Serum creatinine less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Total bilirubin less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. SGOT or SGPT (only one of these tests needs to be performed) less than or equal&#xD;
                  to 5.0 times upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;

             signing informed consent and prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior investigational therapy but at least 4 weeks must&#xD;
             have elapsed with recovery from all toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are poor medical risks because of non-malignant systemic disease, as well&#xD;
             as those with active uncontrolled infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled heart disease (symptomatic ischemic heart disease or congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, or either of these conditions with a variable medication requirement).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with QTc prolongation at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intractable vomiting (e.g., CTC Grade 2 or higher despite antiemetic medication) or&#xD;
             any medical condition which could interfere with taking oral medication and&#xD;
             gastrointestinal absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has received prior induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient exhibits confusion, disorientation, or has a history of major psychiatric&#xD;
             illness which may impair patient's understanding of the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with a FPT inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's life expectancy is less than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity from previous anticancer treatment or&#xD;
             significant neuropathy from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient requires total parenteral nutrition with lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologic therapy, or surgery within four weeks prior&#xD;
             to administration of SCH 66336. Nitrosourea or mitomycin C administration within 6&#xD;
             weeks of SCH 66336.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of resolution of all toxic manifestations of prior chemotherapy, biologic or&#xD;
             radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy to greater than 30% of bone marrow as defined in Appendix D. (Whole&#xD;
             pelvic radiation alone is not exclusionary.)&#xD;
