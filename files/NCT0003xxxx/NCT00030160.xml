  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent obesity prevalence increases have made obesity prevention a clear and pressing public&#xD;
      health issue. The average US. woman gains about 0.5 kg per year. Overweight women aged 25 to&#xD;
      44 have a higher prevalence of significant weight gains (BMI increases of &gt; 5 kg/m2) than men&#xD;
      or older or thinner women. The difficulty in successfully losing weight and maintaining&#xD;
      weight loss has resulted in recommendations from several expert panels to advise overweight&#xD;
      and mildly obese individuals free of co-morbidities to avoid weight gains rather than to lose&#xD;
      weight. Physical activity is observed to decline with age while caloric intake remains stable&#xD;
      or declines slightly. There is strong observational evidence that physical activity could&#xD;
      prevent or attenuate age associated fat gains. This randomized, controlled behavioral&#xD;
      intervention trial will test the hypothesis that regular participation in a twice weekly&#xD;
      strength training program over 2 years, can prevent age associated body fat increases (total&#xD;
      and abdominal fat) in 80 overweight to mildly obese premenopausal women between the ages of&#xD;
      25 and 44 years, compared to a 'standard care' group (n=80). The overall aim of the study is&#xD;
      to prevent body fat gains and to reduce health risks associated with obesity. Treatment&#xD;
      effects will be assessed for insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, blood lipids, muscle&#xD;
      strength, and psychosocial predictors of strength training adherence. The innovation of this&#xD;
      approach rests in its simplicity and the minimal time requirement for full participation (2&#xD;
      exercise sessions weekly). A preliminary study of this innovative approach resulted in 88%&#xD;
      exercise session attendance over 12 months and maintenance of treatment effects on total body&#xD;
      fat percentage to the end of pilot study measurements (9 months). This supports the&#xD;
      feasibility and potential for long term efficacy of the proposed intervention approach. The&#xD;
      long-term implication of success in this efficacy trial would be that this modest behavior&#xD;
      change could prevent the fat gains and associated co-morbidities commonly observed in midlife&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

      Recent obesity prevalence increases have made obesity prevention a clear and pressing public&#xD;
      health issue. The average US. woman gains about 0.5 kg per year, 60 to 80% of which can be&#xD;
      assumed to be fat. Overweight women aged 25 to 44 have a higher prevalence of significant&#xD;
      weight gains (BMI increases of &gt; 5 kg/m2) than men or older or thinner women. Total and&#xD;
      visceral abdominal fat gains are associated with a variety of obesity co-morbidities,&#xD;
      including insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The difficulty in successfully&#xD;
      losing weight and maintaining weight loss has resulted in recommendations from several expert&#xD;
      panels to advise overweight and mildly obese individuals free of co-morbidities to avoid&#xD;
      weight gains rather than to lose weight. Physical activity is observed to decline with age&#xD;
      while caloric intake remains stable or declines slightly. There is strong observational&#xD;
      evidence that physical activity could prevent or attenuate age associated fat gains. This&#xD;
      randomized, controlled behavioral intervention trial will test the hypothesis that regular&#xD;
      participation in a twice weekly strength training program over 2 years, can prevent age&#xD;
      associated body fat increases (total and visceral abdominal fat) in 80 overweight to mildly&#xD;
      obese premenopausal women (BMI 25-35 kg/m2) between the ages of 25 and 44 years, compared to&#xD;
      a 'standard care' group (n=80). The overall aim of the study is to prevent body fat gains and&#xD;
      to reduce health risks associated with obesity. Treatment effects will be assessed for&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, blood lipids, muscle strength, and psychosocial&#xD;
      predictors of strength training adherence. The innovation of this approach rests in its&#xD;
      simplicity and the minimal time requirement for full participation (2 exercise sessions&#xD;
      weekly). A preliminary study of this innovative approach resulted in 88% exercise session&#xD;
