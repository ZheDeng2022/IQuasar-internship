  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in 'parent' cooperative study projects are interviewed about their experiences in&#xD;
      the informed consent process.&#xD;

      Intervention: (1) Cognitive stratification (obtained by a test of cognitive ability, followed&#xD;
      by a tailored IC process); (2) Pre-recruitment video (a patient-activation video designed to&#xD;
      prevent several common misconceptions; (3) Provide prospective research volunteers with a&#xD;
      sense of the purpose and methods of controlled research); and (4) Evaluation of the informed&#xD;
      consent process using the Brief Informed Consent Evaluation Protocol (BICEP) developed in&#xD;
      EQUIC-DP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: The validity of informed consent can be improved, as measured by an&#xD;
      independent interview of patients (BICEP), by at least one of three interventions described&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes: The quality of the informed consent process, as measured by the BICEP&#xD;
      (Brief Informed Consent Evaluation Protocol). The BICEP also offers a method to certify&#xD;
      informed consent in routine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Abstract: Customized Consent will develop and test an innovative, supplemental method&#xD;
      of disclosing information to patients in the informed consent process. This disclosure&#xD;
      strategy is intended to increase patients' understanding and satisfaction with the consent&#xD;
      process. This study has two goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention to improve comprehension during&#xD;
           informed consent; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify those patients for whom this intervention is most effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of EQUIC-CC is to determine whether an intervention, added to usual&#xD;
      procedures for obtaining informed consent, is able to improve comprehension. The second goal&#xD;
      of EQUIC-CC is to identify those patients for whom an augmented consent intervention is most&#xD;
      effective, as well as to determine which subgroups of patients, if any, are most likely to&#xD;
      benefit from visual information added to the usual disclosure phase of obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
