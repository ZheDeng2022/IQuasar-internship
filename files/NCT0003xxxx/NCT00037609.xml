    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the phase I study is to determine a safe dose for combination&#xD;
      therapy with capecitabine and exisulind. A secondary objective is to assess pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      interactions between the two drugs and assess the biological activity of exisulind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the Phase II part of this study is to assess the anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      of this combination therapy measured by objective tumor response. Secondary end points also&#xD;
      assessed will be toxicity of therapy, duration of response and time to progression.&#xD;

      Rationale for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as 2nd or 3rd line&#xD;
      chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer who previously have failed both&#xD;
      anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy. Capecitabine produces objective tumor response of&#xD;
      around 20% with a median duration of response of 32 weeks in these patients (1). These&#xD;
      results indicate that improvements in the treatment of anthracycline and taxane resistant&#xD;
      breast cancer are needed. Exisulind (sulindac sulfone, FGN-1, APTOSYNTM) is a sulfone&#xD;
      metabolite of sulindac, a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug. Sulindac&#xD;
      sulfone lacks inhibitory activity on the two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX 1 and COX 2, and&#xD;
      is devoid of gastrointestinal and renal toxicity that is associated with NSAIDs. Exisulind&#xD;
      selectively stimulates programmed cell death in a variety of neoplastic cells including&#xD;
      colon, prostate, and mammary epithelial cells without affecting normal cells (2,3). Exisulind&#xD;
      inhibits the growth of breast cancer cell lines in vitro and also inhibits chemically-induced&#xD;
      mammary carcinogenesis in rats (4,5). The drug is also synergistic with a diverse group of&#xD;
      cytotoxic compounds including cisplatin, taxanes and retinoids (6). Exisulind exerts its&#xD;
      effects by inhibiting a novel phosphodiesterase that belongs to the PDE5 family which&#xD;
      specifically degrades cGMP (7). Inhibition of this enzyme results in a rise in intracellular&#xD;
      cGMP levels and leads to apoptosis through yet unknown mechanism. Exisulind also inhibits&#xD;
      transcription factor NF-kB (8). The NF-kB pathway is activated by cellular stress including&#xD;
      exposure to inflammatory cytokines, cytotoxic agents and oxidative stress (9). It is believed&#xD;
      that activation of NF-kB protects from cell death, therefore, inhibition of this&#xD;
      transcription factor may contribute to the proapoptotic, chemotherapy potentiating effect of&#xD;
      exisulind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exisulind selectively promotes apoptosis in neoplastic cells whereas chemotherapeutic drugs&#xD;
      induce programmed cell death in a non-selective manner. We hypothesize that combination of&#xD;
      the 2 drugs will increase response rates by selectively augmenting the cytotoxic activity of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Furthermore, continuous maintenance treatment, between chemotherapy doses, with&#xD;
      a minimally toxic drug that selectively induces apoptosis of cancer cells may improve&#xD;
      response duration and ultimately may translate into improved survival and better quality of&#xD;
      life. Each drug alone has an established maximum tolerated dose in humans. However, the&#xD;
      combination of exisulind and capecitabine has not been tested. This phase I-II study is&#xD;
      proposed to test safety and efficacy of this combination in patients with metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female patients must be of non-childbearing potential or non-lactating and using&#xD;
             adequate contraception. Beta-HCG will be checked in premenopausal patients if&#xD;
