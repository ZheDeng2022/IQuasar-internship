      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are to determine: (1) the effects of asthma with pre-existing&#xD;
      airway hyper reactivity on the pulmonary function and airway reactivity and inflammation&#xD;
      responses to chlorine; (2) the effects of chlorine concentration on the pulmonary function&#xD;
      and airway reactivity and inflammation responses to chlorine; and (3) to assess the time&#xD;
      dynamics of the pulmonary function and airway reactivity and inflammation responses to&#xD;
      chlorine. It is hypothesized that both airway hyperactivity and higher chlorine concentration&#xD;
      will result in larger changes in pulmonary function and airway reactivity and inflammation&#xD;
      responses, and that these changes will have differential time courses following chlorine&#xD;
      exposure. This study uses two controlled human exposure experiments, utilizing a&#xD;
      single-blind, repeated-measures, and counter- balanced design. The two subject groups for&#xD;
      both experiments will consist of 21 individuals with no airway hyperactivity, and 21&#xD;
      individuals with both asthma and airway hyperactivity. In Experiment One, subjects are&#xD;
      exposed for 15 minutes separately to each of: (1) chlorine at 0.4 ppm; (2) chlorine at 1.0&#xD;
      ppm; and (3) filtered air (Control). Pulmonary function and airway reactivity are measured&#xD;
      immediately pre-exposure and 1 and 20 hours post-exposure. Airway inflammation, as determined&#xD;
      by cellular and biochemical components from sputum-induction, is measured 65 hours&#xD;
      pre-exposure and 20 hours post-exposure. In Experiments Two, subjects are exposed for 15&#xD;
      minutes separately to each of: (1) chlorine (concentration determined from Experiment One);&#xD;
      (2) filtered air (Control). Pulmonary function and airway reactivity are measured immediately&#xD;
      pre-exposure and at 3 and 72 hours post-exposure. Sputum-induction is performed 65 hours&#xD;
      pre-exposure and at 3 and 72 hours post-exposure. The results of this study will provide&#xD;
      information on a major irritant chemical relevant to occupational environments. Specially,&#xD;
      the susceptibility of a large sub-population at increased risk, the dose-response effects,&#xD;
      and the post-exposure time dynamics of the effects of chlorine gas will be determined.&#xD;
