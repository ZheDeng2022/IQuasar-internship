      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of TLK286 in treating patients who have&#xD;
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the 12-month survival of patients with advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer treated with TLK286. II. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this&#xD;
      drug. III. Determine the objective response rate, duration of objective response, time to&#xD;
      tumor progression, and disease stabilization in patients treated with this drug. IV.&#xD;
      Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive TLK286 IV over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 6 weeks for 1 year and then every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 55 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.&#xD;
