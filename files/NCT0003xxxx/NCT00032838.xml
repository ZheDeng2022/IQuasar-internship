  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how hormonal changes that occur during stressful&#xD;
      situations affect thought and emotions. Results from this study may lead to treatments that&#xD;
      can alleviate the psychological effects of trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of cortisol and norepinephrine increase in response to stress; these hormones also&#xD;
      influence thought processes. This study will give hydrocortisone and/or yohimbine (a&#xD;
      stimulator of central norepinephrine) to healthy adults in order to model the stress response&#xD;
      and to better understand the way people process information during traumatic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study comprises two experiments in which the stress response is pharmacologically&#xD;
      modeled. Participants in the study will have two study visits. During Visit 1, participants&#xD;
      will undergo a psychiatric assessment, complete neuropsychological tasks, and have their IQ&#xD;
      measured. During Visit 2, participants will be given hydrocortisone and/or yohimbine. Blood&#xD;
      will be collected before and during this. Participants will then perform two experiments. In&#xD;
      one experiment, participants will hear a story with emotional and non-emotional segments; in&#xD;
      a second experiment, participants will view both emotional and non-emotional stimuli.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Memories for traumatic events are fundamentally different from typical memories. Individuals&#xD;
      who witness or are involved in an extremely stressful event, such as a robbery or a violent&#xD;
      act, retain highly accurate memories for the information directly related to the trauma&#xD;
      (e.g., a gun or verbal threat), while surrounding details are poorly remembered. This&#xD;
      so-called weapon focus phenomenon has been found in both naturalistic and laboratory studies&#xD;
      with humans. However, difficulties with the control of naturalistic studies and approximating&#xD;
      trauma in the lab limit the validity of these findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurophysiologically, cortisol and norepinephrine are principal mediators of the stress&#xD;
      response, and both influence memory function. In particular, cortisol improves memory at low&#xD;
      levels but impairs memory at higher doses. Similarly, some evidence indicates that&#xD;
      norepinephrine also enhances memory in low doses and either impairs or does not influence&#xD;
      memory at high doses. Much of the experimental work in this area has been conducted with&#xD;
      animals. Studies have recently begun to extend these paradigms to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand memory processing during trauma, hydrocortisone and/or yohimbine (a&#xD;
      stimulator of central norepinephrine) will be administered to healthy adults in two&#xD;
      experiments in order to pharmacologically model the stress response. Following infusion,&#xD;
      participants will hear a story with emotional and nonemotional segments in one experiment (N&#xD;
      = 80) and emotional as well as nonemotional stimuli (faces and scenes) in another experiment&#xD;
      (N = 80). It is predicted that relative to the placebo, hydrocortisone will impair memory for&#xD;
      both emotional and nonemotional information, yohimbine will improve memory for both types of&#xD;
      information, and the combination of hydrocortisone and yohimbine will enhance memory for&#xD;
      emotional aspects and impair memory for the nonemotional segments of the story. Results from&#xD;
      this study will permit a better understanding of how emotionally charged memories are encoded&#xD;
      and will potentially lead to treatments to mitigate the psychological effects of traumatic&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
