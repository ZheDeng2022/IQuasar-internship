      This 36-week study will determine whether traditional Chinese medicine (acupuncture and&#xD;
      Chinese herbs) is as effective as hormone therapy for alleviating endometriosis-related&#xD;
      pelvic pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a significant public health problem affecting 10-15% of women of&#xD;
      childbearing age, many of whom suffer persistent pelvic pain and infertility. Therapeutic&#xD;
      options include surgery and hormone therapy that are often temporarily effective but produce&#xD;
      unwanted side-effects. The present proposal, based on case series reports of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM: acupuncture and Chinese herbs) for this&#xD;
      condition, aims to evaluate whether TCM is as effective as hormone therapy for alleviating&#xD;
      endometriosis-related chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with laparoscopy-diagnosed endometriosis will be randomly assigned to either TCM or&#xD;
      hormone therapy. Women assigned to TCM will be divided into four sub-groups on the basis of&#xD;
      the diagnostic categories of endometriosis recognized by TCM. A pre-established acupuncture&#xD;
      protocol and herbal formula specific for each sub-group will be followed. This aspect of the&#xD;
      research design permits an important feature of the clinical practice of TCM (matching&#xD;
      treatment to sub-group diagnosis) to be adopted in a clinical trial. Women assigned to&#xD;
      hormone therapy will be treated with the gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa),&#xD;
      nafarelin, chosen for this study on the basis of its clinical trial-established efficacy,&#xD;
      ease of patient usage via intranasal spray and milder side-effect profile relative to other&#xD;
      GnRHa's. Pelvic pain symptoms (patient-scored) and signs (physician-scored) will be assessed&#xD;
      at baseline, after 12 weeks of treatment, and at 12- and 24-week post-treatment follow-up.&#xD;
      Pelvic examination scores will be determined by a physician blinded to the treatment group&#xD;
      assignments. Side effects, including those of pseudomenopause known to result from GnRHa&#xD;
      therapy, will be recorded in both groups at 4-week intervals during the 12-week treatment,&#xD;
      and at each follow-up time. A further objective is to make a preliminary assessment of&#xD;
      whether diagnostic sub-groups of endometriosis recognized by TCM serve as predictors of&#xD;
      differential response to hormone therapy. Data obtained from this study, on treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness, side effect profiles, recurrence of symptoms, compliance with therapy and&#xD;
      drop-out rates, will be used to design a large-scale clinical trial.&#xD;
