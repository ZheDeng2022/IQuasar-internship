    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining UCN-01 with carboplatin in treating&#xD;
      patients who have advanced solid tumors. UCN-01 may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy use&#xD;
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining&#xD;
      UCN-01 with carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity and other toxicities of&#xD;
      UCN-01 when combined with carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Preliminarily evaluate the antitumor effect of the combination of carboplatin and UCN-01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of UCN-01 and carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour followed by UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin and UCN-01 until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2&#xD;
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
