  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if an investigational vaccine can make antibodies&#xD;
      (proteins found in blood) in humans that will influence the course of an AIDS-like disease in&#xD;
      monkeys. Hopefully, the results of this study can be applied to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIDS, which is caused by infection with HIV, is associated with many deaths and occurrences&#xD;
      of disease. Although recent advances have been made in anti-HIV therapy for AIDS, there is no&#xD;
      cure for HIV infection or AIDS, and drug therapy is too expensive for most infected&#xD;
      populations. Some organizations are trying to make safe and effective vaccines that may&#xD;
      prevent HIV infection and AIDS worldwide. Certain vaccines can generate specific antibodies&#xD;
      in humans, but they do not inhibit HIV infection in laboratory tests. It is possible,&#xD;
      however, that these antibodies may make HIV disease less severe following infection. For this&#xD;
      reason, monkeys will be used to evaluate the role of specific human antibodies.&#xD;

      AIDS, caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated&#xD;
      with enormous morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although recent advances have been made in&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy for AIDS, there is no cure for HIV infection or AIDS, and drug therapy&#xD;
      is too expensive for most infected populations. The development of safe, effective vaccines&#xD;
      to prevent HIV infection and AIDS worldwide is a commitment of some health-oriented&#xD;
      organizations. A major goal in the effort to design an effective vaccine has been the&#xD;
      identification of the immunologic correlates of protective immunity. Non-neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies might possess clinically important anti-HIV activities that remain to be defined&#xD;
      and warrant investigation. The role played by antibody with minimal neutralizing activity&#xD;
      induced by various HIV vaccination strategies is unknown. It is possible that low-level&#xD;
      neutralization or other activities may lead to an improvement or worsening in disease course&#xD;
      following infection. For this reason it is proposed that a challenge trial in the rhesus&#xD;
      macaque SHIV model be performed, in which the role of such antibodies, which are derived from&#xD;
      non-infected human vaccinees, will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 2-part study. Part I involves human participants; Part II involves rhesus macaques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Human participants are divided into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: Participants who previously were enrolled in specific AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group&#xD;
      (AVEG) protocols are immunized with a single dose of the recombinant gp160MN/LAI-2 vaccine in&#xD;
      alum (aluminum hydroxide adjuvant) on Day 0 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: Participants who are vaccine naive receive no immunization. Each participant will&#xD;
      have 5 clinic visits during the study. Blood is drawn at each visit for routine testing and&#xD;
      immune system check. Sera is drawn from participants for neutralizing antibody determination.&#xD;
      Approximately 3 weeks after immunization (Day 18), blood is drawn from participants of both&#xD;
      groups for a plasmapheresis procedure in which platelets and plasma are removed. This process&#xD;
      is repeated 1 week later. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is purified from the plasma of vaccinated&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Juvenile rhesus macaques are divided into 4 groups and are infused with IgG from&#xD;
      human participants of Groups I and II at Day 0. At Day 1, the macaques are exposed to&#xD;
      SHIV-89.6P. At Days 3, 7, 10, and weekly up to Day 73, the CD4 lymphocyte count, plasma&#xD;
      viremia, and antibodies of the macaques are measured.&#xD;
