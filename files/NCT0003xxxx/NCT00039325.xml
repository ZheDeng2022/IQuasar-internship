      RATIONALE: Vaccines made by inserting a laboratory-treated gene into a person's white blood&#xD;
      cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy&#xD;
      and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IV or recurrent malignant&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This study is confined to adults over the age of 18 with histologically proven&#xD;
             malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MART-1, as assessed by either RT-PCR or by immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be typed for HLA-A*0201 for the phase I part of the study, and&#xD;
             HLA-A*0201 and/or DR*04 for the phase II part.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage with unresectable measurable melanoma (stage IV or stage III unresectable).&#xD;
             Patients previously treated with any form of therapy (including chemotherapy,&#xD;
             radiation therapy, immunotherapy or surgery) for either metastatic, relapsed or&#xD;
             primary melanoma are eligible for this trial, provided that previous the previous&#xD;
             treatment was completed &gt; 30 days prior to first vaccine.&#xD;

             negative pregnancy test prior to treatment.&#xD;

             response.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute medical problems such as ischemic heart or lung disease that may be considered&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with organ allografts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled CNS metastasis. Patients with CNS metastasis will be eligible if they&#xD;
             have received CNS irradiation to control local tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous clinical evidence of an autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant Medication and Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        All allowed medications or treatments should be kept to a minimum and recorded. All&#xD;

        investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medications and Treatments Not Allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
