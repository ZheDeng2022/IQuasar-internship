  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the maximum dose of docetaxel that can be given safely in&#xD;
      combination with ketoconazole for treating advanced prostate cancer. Docetaxel is approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of several other types of cancers; ketoconazole is an approved antifungal&#xD;
      medication that is also commonly used in high doses to treat prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with advanced prostate cancer that does not respond to&#xD;
      hormone therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with blood tests&#xD;
      to evaluate liver, kidney and other organ function and with x-rays, scans, or other imaging&#xD;
      tests to determine the extent of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the following medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Docetaxel daily, infused through a vein over 30 minutes, in 4-week cycles-3 consecutive&#xD;
           weeks of drug followed by one week of rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone, 12 hours and 1 hour before and 12 hours after docetaxel infusions to help&#xD;
           prevent fluid retention caused by the docetaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ketoconazole, 3 times a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hydrocortisone, twice a day to replace a loss of natural steroids caused by the&#xD;
           ketoconazole&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be hospitalized 1 to 2 days each for the first and second doses of docetaxel to&#xD;
      allow for frequent blood draws to measure blood levels of the drug. Ketoconazole will be&#xD;
      started about 2 weeks after the first dose of docetaxel and the second dose of docetaxel will&#xD;
      be given 2 days after that. In order to determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel,&#xD;
      the first few patients in the study will be given a low dose of the drug, and subsequent&#xD;
      patients will get increasingly higher doses until unacceptable side effects occur. Because&#xD;
      prostate cancer cells may grow if exposed to testosterone, patients may have to have their&#xD;
      testosterone production suppressed either surgically (removal of the testicles) or medically&#xD;
      with an injection of leuprolide or goserelin, which are luteinizing hormone-release hormone&#xD;
      agonists that reduce the amount of testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging studies, such as x-rays, bone scans or computed tomography (CT) scans, will be done&#xD;
      about every 3 months to examine how the tumor is responding to therapy. After six treatment&#xD;
      cycles, patients will have monthly chest x-rays to check for fluid around the lining of the&#xD;
      lungs, which may occur as a result of docetaxel therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is expected to continue for at least 3 to 6 months, although this time could be&#xD;
      shortened or extended depending on the tumor response to therapy or side effects of the&#xD;
      drugs. Patients who do not experience bad side effects and whose tumor does not grow during&#xD;
      the first 3 treatment cycles will continue treatment; those who experience unacceptable side&#xD;
      effects will be taken off the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      High dose ketoconazole and weekly docetaxel have both been shown to have activity against&#xD;
      androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC). We have demonstrated synergy in prostate cancer&#xD;
      in an in vitro model. This is an open label phase I study of high-dose ketoconazole plus&#xD;
      weekly docetaxel in patients with metastatic AIPC. The primary objective of this study will&#xD;
      be to determine the side effect profile of ketoconazole when combined with weekly docetaxel&#xD;
      therapy and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and a recommended phase II dose&#xD;
      (RPIID) of docetaxel when combined with high dose ketoconazole. Since ketoconazole may alter&#xD;
      the metabolism of docetaxel, this study will evaluate potential drug interactions and adverse&#xD;
      events between these two agents. Ketoconazole dose will be 600mg per day (given 200 mg, three&#xD;
      times a day), plus 30mg of hydrocortisone (20mg in the morning and 10mg in the evening), plus&#xD;
      docetaxel 10-43 mg/m(2) in a dose escalation, repeated in 28-day cycles, comprising weekly&#xD;
      treatments for three consecutive weeks followed by one week off. Each patient will be&#xD;
      evaluated every four weeks for the duration of the study.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have histopathological documentation of prostate cancer confirmed in the&#xD;
        Pathology Department of the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health or the&#xD;
        National Naval Medical Center prior to starting this study. Patients whose pathology&#xD;
        specimens are no longer available may be enrolled in the trial, if the patient has a&#xD;
        clinical course consistent with prostate cancer and pathologic documentation of the&#xD;
        diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have metastatic progressive androgen-independent prostate cancer (progressive&#xD;
        prostate cancer while continuing to receive hormonal ablation, such as that of an LHRH&#xD;
        agonist) documented prior to entry. Progression must be documented by at least one of the&#xD;
        following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Two consecutively rising PSA levels, separated by at least one week, with at least one&#xD;
             measurement that is 50% above the nadir reached after the last therapeutic maneuver&#xD;
             (as long as the measurement is 5 ng/ml or greater); and/or,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At least one new metastatic deposit on Tc-99 bone scintigraphy; and/or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        Progression of soft tissue metastases as measured by appropriate modalities (i.e., imaging,&#xD;
        palpation):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Development of new area of malignant disease (measurable or non-measurable);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Measurable disease progression by RECIST criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least 4 weeks off of flutamide and 6 weeks off of bicultamide and nilutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have not undergone surgical castration must continue treatment with an LHRH&#xD;
        agonist. If for some reason the LHRH agonist has been discontinued prior to entry on the&#xD;
        study, then it should be reinstituted and disease progression must be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a life expectancy of more than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a performance status of 0 to 2 according to the ECOG criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy, including&#xD;
        surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hematological eligibility parameters (within 2 weeks before starting therapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Granulocyte count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm(3)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm(3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Biochemical eligibility parameters (within 2 weeks before starting therapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. If the creatinine is greater than 1.5 mg/dl, a 24 hour urine collection must be&#xD;
             obtained, and measured creatinine clearance must be at least 40 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hepatic function: Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 1.0 mg/dl, AST and ALT less than 2.5&#xD;
             times upper limit of normal. If the alkaline phosphatase is greater than 2.5 times the&#xD;
             upper limit of normal, it must be fractionated and the hepatic alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
             should be less than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hormonal profile for patients with prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients who have not undergone surgical castration must have a serum testosterone&#xD;
        under 50 ng/ml and continue on their GnRh agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have other active malignancies (within the past two years with the&#xD;
        exception of non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the bladder).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of unstable or newly diagnosed angina pectoris, recent myocardial&#xD;
        infarction (within 6 months of enrollment), New York Heart Assoc. class II-IV congestive&#xD;
        heart failure are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be able to understand and sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be willing to travel from their home to the NIH for follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be able to ingest oral medications to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with brain metastases will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have received strontium or samarium will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy will be excluded&#xD;
        because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole, docetaxel or other&#xD;
        agents administered during the study. In fact, ketoconazole has been found to increase the&#xD;
        toxic effects of several protease inhibitors by affecting CYP3A4 activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients on theophylline will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are receiving cisapride will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are receiving HMG-CoA inhibitors (lovastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin,&#xD;
        pravastatin and cerivastatin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients currently taking known inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP3A4; patients taking known&#xD;
        substrates of CYP3A4 will be evaluated by the primary investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are receiving terfenadine, midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam, astemizole,&#xD;
        loratadine, rifampin, isoniazid, dofetilide, pimozide, sirolimus or erythromycin will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because gastric acidity is necessary for the dissolution and absorption of ketoconazole,&#xD;
        concomitant administration of drugs which decrease gastric acid output or increase gastric&#xD;
        pH (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, ranitidine, antimuscarinics, omeprazole, and lansoprazole)&#xD;
        may decrease absorption and thus will be prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients requiring warfarin will be excluded.&#xD;
