  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine blood cells of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&#xD;
      (PNH) after they receive a blood transfusion to determine if certain proteins (GPI-linked&#xD;
      proteins) in the transfused blood transfer to the patient's blood cells. GPI-linked proteins,&#xD;
      which are normally present on red cells and regulate red cell survival, are absent in&#xD;
      patients with PNH. Their lack is believed to account for the premature destruction of red&#xD;
      blood cells in these patients, resulting in a low hemoglobin and hematocrit. Patients may&#xD;
      experience fatigue, flank pain and other symptoms, requiring treatment with blood&#xD;
      transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PNH 18 years of age or older with group A1 blood who require at least three&#xD;
      units of red cells and who have not been transfused with group O blood within the last 3&#xD;
      months may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the NIH Clinical Center for the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview about the severity of their anemia-related symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood transfusion, if required. Patients will be transfused with compatible group O&#xD;
           blood. The donor blood will be washed (rinsed with a salt solution) until it is 99% free&#xD;
           of donor plasma. Group O blood is given instead of group A1 in order to be able to&#xD;
           distinguish the patient's cells from the transfused cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples of 3 teaspoons each will be drawn 1 day, 1 week, and 3 weeks after the&#xD;
      transfusion. These samples may be collected by the patient's doctor locally and sent to NIH&#xD;
      by mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is found that GPI-linked proteins transfer to the patient's cells, the study will also&#xD;
      examine how long the proteins remain attached and will assess whether the proteins are&#xD;
      functional and prevent cell destruction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a clonal bone marrow disorder, resulting from an&#xD;
      acquired, somatic X-linked mutation of the PIG-A gene in an hematopoietic stem cell. Absence&#xD;
      of PIG-A function in a cell prevents synthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)&#xD;
      moiety, which anchors many different types of proteins to the cell membrane. Intravascular&#xD;
      red cell destruction, the hallmark of the disorder, is caused by susceptibility of the&#xD;
      abnormal erythrocyte to complement-mediated lysis; this sensitivity is due to lack of CD59, a&#xD;
      potent inhibitor of the late components of complement and reactive lysis. In vitro studies&#xD;
      from this laboratory have demonstrated transfer of GPI-linked proteins, CD55 and CD59, from&#xD;
      normal to deficient cells and transfer is associated with resistance to hemolysis. Patients&#xD;
      with PNH frequently require transfusion as their standard care. In addition, patients with&#xD;
      all blood groups requiring transfusion will often receive compatible group O blood. Group O&#xD;
      blood is prevalent in blood bank inventories; and red cell survival after transfusion is&#xD;
      equal to that after transfusion of &quot;in group&quot; blood. The purpose of this study is to examine&#xD;
      protein transfer of GPI-linked proteins from transfused cells to deficient cells obtained&#xD;
      from patients with PNH. Patients with group A(1) blood will receive compatible group O blood&#xD;
      so that donor and recipient blood cells can be discriminated. Flow cytometric studies will be&#xD;
      performed subsequently to determine if transfer of GPI-linked protein to patients' cells has&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following must be met before the subject may be enrolled:&#xD;

        by their primary care physician; criteria for transfusion would include hemoglobin below&#xD;
        7.5 g/dl or symptoms related to anemia (impaired exercise tolerance, angina, shortness of&#xD;
        breath) that warrant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A PNH clone of greater than 40% and not have been transfused with group O blood for at&#xD;
        least three months previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eighteen years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Karnofsky performance status of 60% or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adequate organ function as defined by serum creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Able to comprehend and willing to sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any one of the following eliminates a subject from participating:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of uncontrolled infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known alloimmunization to red cell antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
