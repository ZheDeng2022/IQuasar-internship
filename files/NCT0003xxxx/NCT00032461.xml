      Primary Hypothesis: Gulf War veterans will have an equal prevalence or mean level of the&#xD;
      following medical and psychological conditions frequently reported in the literature compared&#xD;
      to a control group of nondeployed veterans: (1) chronic fatigue syndrome, (2) fibromyalgia,&#xD;
      (3) post-traumatic stress disorder, (4) neurologic abnormalities, including peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy and cognitive dysfunction, and (5) general health status.&#xD;

      * 1,000 Gulf War veterans, spouses, &amp; children and 1,000 non-deployed Gulf War era veterans,&#xD;
      spouses, &amp; children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Gulf War veterans will have an equal prevalence or mean level of the&#xD;
      following medical and psychological conditions frequently reported in the literature compared&#xD;
      to a control group of nondeployed veterans: (1) chronic fatigue syndrome, (2) fibromyalgia,&#xD;
      (3) post-traumatic stress disorder, (4) neurologic abnormalities, including peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy and cognitive dysfunction, and (5) general health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses: (1) Medical conditions that were reported as more frequent among Gulf&#xD;
      War veterans compared to nondeployed veterans in the self-reported data in Phase I will be of&#xD;
      equal prevalence in the two groups upon objective clinical examination. These include&#xD;
      arthritis, dermatitis, hypertension, bronchitis, and asthma. (2) The prevalence of the above&#xD;
      medical conditions in the primary hypotheses and secondary hypothesis (#1) will be equal&#xD;
      between the spouses of Gulf War veterans and those of nondeployed veterans. (3) The&#xD;
      prevalence of major birth defects found on a pediatric physical examination of veterans'&#xD;
      biologic children conceived after the war to Gulf War veterans and nondeployed veterans will&#xD;
      be equal; the prevalence of medical conditions in children living in the veterans' household,&#xD;
      whether conceived before or after the war, for Gulf War veterans and nondeployed veteran will&#xD;
      be equal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: This is an observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes variables: chronic fatigue syndrome; post-traumatic stress disorder,&#xD;
      fibromyalgia; peripheral neuropathy; cognitive dysfunction; and general health status:&#xD;
      physical component and mental component.&#xD;

      Study Abstract: In response to a legislative mandate, the VA initiated a survey entitled A&#xD;
      National Health Survey of Persian Gulf Veterans and Their Families. The survey was designed&#xD;
      as a retrospective cohort study in which the health of a population-based sample of 15,000&#xD;
      troops deployed into the Persian Gulf area was compared to those of 15,000 troops not&#xD;
      deployed in the Persian Gulf area. The survey was to be conducted in three phases. In Phase I&#xD;
      of the study, a structured health questionnaire was mailed to each of the 30,000 Persian Gulf&#xD;
      War-era veterans who were sampled for the survey. Up to four follow-up mailings were sent to&#xD;
      non-respondents to increase the response rate in a six-month period. In Phase II, telephone&#xD;
      interviews of a sample of 8,000 non-respondents and a review of selected medical records for&#xD;
      a sample of 4,000 veteran respondents were conducted. Through additional telephone interviews&#xD;
      with non-respondents, the potential for non-participant bias was evaluated. The medical&#xD;
      records review helped in assessing validity of selected self-reported health data (clinic&#xD;
      visit, hospitalization, pregnancy outcomes, birth defects among children, infant deaths,&#xD;
      etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol represents Phase III of the study--clinical examinations of a sample of&#xD;
      1,000 Gulf War (GW) veterans and their spouses and children and 1,000 Gulf War era&#xD;
      nondeployed veterans and their spouses and children. Results from Phase I indicated that the&#xD;
      prevalence of several self-reported health conditions are elevated in the GW veterans&#xD;
      compared to the control group. The overall purpose of the Phase III study is to corroborate&#xD;
      these findings through more objective clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample from a pool of Phase I and Phase II Persian Gulf War veterans and Persian Gulf era&#xD;
      nondeployed veterans were generated. Dr. Kang's office provided the 16 participating medical&#xD;
      centers with names and phone numbers of veterans to be contacted. Each medical center&#xD;
      examined an average of 125 veterans, 95 spouses, and 123 children over a period of 30 months.&#xD;
      The VA medical centers were strategically selected so that there was a VA medical center&#xD;
      within driving distance of the majority of the families sampled. Veterans were contacted&#xD;
      first by letter and then by telephone through the site closest to their home and invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Exams were scheduled for the veteran and spouse/children if they&#xD;
      were participating. Data from these exams were sent to the Hines CSPCC for cleaning and&#xD;
      analysis. Travel arrangements and expenses were provided for the participants and they were&#xD;
      reimbursed for their time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of Participants: Mean age for deployed veterans who were examined was 38.9&#xD;
      yrs. compared with 40.7 yrs. for non-deployed veterans who were examined (p&lt;.0001). Mean&#xD;
      income was $46,800 for deployed and $52,000 for non-deployed participants (p=.003).&#xD;
      Non-deployed participants were more likely to be white (81.0% vs. 76.4%, p=.03), to be&#xD;
      married (72.3% vs. 67.4%, p=.02), and to continue education past high school (42% vs. 32.5%,&#xD;
      p&lt;.0001). Results for Veterans: Both the physical and mental component scores derived from&#xD;
      the SF-36 were significantly lower among deployed veterans who were examined. For the&#xD;
      physical component score, the mean for the deployed group was 48.2 (s.d. 9.8) compared with&#xD;
      50.8 (s.d. 8.3) for the non-deployed group, p&lt;.0001. The mental component score averaged 49.6&#xD;
      (s.d. 10.2) for the deployed group and 53.7 (s.d. 7.9) for the non-deployed group, p&lt;.0001.&#xD;
      There was a weak trend for a higher prevalence of fibromyalgia in the deployed group (3.1%)&#xD;
      than in the non-deployed group (1.9%), [odds ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval (.94, 2.87),&#xD;
      p=.09]. There was a higher prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome among deployed (1.6%) than&#xD;
      non-deployed (0.4%), [odds ratio 4.58, 95% confidence interval (1.53, 13.64), p=.003]. Among&#xD;
      the seven cognitive dysfunction factors, there was a trend towards a higher prevalence of&#xD;
      impaired attention/working memory among deployed (6.6%) than non-deployed (4.2%), [odds ratio&#xD;
      1.60, 95% confidence interval (1.10, 2.35), p=.02]. PTSD after the Gulf War was more&#xD;
      prevalent among deployed (10.1%) than non-deployed participants (3.2%), [odds ratio 3.41, 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval (2.30, 5.05), p&lt;.0001]. No differences were found for peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy and 6 of the 7 factors defined to assess cognitive dysfunction. Among secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures, several categories of skin conditions were found to be more prevalent among&#xD;
      deployed veterans. Results for Spouses: The mean score for the mental component scale was&#xD;
      lower in the spouses of deployed participants (50.3 (s.d. 9.9)) than in the spouses of&#xD;
      non-deployed participants (52.6 (s.d. 8.6), p&lt;.0001). No other outcome measures for spouses&#xD;
      were found to be related to deployment status of the veteran. Birth Defects: No statistically&#xD;
      significant relationship between deployment status and prevalence of birth defects among&#xD;
      first live born offspring born after the Gulf War was found. Summary: Although participation&#xD;
      rates were lower than anticipated, we found little evidence of participation bias. Veterans&#xD;
      deployed to the Gulf War have higher rates of chronic fatigue syndrome and post-Gulf War&#xD;
      onset PTSD, and poorer health-related quality of life. Attention/working memory deficits and&#xD;
      fibromyalgia may also be related to deployment to the Gulf War. Additional Comments:&#xD;
      Additional analytic work remains: (a) the results have not been adjusted for covariates such&#xD;
      as age, (b) certain subgroups were oversampled and the results are not adjusted for the&#xD;
      study's original sampling methodology, (c) analysis of subgroups that are purported to be at&#xD;
      increased risk of health impacts due to their type of service in the Gulf War has not been&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
