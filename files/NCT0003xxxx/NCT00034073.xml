  <brief_summary>

      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine how blood flow to the brain&#xD;
      differs at different ages with the brain is at rest, and during performance of tasks that&#xD;
      involve language, memory, motor control, and sight. The study will evaluate the usefulness of&#xD;
      MRI in identifying language function and location, and may provide information on how the&#xD;
      brain develops over time to process brain functions, such as language and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers in three age groups-children 8-10, adolescents 13-16, and young&#xD;
      adults 21-30-may be eligible for this study. Participants must be right-handed and be native&#xD;
      English speakers. Candidates will be screened via a telephone interview and examination by a&#xD;
      neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo MRI scanning of the brain during rest or while performing a task&#xD;
      designed to test a skill. The tasks may involve remembering numbers, reading a word, tapping&#xD;
      fingers, or looking at a flashing picture. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to&#xD;
      produce pictures of the brain. For the procedure, the subject lies still on a table that is&#xD;
      moved into the scanner (a cylinder containing the magnet). Earplugs are worn to muffle loud&#xD;
      noises caused by electrical switching of radio frequency circuits used in the scanning&#xD;
      process. Adults may spend as long as 90 minutes in the scanner, usually less than 45 minutes.&#xD;
      For children, the time is less than 75 minutes-usually 30 to 40 minutes. Participants may be&#xD;
      asked to repeat the scans up to 5 times in different sessions to test different brain&#xD;
      functions or confirm findings.&#xD;

      FMRI using BOLD technique is an indirect and relative measure of neuronal activity and makes&#xD;
      comparison among age groups problematic in light of known age related changes in glucose&#xD;
      consumption and resting cerebral blood flow. In this study Arterial Spin Tagging techniques&#xD;
      will be used to perform quantitative measures of blood flow changes during fMRI tasks.&#xD;
      Children and adults will perform four tasks: primary sensory (photic flash), primary motor&#xD;
      (finger tapping), and cognitive (working memory and semantic decision) tasks using parametric&#xD;
      block designs, to account for developmental performance, using imaging parameters that allow&#xD;
      quantitative measures of cerebral blood flow response as well as BOLD signal. Three age&#xD;
      groups will be studied, children 8-10, 14-16, and young adults (21-28). Data will be analyzed&#xD;
      using AFNI to identify activated areas. Further analysis will be performed using a region of&#xD;
      interest analysis. We will compare quantitative measures at optimal performance levels. The&#xD;
      three experimental age groups will be compared for delta rCBF and extent of activated area&#xD;
      for each task. The study will determine age dependent changes in blood flow response during&#xD;
      cortical activation across ages.&#xD;
