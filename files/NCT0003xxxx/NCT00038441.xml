  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study of a new investigational treatment for cancer called&#xD;
      &quot;DTI-015&quot; to be given by intratumoral injection. Intratumoral injection is when drug is&#xD;
      injected directly into the tumor. This study will help doctors find out what is the best dose&#xD;
      level for DTI-015 and if this treatment can shrink tumors without causing severe side&#xD;
      effects. The effects of the drug on the patient's quality of life (how the patient feels and&#xD;
      what the patient can do) and their mental functions (reasoning and thinking abilities) will&#xD;
      also be studied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will involve 45 patients with malignant glioma brain tumors. Before the study, all&#xD;
      patients will be given a physical exam and blood and urine tests, and they will be asked&#xD;
      about their cancer and treatment. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain will&#xD;
      pinpoint the location of the tumor. Female patients who are able to have children will have a&#xD;
      pregnancy test. All patients will be asked about their quality of life and will undergo tests&#xD;
      of their mental functions. Patients might receive a steroid drug for several days before and&#xD;
      after the treatment. This will help prevent swelling around the tumor. Patients will also be&#xD;
      given a drug to prevent convulsions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTI-015 will be injected through a catheter (a hollow tube) into the center of the brain&#xD;
      tumor. For patients undergoing a needle biopsy, computer (&quot;stereotactic&quot;) guidance will be&#xD;
      used to place the catheter. For patients undergoing an open brain operation, the catheter&#xD;
      will be placed under the direct vision of the surgeon or with computer guidance. It is&#xD;
      possible that the injection might not be done in the brain operation patients because there&#xD;
      either is too much or too little tumor after the resection. The catheter will be removed&#xD;
      after the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive only one injection although one of the first three patients might&#xD;
      receive a second injection if the first injection volume was less than 25% of the tumor&#xD;
      volume. A second injection can also be given to those patients who were stable after the&#xD;
      first injection and develop a nodule of growth. If &gt;250 mg BCNU total was injected, any&#xD;
      repeat injection cannot be done for at least 6 weeks. The dose of DTI-015 will depend on the&#xD;
      size of the patient's tumor. The dose level will be increased after the first 3 patients and&#xD;
      again after the next 3 patients. After the treatment, the patient will remain in the hospital&#xD;
      for 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several tests will be repeated during the study. Patients will come to M.D. Anderson every&#xD;
      2-4 weeks for a total of 12 weeks. Blood tests will be done during each visit. An MRI scan of&#xD;
      the brain will be done every month for 3 months. The physical exam, quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire, and mental functions tests will be repeated 12 weeks after the treatment. Some&#xD;
      blood tests, however, may be done by a local doctor. The test results would then be sent to&#xD;
      the study coordinator. The follow-up visits will end after 12 weeks.&#xD;

          -  Histologic proof of recurrent previously irradiated supratentorial malignant gliomas&#xD;
             including anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic&#xD;
             oligodendroglioma, or anaplastic ependymoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It must be judged that gross total resection of the patient's tumor is not possible or&#xD;
