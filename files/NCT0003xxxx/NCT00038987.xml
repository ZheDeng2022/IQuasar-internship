      To define the safety of vaccination with APSV as determined by the reactogenicity of the&#xD;
      vaccine and the development of expected and un-expected adverse events associated with&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the proportion of individuals who respond to vaccination with a &quot;take&quot; (those who&#xD;
      form a visible lesion at the injection site) 6 to 8 days after the vaccination.&#xD;

      The study will be a four-center, randomized, dose finding trial to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy, and immunogenicity of Aventis Pasteur smallpox vaccine (APSV) in&#xD;
      healthy, vaccinia-naive adults. Four concentrations of APSV, derived from 2 lots of vaccine,&#xD;
      will be tested; ranging from 10 (exponent 6 pfu per ml) to 10 (exponent 7.5 pfu per ml). Four&#xD;
      concentrations of Dryvax (ranging from 10 exp 6 per ml to 10 exp 8 per ml) will be evaluated&#xD;
      as a positive control. This study is designed to assess the feasibility of the use of APSV&#xD;
      and dilutions of APSV in an emergency vaccination scenario. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      two phases. The initial phase will consist of a single-center, randomized, open-label study&#xD;
      in 45 subjects to evaluate the safety and approximate the take rate of undiluted APSV (two&#xD;
      lots APSV plus a Dryvax control arm: n=15 per arm). A 14 day post vaccination safety&#xD;
      follow-up will be completed for all subjects vaccinated in the initial phase prior to&#xD;
      initiation of the second phase of the study with an additional 285 subjects. All subjects&#xD;
      will be followed for 56 days post vaccination with a clinic visit at day 180 for stage 1&#xD;
      subjects and a follow-up phone call at day 180 for stage 2 subjects. The expansion phase of&#xD;
      the study will be conducted at three additional sites.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 18-32 (Volunteers over 32 years of age are not included since they usually are&#xD;
             not vaccinia-naive.) Children are excluded due to concerns of safety, including&#xD;
             autoinoculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptable medical history by screening evaluation form and brief assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative urine pregnancy test for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative history of smallpox vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative ELISA for HIV or negative Western blot for volunteers who have a positive&#xD;
             ELISA and have participated in an HIV vaccine trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability for follow-up for planned duration of the study (6 months). Note: Stage 1&#xD;
             - clinic visit at Day 180+/-15 days, Stage 2 - phone call at Day 180 +/- 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the volunteer is female, she agrees to use acceptable contraception and not become&#xD;
             pregnant for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal functions as defined as a serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, urine protein&#xD;
             &lt; 100 mg/dL or negative proteinuria, and a calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 55 mL/min&#xD;
             based on the following formulas: For males ((140 minus age in years) x weight in&#xD;
             kg)/72 x serum creatinine). For females: 0.85 x ((140 minus age in years) x weight in&#xD;
             kg)/72 x serum creatinine). Note: Renal function is measured to ensure subjects could&#xD;
             meet criteria for use of cidofovir if needed.&#xD;
