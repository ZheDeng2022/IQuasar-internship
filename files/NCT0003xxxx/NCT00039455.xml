    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or&#xD;
      deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or&#xD;
      die. Combining trastuzumab with flavopiridol may kill more tumor cells. Phase I trial to&#xD;
      study the effectiveness of combining trastuzumab with flavopiridol in treating patients who&#xD;
      have metastatic breast cancer&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of flavopiridol in combination with Herceptin in&#xD;
      HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose of flavopiridol necessary to achieve a target plasma level of&#xD;
      300-500 nM of flavopiridol in combination with a fixed dose of Herceptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the feasibility of measuring cyclin D1 in circulating tumor cells and tissue&#xD;
      biopsies before and after therapy as a surrogate marker of flavopiridol activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To monitor target activity of flavopiridol and Herceptin in plasma, circulating tumor&#xD;
      cells and tissue biopsies from breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of flavopiridol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 followed&#xD;
      by flavopiridol IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose is determined (MTD). The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional&#xD;
      cohort of 10 patients receives flavopiridol at the MTD and trastuzumab on the once weekly&#xD;
      schedule to assess the true toxicity rate. A second cohort of 10 patients receives&#xD;
      flavopiridol at the MTD and trastuzumab once every 21 days to assess the tolerability of this&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
