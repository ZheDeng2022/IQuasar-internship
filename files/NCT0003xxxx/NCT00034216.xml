    <textblock>
      This study will collect blood from patients with cancer to study the level of cells which&#xD;
      decrease the immune response (suppressor cells) before and after chemotherapy. Patients 18&#xD;
      years of age and older with cancer may participate. This study does not involve treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have about 50 ml (3 tablespoonfuls) of blood drawn. Depending on their&#xD;
      condition, patients may be invited to enroll in a clinical research study involving&#xD;
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery. Additional 40-ml blood samples may be drawn during&#xD;
      the course of treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlative studies performed on biospecimens of human subjects can be used to&#xD;
           investigate the biology of solid tumors, inform the development of new strategies for&#xD;
           treating those cancers, and evaluate these new therapeutic approaches. Specific areas of&#xD;
           interest include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the underlying mechanisms of tumor-specific immune response and suppression in cancer&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  genetic and molecular profiling of tumors through circulating tumor cell (cTC),&#xD;
           circulating DNA, and tissue analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  investigation of potential early diagnostic and prognostic indicators for solid tumors&#xD;
           such as cTCs and miRNA expression of serum exosomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identification of mechanisms of drug-related adverse events and correlation with&#xD;
           clinical parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the role of commensal gut microbiota in both the innate and adaptive responses to tumors&#xD;
           as well as with the use of anticancer agents&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze biospecimens such as tissue, urine, saliva, stool and blood components, which&#xD;
           include serum, leukocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and circulating&#xD;
           tumor cells (cTC), of human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate analysis results with clinical parameters such as demographics, toxicities,&#xD;
           and treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undertake genetic analysis of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic samples for advanced&#xD;
           mutational analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients and healthy volunteers whose biospecimens are of interest to NIH investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Subject cases will be evaluated by NCI or Interventional Radiology, NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
      personnel. Blood, tissue, urine, saliva or other samples may be collected at the initial&#xD;
      visit and at follow-up visits.&#xD;
