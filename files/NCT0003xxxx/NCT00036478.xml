  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to&#xD;
      detect damage to the mitochondria in HIV-infected patients taking nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients taking NRTI drugs may have an increase in a chemical in their blood&#xD;
      called lactate. High lactate levels may damage the energy source of the cell (mitochondria).&#xD;
      Damage to mitochondria may cause lactic acidosis, liver failure, and other problems. It is&#xD;
      important to find effective ways to see if the mitochondria of HIV-infected patients have&#xD;
      been damaged. This study will see if MRS can be used to determine mitochondrial damage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NRTI-related mitochondrial toxicity has been implicated in some fatal cases of lactic&#xD;
      acidosis and liver failure. In addition, some investigators believe NRTI-related&#xD;
      mitochondrial toxicity to be the culprit in the development of peripheral neuropathy and&#xD;
      lipodystrophy in HIV-infected patients. There is a need for a sensitive, reproducible, and&#xD;
      noninvasive marker of mitochondrial dysfunction. To date, the only available noninvasive&#xD;
      marker is lactate, but lactate testing is insensitive and the significance and&#xD;
      reproducibility of lactate levels in the HIV-infected population are questionable.&#xD;
      Spectroscopy promises to be a very useful alternative for the evaluation of the in vivo&#xD;
      effect of NRTIs on mitochondrial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the screening visit, HIV-infected participants must fast for at least 12 hours and&#xD;
      refrain from exercise for at least 24 hours. At the screening visit, all participants have&#xD;
      blood drawn for lactate measurements and tests for hepatitis B and C. HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      participants have an HIV test. Women who are able to become pregnant have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the entry visit, HIV-infected participants must fast for 12 hours and refrain from&#xD;
      exercise for 3 days. At the entry visit, all participants have blood drawn for lactate&#xD;
      measurements and women have repeat pregnancy tests. Participants have an MRS scan, which&#xD;
      takes approximately 60-80 minutes.&#xD;
