      Acne is a common inflammatory skin condition characterized by skin eruptions around hair&#xD;
      follicles. People with acne can have pustules (zits or pimples), papules, whiteheads or&#xD;
      blackheads, nodules, and redness of the skin. Acne usually involves the face and shoulders,&#xD;
      but can also involve the chest, arms, and legs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of an investigational gel containing active medication compared to&#xD;
      the same gel without any active medication (placebo or vehicle) in subjects with mild to&#xD;
      moderate facial acne.&#xD;
&#xD;

      HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#xD;
