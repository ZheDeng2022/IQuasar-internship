  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate which areas of the brain are primarily involved in and&#xD;
      responsible for tics in patients with Tourette's syndrome and chronic motor disorder.&#xD;
      Tourette's syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics and&#xD;
      is associated with behavioral and emotional disturbances, including symptoms of attention&#xD;
      deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Chronic motor disorder has&#xD;
      the same characteristics as Tourette's syndrome, except that patients do not have vocal tics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with Tourette's syndrome or chronic motor tic disorder&#xD;
      between 18 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened&#xD;
      with a medical history and physical and neurological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to study tics under&#xD;
      three conditions- spontaneous tics, suppression of tics, and sleep-to determine which areas&#xD;
      of the brain are responsible for generation of tics. For this procedure, the subject is&#xD;
      injected with H215O, a radioactive substance similar to water. A special camera detects the&#xD;
      radiation emitted by the H215O, allowing measurement of brain blood flow. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive up to 20 injections of H215O during the scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked not to sleep the entire night before the test. Before the scan,&#xD;
      both patients and volunteers will have EEG electrodes placed on their heads to record the&#xD;
      electrical activity of their brains. Patients will also have EMG electrodes placed in areas&#xD;
      of the body where tics occur. A small catheter (plastic tube) will be placed in an arm vein&#xD;
      for injecting the radioactive tracers, and a mask will be placed on the face to help keep the&#xD;
      head still during scanning. The mask has large openings for eyes, nose and mouth, so that it&#xD;
      does not interfere with talking or breathing. The entire test takes about 4 hours. During&#xD;
      this time, the subject will sleep for 1.5 hours either at the beginning or end of the scan.&#xD;
      For the other 2.5 hours, scans will be done every 10 minutes for 1 minute under the different&#xD;
      conditions of tic suppression or release of tics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a separate day, participants will also undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a&#xD;
      diagnostic test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the brain.&#xD;
      For this procedure, the subject lies still on a stretcher that is moved into the scanner (a&#xD;
      narrow cylinder containing the magnet). ...&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the areas of the brain responsible for tics in&#xD;
      patients with Tourette's syndrome and chronic motor tic disorder using [15O]H2O. Previous&#xD;
      neuroimaging studies have looked at brain activity during tics using functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET), but a major drawback of&#xD;
      these studies lay in the difficulty distinguishing between the activity in the brain&#xD;
      responsible for tic generation versus activity in motor-related structures due to tic&#xD;
      movements. We plan to overcome this difficulty in our paradigm using two rest conditions&#xD;
      without any movement. One is a state when patients suppress their tics and the second is&#xD;
      sleep state, when tics usually cease or are at least very infrequent. 23 adult patients with&#xD;
      a DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 2000) diagnosis of a tic disorder and frequent&#xD;
      tics will be studied. These two rest states will be compared with a condition where tics are&#xD;
      allowed to occur spontaneously. The differential activation of brain areas between these&#xD;
      three conditions should help to elucidate/define the regions of the brain responsible for&#xD;
      generation of tics.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will have clinically documented Tourette's syndrome or chronic motor tic disorder&#xD;
        as defined by DSM-IV-TR and evaluation of tic severity using the Yale Tic Scale. This&#xD;
        criterion will be established by preliminary screening in the NINDS Movement Disorders&#xD;
        Outpatient Clinic. Regarding co-morbid disorders such as ADHD and OCD, we will accept a&#xD;
        mild degree of ADHD and mild to moderate degree of OCD. These disorders will be established&#xD;
        by a psychiatrist using below listed scales and criteria. In order to participate in this&#xD;
        study, patients will be asked to stop any medication that can influence the central nervous&#xD;
        system for 2 weeks prior to exam. Patients taking fluoxetine will be asked to stop it 4&#xD;
        weeks prior to the exam. Stopping the medications for Tourette syndrome or tics, OCD and&#xD;
        ADHD may lead to worsening of their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any changes to patients' medication must first be discussed with their doctor and only this&#xD;
        doctor will be responsible for tapering the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be asked to abstain from alcohol for one week before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be in age ranges 18 to 65. Patients may be male or female. Female patients of&#xD;
        child-bearing potential will have a pregnancy test and specific interview prior to the&#xD;
        study to ensure that pregnant patients will not participate in the study. Patients will be&#xD;
        asked to stop any medication that can influence central nervous system (CNS) for one week&#xD;
        prior to exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Twenty three normal controls will be included; controls will be screened in the NINDS&#xD;
        Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic, and will have neurological and physical examination.&#xD;
        Controls with chronic illnesses, taking any medication that affects the CNS will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients younger than 18 or older than 65 years old will be excluded from the study. We are&#xD;
        excluding patients older than 65 years because of possibility of age-related neurological&#xD;
        disorders such as stroke and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with MRI findings consistent with brain tumors, strokes, trauma or AVMs will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with progressive neurological disorders other than TS or chronic motor tic&#xD;
        disorder and significant other pathology will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of significant medical disorders, or requiring chronic treatment&#xD;
        with other drugs, which cannot be stopped, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with cancer will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients not capable of giving an informed consent will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are pregnant will be excluded.&#xD;
