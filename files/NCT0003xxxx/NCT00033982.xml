  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of posaconazole for treating invasive&#xD;
      fungal infections. New therapies for these infections are needed for patients who do not&#xD;
      respond, to or cannot tolerate, standard treatment. These patients include those with immune&#xD;
      defects who have significant side effects from treatment with amphotericin or other&#xD;
      antifungals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 13 years of age or older who are on other primary NIH protocols with an invasive&#xD;
      fungal infection 1) that does not respond to standard antifungal therapies; 2) for which&#xD;
      there is no effective therapy; 3) who develop serious side effects from their current&#xD;
      treatment; or 4) who have organ dysfunction that does not permit use of standard antifungal&#xD;
      treatments may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical&#xD;
      history, including a review of current and previous antifungal treatments, pregnancy test for&#xD;
      women of childbearing potential, electrocardiogram (EKG), and detailed neurologic&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take either 200 mg (1 teaspoonful) of liquid posaconazole by mouth four&#xD;
      times a day or 400 mg (two teaspoonfuls) twice a day for a period of 28 days to 24 months.&#xD;
      (The physician will determine the duration of treatment.) Patients will have monthly&#xD;
      follow-up visits during the treatment period and 1 month after treatment is completed for the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed neurologic exam every 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests every month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EKG every month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies, including chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging (MRI) radionuclide scanning or ultrasound, every month until the infection has&#xD;
           been stable for three determinations. Thereafter, imaging studies will be done every 3&#xD;
           months as long as the infection remains stable or improves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the last day of the study treatment period, participants will have a detailed neurologic&#xD;
      exam and review of medications and medical complaints since their last visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We seek to use the experimental triazole antifungal, Posaconazole, in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with invasive fungal infections that are resistant or refractory to the best&#xD;
      available treatment, or who are unable to tolerate the best available treatment. We have&#xD;
      observed significant short and long term toxicities from amphotericin and its various&#xD;
      preparations in our patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and Hyper IgE recurrent&#xD;
      infection syndrome (HIE or Job's). We now have now had 5 CGD patients on dialysis, and&#xD;
      several more have progressive renal failure, all thought due to high dose, prolonged&#xD;
      amphotericin. In addition, many of our more severely affected CGD patients have had multiple&#xD;
      thoracic surgeries, leading to reduced lung capacity. Several of our HIE patients have&#xD;
      persistent fungal lung infections that have not cleared with extensive therapy with&#xD;
      amphotericin and/or other new triazole antifungals. Therefore, agents of high tolerability&#xD;
      and high potency are still desperately needed. Posaconazole has a broad spectrum of action&#xD;
      against a large number of molds and fungi at easily achievable concentrations in plasma. It&#xD;
      has a favorable toxicity profile and has performed well in clinical trials to date. This drug&#xD;
      will be administered orally twice daily. Close monitoring of tolerance, toxicity, and&#xD;
      efficacy will be performed. We anticipate enrollment of up to 50 patients over the next 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        As set out in the company protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects must have a proven or probable fungal infection that is resistant to standard&#xD;
        therapy, or to which therapy the patient is significantly intolerant. (Intolerance must&#xD;
        include signs of intolerance such as fever, rigors, laboratory, abnormalities, as well as&#xD;
        subjective symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only subjects age 2 years and older will be eligible at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pediatric Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children age 2 and over are eligible. Children under 2 years are not currently eligible&#xD;
        because of lack of any data on dose and tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
