      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 1980s and 1990s, genetic research in cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as&#xD;
      other common chronic diseases, has been dominated by single gene linkage and association&#xD;
      studies focused on understanding of the genetics of prevalent disease. Rarely have there been&#xD;
      studies of the longitudinal predictive value of these genetic variations. Furthermore, few&#xD;
      studies have attempted to address the complex and high-dimensional genetic reality that&#xD;
      underlies an individual's risk of disease. A crucial next step in CVD genetic research is the&#xD;
      evaluation of the contribution of variations in many genes simultaneously, and their&#xD;
      interactions with traditional risk factors, to the longitudinal prediction of CVD in&#xD;
      individuals and families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses participants from the Rochester Family Heart Study (RFHS) which provides one&#xD;
      of the richest genetic epidemiological resources for this type of study. The RFHS represents&#xD;
      3941 individuals distributed among 552 three- generation pedigrees ascertained without regard&#xD;
      to health status during two phases of collection. Phase I was from 1984 - 1988 and Phase II&#xD;
      was from 1988 - 1991. These participants have extensive demographic, physiological, genetic,&#xD;
      and clinical information measured at baseline. This study builds upon this already&#xD;
      established resource by conducting a longitudinal follow-up of the RFHS participants to&#xD;
      address two central questions: 1) Do measured genetic variations in known susceptibility&#xD;
      genes provide additional predictive information about risk of future CVD outcomes beyond the&#xD;
      information provided by more traditional risk factors? and 2) Do these measured genetic&#xD;
      variations explain patterns of disease aggregation in families and can these patterns be used&#xD;
      to predict disease in future generations?&#xD;
