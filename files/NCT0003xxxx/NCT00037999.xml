  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to determine the safety and efficacy of testosterone&#xD;
      supplementation as an adjunct to traditional rehabilitation therapy in the care of&#xD;
      deconditioned older men. Our long range goal is to determine whether other hormones (e.g.,&#xD;
      combined testosterone and growth hormone) are helpful as an adjunct to traditional&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is important to the VA health care system because 38% of American veterans are&#xD;
      aged (age &gt; 65 years), bioavailable testosterone is diminished in older age men, low&#xD;
      testosterone is associated with impaired muscle strength, and lack of muscle strength hinders&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Older men who are not successfully rehabilitated often get admitted to&#xD;
      nursing homes for long term care, at a cost of approximately $40,000/year. Payment for long&#xD;
      term care is currently one of our most difficult health care problems. If testosterone&#xD;
      supplementation improves rehabilitation outcomes, as our pilot data suggest it will, patients&#xD;
      will be more satisfied and long-term care financial resources will be saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      supplementation with testosterone improves rehabilitation outcomes in deconditioned older&#xD;
      men. Specifically, we will screen all hospitalized older men with delayed discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital (&gt; 7 day hospital stay). Men who have at least one new impairment in their ability&#xD;
      to perform activities of daily living (e.g., inability to walk), low serum testosterone&#xD;
      concentration, and no contraindications (e.g., prostate or breast cancer) will be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to participate. Study participants will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      testosterone (5 mg transdermally each night) or placebo (matching transdermal patch) daily in&#xD;
      a double-blind fashion for the duration of their hospital course (expected average duration&#xD;
      of study is 29 days). Subjects will then receive their rehabilitation as usual, with all&#xD;
      members of the health care team blinded as to whether the subject is receiving testosterone&#xD;
      or placebo. At baseline, weekly, at discharge, and at 6 and 12 months after discharge,&#xD;
      subjects will be assessed using validated measures (i.e., Functional Independence Measure -&#xD;
      FIM). Our hypothesis is that testosterone supplementation, as an adjunct to traditional&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy, will improve rehabilitation outcomes.&#xD;

      Our overall goal is to determine the safety and efficacy of testosterone supplementation as&#xD;
      an adjunct to traditional rehabilitation therapy on health outcomes in deconditioned older&#xD;
      men. Specifically, we will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that supplementation with testosterone improves rehabilitation outcomes in&#xD;
      deconditioned older men. We will use objective validated measures (i.e., FIM, muscle&#xD;
      strength) to assess health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will begin enrolling subjects within three months of receipt of funding, and study 60&#xD;
      subjects (30 in each group) within 24 months. All subjects will undergo follow-up evaluation&#xD;
      6 and 12 months after completion of inpatient rehabilitation and cessation of testosterone&#xD;
      supplementation. Therefore, this project will be completed within 3 years. Our short term&#xD;
      goal (within 3 years) is to delineate the safety and efficacy of testosterone supplementation&#xD;
      on rehabilitation outcomes in deconditioned older men. Our long range goal is to determine&#xD;
      whether other hormones (e.g., combined testosterone and growth hormone) are helpful as an&#xD;
      adjunct to traditional rehabilitation therapy in the care of older men&#xD;
