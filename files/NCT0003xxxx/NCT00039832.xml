    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two types of blood thinners,&#xD;
      abciximab (ReoPro) and reteplase (Retavase) for restoring normal brain blood flow after&#xD;
      ischemic stroke (stroke resulting from a blood clot in the brain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat ischemic stroke is the&#xD;
      clot buster drug rt-PA. This treatment, however, is effective only if begun within 3 hours of&#xD;
      onset of the stroke and most patients do not get to the hospital early enough to benefit from&#xD;
      it. There is thus a pressing need to develop effective stroke treatments that can be&#xD;
      initiated more than 3 hours after onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 18 and 80 years of age who have experienced a mild or moderate acute stroke&#xD;
      between 3 and 24 hours before starting study drugs may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      will be screened with a physical examination, blood tests and a magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) scan (if an MRI was not done during the stroke evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive ReoPro. Some will also receive Retavase, which may boost the&#xD;
      effectiveness of ReoPro. Retavase is administered in a single dose through a needle in the&#xD;
      vein over 2 minutes. ReoPro is infused into the vein over 12 hours. Patients will be&#xD;
      monitored with physical examinations, blood tests, computed tomography (CT) scans, and three&#xD;
      or four MRI scans of the brain to evaluate both the response to treatment and side effects of&#xD;
      the drugs. An MRI scan will be done 24 hours, 5 days and 30 days after starting the study&#xD;
      medication, and possibly during screening for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT involves the use of specialized x-rays to obtain images of the brain. The patient lies&#xD;
      still in the scanner for a short time while the X-ray images are formed. MRI uses a strong&#xD;
      magnetic field and radio waves to demonstrate structural and chemical changes in tissue. MRI&#xD;
      is more sensitive than x-ray in evaluating acute stroke. The patient lies on a table in a&#xD;
      metal cylinder (the scanner) while the pictures are being taken. During part of the MRI, a&#xD;
      medicine called gadolinium contrast is injected in a vein. This medicine brightens the&#xD;
      images, creating better pictures of the blood flow.&#xD;

      Objectives: This is a clinical trial to determine an acceptable dose of reteplase in&#xD;
      combination with a fixed dose of abciximab for ischemic stroke 3-24 hours from onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients will be selected by criteria to minimize likelihood of toxicity&#xD;
      and maximize likelihood of response. These criteria include age 18-80 years old, acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke of moderate severity (NIH Stroke Scale less than or equal to 16 and lesion&#xD;
      volume on diffusion MRI less than approximately one third of the volume of the middle&#xD;
      cerebral artery territory), positive MRI evidence of hypoperfusion corresponding to the acute&#xD;
      stroke symptoms, no MRI evidence of chronic micro-hemorrhages, and no other clinical,&#xD;
      radiological or laboratory features associated with risk of hemorrhage with thrombolytic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study is open-label, dose escalation, safety and proof of principle study of the&#xD;
      combination of intravenous abciximab and reteplase. A fixed dose of abciximab will be used in&#xD;
      all patients: 0.25 mg/kg bolus (to a maximum of 30 mg) followed by a 0.125&#xD;
      microgram/kg/minute infusion (to a maximum of 10.0 microgram/minute) for 12 hours. The five&#xD;
      dosing groups for the reteplase dose are 0 U, 2.5 U, 5.0 U, 7.5 U, and 10.0 U. A maximum of&#xD;
      72 patients will be treated using an adaptive statistical design, in which data on both the&#xD;
      response and toxicity will be used to determine the dose for subsequent patients, thereby&#xD;
      minimizing exposure to either ineffective or toxic doses. Non-investigational patient&#xD;
      management will be standardized across all patients according to the NIH Stroke Center&#xD;
      Clinical Care Pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary efficacy endpoint for response will be reperfusion by MRI 24&#xD;
      hours after start of therapy. The primary safety endpoint for determination of toxicity will&#xD;
      be any one of the following: symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), major systemic&#xD;
      hemorrhage, or other serious adverse event related to study drug administration, including&#xD;
      death, within 48 hours from start of therapy. The maximum acceptable rate of toxicity will be&#xD;
      10% of patients treated at any dose level and the minimum acceptable rate of response will be&#xD;
      50% of patients treated at any dose level. The outcomes will be monitored by a Data and&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Committee, which will have the authority to stop or recommend modifications&#xD;
      of the trial for safety concerns. Other clinical outcome variables and imaging variables will&#xD;
      be recorded and analyzed in secondary and exploratory analyses. If an acceptable dose is&#xD;
      identified, then that will be investigated in a subsequent randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be enrolled in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with onset between 3 and 24 hours prior to planned&#xD;
             start of study drugs. Acute ischemic stroke is defined as a measurable neurological&#xD;
             deficit of sudden onset, presumed secondary to focal cerebral ischemia, and not&#xD;
             otherwise attributable to ICH or another disease process. Stroke onset will be defined&#xD;
             as the time the patient was last known to be without the new clinical deficit.&#xD;
             Patients whose deficits have worsened in the last 24 hours are not eligible if their&#xD;
             first symptoms started more than 24 hours before. If the stroke started during sleep,&#xD;
             stroke onset will be recorded as the time the patient was last known to be intact. A&#xD;
             careful history is important to determine when the patient was last without the&#xD;
             presenting deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Disabling neurological deficit attributable to the acute stroke at the start of study&#xD;
             drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. NIHSS less than or equal to 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence on PWI MRI of a perfusion defect corresponding to the acute stroke syndrome&#xD;
             of at least 2cm in diameter in both long and short axis in any slice. The PWI will be&#xD;
             assessed by relative mean transit time (MTT) images. The MRI evaluation must involve&#xD;
             echo planar diffusion weighted imaging, MRA, and MRI perfusion. A normal appearing MRA&#xD;
             with an appropriate perfusion defect is eligible. An apparent stenosis or occlusion on&#xD;
             MRA with normal appearing perfusion distally will not be eligible. Poor quality or&#xD;
             uninterpretable MRA will not make patient ineligible. Patients who have a normal DWI&#xD;
             are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age 18 - 80 years, inclusive.&#xD;

             therapeutic trial, prior to the final assessment in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Time interval since stroke onset of less than 24 hours impossible to determine with&#xD;
             high degree of confidence.&#xD;

             hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of acute myocardial infarction defined as having at least two of the&#xD;
             following three features: 1.) Chest pain suggestive of cardiac ischemia; 2.) EKG&#xD;
             findings of ST elevation of greater than 0.2 mV in 2 contiguous leads, new onset left&#xD;
             bundle branch block, ST segment depression, or T-wave inversion; 3.) Elevated troponin&#xD;
             I&#xD;
