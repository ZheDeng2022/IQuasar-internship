      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Many risk factors for breast cancer have been identified, including family history,&#xD;
           endocrine background, changes in breast tissue, cancer in one breast, radiation&#xD;
           exposure, obesity and others. There is a spectrum of tissue changes seen in cancerous&#xD;
           and pre-cancerous breast tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cell line is a collection of cells that are grown in the laboratory from an original&#xD;
           tissue specimen. Cell lines developed from high-risk breast tissue allow researchers to&#xD;
           perform metabolic and molecular studies of breast cells over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To establish a repository (facility in which tissue samples can be preserved and&#xD;
      stored for many years) of cell lines from high-risk breast tissue to allow researchers to&#xD;
      learn more about changes in breast cells that may cause them to develop into breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Women between 20 and 80 years of age who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have an increased risk of breast cancer because they are members of a high-risk breast&#xD;
           or ovarian cancer family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have had breast cancer in one or both breasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have had radiation for lymphoma before the age of 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a mutation in a breast cancer susceptibility gene, but whose family history is not&#xD;
           known.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are not at increased risk of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small piece of breast tissue will be obtained from about 10 women without an&#xD;
           identified risk of breast cancer and up to 100 women at high risk of developing breast&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cell lines will be developed from each high-risk category.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cell lines and tissues will be used to establish a repository of high-risk breast&#xD;
           cell lines and breast tissues that can be used to study how the cells develop into&#xD;
           breast cancer.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCI Surgery Branch&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple risk factors for breast cancer have been identified, including family history,&#xD;
      endocrine background, histologic changes in breast tissue, cancer in one breast, radiation&#xD;
      exposure, obesity, and others. The histologic phenotypes of breast carcinogenesis include a&#xD;
      spectrum of changes, beginning with normal appearing breast epithelium, progressing to&#xD;
      hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia, in situ carcinoma, and finally invasive carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our present knowledge of high risk breast tissue is based on the study of a variety of&#xD;
      cellular sample types, which include fine needle aspirates, nipple aspirate fluid, core&#xD;
      needle biopsies, and breast tissue from mastectomy or segmentectomy specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valid preclinical models are needed which utilize homogenous human cellular material which&#xD;
      can be studied over time in large quantities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A model which may be ideally suited to the metabolic and molecular studies of breast&#xD;
      epithelial cells is an in vitro cell line model developed from high risk breast tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study normal breast tissue will be acquired from each of the high risk sites for&#xD;
      breast cancer in the breast. These tissues will be used to develop breast epithelial cell&#xD;
      lines for in vitro studies, and to establish a high risk cell line and tissue repository.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To acquire normal breast tissue from each of the high risk sites for breast cancer in the&#xD;
      breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop breast epithelial cell lines from the normal high risk breast tissue from each of&#xD;
      the major high risk sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish a repository of high risk breast epithelial cell lines and high risk normal&#xD;
      breast tissue which can be used as a resource for pilot studies at NIH and other&#xD;
      participating centers to characterize high risk breast epithelial cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women age 20 - 80 years who have an increased risk of breast cancer because they are members&#xD;
      of a high risk breast or ovarian cancer family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with a history of ipselateral breast cancer, either invasive or in situ, and a normal&#xD;
      contralateral breast by mammography (within the past 12 months) and a normal physical&#xD;
      examination of the contralateral breast and adjacent lymph node bearing areas, or be&#xD;
      undergoing prophylactic mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women without breast cancer but with a Gail model estimate of 5-year risk of breast cancer of&#xD;
      1.67 percent or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with bilateral breast cancer (invasive or in situ) who have not received whole breast&#xD;
      irradiation to both breasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with a previous history of mediastinal irradiation for lymphoma before the age of 30&#xD;
      and who are now greater than 5 years since completing radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal women not at increased risk of breast cancer (Gail model Index of less than 1.50&#xD;
      percent) and without abnormal findings in the breast by physical examination and mammography&#xD;
      to serve as normal control tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with a mutation in a breast cancer susceptibility gene, but whose family history is not&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absence of significant cardiac, hepatic or renal disease, which, in the opinion of the PI, is&#xD;
      likely to cause metabolic changes in the breast tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tissue acquisition in which Normal breast tissue will be collected from women at high risk&#xD;
      of breast cancer at NIH and at other institutions as well. Centers collecting tissue for this&#xD;
      protocol must have IRB approval for this study and an IRB approved Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All breast tissue will be obtained from surgical specimens acquired as part of planned&#xD;
      surgical procedures. Short-term cell lines will be developed from this tissue and confirmed&#xD;
      cytologically and by expression of cytokeratins. Multiple cell lines from each of the high&#xD;
      risk categories will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These cell lines and the respective tissues will be used to establish a repository of high&#xD;
      risk breast epithelial cell lines and high risk breast tissues which can be used to further&#xD;
      define the carinogenic pathway for breast cancer. Early passages of these cell cultures and&#xD;
      the respective normal breast tissue will be stored for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients will be enrolled over a period of 5 years.&#xD;
