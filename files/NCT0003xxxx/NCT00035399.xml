      This study will examine the efficacy of acupuncture in combination with exercise physical&#xD;
      therapy for moderate osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.&#xD;

      Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese technique of using a fine needle to stimulate points along&#xD;
      theoretical meridians of energy to correct imbalances thought to be responsible for specific&#xD;
      disease states. In the United States, acupuncture is often used for the treatment of painful&#xD;
      conditions. The 1997 NIH Consensus Conference concluded that there was adequate evidence of&#xD;
      efficacy in an acute dental pain model and in nausea. In chronic pain, most studies were too&#xD;
      small, poorly designed, poorly executed, or improperly controlled to adequately demonstrate&#xD;
      that needle acupuncture worked better than sham acupuncture, placebo, standard medical&#xD;
      therapy, or even no treatment. Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee has been proposed as a good&#xD;
      model to test the efficacy of acupuncture in a chronic pain condition because it is an&#xD;
      extremely common, well defined, and disabling condition with well established outcome&#xD;
      measures for symptoms and functional status. There is clinical trial evidence of efficacy for&#xD;
      the standard treatments of acetaminophen and NSAIDs, and exercise physical therapy (EPT),&#xD;
      which is usually added when the patient develops functional limitations. One high quality&#xD;
      study of acupuncture for knee OA, demonstrated moderate benefit in an unblinded comparison to&#xD;
      a usual care control group. As such, a major question remains about whether acupuncture, used&#xD;
      in addition to exercise therapy, will provide a clinically meaningful improvement in pain and&#xD;
      function. Since pain can be the primary limiting factor in improved exercise capacity, if&#xD;
      acupuncture has any efficacy in reducing the pain of knee OA, then the combination with an&#xD;
      EPT program should be substantially more effective than EPT alone. Another major concern is&#xD;
      that the effect of the acupuncture may be predominantly mediated by non- specific placebo&#xD;
      effects rather than the specific effects of the placement of a needle. Another important&#xD;
      component of this proposal is our use of a validated blinded placebo needle instead of sham&#xD;
      acupuncture points. Therefore, the primary goal of this proposal is to use a properly&#xD;
      designed randomized blinded clinical trial, using American College of Rheumatology (ACR)&#xD;
      criteria and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended outcome measures, to determine&#xD;
      whether the addition of acupuncture to standard EPT provides an overall clinically important&#xD;
      benefit to patients with symptomatic knee OA compared to placebo acupuncture. As a secondary&#xD;
      goal, we will use the clinical trial data to develop prognostic and etiologic models for the&#xD;
      patients that are most likely to respond to acupuncture. If a clinically important benefit&#xD;
      for acupuncture is found, a broader application of this technique would be justified.&#xD;
      However, if the results are negative, then the addition of acupuncture to EPT should be&#xD;
      generally curtailed.&#xD;
