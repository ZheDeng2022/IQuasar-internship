  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of galantamine in patients with&#xD;
      dementia secondary to blood vessel disease in the brain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a previous 6-month study in patients with both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's dementia,&#xD;
      galantamine demonstrated positive results on thinking, functioning, behavior, speech and&#xD;
      overall well being of patients, and prevented the behavior symptoms of dementia from&#xD;
      appearing. This combined study consists of two almost identical 26-week studies that examine&#xD;
      the same criteria as the previous study, but in a larger patient population (dementia has&#xD;
      been identified as having been caused by blood vessel disease without Alzheimer's disease).&#xD;
      The study starts with a 4-week period in which current medications for dementia are withdrawn&#xD;
      followed by a 26-week double-blind treatment period when patients will receive either placebo&#xD;
      or galantamine 8 milligrams or 12 milligrams twice a day. Effectiveness will be measured by&#xD;
      changes in scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale, Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease Cooperative Study Scale, the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus,&#xD;
      and the neuropsychiatric inventory, as well as (in English-speaking countries only) a&#xD;
      10-minute interview of the patient (EXIT-25 scale). Safety will be evaluated throughout the&#xD;
      study based on the incidence and severity of unexpected events, laboratory and physical&#xD;
      tests, and vital signs. The hypothesis of the study is that galantamine will improve&#xD;
      thinking, function, behavior, speech, and overall well being, better than placebo. A&#xD;
      voluntary pharmacogenomic study will be incorporated into the study plan to evaluate whether&#xD;
      specific genes are related to the dementia or drug response. 8 milligrams (mg) 2 times a day&#xD;
      for 8 weeks, then increasing to12 mg, if tolerated. After 12 weeks dose can be reduced to 8&#xD;
      mg or matching placebo&#xD;
