  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two phases. Phase 1 will examine the role of inflammatory mediators called&#xD;
      cytokines on growth hormone levels in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Phase 2 will&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of etanercept on these growth hormone levels. Etanercept is approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of RA. It lowers the levels of a key inflammatory mediator called tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alpha and is very effective in reducing arthritis symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth hormone promotes bone and muscle growth. With aging, people lose muscle mass and bone&#xD;
      strength, possibly because of decreased levels of growth hormone. People with RA have bone&#xD;
      and muscle changes similar to those in older people, perhaps also due to decreased levels of&#xD;
      growth hormone. The first part of this study will see if the inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      responsible for joint inflammation (warmth, redness, pain, and swelling) in RA are related to&#xD;
      the lowered growth hormone levels in this disease. The second part will evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of etanercept treatment on muscle mass and bone density, in addition to growth hormone&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premenopausal women between 18 and 55 years of age with a recent diagnosis of rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis (less than 3 years) are eligible for this study. Healthy volunteers will also be&#xD;
      enrolled in the first phase of the study as control subjects. This study is conducted at two&#xD;
      sites, the NIH and the Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers enrolled in this study will be interviewed about their health status and&#xD;
      will fill out questionnaires on diet and general physical function, including fatigue, energy&#xD;
      and well being. In addition, they will be hospitalized once at the NIH Clinical Center for&#xD;
      24-hour blood sampling and will visit to Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore for a&#xD;
      brachial artery reactivity study, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour blood sampling for growth hormone levels. Blood samples (1/2 teaspoon each) will&#xD;
           be collected every 20 minutes from 8 AM one day until 8 AM the following day through a&#xD;
           plastic tube in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan on a small area of the spine, hip and wrist&#xD;
           to assess bone density and a total body DEXA scan to assess the amount and distribution&#xD;
           of muscle and body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood vessel (brachial artery reactivity) study to measure the ability of the brachial&#xD;
           artery to dilate and increase its blood flow. For this procedure, the subject lies on a&#xD;
           table with electrocardiogram leads attached to the chest. A blood pressure cuff is&#xD;
           inflated for several minutes and a drop of nasal spray of nitroglycerin is given that&#xD;
           may cause a headache. Blood pressure and headache are monitored and treated as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis will be seen at the NIH clinic on six separate visits&#xD;
      (weeks 0, 1, 6, 12, 18, and 26) over 26 weeks. Week 0 is a screening visit. At weeks 1 and&#xD;
      26, patients will be admitted to the hospital for 24-hour blood sampling, DEXA scans, and&#xD;
      brachial artery reactivity tests, as described above, plus X-rays of the hand and feet. After&#xD;
      the first visit, they will start taking etanercept, given by self-injection under the skin&#xD;
      (like insulin shots) twice a week. Follow-up visits at weeks 6, 12, and 18 will involve&#xD;
      evaluations of disease activity and drug side effects through joint examination, blood tests,&#xD;
      and questionnaires.&#xD;

      This is a study in pre-menopausal and perimenopausal women with onset of rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (RA) of less than 10 years duration, to be conducted at the Clinical Center of National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health and The General Clinical Research Center of the Johns Hopkins Bayview&#xD;
      Medical Center, Baltimore, MD. This investigation will explore the possible impact of&#xD;
      systemically released inflammatory cytokines on suppression of the GH/IGF-1 axis, and the&#xD;
      relationships of altered endocrine-immune function with body composition, endocrine,&#xD;
      metabolic and vascular functions thought to be associated with RA-related sarcopenia,&#xD;
      osteopenia and increased cardiovascular risk. In phase I of the study, we shall admit RA&#xD;
      patients and control subjects to the Clinical Center for a 26-36 hour period for assessments&#xD;
      of the GH/IGF-I axis, cytokines, body composition, endocrine-metabolic and cardiovascular&#xD;
      functions, and quality of life. We plan to initiate Phase I of the study to compare baseline&#xD;
      endocrine and inflammatory parameters in RA patients to matched normal controls. Phase II of&#xD;
      the study, we shall enroll a new group of RA patients to evaluate the above outcome measures&#xD;
      at baseline and after six months of treatment with standard therapy, using the soluble p75&#xD;
      TNF receptor molecule etanercept, that has recently been approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with early RA. Phase 2 of this study will be initiated upon access to&#xD;
      etanercept and completion of Phase I of the study.&#xD;
