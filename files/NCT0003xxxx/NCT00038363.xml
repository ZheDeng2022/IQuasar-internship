  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study objective is to compare hospital-based rehabilitative care with&#xD;
      transitional subacute rehabilitation for adults recently diagnosed with a disabling disorder.&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes, cost and utilization of services will be compared in order to test the&#xD;
      hypotheses that medically-stable patients receiving rehabilitation from subacute care&#xD;
      facilities will: 1) function as well physically, 2) report less family dysfunction, 3) have&#xD;
      better psychological adjustment and well-being than controls who receive only hospital-based&#xD;
      inpatient care, and 4) receive services at lower cost. We intend to assess the impact of&#xD;
      hospital-based versus subacute care on clinical and cost outcomes at admission, discharge [3&#xD;
      months post-admission] and at 12 months. The first set of analyses will determine predictors&#xD;
      of physical function, family function, psychological adjustment and well-being over a 1 year&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although subacute transitional care is thought to reduce costs by as much as 60 percent of&#xD;
      hospital-based care costs (DHHS, 1995), systematic prospective studies of utilization and&#xD;
      cost of services have not been done. An important factor to be considered, particularly in&#xD;
      elderly patients, is the cost associated with readmission. Some studies have suggested that&#xD;
      cost savings and reduced readmissions are associated with the increased availability of&#xD;
      post-discharge services (Ludke, MacDowell, Booth et. al., 1990; Weinberger, Smith, Katz et&#xD;
      al., 1988). If such cost savings exist, then transitional subacute care may be an important&#xD;
      community-based resource for patients returning to independent living. In addition to&#xD;
      demonstrating the clinical efficacy of subacute transitional care, the proposed study will&#xD;
      also assess long-term outcomes, taking into account patient resource utilization and the&#xD;
      incidence of readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will determine if subacute transitional care can improve outcomes that are&#xD;
      important to the broad goals of long term independent living and enhanced quality of life.&#xD;
      Variables assessed will focus on physical and family function, adjustment, resource&#xD;
      utilization, skilled care placements, and survival. When compared to hospital-based&#xD;
      rehabilitation, subacute rehabilitation is expected to demonstrate improvements in physical&#xD;
      abilities, family function, adjustment, well being, and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Hypothesis. The primary hypothesis is that clinical outcomes will be significantly better&#xD;
      for subacute care patients at 3 and 12 months than hospital-based control patients. Costs and&#xD;
      resource utilization are hypothesized to be significantly less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Objectives and projected timeline. The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to examine the effects of subacute transitional care compared with&#xD;
      hospital-based rehabilitative care for disabled patients. Specific objectives will be to: 1]&#xD;
      evaluate the type, magnitude and duration of rehabilitative care provided, 2] determine&#xD;
      differences in cost of care provided to the two groups, 3] compare clinical outcomes of the&#xD;
      two treatments by assessing the magnitude of change, and 4] compare long-term outcomes at 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will be to describe diagnostic or demographic subgroups who may benefit&#xD;
      to a greater or lesser extent than others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited into the study and followed for 1 year, with measurements&#xD;
      occurring at hospital admission, at 3 months, and at 12 months. The time to completion of the&#xD;
      study is projected to be 3 years. Recruitment of subjects will begin during the second&#xD;
      quarter of the project and will continue for 1.5 years. Follow-up measures will continue for&#xD;
      an additional year.&#xD;
