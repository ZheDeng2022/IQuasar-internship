      Our overall goal is to develop therapeutic interventions to improve upper-limb motor function&#xD;
      in hemiparetic persons based on an improved understanding of the mechanisms responsible for&#xD;
      its loss and recovery. We intend to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of these interventions&#xD;
      with clinical trials, and to study the mechanisms by which these interventions affect motor&#xD;
      recovery. In this proposal, we will use a controlled, randomized, double blind clinical trial&#xD;
      to study the effects of shoulder and elbow strength training in subjects in the subacute&#xD;
      phase of recovery following stroke.&#xD;

      Hypotheses: The specific hypotheses that we will test in this proposal all refer to persons&#xD;
      with post-stroke hemiparesis in the subacute phase of recovery (completed all out-patient&#xD;
      therapy programs, but still less than 6 months post-CVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a) Standard functional rehabilitation combined with strength training in the form of&#xD;
           high-intensity resistance exercise results in greater gains in elbow and shoulder&#xD;
           strength than standard functional rehabilitation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b) This increased strength is not accompanied by increased hypertonia. c) This increased&#xD;
           strength is not accompanied by significant muscular hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard functional rehabilitation combined with strength training results in greater&#xD;
           improvements in motor function than functional rehabilitation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Strength training results in improved control of elbow trajectory tracking movements and&#xD;
           shoulder-elbow reaching movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To perform a controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial to test the effects of&#xD;
           high-intensity resistance exercise at the shoulder and elbow. Two interventions will be&#xD;
           compared: standard functional rehabilitation (SFR), and standard functional&#xD;
           rehabilitation combined with high-intensity resistance exercise (strength training)&#xD;
           (SFR+STR). We will study persons with post-stroke hemiparesis in the subacute phase of&#xD;
           recovery, i.e. having completed all outpatient therapy programs, but still less than 6&#xD;
           months post-CVA. Outcome measures will include strength (maximal voluntary isovelocity&#xD;
           joint torque), hypertonia (onset threshold of the stretch reflex, Modified Ashworth&#xD;
           Scale), standard clinical assessment of activities of daily living (Barthel Index,&#xD;
           Functional Independence Measure), and upper extremity motor function (Fugl-Meyer exam,&#xD;
           Functional Test of the Hemiparetic Upper Extremity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the neuromuscular mechanisms associated with improvements in strength and motor&#xD;
           control that result from these interventions. Strength changes will be investigated by&#xD;
           measuring muscle hypertrophy, hyperreflexia, and passive stiffness. Changes in control&#xD;
           of upper extremity movements will be investigated by measuring motor performance and&#xD;
           muscle activation patterns in trajectory tracking and reaching tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long term goal is to develop therapeutic interventions to improve upper-limb motor&#xD;
      function in persons with post-stroke hemiparesis. Improved motor function involves not only&#xD;
      increased strength at the shoulder and elbow, but also increased strength and dexterity at&#xD;
      the wrist and hand. The proposed study will establish a foundation by demonstrating the&#xD;
      positive effects of strength training in persons with hemiparesis. Then, in future studies,&#xD;
      we can investigate the effects of specific interventions at the hand and wrist and&#xD;
      investigate physiologic mechanisms subserving change in neuromuscular function following&#xD;
      strength training.&#xD;
