  <brief_summary>

      This study will try to learn more about complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS (previously&#xD;
      known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, spreading neuralgia, and sympathalgia), by examining&#xD;
      the release of small proteins in the blood of patients with this condition. Patients with&#xD;
      CRPS usually have three types of symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensory abnormalities increased sensitivity to pain or a painful reaction to a harmless&#xD;
           stimulus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perfusion abnormalities alterations in blood flow, temperature abnormality, swelling,&#xD;
           decrease or increased nail growth, and hair and skin changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor abnormalities weakness, guarding (Holding the limb in such a fashion that it&#xD;
           minimizes accidental or intentional contact from possible sources of pain), and atrophy&#xD;
           (wasting)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of CRPS is unknown, and there are no definitive diagnostic tests for the condition.&#xD;
      Because early treatment improves the prognosis of CRPS, a test that enables early diagnosis&#xD;
      would be important for optimal medical management. The findings of this study may contribute&#xD;
      to the development of such a test and possibly new drug treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal healthy volunteers and patients of any age with complex regional pain syndrome who are&#xD;
      in otherwise good general health may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history, physical examination and collection of a blood&#xD;
      sample. They will fill out several questionnaires, providing information on their health,&#xD;
      personality, mood, pain levels, and symptoms. Participation in the study requires one&#xD;
      outpatient clinic visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is unknown but a patient typically&#xD;
      presents with a triad of clinical findings: sensory abnormalities, perfusion abnormalities&#xD;
      and alterations in motor function. Since some of these findings are seen in the other disease&#xD;
      states, the diagnosis is often not clear. A response to a sympathetic ganglion block&#xD;
      (stellate or lumbar) is also suggestive of the disorder. However, there is no definitive&#xD;
      diagnostic test for CRPS. Experience has shown that early aggressive treatment improves the&#xD;
      prognosis. Therefore, tests that facilitate the early diagnosis would have important clinical&#xD;
      implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in laboratory techniques allow analysis of clinical samples to identify protein or&#xD;
      patterns of protein changes associated with a disease state. Patients suffering with CRPS who&#xD;
      are currently seen in a pain clinic will be asked to participate in this study. The subjects&#xD;
      will complete a brief symptom survey, be examined by a co-investigator to document sensory,&#xD;
      temperature and trophic changes, and have a blood sample collected for protein and gene&#xD;
      expression (RNA) analysis. Blood samples from age-matched controls will be collected from&#xD;
      non-CRPS patients. Fifty patient samples collected from each group will be analyzed and used&#xD;
      to teach the diagnostic software and an additional 20 samples (10 controls, 10 CRPS patients)&#xD;
      will be used to validate diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients referred by their physician with the diagnosis of CRPS&#xD;
             criteria as outlined by Stanton-Hicks et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy volunteers will be screened according to the eligibility criteria as specified&#xD;
             in the appendix (see Healthy Subject Eligibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age restrictions: Patients and volunteers must be (Bullet)18 years of age at the time&#xD;
             of enrollment. There is no upper limit for age of inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good general health (other disease states could may confound the results see exclusion&#xD;
             criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to have blood drawn&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to have behavioral measures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to provide a directed medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is expected to be a greater number of females than males being recruited to this&#xD;
             study since there is a much higher occurrence of CRPS in women. Additionally, it is&#xD;
             expected to be equal across all ethnic groups. However, we do not anticipate requiring&#xD;
             any special recruiting strategies for specific gender or ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to blood screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced disease other than the CRPS (cardiovascular, liver, kidney disease ASA III or&#xD;
             above excluding CRPS) that may cause a theoretical inclusion of samples resulting in&#xD;
             confounding results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No exclusions will be made based on race, gender, or religion.&#xD;
