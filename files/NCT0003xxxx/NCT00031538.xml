      This study will analyze tissue and blood samples from patients with gliomas (a type of brain&#xD;
      tumor) to develop a new classification system for these tumors. Tumor classification can help&#xD;
      guide treatment, in part by predicting how aggressive a tumor may be. Gliomas are currently&#xD;
      classified according to their grade (how quickly they may grow) and the type of cells they&#xD;
      are composed of. This system, however, is not always accurate, and sometimes two tumors that&#xD;
      appear to be identical under the microscope will have very different growth patterns and&#xD;
      responses to treatment. The new classification system is based on tumor genes and proteins,&#xD;
      and may be used in the future to better predict a given tumor s behavior and response to&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with evidence of a primary brain tumor and patients with a known glioma who will be&#xD;
      undergoing surgery to remove the tumor may participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of tumor tissue removed in the course of a participant s normal clinical care will&#xD;
      be used in this study for laboratory analysis of genes and chromosome abnormalities. A small&#xD;
      blood sample will also be collected for genetic analysis. In addition, clinical information&#xD;
      on patients condition and response to treatment will be collected every 6 months over several&#xD;
      years. This information will include findings from physical and neurologic examinations,&#xD;
      radiographic findings, and response to therapy, including surgery, radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary brain tumors are an increasingly important cause of cancer-related morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in this country. Little progress has been made in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      gliomas over the last decade. One of the largest problems in our understanding, and&#xD;
      ultimately in our successful treatment of gliomas is the great heterogeneity between tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to generate a large publicly accessible molecular and genetic&#xD;
      database with prospective corollary clinical data for 1000 gliomas for the purpose of&#xD;
      allowing investigators from around the world to ask important questions regarding the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of these tumors, the development of novel molecular classification schemas, and&#xD;
      the identification of potentially new and important therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To substantially enlarge the growing glioma genomic and corollary clinical database currently&#xD;
      being generated by the Glioma Molecular Diagnostic Initiative (GMDI) and recorded in the&#xD;
      Repository of Malignant Brain Tumor Database (REMBRANDT), through the accrual of any&#xD;
      potential glioma patient with banked formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks&#xD;
      rather than restricting accrual to only those patients undergoing surgical resection of their&#xD;
      tumor. (NCI Only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell lines will be created using glioma tissue harvested during surgery. The cell lines will&#xD;
      be used for research in the NOB laboratory as well as to advance the public s scientific&#xD;
      knowledge by making them available to intramural, extramural and private sector investigators&#xD;
      for their own research. This would be done after executing a Material Transfer Agreement&#xD;
      (MTA) as needed on a case by case basis. The PI of this study should be contacted directly&#xD;
      for initiation of a cell line transfer to another organization or investigator. (NCI Only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient with radiographic suggestion of a primary glial neoplasm or any patient with a&#xD;
      known glial neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medically indicated (diagnostic and/or therapeutic) tumor resection, or biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All attempts will be made to obtain specimens immediately adjacent to the areas of resection&#xD;
      taken for &quot;permanent sections&quot; in order to optimize the likelihood that the tumor seen on&#xD;
      permanent sections is representative of that taken for genetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once tumor specimens have been acquired, they will be immediately brought to a liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen cell/tissue storage container, -70/-80 degrees C, or -20 degrees C freezer (in order&#xD;
      of preference) for storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following storage of the specimens, the NCI-based study specimen coordinator will be&#xD;
      contacted for determination of when frozen specimens will be sent to the NCI for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 ml of whole blood will be obtained for analysis of SNP Analogs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated every 6 months at a minimum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1000 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
