  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying imatinib mesylate to see how well it works in treating&#xD;
      patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response rate in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic&#xD;
      phase chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with imatinib mesylate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the disease-free survival of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the toxic effects of this&#xD;
      drug in these patients. V. Determine the rates of hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular&#xD;
      response and time to response in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (chronic&#xD;
      myelogenous leukemia [CML] in first chronic phase after failing interferon therapy or&#xD;
      demonstrating intolerance to interferon [closed to accrual as of 12/05/03] vs CML relapsing&#xD;
      after stem cell transplantation or in second or subsequent chronic phase [closed to accrual&#xD;
      as of 7/29/05] vs newly diagnosed CML in first chronic phase with no prior treatment [closed&#xD;
      to accrual as of 7/29/05] vs newly diagnosed CML in first chronic phase with no prior&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days&#xD;
      for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who fail&#xD;
      to achieve a complete hematologic response after 3 courses or a partial or complete cytogenic&#xD;
      response after 6 courses are removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 109 patients (30 for stratum I [closed to accrual as of&#xD;
      12/05/03] and stratum II [closed to accrual as of 7/29/05], 34 for stratum III [closed to&#xD;
      accrual as of 7/29/05], and 45 for stratum IV) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.&#xD;
