      RATIONALE: Octreotide may be effective in preventing or controlling diarrhea in patients who&#xD;
      are undergoing radiation therapy to the pelvis. It is not yet known whether octreotide is&#xD;
      effective for diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of octreotide in&#xD;
      preventing diarrhea in patients who are undergoing radiation therapy to the pelvis.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effectiveness of octreotide in reducing acute treatment-related diarrhea&#xD;
           in patients receiving external-beam radiotherapy to the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effectiveness of this drug in reducing chronic treatment-related bowel&#xD;
           dysfunction in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the importance that these patients attach to various measures of bowel function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients&#xD;
      are stratified according to prior anterior resection of the rectum (yes vs no), total planned&#xD;
      cumulative dose of radiotherapy, including boost fields (4,500-5,350 cGy vs 5,351-6,000 cGy&#xD;
      vs more than 6,000 cGy), use of concurrent fluorouracil (none vs bolus vs continuous&#xD;
      infusion), use of concurrent leucovorin calcium (yes vs no), use of concurrent cisplatin (yes&#xD;
      vs no), superior border of initial field (at or inferior to the L4-5 interspace vs superior&#xD;
      to the L4-5 interspace), planned intracavitary brachytherapy (yes vs no), and primary site of&#xD;
      disease (rectal cancer vs prostate cancer vs gynecological cancer vs other). Beginning no&#xD;
      later than the fourth day of radiotherapy, patients are randomized to one of two treatment&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive short-acting octreotide subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and&#xD;
           long-acting octreotide intramuscularly (IM) on days 2 and 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo SC on day 1 and IM on days 2 and 29. In both arms,&#xD;
           treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or the development of severe&#xD;
           diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a bowel function questionnaire at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, and&#xD;
      then weekly for 4 weeks and at 1 and 2 years after completion of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks and then at 1 and 2 years.&#xD;
