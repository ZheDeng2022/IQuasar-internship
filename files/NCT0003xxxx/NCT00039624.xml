      This study will evaluate the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for guiding placement of&#xD;
      hollow needles into the prostate gland for delivering internal radiation therapy to patients&#xD;
      with prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is often treated with a combination of external beam&#xD;
      radiation therapy and brachytherapy (internal radiation delivered close to the tumor). This&#xD;
      study will determine whether MRI is more accurate in guiding needle placement than&#xD;
      ultrasound, which is currently used for this purpose. Patients will have one brachytherapy&#xD;
      treatment followed by 5 weeks of external beam treatments and a second brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with prostate cancer that has not spread to the bone may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination, blood&#xD;
      and urine tests, and a bone scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To plan for radiation therapy, patients will have standard computed tomography (CT) and MRI&#xD;
      scans of the pelvis and prostate. In addition, CT and MRI scans will be done to determine if&#xD;
      the prostate is in a good position for brachytherapy. For these scans, patients will have an&#xD;
      enema and a tube will be placed in the rectum. They will then lie still on their side for&#xD;
      about 45 minutes during the scan. Patients who have blood in their urine will also undergo&#xD;
      cystoscopy. This is an examination of the bladder using a small camera that is advanced&#xD;
      through the penis into the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are given an antibiotic for 2 days before the brachytherapy and on the morning of&#xD;
      the procedure. Before the test, they have a small enema and are given medicines through the&#xD;
      vein and into the spine for relaxation and to decrease any discomfort. (The test is done&#xD;
      under general anesthesia for patients who require it.) The patient is moved on a stretcher&#xD;
      into the MRI scanner and a catheter is inserted into the bladder through the penis. The&#xD;
      bladder is filled with water and a tube is placed in the rectum. With the help of a plastic&#xD;
      guide placed against the skin, about 14 to 18 needles are then placed in the prostate. Some&#xD;
      stitches are sewn to hold the needles and the guide in place, and the tube in the rectum is&#xD;
      removed. The patient is the transferred from the MR scanner into the CT scanner, where the&#xD;
      rectal tube is reinserted and the needles are adjusted. A cystoscopy is done to make sure the&#xD;
      needles do not enter the bladder. When the needles are adjusted, the tube is removed from the&#xD;
      rectum and the patient is moved to the radiation oncology clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a few hours, when the radiation dose has been calculated, a radioactive substance&#xD;
      called iridium is administered. The needles placed in the prostate are connected to a&#xD;
      radiation machine, and thin wires with radioactive material on the tips are inserted into&#xD;
      each needle and withdrawn a little at a time. The process takes about 20 to 30 minutes. The&#xD;
      patient is then disconnected from the machine and undergoes another MRI scan to confirm the&#xD;
      position of the needles. The needles and catheter are then removed and the patient is&#xD;
      monitored for a while before going home. Patients then have 5 weeks of external beam therapy,&#xD;
      followed by a second brachytherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients return to the clinic at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after treatment&#xD;
      for blood tests, physical examination, and review of symptoms.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachytherapy, the placement of a radioactive source close to a tumor, is rapidly becoming an&#xD;
      important modality for patients with prostate cancer because higher and more conformal doses&#xD;
      can be safely delivered compared with external beam radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High dose rate (HDR) temporary implants offer several treatment and research based advantages&#xD;
      over permanent seeds, including exceptionally complex and accurate dosimetry in reference to&#xD;
      anatomic images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Needle placement in brachytherapy procedures requires detailed image guidance, traditionally&#xD;
      obtained with trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS). MRI offers a 3D dataset, arbitrary imaging&#xD;
      planes, and unparalleled soft tissue resolution of the anatomy, making it the modality of&#xD;
      choice for imaging the prostate gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A real-time MR-guided prostate permanent seed implant technique that utilizes both real-time&#xD;
      MRI and real-time dosimetry has been designed, implemented and reported. Results confirm that&#xD;
      TRUS-guided implants may be improved upon by using MRI. To our knowledge, HDR implants have&#xD;
      not yet been performed under MR guidance in a closed bore magnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the quality of prostate HDR brachytherapy implants&#xD;
      performed under MR-guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality is defined by the percentage of the planning target volume (PTV) encompassed by a&#xD;
      given percentage of the prescribed dose. In this study an implant will be of &quot;acceptable&quot;&#xD;
      quality if 80% of the PTV is encompassed by the 100% isodose (V100 80%), in accordance with&#xD;
      RTOG guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathologically confirmed prostate cancer with the following features:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gleason score greater than 6, or greater than T2a, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSA greater than or equal to 10, and no evidence of bone metastases;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age greater than or equal to 18 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed with a &quot;run-in&quot; pilot phase with the objective of refining the&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation phase is a two-stage optimal design to evaluate the quality of the implant&#xD;
      with an early look for futility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the potential to enroll a maximum of 27 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation treatment parameters will be patterned after established guidelines in the&#xD;
      literature such as those reported by the American Brachytherapy Society and the&#xD;
      William-Beaumont Hospital. There will be no attempted dose escalation or attempts to&#xD;
      prescribe the dose to unconventional target volumes in this phase of the project.&#xD;
