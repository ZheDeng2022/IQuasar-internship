  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying erlotinib to see how well it works in treating patients with&#xD;
      persistent or recurrent cancer of the cervix. Biological therapies such as erlotinib may&#xD;
      interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of the tumor&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the antitumor cytostatic activity of OSI-774 as measured by the probability of&#xD;
      surviving progression-free for at least 6 months in patients with persistent or recurrent&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of OSI-774 in this cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the partial and complete response rates in patients with squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the cervix receiving OSI-774.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival within this&#xD;
      patient population treated with OSI-774.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the effects of prognostic factors: initial performance status and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p110 truncated EGFR (p110 sEGFR)&#xD;
      isoform expression levels in primary tumors, and from tumor samples obtained pretreatment and&#xD;
      following four weeks of therapy to determine tumor response (or resistance) to OSI-774&#xD;
      inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate EGFR and p110sEGFR expression levels with either MAPK or AKT phosphorylation&#xD;
      status in the same tissue samples obtained pretreatment and following four weeks of drug&#xD;
      treatment to determine downstream effects with response to OSI-774 inhibition of EGFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether pretreatment serum p110 sEGFR concentrations are a useful&#xD;
      prognostic indicator and whether altered and/or sEGFR concentrations are useful indicators of&#xD;
      therapeutic responsiveness, time to progression, and overall survival in cervical carcinoma&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
