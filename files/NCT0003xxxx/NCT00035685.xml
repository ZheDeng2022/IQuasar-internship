      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with asthma are particularly vulnerable to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).&#xD;
      However, despite this special vulnerability to ETS, children with asthma are at least as&#xD;
      likely to live in smoking households, as are healthy children. Controversy exists, however,&#xD;
      about whether or not the smoking members of households with children with asthma use specific&#xD;
      strategies to reduce the harmful effects of their smoking on their children more than the&#xD;
      smoking members of households of healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The case-control study examines whether or not primary school-aged children with asthma from&#xD;
      low-income households have lower household ETS exposure than matched control children.&#xD;
      Household ETS exposure will be measured by both objective monitoring, specifically passive&#xD;
      nicotine dosimeters and child cotinine assays (the primary hypothesis), and maternal-report&#xD;
      (the secondary hypothesis). Ninety children with physician diagnosed asthma and smoking&#xD;
      mothers will be matched by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and other relevant variables to 90&#xD;
      healthy children. All children will be recruited from Metro Denver clinics providing services&#xD;
      to low-income, underserved populations. The sample will contain equal numbers of African&#xD;
      Americans, Hispanics, and Whites. Recruitment will target low-income populations due to their&#xD;
      increased prevalence of, and associated morbidity from both asthma and tobacco smoking.&#xD;
      Specific household smoking behaviors, as reported by mothers, will be examined for&#xD;
      association with household nicotine and child cotinine levels. Finally, a set of carefully&#xD;
      chosen measures will be examined in tertiary, exploratory analyses to help understand,&#xD;
      clarify, and contextualize the observed results.&#xD;
