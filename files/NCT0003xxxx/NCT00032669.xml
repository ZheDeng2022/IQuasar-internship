      This study will evaluate a new treatment strategy called therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in&#xD;
      HIV-infected children and adolescents. TDM involves analyzing the virus, giving drugs the&#xD;
      virus is most sensitive to, monitoring drug blood levels to make sure there is enough drug to&#xD;
      work against the virus, and changing the drug dose if it is too low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected children between 0 and 21 years of age who may benefit from treatment with a&#xD;
      protease inhibitor and who are not benefiting from their current antiretroviral drug&#xD;
      treatment regimen may be enrolled in this 48-week study. Patients who are not currently&#xD;
      receiving antiretroviral treatment, including patients who have never received antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment, may be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood drawn to learn what anti-HIV drugs the patient's virus is&#xD;
      resistant to-that is, what drugs are no longer effective against the virus. This is&#xD;
      determined by analyzing the virus's genotype (detailed genetic structure) and phenotype&#xD;
      (response to exposure to anti-viral drugs). Based on these test results and the patient's&#xD;
      prior medication history, a drug regimen tailored to the individual patient will be&#xD;
      prescribed. It may include one or two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as&#xD;
      zidovudine, didanosine, lamuvidine, zalcitabine, stavudine), a non- nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitor such as nevirapine or efavirenz, and a protease inhibitor such as&#xD;
      amprenavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, or Kaletra (a combination of lopinavir and&#xD;
      ritonavir).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patients begin treatment, the amount of the protease inhibitor in the blood will be&#xD;
      measured. If not enough of the drug is found in the blood, the dose of the drug will be&#xD;
      increased and the amount of the drug in the blood will be checked again. In this study, the&#xD;
      dose may be increased up to three times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen in clinic for 6 days when treatment begins to measure blood levels of&#xD;
      the medicines and evaluate the response of the virus. Treatment will then continue on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis. Drug levels will be measured periodically throughout the study. The viral&#xD;
      load will also be measured and additional tests to determine whether the resistance pattern&#xD;
      of the patients' virus has changed. In addition, patients will undergo the following tests&#xD;
      and procedures at various times throughout the study, more frequently for the first few&#xD;
      months and then less often:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure cell counts and viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine laboratory tests to measure kidney, liver, bone marrow, and other organ&#xD;
           functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye and neuropsychologic examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram (heart ultrasound)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG - heart rhythm test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      To make sure the medicines work, they must be taken as directed. In addition, since higher&#xD;
      than usual doses of some of the anti-HIV drugs may be given, it will be important to know&#xD;
      whether the patients are taking all of the medicine that has been prescribed. This study will&#xD;
      therefore also measure patients' adherence to their medication regimen in two ways: 1) some&#xD;
      medicines will be packaged in a bottle with an electronic medicine bottle cap that will&#xD;
      record when the bottle is opened, and 2) patients and their parents will be interviewed by&#xD;
      phone or in person at various times during the study about adherence and may be asked to fill&#xD;
      out forms that record the number of doses taken. This will allow the doctor and patient to&#xD;
      work together to make sure the medicines are being taken properly. Patients and parents will&#xD;
      also be interviewed periodically about their understanding of HIV disease, about social&#xD;
      supports that are available, and about the child's emotional adjustment.&#xD;

      This is a single arm study to determine whether a novel dose adjustment strategy that&#xD;
      individualizes protease inhibitor dosing to maintain drug concentrations above&#xD;
      virologic-based threshold values (TDM) in pediatric patients with HIV is able to result in a&#xD;
      potentially clinically useful proportion of patients who achieve a targeted inhibitory&#xD;
      quotient (IQ). The study will consist of up to 34 children between 0 and 21 years of age&#xD;
      (minimum weight 10 kg). Patients will have viral resistance testing performed at baseline and&#xD;
      that information, combined with treatment history analysis and drug tolerability issues will&#xD;
      be used to design a combination antiretroviral regimen. After the new regimen is started,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic monitoring will guide dose adjustments of protease inhibitors. An algorithm&#xD;
      will be followed to make dose adjustments based upon viral phenotype and drug levels. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure will be the fraction of patients who attain adequate protease&#xD;
      inhibitor levels above target values. Secondary measures will include virologic and&#xD;
      immunologic benefits and evaluation of toxicity and tolerability.&#xD;
