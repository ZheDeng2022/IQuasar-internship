    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether people who develop Post-Traumatic Stress&#xD;
      Disorder (PTSD) after a trauma have increased sensitivity to the effects of a stress hormone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PTSD have small hippocampal volume and deficits in hippocampal-mediated memory&#xD;
      as compared to healthy people. However, it is unclear whether the smaller hippocampi are a&#xD;
      consequence of PTSD or a risk factor for the development of PTSD. Some researchers believe&#xD;
      that people who develop PTSD have an increase in cortisol levels during traumatic experiences&#xD;
      and that this could be neurotoxic to the hippocampus. Others hypothesize that increased&#xD;
      sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors to cortisol, regardless of the cortisol levels, could&#xD;
      lead to neurotoxic damage to the hippocampus. This study will compare responses to a stress&#xD;
      hormone in patients with PTSD, participants who have experienced trauma but do not have PTSD,&#xD;
      and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical and psychiatric interview, physical examination,&#xD;
      blood tests, electrocardiogram, and an emotional intelligence evaluation. Those eligible for&#xD;
      the study will be asked to collect urine and saliva samples for 3 days. Participation will&#xD;
      also include blood draws, a PET scan (brain imaging), an eye-blink test, neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing, and other procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At another study visit, participants will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&#xD;
      (brain imaging), questionnaires, and other procedures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to combat or civilian trauma have&#xD;
      been found to have small hippocampal volume, and deficits in hippocampal mediated memory,&#xD;
      compared to the controls. However, it is not clear if the smaller hippocampi are a&#xD;
      consequence of the extreme trauma and PTSD, or a risk factor in the development of PTSD.&#xD;
      Researchers supporting the causal hypothesis have proposed that increased levels of cortisol&#xD;
      during the traumatic experience could be neurotoxic to the hippocampus. Several studies have&#xD;
      confirmed an increase in levels of cortisol during stress. However, plasma and urine measures&#xD;
      of cortisol in patients with PTSD are mixed; with reports of increased decreased or normal&#xD;
      cortisol. The possibility that increased sensitivity of the Type II or glucocorticoid&#xD;
      receptors to circulating cortisol could lead to neurotoxic damage to the hippocampus, despite&#xD;
      normal to low peripheral levels of cortisol has been proposed. Furthermore, increased&#xD;
      sensitivity of the glucocorticoid receptor in PTSD could lead to stronger negative feedback&#xD;
      inhibition, thereby offering a mechanism for the paradoxical observation of lower ACTH and&#xD;
      cortisol levels in PTSD. Studies attempting to test the glucocorticoid receptor super&#xD;
      sensitivity theory in PTSD confirmed the presence of increased number and sensitivity of&#xD;
      lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptors in patients compared to healthy subjects. However, there&#xD;
      are currently no published reports investigating central glucocorticoid sensitivity in&#xD;
      patients with PTSD. A recent study in healthy subjects and Alzheimer's disease demonstrated&#xD;
      that central glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity can be measured by hydrocortisone mediated&#xD;
      inhibition of glucose metabolism measured by positron emission tomography (PET) and&#xD;
      2-deoxy-2[F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). We propose to evaluate the metabolic, cognitive, and&#xD;
      behavioral effects of hydrocortisone or placebo administration in patients with PTSD,&#xD;
      subjects who have experienced trauma but do not develop PTSD (trauma controls) and healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The study sample will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients with a primary diagnosis of PTSD due to non-combat or combat related trauma&#xD;
             according to DSM-IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects with non-combat related traumatic experiences without current PTSD and&#xD;
&#xD;
             Healthy subjects without current or past history of psychiatric or major medical&#xD;
             illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All subjects will be between 18 and 60 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male and female subjects will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All subjects must be able to give written informed consent prior to participation in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with PTSD must score greater than or equal to 50 on Clinician-Administered&#xD;
             PTSD Scale as a measure of PTSD symptom severity to be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who are not currently on medications for PTSD. (Patients will not be&#xD;
             discontinued from effective medication for purposes of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who are nonresponders to other psychotropic drugs must have discontinued them&#xD;
             for at least 2 weeks prior to the first PET scan. Medications will be discontinued&#xD;
             under the supervision of the treating physician or a research psychiatrist listed in&#xD;
             the protocol. (Nonresponders will be defined as subjects who continue to meet criteria&#xD;
             for PTSD despite treatment with 30 mg equivalent of paroxetine for a minimum duration&#xD;
             of six weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. All eligible subjects must be in good physical health as confirmed by a complete&#xD;
        physical exam (including normal vital signs), electrocardiogram, neurological exam, and&#xD;
        routine laboratory tests of blood and urine. [However, if patients have participated in&#xD;
        other research studies or have had blood work through their primary MD within the last 6&#xD;
        months, these results will be used instead of repeating blood draws for inclusion into the&#xD;
        study.]&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with a clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine,&#xD;
             neurological, gastrointestinal illness or unstable medical disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who would be unable to comply with study procedures or assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with primary trauma related to motor vehicle accidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who meet DSM-IV criteria for alcohol and/or substance abuse or substance&#xD;
             dependence within 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who are currently on fluoxetine (Justification: Washout from fluoxetine could&#xD;
             take up to six weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who are currently at high risk for homicide or suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with a current or past history of other axis I disorders like schizophrenia,&#xD;
             schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or dementia will be excluded from the&#xD;
             study. However, those with a comorbid history of other Axis 1 disorder like major&#xD;
             depression, dysthymia or panic disorder will be included in the study. Justification:&#xD;
             Approximately 70% of subjects with PTSD have comorbid depression and or alcohol abuse;&#xD;
             reviewed in 134. Restricting the sample to PTSD patients without depression will not&#xD;
             accurately reflect the biology of this disorder].&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with a history of peptic ulcer disease will be excluded. (Justification:&#xD;
             Those with a history of acid peptic disease requiring antacids in the past will be&#xD;
             excluded, although it is unlikely that a single dose of intravenous hydrocortisone&#xD;
             could precipitate bleeding due to gastritis or peptic ulcer disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential who are not practicing a clinically accepted method of&#xD;
             contraception or who have a positive pregnancy test or who are lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who donated a Red Cross unit of blood within 60 days prior to participation&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
