      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drug felbamate&#xD;
      for treating depression in patients with bipolar disorder that has not responded to standard&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bipolar disorder is a severe, chronic, and often life-threatening illness. Despite the&#xD;
      availability of a wide range of antidepressant drugs, a proportion of patients fail to&#xD;
      respond to first-line antidepressant treatment despite adequate dosage, duration, and&#xD;
      compliance. Studies suggest that the glutamatergic system may play a role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology and treatment of depression. Felbamate and other agents which reduce&#xD;
      glutamatergic neurotransmission may represent a novel class of antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be admitted to the Clinical Center for up to 10 weeks. At&#xD;
      study entry, participants will have a 7-day washout period in which they will be tapered off&#xD;
      all psychiatric medications, with the possible exception of lithium, and will be given a&#xD;
      placebo (an inactive pill). After the washout period, participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive either felbamate or placebo for 8 weeks. Participants whose depression symptoms&#xD;
      worsen by more than 30% or those for whom study continuation is considered potentially&#xD;
      harmful will be taken off the study and offered open-label treatment. Participants who&#xD;
      received felbamate and responded well to treatment will have the option of continuing&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar affective disorder (BPD, manic-depressive illness) is a common, severe, chronic and&#xD;
      often life-threatening illness. Increasingly, it is being recognized that it is the&#xD;
      depressive phase of the illness, which contributes much of the morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Impairment in physical and social functioning resulting from depression can be just as severe&#xD;
      as other chronic medical illnesses. Suicide is the cause of death in 10-20% of individuals&#xD;
      with either bipolar or recurrent depressive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments for acute unipolar depression have extensively researched. However, despite&#xD;
      the availability of a wide range of antidepressant drugs, clinical trials indicate that 30%&#xD;
      to 40% of depressed patients fail to respond to first-line antidepressant treatment, despite&#xD;
      adequate dosage, duration, and compliance. Very few studies have examined the efficacy of&#xD;
      somatic treatments for the acute phase of bipolar depression. Thus, there is a clear need to&#xD;
      develop novel and improved therapeutics for bipolar depression. Recent preclinical studies&#xD;
      suggest that antidepressants may exert delayed indirect effects on the glutamatergic system.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a growing body of data suggests that mood disorders are associated with regional&#xD;
      volumetric reductions, and cell loss and atrophy. It is noteworthy that lamotrigine reduces&#xD;
      glutamatergic neurotransmission, has antidepressant effects in bipolar depression, and a&#xD;
      pilot study has suggested that NMDA antagonists may have antidepressant effects. Together,&#xD;
      this data suggests that the glutamatergic system may play a role in the pathophysiology and&#xD;
      treatment of depression, and the agents, which more directly reduce glutamatergic&#xD;
      neurotransmission, may represent a novel class of antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Felbamate (Felbatol Â® (Registered Trademark)) a dicarbamate, is FDA-approved as monotherapy&#xD;
      and adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures with or without secondary&#xD;
      generalization and in partial and generalized seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut&#xD;
      syndrome in children. Felbamate has significant antiglutamatergic and neuroprotective&#xD;
      properties, and may prove to have antidepressant properties in bipolar patients. In this&#xD;
      study, we propose to investigate the potential efficacy of felbamate, which reduces&#xD;
      glutamatergic throughput via inhibition of glutamate release and NMDA, AMPA, and metabotropic&#xD;
      glutamate receptor blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will examine the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of felbamate in acutely depressed bipolar patients who are considered&#xD;
      treatment-resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two phases. The first phase is the washout phase that will last for 7 days.&#xD;
      The second phase is an 8-week acute treatment phase in which the efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      felbamate and placebo are compared. Lithium can remain during Study Periods I and II if&#xD;
      partial response to this agent is documented. Patients who complete the 8-week double-blind&#xD;
      phase will receive clinical treatment. Acute efficacy will be determined by demonstrating a&#xD;
      greater response rate using specified criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, ages 18 or older, with a diagnosis of Bipolar I or II disorder, depressed (without&#xD;
      psychotic features), will be randomized to double-blind treatment to receive either felbamate&#xD;
      (600-3000 mg/day) or placebo for a period of 8 weeks. Following this acute period, the&#xD;
      patients will receive treatment as clinically indicated. Approximately 52 patients with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant acute bipolar depression will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Currently taking a protocol disallowed agent that is effective and specifically necessary&#xD;
        for that individual for the recurrence of mania.&#xD;
&#xD;

        dependence within the past 3 months or positive results for illicit drugs at prestudy drug&#xD;
        screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with a rapid cycling course of illness (defined as 4 affective episodes in the&#xD;
        previous year) in the past 12-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with an injectable depot neuroleptic within less than one dosing interval between&#xD;
        depot neuroleptic injections prior to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor, guanethidine, or guanadrel within&#xD;
        1 week prior to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with fluoxetine within 4 weeks prior to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with any other concomitant medication with primarily CNS activity, other than&#xD;
        specified in Appendix A of protocol.&#xD;

        (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune liver&#xD;
        disease) or a history of any blood dyscrasia. Thus a history of anemias or cytopenias that&#xD;
        were not obviously related to a limited benign process (e.g., anemia related to menstrual&#xD;
        bleeding) will be reason for exclusion. Consultation with hematology will be used for help&#xD;
        with any 'gray area' cases.&#xD;
