  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been observed in&#xD;
      kidney, prostate, colon, lung, breast, and other cancers, and is often associated with a poor&#xD;
      prognosis. TGFa and EGF, the ligands for EGFR, are also overexpressed in some of these tumor&#xD;
      types, suggesting a self-propagating stimulus that may be responsible for rapid tumor growth.&#xD;
      Blocking this stimulus by blocking activation of EGFR with ABX-EGF, a fully human monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody against EGFR, may prevent tumor growth and perhaps shrink tumors. Purpose: This is a&#xD;
      Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABX-EGF in combination with&#xD;
      paclitaxel and carboplatin in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
