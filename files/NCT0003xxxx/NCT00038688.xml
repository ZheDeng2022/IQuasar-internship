  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injection drug use is the major mode of HIV transmission in many countries. Injection drug&#xD;
      users (IDUs) transmit HIV not only through shared drug injection equipment but also through&#xD;
      heterosexual and homosexual transmission and mother-to-child transmission. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that peer education programs can reduce HIV risk behavior in IDUs. However, it is not known&#xD;
      if reduced HIV risk behavior leads to fewer HIV infections. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      find out if a peer education program can reduce the number of new HIV infections by changing&#xD;
      the behavior of IDUs and their HIV risk contacts.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 20 years of research in implementing interventions for IDUs indicate that HIV&#xD;
      transmission among these users can be prevented, slowed, and stopped with the appropriate&#xD;
      intervention. Intervening early with multiple strategies can prevent epidemic spread and its&#xD;
      consequences. Even after prevalence has increased substantially, prevention interventions can&#xD;
      reduce the further spread of HIV in drug-using populations and transmission into other&#xD;
      populations. Although research results have been promising, it is unknown if self-reported&#xD;
      behavior change is correlated with reducing rates of HIV transmission. This study will&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of a peer-educator, network-oriented intervention to prevent HIV&#xD;
      transmission among substance users and their risk network members. IDUs will be recruited&#xD;
      using street and community outreach methods in Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, Thailand and in&#xD;
      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals at the study clinics will undergo a screening survey and HIV counseling and&#xD;
      testing; they will return to the clinic to receive their HIV test results, post-test&#xD;
      counseling, and further screening. Those who are HIV uninfected, meet preliminary eligibility&#xD;
      requirements, and are willing to participate will be enrolled as index participants. Each&#xD;
      index participant will be asked to identify and attempt to recruit at least two other people&#xD;
      (potential network members) whom he/she has had sex with or taken drugs with in the 3 months&#xD;
      prior to screening. Infected and uninfected network members will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
      Index participants will be randomly assigned with their network members to either the&#xD;
      intervention group or a control group. All participants will receive HIV counseling and&#xD;
      regular HIV testing. Index participants assigned to the intervention group attend six,&#xD;
      two-hour peer educator-training sessions over a period of 4 weeks. The training sessions&#xD;
      focus on skills building and promotion of risk-reducing behaviors. A one-hour booster&#xD;
      training session is held for index participants after their 6- and 12-month follow-up&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last approximately 48 months, with enrollment expected to take about 30&#xD;
      months. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 18 months and a maximum of 30 months.&#xD;
      Both index participants and network members have follow-up visits every 6 months, at which&#xD;
      they will complete surveys designed to assess HIV risk behavior, network characteristics, the&#xD;
      intensity of the intervention delivery, and social harms that may be associated with study&#xD;
      participation. Average network HIV incidence rates will be compared for the two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: as of January 31, 2006, the HPTN 037 trial was terminated. Participants enrolled in the&#xD;
      study will continue to be followed at a reduced number of study visits.&#xD;
