  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CCI-779 in treating patients who have mantle&#xD;
      cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer&#xD;
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the objective responses in patients with previously treated mantle cell&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with CCI-779.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine whether this&#xD;
      drug inhibits cell proliferation pathways in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable&#xD;
      disease receive a maximum of 6 courses. Patients with partial response receive a maximum of&#xD;
      12 courses. Patients with complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months&#xD;
      for 1 year, and then annually for 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>The proportion will be evaluated separately for each dose group. The proportion of patients who achieve a confirmed CR or PR, or success, will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>
