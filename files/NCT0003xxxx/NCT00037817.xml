    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously we have demonstrated induction of tumor antigen and tumor suppressor gene&#xD;
      expression in lung cancer cells following exposure to the DNA demethylating agent, Decitabine&#xD;
      (DAC). We have also demonstrated that DAC mediated target gene expression and apoptosis can&#xD;
      be significantly enhanced in cancer cells by subsequent exposure to the histone deacetylase&#xD;
      (HDAC) inhibitor Depsipeptide FK228 (DP). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that following&#xD;
      DAC, or DAC/DP exposure, cancer cells can be recognized by cytolytic T cells specific for the&#xD;
      cancer testis antigen, NY-FSO-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase I study will evaluate gene induction in thoracic oncology patients mediated by&#xD;
      sequential DAC/DP treatment with or without the selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of continuous 72-hour intravenous Decitabine&#xD;
      (DAC) infusion followed by 4-hour intravenous infusion of Depsipeptide FK228 (DP) with or&#xD;
      without oral celecoxib in patients with unresectable cancers involving the lungs or pleura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of NY-ESO-1, p16 and p21 expression in cancer specimens before and after sequential&#xD;
      Decitabine/Depsipeptide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of serologic response to NY-ESO-1 before and after sequential drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of apoptosis in tumor biopsies before and after sequential Decitabine/Depsipeptide&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refinement of laser capture microdissection and micro-array techniques for analysis of gene&#xD;
      expression profiles in tumor tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically or cytologically proven primary small cell or non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancers, advanced esophageal cancers, pleural mesotheliomas, or non-thoracic cancers&#xD;
      with metastases to the lungs or pleura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0-2 and have adequate&#xD;
      pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO greater than the 30% predicted, and less than 50&#xD;
      mm Hg and p02 greater than 60 mm Hg on room air ABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have a platelet count greater than 100.000. an ANC equal to or greater than&#xD;
      1500 without transfusion or cytokine support, a normal PT, and adequate hepatic function as&#xD;
      evidenced by a total bilirubin of less than 1.5 x upper limits of normal. Serum creatinine&#xD;
      less than or equal to 1.6 mg/ml or the creatinine clearance must be greater than 70&#xD;
      ml/min/1.73m(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with inoperable malignancies involving lungs or pleura will receive two cycles of&#xD;
      72-hour intravenous infusion of Decitabine followed by 4-hour Depsipeptide infusion using a&#xD;
      Phase I study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decitabine will be administered by continuous infusion on days 1-4, and patient cohorts will&#xD;
      receive escalating doses of Depsipeptide administered on day 4 and day 10 of a 34 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD and toxicities for sequential DAC/DP have been identified, additional cohorts of&#xD;
      6 lung cancer patients and 6 mesothelioma patients will receive sequential DAC/DP&#xD;
      administered at the MTD as outlined above with celecoxib (400mg bid) administered on days&#xD;
      4-34 of each treatment cycle, as a means to enhance target cell apoptosis and facilitate&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune recognition/response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics, systemic toxicity, and response to therapy will be recorded. Tumor biopsies&#xD;
      will be obtained prior to, and after therapy to evaluate expression of NY-ESO-1 tumor&#xD;
      antigen, as well as p16 and p21 tumor suppressor genes, which are known to be modulated by&#xD;
      chromatin structure. Additional analysis will be undertaken to evaluate the extent of&#xD;
      apoptosis in tumor tissues, and to determine if immune recognition of NY-ESO-1 can be&#xD;
      demonstrated following sequential DAC?DP +/- celecoxib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the exact set of comparisons and analyses to be performed will be determined following&#xD;
      completion of the trial and will be based on limited numbers of patients, the analyses will&#xD;
      be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating rather than definitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;

        therapy may be eligible for study provided there is no evidence of active disease and no&#xD;
        requirement for anticonvulsant therapy or steroids following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with prior Decitabine or Depsipeptide exposure are eligible for study provided&#xD;
        they have not experienced dose limiting toxicity at the dose of DAC or DP that they are&#xD;

        between discontinuing the drug and entering this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant patients and lactating mothers will be excluded due to the unknown, potentially&#xD;
        harmful effects of demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors on fetal and early childhood&#xD;
        development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with active infections will be excluded.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients should not be using hydrochlorothiazide diuretics if entered on this protocol.&#xD;
