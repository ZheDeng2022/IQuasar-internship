      This study will examine blood or other tissue samples from patients with Fraser syndrome and&#xD;
      patients with Fryns syndrome to try to identify the gene responsible for these diseases.&#xD;
      Fraser syndrome is characterized by congenital abnormalities including cryptophthalmos (lack&#xD;
      of eyelid formation), syndactyly (webbed fingers or toes) and abnormal genitalia. Patients&#xD;
      may also have abnormalities of the nose, ears and larynx (voice box), cleft lip or palate,&#xD;
      and kidney agenesis. Fryns syndrome is characterized by hernia through the diaphragm, cloudy&#xD;
      cornea, coarse facial features, cleft lip or palate, abnormal fingers and toes, heart, kidney&#xD;
      and brain malformations and hydrocephalus (accumulation of fluid around the brain). This&#xD;
      protocol consists of laboratory study only; it does not involve patient care or patient&#xD;
      counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Fraser syndrome or Fryns syndrome are eligible for this study. Parents and&#xD;
      healthy siblings of patients will also be included for genetic study, and parents of children&#xD;
      with undiagnosed multiple congenital anomalies syndromes will be included for comparison&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide a blood sample (about 8 to 10 teaspoons from adults; 1 to 3&#xD;
      teaspoons from children) or sample of skin cells collected by swabbing the inner surface of&#xD;
      the cheek. Some patients may undergo a skin biopsy, in which a small skin sample (about&#xD;
      1/8-inch in diameter) is surgically removed. The tissue samples will be used to obtain DNA&#xD;
      (genetic material) for laboratory testing. A permanent cell line-a collection of cells grown&#xD;
      in the laboratory from the original tissue specimen-will also be established to enable&#xD;
      additional testing in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We would like to determine the molecular genetic etiology of two rare human malformation&#xD;
      syndromes, Fraser syndrome (OMIM 219000) and Fryns syndrome (OMIM 229850). To date, we are&#xD;
      unaware of molecular genetic studies that have been performed in either syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are planning to perform molecular genetic studies on DNA specimens from affected&#xD;
      individuals ascertained outside NIH by other clinicians and/or reported in the medical&#xD;
      literature. Should these studies prove fruitful, we would plan to expand this work to a&#xD;
      combined clinical and molecular study to fully delineate the phenotypes associated with these&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to collect DNA specimens from affected patients and from unaffected siblings and&#xD;
      parents and to evaluate the specimens in the laboratory by linkage analysis, physical&#xD;
      mapping, candidate gene characterization and mutation screening. If the causative genes(s)&#xD;
      for either syndrome are identified, then mouse models of the diseases may be developed and&#xD;
      cell biologic studies of normal and mutant proteins may be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cloning of these genes would enable better characterization of human developmental&#xD;
      processes and improve patient counseling for individuals and families affected by these&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Fraser syndrome, clinical criteria for inclusion will be by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Satisfying diagnostic criteria for Fraser syndrome. These are at least two major criteria&#xD;
        and one minor criterion (listed below) or one major criterion and four minor criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Major criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cryptophthalmos&#xD;
&#xD;
        Syndactyly&#xD;
&#xD;
        Abnormal genitalia&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sib with cryptophthalmos syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        Minor criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Congenital malformation of the nose&#xD;
&#xD;
        Congenital malformations of the ears&#xD;
&#xD;
        Congenital malformation of the larynx&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cleft lip and/or palate&#xD;
&#xD;
        Skeletal defects&#xD;
&#xD;
        Umbilical hernia&#xD;
&#xD;
        Renal agenesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mental retardation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cryptophthalmos with additional anomalies consistent with the phenotypic spectrum of Fraser&#xD;
        syndrome but without satisfying diagnotisic for Fraser syndrome may also be considered&#xD;
        sufficient for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Fryns syndrome, formal diagnostic criteria have not been published. The clinical&#xD;
        criteria for inclusion will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diaphragmatic hernia with at least one additional anomaly found in the spectrum of Fryns&#xD;
        syndrome, including cleft lip and or palate, renal or genital malformations, cerebral&#xD;
        malformations or hydrocephalus, corneal clouding, craniofacial dysmorphism and&#xD;
        brachydactyly or nail hypoplasia, pulmonary agenesis or microphthalmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with four or more of the additional anomalies may be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Parents and unaffected siblings will be also included for linkage analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specimens of DNA or whole blood for DNA extraction collected outside the NIH may be&#xD;
        accepted into the study if they are obtained through an approved NIH protocol consent form.&#xD;
