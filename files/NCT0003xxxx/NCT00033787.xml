  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serotonin is a chemical involved in regulation of emotions, anxiety, sleep, stress hormones,&#xD;
      and other body functions. The purpose of this study is to use a procedure called tryptophan&#xD;
      depletion to study the function of serotonin in people with depression and in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with reduced functioning of central&#xD;
      serotonergic systems. Tryptophan depletion (TD) is a procedure used to investigate the&#xD;
      relationship between serotonergic function and depression. Evidence suggests that the mood&#xD;
      lowering effects of TD depend upon family history and differences in genes for a specific&#xD;
      protein called 5-HTTLPR. Healthy females with a particular gene for 5-HTTLPR and a family&#xD;
      history of mood disorders appear to be at a greater risk for the development of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms during TD. This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the brain&#xD;
      to investigate the effect of variant 5-HTTLPR genotypes on response to TD. The relationship&#xD;
      between 5-HTTLPR genotypes and the effect of TD on brain activity in individuals with&#xD;
      different 5-HTTLPR genes will be determined. This study will also examine how the reduced&#xD;
      serotonin function that occurs in MDD affects the brain's response to sensory stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be screened by telephone about their psychiatric and medical&#xD;
      history, current emotional state, anxiety and sleep patterns, and family history of&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders. At study entry, participants will have an interview, physical&#xD;
      examination, electrocardiogram (EKG), and blood and laboratory tests. Menstruating women will&#xD;
      have a pregnancy test and tests to determine menstrual phase and time of ovulation. At the&#xD;
      second clinic visit, participants will undergo tests of intelligence and cognitive abilities&#xD;
      and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. Prior to Visits 3 and 4,&#xD;
      participants will collect their saliva and urine. Menstruating women will have a pregnancy&#xD;
      test. At Visits 3 and 4, participants will undergo TD studies and PET scanning. During one of&#xD;
      these visits, participants will take capsules of an amino acid. On the other day, they will&#xD;
      take lactose capsules. Throughout the study, participants will be asked about their emotional&#xD;
      state, anxiety, ability to concentrate, and well being.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with abnormally reduced function of&#xD;
      central serotonergic systems by various types of evidence. One instructive paradigm for&#xD;
      investigating the relationship between serotonergic function and depression has involved the&#xD;
      mood response to tryptophan depletion (TD), achieved by oral loading with all essential amino&#xD;
      acids excepting the 5-HT precursor, tryptophan. We obtained preliminary evidence that the&#xD;
      mood lowering effect of TD depends upon the genotype for a functional polymorphism in the&#xD;
      promoter region of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), designated 5-HTTLPR, as well as upon family&#xD;
      history. In healthy females the s-allele and a positive family history for mood disorders&#xD;
      appeared to be additive risk factors for the development of depressive symptoms during TD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study employs quantitative PET imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glucose&#xD;
      metabolism to investigate the effect of variant 5-HTTLPR genotypes on the neurophysiological&#xD;
      response to TD. The current study will examine the relationship between 5-HTTLPR genotypes&#xD;
      and the TD effect on PFC metabolic activity. We will determine whether under TD the reduction&#xD;
      in PFC metabolism in response to TD will occur to a greater extent in subjects with the s/s&#xD;
      allele, and in subjects with a single s allele plus a family history of depression. We will&#xD;
      also examine whether this reduction in PFC metabolic activity is unique to subjects who&#xD;
      develop depressive symptoms during TD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, based upon evidence that 5-HT inhibits neuronal activity in the amygdala, and&#xD;
      modulates transmission of emotionally-salient sensory information from the sensory cortices&#xD;
      to the amygdala, we will test the hypothesis that in MDD, reduced serotonin function&#xD;
      associated with TD may disinhibit the amygdala response to sensory stimulation. This&#xD;
      hypothesis will be explored by assessing the physiological responses of the amygdala to&#xD;
      sensory stimuli that normally activate the amygdala, namely pictures of human faces that show&#xD;
      fearful or sad emotional expressions. We are particularly interested in determining whether&#xD;
      the amygdala CBF response to emotional stimuli during TD will be most prominently increased&#xD;
      in subjects carrying the s-allele of the 5-HTTLPR, and whether it will be unique to subjects&#xD;
      who develop depressive symptoms during TD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four unmedicated-remitted subjects with MDD and 24 healthy controls will be studied in&#xD;
      a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (according to 5-HTTLPR genotype) crossover&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
