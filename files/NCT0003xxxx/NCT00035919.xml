  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I safety study of a gene transfer drug for colorectal cancer that has spread&#xD;
      to the liver. The main purpose of this study is to determine if it is safe to give this new&#xD;
      intervention to persons with cancer, but we will also look for indications that the drug is&#xD;
      effective. Although the findings in animals that have cancer are encouraging, this is the&#xD;
      first time humans will receive this experimental gene transfer drug. A gene called cyclin G1&#xD;
      has been shown to play a very important part in cancer growth. In animal experiments, a&#xD;
      genetically modified virus (or vector)carrying a modified cyclin G1 gene caused the cancerous&#xD;
      tumors to grow much slower or even die. In this safety study, the drug will be injected&#xD;
      through the liver artery to get it near the cancer that has spread to the liver. The way the&#xD;
      gene gets into the cancer cells is by using a targeted vector that concentrates in the area&#xD;
      of the cancer to improve the delivery of the killing gene into cancer cells. The vector we&#xD;
      are using is a virus that has been changed so that the infectious genes have been removed and&#xD;
      instead carries the modified cyclin G1 gene.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety/toxicity of hepatic arterial administration of a matrix-targeted&#xD;
           retroviral vector bearing a dnG1 construct (Mx-dnG1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of hepatic arterial infusion of the Mx-dnG1 retroviral&#xD;
           vector administered as hepatic arterial infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To obtain preliminary data on molecular markers of tumor response&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify an anti-tumor response to hepatic artery administered Mx-dnG1 retroviral&#xD;
           vector&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Male and female patients, &gt;18 years old, with metastatic colorectal carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Nine to fifteen patients (3 to 6 patients treated at each of three dose levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage Treatment: Hepatic arterial infusion of the Mx-dnG1 retroviral vector once a day on&#xD;
      days 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three patients will receive the Mx-dnG1 retroviral vector at Dose Level I. If 1 of 3 patients&#xD;
      at Dose Level I develops a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (CTC Version 2.0) which appears to be&#xD;
      related or possibly related to the Mx-dnG1 retroviral vector, then 3 additional patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled at the same dose level. If at least 2 of the first 3, or 3 of 6, patients at Dose&#xD;
      Level I develop a grade 3 to 4 adverse event which appears to be related or possibly related&#xD;
      to the Mx-dnG1 retroviral vector, accrual into the study will be held until the data are&#xD;
      discussed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a decision is made whether to&#xD;
      continue or terminate study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If none of the first 3 or no more than 1 of the first 6 patients that have received vector at&#xD;
      Dose Level I develop a grade 3 or 4 adverse event which appears to be related or possibly&#xD;
      related to the dnG1 retroviral vector, the dose of the vector will be escalated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose LeveL---No. of Patients---Vector Dose---Maximum Volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I----------------3------------3 X 10e9 cfu-------500 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  II---------------3------------6 X 10e9 cfu-------500 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  III--------------3------------1 X 10e10 cfu------500 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention plan will be identical to the one described above for Dose Level I. The&#xD;
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be defined as one dose level below the level at which dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Clinical toxicity (DLT and MTD) as defined by patient performance status,&#xD;
      toxicity assessment score, hematologic, liver and coagulation profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Obtain preliminary data on molecular markers of tumor response. To assess&#xD;
      decrease in tumor size as detected by abdominal CT Scan at 3 and 6 weeks after treatment.&#xD;
      Evaluate the pharmacodynamics of hepatic arterial infusion of the Mx-dnG1 retroviral vector&#xD;
      administered as hepatic arterial infusion.&#xD;
