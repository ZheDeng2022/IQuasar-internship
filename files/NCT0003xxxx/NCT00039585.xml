      RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes&#xD;
      necessary for cancer cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating&#xD;
      patients who have refractory or relapsed ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer, or ovarian low malignant potential tumor.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the clinical activity of imatinib mesylate in patients with recurrent or&#xD;
           relapsed ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer or ovarian low&#xD;
           malignant potential tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate the biochemical modulation of signal transduction pathways downstream of&#xD;
           platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-kit tyrosine kinases in biopsy&#xD;
           tissue with outcome in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate the expression of PDGFR and c-kit in both archival and fresh biopsy tissue&#xD;
           with response and outcome in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the potential antiangiogenic activity of this drug in microdissected tumor&#xD;
           cell and stromal lysates of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the potential for collateral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition in biopsy&#xD;
           tissue of patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the application of surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization with&#xD;
           time-of-flight detection (SELDI-TOF) with artificial intelligence bioinformatics to&#xD;
           serially obtained serum samples for prediction of response in these patients and/or&#xD;
           toxicity of this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 47 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-20 months.&#xD;
