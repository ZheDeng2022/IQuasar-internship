      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VA HDL Intervention trial (VA-HIT) was a multicenter, placebo controlled, randomized&#xD;
      trial that showed that gemfibrozil significantly reduced major cardiovascular events in 2531&#xD;
      men with coronary heart disease, low levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and&#xD;
      low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. In addition to its unique lipid&#xD;
      profile, the VA-HIT population also had a high prevalence of diabetes, impaired fasting&#xD;
      glucose, or high fasting plasma insulin; central obesity; and hypertension, which are all&#xD;
      components (together with high triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol) of a constellation of&#xD;
      risk factors known as the metabolic syndrome. Since prior clinical trials have not enrolled&#xD;
      this type of population, the VA- HIT database is a unique resource.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study used the VA-HIT database to study additional risk markers that were measured in the&#xD;
      study population of 2,531 men with coronary heart disease. Specific analyses were: 1) the&#xD;
      association between levels of glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and other features of the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, occurrence of major cardiovascular outcomes, and gemfibrozil efficacy; 2)&#xD;
      the effect of gemfibrozil on progression of carotid atherosclerosis, as measured by B-mode&#xD;
      ultrasound; 3) the association between LDL particle size distribution and lipoprotein&#xD;
      subclass distribution; homocysteine; lipoprotein(a); C-reactive protein, tissue plasminogen&#xD;
      activator; fibrinogen; and factor VII; major cardiovascular outcomes and gemfibrozil&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
