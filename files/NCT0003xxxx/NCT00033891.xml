  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether infliximab (Remicade ) is safe and effective for the&#xD;
      treatment of dermatomyositis and polymyositis. Infliximab blocks the effect of a protein&#xD;
      called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which is associated with harmful inflammation in many&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with active dermatomyositis or polymyositis that does not&#xD;
      respond adequately to treatment with methotrexate and corticosteroids may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood&#xD;
      and urine tests, chest x-ray, pulmonary function test, skin test for tuberculosis, HIV test,&#xD;
      electromyography (described below), manual muscle testing, and functional assessments.&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (described below) will be done to assess the degree and location&#xD;
      of inflammation in the involved limbs. An electrocardiogram and echocardiogram will be done&#xD;
      if recent ones are not available. Patients who qualify for the study will be asked to undergo&#xD;
      two muscle biopsies (surgical removal and analysis of small pieces of muscle tissue), one&#xD;
      before initiation of treatment and another on the 16th week .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 3 mg/kg body weight of infliximab or&#xD;
      a placebo (inactive substance) by infusion through a vein over 2 hours. The infusions will be&#xD;
      given at the beginning of the treatment period (week 0) and at weeks 2, 6 and 14. At week 16,&#xD;
      strength will be assessed by manual muscle testing. Patients who improved with treatment will&#xD;
      continue with the same infusion dose on weeks 18, 22, 30, and 38. Those who do not improve&#xD;
      will be assigned by random allocation to receive either 5 mg/kg body weight or 10/mg/kg body&#xD;
      weight of infliximab on weeks 18, 22, 30 and 38. Those who did not improve who were&#xD;
      previously on the placebo infusion will receive an extra dose of either 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg&#xD;
      body weight of infliximab on week 16, while those patients who were previously on 3 mg/kg&#xD;
      body weight of infliximab who failed to meet the improvement criteria will receive an&#xD;
      infusion containing no medication on week 16. Patients will be admitted to the hospital for&#xD;
      infusions at weeks 0, 14 and 38; the rest will be given on an outpatient basis. After the&#xD;
      38th week, all infusions will be stopped and patients will be assessed on the 40th week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo some or all of the following tests and evaluations during&#xD;
      treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests every week to look for antibodies seen with muscle inflammation. Some of the&#xD;
           blood samples will be stored for later testing, including genetic studies to find&#xD;
           genetic differences related to inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin test for tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest x-rays at the beginning of the study (if a recent one is not available) and again&#xD;
           at weeks 16 and 40 to look for active infection, detect signs of past exposure or&#xD;
           infection with diseases such as tuberculosis, and assess the presence of lung disease&#xD;
           that might be related to the myositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI (usually of the legs) at the beginning of the study and again at weeks 16 and 40 to&#xD;
           measure disease activity and extent of muscle involvement. This will also give an idea&#xD;
           of the response to treatment. This test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce&#xD;
           images of body tissues. During the procedure the patient lies on a bed surrounded by a&#xD;
           metal cylinder (the scanner).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle biopsy at the beginning of the study to diagnose muscle inflammation and again at&#xD;
           week 16 to evaluate the response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electromyography if the patient has not had an EMG previously. For this test, small&#xD;
           needles are inserted into the muscle to assess the electrical activity of the muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose disease worsen with treatment or who develop serious drug-related side effects&#xD;
      will be taken off the study and referred back to their primary care physician for further&#xD;
      therapy. Patients who improve will be referred back to their primary physician at the end of&#xD;
      the study for possible continued treatment. Participants will be asked to return for&#xD;
      follow-up visits every 6 weeks for a total of 30 weeks to monitor long-term effects of the&#xD;
      drug&#xD;

      Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a cytokine that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many&#xD;
      diseases including inflammatory disorders, has been found to be elevated in the muscles of&#xD;
      patients with dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM). A subset of patients with DM and PM&#xD;
      do not respond readily to conventional therapy. Therefore, a controlled trial using&#xD;
      infliximab, a chimeric IgG(1) kappa monoclonal antibody against TNF, may provide a&#xD;
      therapeutic option and advance understanding in the pathogenesis of these diseases. This&#xD;
      study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of infliximab in patients with DM and&#xD;
      PM. We plan to enroll a maximum of 28 patients randomized at 1:1 ratio into 2 groups, placebo&#xD;
      vs. infliximab at 5 mg/kg body weight. In the first phase of the study the placebo and&#xD;
      infliximab infusions will be given at week 0, 2, 6 and 14. Primary outcome assessment will be&#xD;
      done at week 16. Those who respond according to the criteria set for improvement in MMT will&#xD;
      be given the option to remain on the same infusion (i.e. placebo or infliximab at 5 mg/kg&#xD;
      body weight) at weeks 22, 30 and 38. Placebo non-responders will be given infliximab at 5&#xD;
      mg/kg body weight in an open label fashion at weeks 16, 18, 22, 30 and 38. Patients who were&#xD;
      initially on 5 mg/kg body weight of infliximab who failed to respond based on the criteria&#xD;
      set will be placed on infliximab at 7.5 mg/kg body weight in an open label fashion on weeks&#xD;
      22, 30 and 38. Pharmacokinetic modeling will be done in both phases of the study. A muscle&#xD;
      biopsy will be done before treatment and again at 16 weeks of treatment. Microarray gene&#xD;
      expression profiling of the muscle biopsy specimens will be done before treatment and again&#xD;
      at 16 weeks. Clinical, functional and serological evaluations will be performed in every&#xD;
      visit to assess other responses to treatment. Patients will be followed for 30 weeks after&#xD;
      study termination to evaluate the long-term effects of the drug.&#xD;
