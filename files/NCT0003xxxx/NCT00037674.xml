  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topiramate&#xD;
      compared with lithium or placebo in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in&#xD;
      patients with Bipolar I Disorder.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of two dose levels of topiramate (200 and 400 milligrams/day) compared with&#xD;
      lithium and placebo in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with Biplar&#xD;
      I Disorder. The trial consists of 3 phases: a screening period; double-blind treatment for 12&#xD;
      weeks; and an optional open-label period of at least 6 months. Efficacy assessments include&#xD;
      the change from baseline to Day 21 for the total Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score. Also&#xD;
      included as efficacy assessments during the 12 week study are the Global Assessment Scale&#xD;
      (GAS), Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale&#xD;
      (BPRS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), and health-related quality of life measures at&#xD;
      specified time intervals. Safety assessments include evaluation of adverse events throughout&#xD;
      the study, rate of withdrawal from the study due to adverse events, and vital signs (blood&#xD;
      pressure and pulse) througout the study, as well as changes in clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
      (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis), electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations at&#xD;
      specified times. The study hypothesis is that the change from baseline in Young Mania Rating&#xD;
      Scale (YMSR) total score at Day 21 will be significantly better for the topiramate groups&#xD;
      than for the placebo group and that the study drug will be well tolerated by the patients.&#xD;
      Topiramate: oral tablets (50 milligrams[mg]); increasing from once daily (50mg) to 3-times&#xD;
      daily; target total daily dose 200mg or 400mg, maintained through Week 12. Lithium: oral&#xD;
      capsules (300mg); increasing from once daily (300mg) to three-times daily; target total daily&#xD;
      dose 1500-1800 mg.&#xD;
