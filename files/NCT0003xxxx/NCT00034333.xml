  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MTC-DOX is Doxorubicin or DOX, a chemotherapy drug, that is adsorbed, or made to &quot;stick&quot;, to&#xD;
      magnetic beads (MTCs). MTCs are tiny, microscopic particles of iron and carbon. When DOX is&#xD;
      added to MTCs, DOX attaches to the carbon part of the MTCs. MTC-DOX is directed to and&#xD;
      deposited in the area of a tumor, where it is thought that it then &quot;leaks&quot; through the blood&#xD;
      vessel walls. Once in the surrounding tissues, it is thought that Doxorubicin becomes &quot;free&#xD;
      from&quot; the magnetic beads and will then be able to act against the tumor cells. The iron&#xD;
      component of the particle has magnetic properties, making it possible to direct MTC-DOX to&#xD;
      specific tumor sites in the liver by placing a magnet on the body surface. It is hoped that&#xD;
      MTC-DOX used with the magnet may target the chemotherapy directly to liver tumors and provide&#xD;
      a treatment to patients with liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be sure of the effect of MTC-DOX on liver cancer, it will be compared to the effect of&#xD;
      Doxorubicin given through the vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatments will be administered every three weeks, (which is considered a study&#xD;
      treatment cycle), until you complete six treatment cycles, the tumor grows, disappears, or&#xD;
      you experience a side effect, which may cause you to leave the study. Follow-up visits will&#xD;
      occur on Days 3, 10, and 21 following treatment in the first cycle and Days 7 and 21 for the&#xD;
      remaining cycles, and also 60 days after you receive your last treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this Phase 2/3 study is to evaluate safety, tolerance, and efficacy&#xD;
      (survival time) of an MTC-DOX dosing strategy where the DOX dose is determined by tumor size&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients may be enrolled into this protocol only if all of the following inclusion criteria&#xD;
        are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed by CT scan and meets the criteria&#xD;
             described in Section 23.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total combined cross-sectional area of all hepatic tumors as determined by CT scan is&#xD;
             between 4 and 200 cm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Center of the tumor(s) mass must be &lt;/= 14 cm from the anterior lateral abdominal wall&#xD;
             as determined by cross-sectional imaging at baseline. This is required for optimal&#xD;
             placement of the magnet. If more than one tumor mass is present, all of the tumor&#xD;
             masses must meet this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is ambulatory with a Karnofsky performance status score &gt; 60 and an estimated life&#xD;
             expectancy of &gt; 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is judged by the investigator to have the initiative and means to be compliant with&#xD;
             the protocol and be within geographical proximity to allow follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have the ability to give informed written consent prior to initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female and of childbearing potential,must have a negative beta-HCG prior to&#xD;
             receiving treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must agree to use an effective method of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from enrollment if any of the following apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of cancer other than hepatocellular (excluding resected basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma; or curatively resected stage 1 or less cervical cancer if disease free for&#xD;
             5 years or more).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had prior local radiation therapy within the last 4 weeks, mediastinal radiation&#xD;
             therapy within the last 3 months, or chemotherapy within the last 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diffuse hepatocellular carcinoma or disease that precludes delivery of the drug to the&#xD;
             tumor via a vessel that feeds the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has another active medical condition(s) or organ disease(s) that may either compromise&#xD;
             patient safety or interfere with the safety and/or outcome (e.g., survival) evaluation&#xD;
             of the study drugs. While this exclusion is not limited to the following&#xD;
             abnormalities, if any of the following laboratory abnormalities are present, the&#xD;
             patient should be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;

        ALT or AST &gt;/= 5 x upper limit of normal Serum Creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL INR &gt;/= 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has cardiac dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has clinically significant pulmonary impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plans concomitant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal and/or biological&#xD;
             treatment for cancer including immunotherapy while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an indwelling cardiac pacemaker, cerebral aneurysm clips, or any other indwelling&#xD;
             device or appliance that could be adversely affected by the use of the external&#xD;
             magnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has documented evidence of hemachromatosis or hemosiderosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has CT or ultrasound evidence of portal vein invasion or thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior orthotopic hepatic transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received previous treatment with doxorubicin, idarubicin, and/or other&#xD;
             anthracyclines or anthracenes.&#xD;
&#xD;
