      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if treatment with the drug liposomal&#xD;
      vincristine can shrink or slow the growth of the patient's cancer. The safety of this drug&#xD;
      will also be studied.&#xD;

      Before and during the treatment patients will have exams done. These may include blood tests,&#xD;
      urine tests, bone marrow tests, tests of the central nervous system, x-rays, or MRI/CT test.&#xD;
      These are needed to measure the patient's clinical condition and progress. A physical exam&#xD;
      and blood tests (about 2 teaspoons) will be repeated at least one time weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since Liposomal Vincristine may prevent the body from making and/or keeping new blood cells,&#xD;
      prior to treatment patients will also have a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (AIDS virus) test,&#xD;
      a blood test to detect the presence of antibodies to the AIDS virus. A separate informed&#xD;
      consent will be given to be signed, in order to obtain permission for this test. Female&#xD;
      patients may also be required to have a urine pregnancy test before treatment may begin, as&#xD;
      it is not known how the drug may affect the unborn child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive liposomal vincristine through a central venous catheter (a plastic tube&#xD;
      usually inserted under the collar bone) over one hour, once every 14 days, + 2 days.&#xD;
      Patient's will also be given the drug docusate by the day liposomal vincristine is started.&#xD;
      This is done to try to prevent constipation as a side effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who show a continued response or stable disease without major side effects may&#xD;
      continue to receive liposomal vincristine for up to 24 months. Patients with solid tumors and&#xD;
      lymphoma will have X-rays performed every 8 weeks to follow the progression of their tumor.&#xD;
      Patients with leukemia will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy done after the first and&#xD;
      second months of treatment, and then every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The FDA has authorized the use of the study drug in&#xD;
      research. Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. Up to 30 patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      at UTMDACC.&#xD;
