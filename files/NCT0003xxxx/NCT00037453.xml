      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted a secondary analysis of the Sex Hormones and Lipoproteins in&#xD;
      Adolescent Males Study (HD/HL18281), a 3-year (1984-1987) study of lipids, blood pressure,&#xD;
      weight, fat patterning, and sex steroid hormones (SSH) in adolescent males. A total of 664&#xD;
      black and white males, ages 10-15, were enrolled into a study designed as a series of&#xD;
      repeated data collections over two years within age cohorts. Cross-sectional analyses were&#xD;
      used to explain differences during adolescence in sex steroid hormones and sex steroid&#xD;
      hormone-lipid relationships between black and white boys and between boys with and without a&#xD;
      family history of coronary heart disease.. When the data were originally collected for this&#xD;
      study, theoretical models of flexible longitudinal analytic techniques had been developed,&#xD;
      but were not available for computer use. These techniques, now supported by software, allow a&#xD;
      more powerful and complete analysis of these data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of these analyses was to explain the contribution of changes in sex steroid&#xD;
      hormones and fat patterning to changes in plasma concentrations of high (HDL-C) and low&#xD;
      (LDL-C) density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), and apolipoproteins (apo) Al,&#xD;
      All, and B occurring during puberty in males. Sex steroid hormones assayed included estradiol&#xD;
      (E2) and free testosterone (T). The following hypotheses were tested: (1) increasing free T&#xD;
      predicts/leads to decreases in HDL-C and increases in LDL-C, apo B, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio&#xD;
      in adolescent males; (2) increasing E2 predicts decreases in apo B, LDL-C and the LDL-C/HDL-&#xD;
      C ratio, but the resultant effects will vary with adiposity and fat patterning; (3) rapid&#xD;
      weight gain predicts increased central adiposity, defined as the ratio of truncal skinfolds&#xD;
      to total skinfolds, and with greater decreases in HDL-C and increases in triglycerides, apo&#xD;
      B, LDL-C and the LDL- C/HDL-C ratio. Rapid weight gain predicts increased E2, but the&#xD;
      atherogenic effects of increased central adiposity on lipids are greater than the anti-&#xD;
      atherogenic effects of E2. These analyses provided a better understanding of metabolic&#xD;
      factors underlying obesity-hormone-lipoprotein relationships.&#xD;
