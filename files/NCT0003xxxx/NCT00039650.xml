      This study will evaluate changes in T cells-infection-fighting white blood cells of the&#xD;
      immune system-in people given a drug called G-CSF before donating stem cells (immature bone&#xD;
      marrow cells) for transplantation. Originally, bone marrow cells were obtained using a needle&#xD;
      inserted into the hipbone of the donor. However, when it was discovered that immature bone&#xD;
      marrow cells also circulate in the blood, scientists began to develop techniques to collect&#xD;
      quantities of these cells from the blood instead of the bone. G-CSF is a blood cell growth&#xD;
      factor that pushes stem cells from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Stem cell donors are&#xD;
      given this drug 5 to 6 days before donation to make more cells available in the circulating&#xD;
      blood for collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cell transplantation requires careful regulation of immune cell function to allow the&#xD;
      donated stem cells to grow in the transplant recipient, to prevent the transplanted cells&#xD;
      from damaging the recipient, and to allow the recipient's new immune system to develop&#xD;
      normally so it can fight infections. Studies comparing the outcome of patients transplanted&#xD;
      with bone marrow cells with those transplanted with stem cells suggest that the G-CSF given&#xD;
      to stem cell donors affects the function of T cells in transplant recipients. This study will&#xD;
      collect white cells containing T cells before and after G-CSF administration to determine the&#xD;
      effects of the drug on both T cells and stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older who meet the health criteria for donating&#xD;
      blood may participate in this study. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collection (15 milliliters, or 3 teaspoons) to measure blood cell counts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram to assess heart function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apheresis to donate white blood cells. Participants will undergo two apheresis&#xD;
           procedures-once before receiving G-CSF and a second time immediately after finishing the&#xD;
           5-day course of the drug. For this procedure, whole blood is removed using a needle&#xD;
           placed in an arm vein. The blood is circulated through a cell separator machine, where&#xD;
           the white cells are removed and collected in a plastic bag. The rest of the blood,&#xD;
           including the red cells, platelets, and plasma, are returned to the donor through a&#xD;
           needle in the other arm. The procedure takes 2 to 3 hours, during which time the donor&#xD;
           lies quietly.&#xD;

      T cells play a critical role in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Many transplant&#xD;
      protocols involving HLA matched sibling donors make use of T cell mediated&#xD;
      graft-versus-leukemia or graft-versus-cancer effects to clear and/or prevent the recurrent&#xD;
      growth of malignant cells. Donor T cells are also responsible for reconstituting cellular&#xD;
      immune function following transplantation, but often cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).&#xD;
      Over the past several years the major source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation&#xD;
      has changed from marrow to granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral&#xD;
      blood stem cells (PBSCs). Despite the fact that patients transplanted with allogeneic&#xD;
      G-CSF-mobilized PBSCs receive approximately 10-fold more T-cells than those transplanted with&#xD;
      marrow, the incidence and severity of acute GVHD is similar among the two groups, although&#xD;
      chronic GVHD is higher in PBSC recipients. Using cellular function assays some investigators&#xD;
      have shown that G-CSF affects T cell function. When healthy subjects are given G-CSF, a&#xD;
      decrease is seen in the concentration of circulating type 1 helper T cells (Th1) with&#xD;
      subsequent falls in the cytokine levels produced by these cells. In contrast, an increase&#xD;
      occurs in the concentration of type 2 helper T cells (TH2) and the level of cytokines&#xD;
      produced. The purpose of this study is to assess G-CSF-induced changes in T cells. cDNA&#xD;
      microarrays will be used to compare genes expressed in CD4 and CD8 cells before and after&#xD;
      G-CSF is given. Up to fifteen healthy subjects will be given a typical PBSC mobilization&#xD;
      regimen for allogeneic transplants: 10 micrograms/kg/day of G-CSF for 5 days. Peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells will be collected by apheresis before the mobilization regimen is&#xD;
      given and the day after the mobilization is complete. CD4, CD8, and CD34+ cells will be&#xD;
      isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and gene expression will be assessed&#xD;
      using cDNA microarrays containing over 8,000 genes.&#xD;
