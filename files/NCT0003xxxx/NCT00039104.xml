  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining zoledronate with BMS-275291 in&#xD;
      treating patients who have prostate cancer that has not responded to previous hormone&#xD;
      therapy. Zoledronate may prevent bone loss and stop the growth of tumor cells in bone.&#xD;
      BMS-275291 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer&#xD;
      cell growth. Combining zoledronate with BMS-275291 may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the confirmed response rate of hormone refractory prostate cancer patients&#xD;
      treated with Zometa with BMS-275291.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile associated with this treatment in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the overall and progression-free survival associated with this treatment&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore changes markers for bone turnover, fPYR, fDPYR, and serum samples for&#xD;
      cross-linked N-telopeptides from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess changes in bone tumor metabolism after treatment using PET scans. V. To assess&#xD;
      changes in MMP-1, MMP-9, VEGF and bFGF from baseline after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy (yes vs no) and participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive zoledronate IV over at least 15 minutes on day 1 and oral BMS-275291&#xD;
      daily on days 1-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 10/10/2003): Patients receive zoledronate as in Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up&#xD;
      to 2 years.&#xD;
