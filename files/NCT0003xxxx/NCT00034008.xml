  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether or not Healing Touch therapy (HT) helps to&#xD;
      treat the stress of babies in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Healing Touch is a&#xD;
      gentle use of human touch - a light, soft placement without moving of the HT therapist's hand&#xD;
      on a baby's body - and energy to create balance and relaxation. The goal of HT treatment is&#xD;
      to help babies rest better, have less pain and discomfort and to heal more quickly. Healing&#xD;
      Touch works along with all the treatments and medicines babies receive as part of ordinary&#xD;
      care in the NICU.&#xD;

      Stress is an inherent part of the experience for the neonate who is critically ill and&#xD;
      unstable during the initial days in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Individualized&#xD;
      developmentally appropriate nursing care is standard of care (SOC) and provides significant&#xD;
      reduction in stressful stimulation. Developmentally appropriate, nurturing stimulation is&#xD;
      often lacking. Touch is critical in development of neonatal self-regulation. Healing Touch&#xD;
      (HT), a gentle touch and energy healing therapy, is proposed to ameliorate stress and enhance&#xD;
      regulatory system development. This R21 feasibility study will involve 40 critically-ill&#xD;
      neonates on admission to the NICU, in a parallel, randomized controlled trial, single blind&#xD;
      design of 2 groups (N=20 each). In each day for a total of 7 days, each subject will have 2&#xD;
      study conditions: a significant, routinely-occurring, specified stressor followed immediately&#xD;
      by either HT+SOC or SOC alone. The treated group will have HT + SOC following a stressor for&#xD;
      one study condition and SOC alone for the second study condition; the SOC group will have&#xD;
      only SOC for both study conditions. This design allows the treated group to be paired to its&#xD;
      own control on each day. During each study condition, markers of stress response will be&#xD;
      collected: physiological [heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (Sa02)&#xD;
      and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) for cardiac vagal tone (Vna)] and behavioral&#xD;
      [Brazelton states 1-6 and cues (self-regulatory and stress) per Bigsby]. The primary&#xD;
      hypotheses (all in comparison to SOC alone) are: a) HT will result in improved stress&#xD;
      recovery within each study condition, reflected by HR, RR, and Sa02;.b) HT will result in an&#xD;
      accumulative improvement in the stress response from day 1-7, reflected by HR, RR and Sa02;&#xD;
      c) In infants &gt; 30 weeks gestation, HT will result in + _ improved stress response within&#xD;
      each study condition, reflected by increased amplitude of RSA and increased cardiac vagal&#xD;
      tone (Vna), or stress reactivity; and d) In infants &gt; 30 weeks gestation, HT will result in&#xD;
      an accumulative + _ improvement in the stress response from day 1-7, reflected by increased&#xD;
      amplitude of RSA and increased cardiac vagal tone (Vna) both in stress reactivity (measured&#xD;
      during the stress response) and in stress vulnerability (measured during sleep). Secondary&#xD;
      hypotheses are: a) HT will result in improved neonatal behavioral state and cues during&#xD;
      stress recovery within each study condition, as compared with standard of care alone; b) HT&#xD;
      will result in accumulative improvement in behavior from day 1-7, during the stress response,&#xD;
      as reflected by decrease in stress cues, increased self-regulatory cues, more relaxed&#xD;
      behavioral state or decreased frequency of state change. Data analysis will be done using&#xD;
      comparison measures [paired, grouped and multiple T-tests]. To assess the data&#xD;
      longitudinally, a general linear mixed model will be used; [repeated measures analysis of&#xD;
      variance and GEE model]. This study will begin our research in enhancement of neonatal&#xD;
      regulatory system development and response to stress and will lay a foundation for larger&#xD;
      scale prospective effectiveness and mechanism studies.&#xD;

          -  Admission to the NICU requiring Level III care during the study period (7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants requiring ventilator support within the first 48 hours after admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants requiring tube feedings &gt; 50% of the time at the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both term and preterm infants (Any neonate admitted to the NICU - 20+ weeks gestation&#xD;
             to term or more.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
