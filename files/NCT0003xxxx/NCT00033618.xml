  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ixabepilone in treating patients who&#xD;
      have metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different&#xD;
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the response rate and toxicity of BMS-247550 given in two dosing schedules in&#xD;
      taxane-na√Øve and taxane-exposed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To provide information about the response rate and toxicity of BMS-247550 given in two&#xD;
      dosing schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure surviving expression and correlate with the therapeutic responsiveness to&#xD;
      BMS-247550.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the changes in tumor vascular density and endothelial cell apoptosis in&#xD;
      response to therapy and the correlation of these changes to outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to prior taxane&#xD;
      therapy (yes vs no) and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses past CR&#xD;
      if a minimum of 6 courses have been administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Baseline tumor measurements/evaluations must be obtained &lt; 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received up to one prior biotherapy regimen and treatment must have&#xD;
             been completed at least 4 weeks prior to randomization; no more than two prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy regimens for recurrent and/or metastatic disease are permitted; patients&#xD;
             may have received prior docetaxel or paclitaxel, but must not have been previously&#xD;
             treated with an investigational taxane; chemotherapy treatment must have been&#xD;
             completed at least 4 weeks prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the only site of measurable disease is a previously irradiated area, the patient&#xD;
             must have documented progressive disease or biopsy-proven residual carcinoma;&#xD;
             persistent disease after radiotherapy must be biopsy-proven at least 8 weeks after the&#xD;
             completion of radiotherapy; patients must have completed radiotherapy at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a concurrent malignancy except curatively treated basal or&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix; patients with&#xD;
             prior malignancies who have been disease-free &gt; 2 years are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have ECOG performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.2 mg OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 ml/min NOTE: Either&#xD;
             calculated or actual creatinine clearance can be used NOTE: The creatinine clearance&#xD;
             may be calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (SGOT) AST, (SGPT) ALT =&lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alkaline phosphatase =&lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum calcium within institutional normal range and no history of malignancy&#xD;
             associated hypercalcemia&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from the effects of any recent surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients must not be pregnant or breastfeeding; the effects of BMS-247550 on&#xD;
             pregnant women and on fetuses are unknown; however, the known toxicities, which&#xD;

             mechanism of action of this compound, stabilization of microtubules in dividing cells,&#xD;
             is highly likely to be teratogenic; taxanes, which have a similar mechanism of action,&#xD;
             are known to be teratogenic NOTE: A negative serum pregnancy test is required =&lt; 2&#xD;
             weeks of randomization for women of childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must agree to use an&#xD;
