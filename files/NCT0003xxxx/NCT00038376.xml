  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate of patients with T-cell&#xD;
      malignancies to combination therapy using interferon-alpha (Roferon) and Isotretinoin&#xD;
      (Accutane).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retinoids have shown activity in T-cell malignancies in past studies (both isotretinoin and&#xD;
      etretinate) with an overall response rate of about 60%. One third of those responses were&#xD;
      complete responses. Interferon-alpha has proven efficacy in wide ranges of human malignancies&#xD;
      including T-cell lymphomas as a single agent. A clinical trial was needed to evaluate the&#xD;
      response rate of these two agents combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interferon is a normal body protein, which is made by cells after exposure to viruses. It&#xD;
      acts as a messenger to warn surrounding cells of invasions by viruses and, possibly, by&#xD;
      cancer cells. Isotretinoin is a synthetic form of Vitamin A which effects the growth of&#xD;
      normal cells and cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants participating in this study will receive a combination of alpha-interferon and&#xD;
      isotretinoin. Alpha-interferon will be given once a day for an initial period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will take the drug home, where a nurse or family member of the participant (who&#xD;
      can be trained at UTMDACC) will inject it just under the skin (SQ). Isotretinoin will be&#xD;
      given by mouth twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant's disease does not show a response, the alpha-interferon and the&#xD;
      isotretinoin will be increased. If side effects occur, the dose of alpha-interferon and/or&#xD;
      isotretinoin will be decreased by 50%. If the side effects are severe, therapy will be&#xD;
      discontinued. If the participant's disease is unresponsive or worsens, the participant will&#xD;
      be taken off study and other treatments will be recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responding participants will be placed on a maintenance schedule for as long as they respond.&#xD;
      Up to 60 participants will be studied at UT M.D. Anderson Cancer Center to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Alpha-interferon and isotretinoin are FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available.&#xD;
