  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common group of viruses that infect humans are enteroviruses. Enteroviruses produce&#xD;
      illnesses in children which may range from very mild (summer colds) to severe (infections of&#xD;
      the brain, liver, and heart). The purpose of this study is to determine if a new drug called&#xD;
      pleconaril helps treat babies with enteroviral sepsis. In addition, researchers are&#xD;
      attempting to determine a safe and effective dose of pleconaril to help babies with this&#xD;
      disease. Infants who are 15 days or younger when diagnosed with enteroviral disease are&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Two out of 3 babies will be randomly assigned to receive Pleconaril&#xD;
      and the other one out of three will receive a placebo (inactive substitute). Participants&#xD;
      will be hospitalized while receiving study medication. Babies will receive standard treatment&#xD;
      care for their symptoms and will be observed for their medical progress. Participants may be&#xD;
      in the study for up to 2 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Enteroviral infection is a serious health problem in the newborn infant. Approximately 60-70%&#xD;
      of infants diagnosed with enteroviral disease within the first 10 days of life acquire their&#xD;
      infection by transmission from the mother at the time of delivery. Congenital infection is&#xD;
      rare but often fatal. Perinatal transmission of enteroviral infections in newborn nurseries&#xD;
      has also been implicated as an important route of spread of the disease in newborn infants&#xD;
      and postnatal transmission of enteroviral infections during seasonal peaks of enterovirus&#xD;
      activity occurs commonly. Thus, during periods of high prevalence of enterovirus infection in&#xD;
      the community, there are many potential sources of infection both during and after discharge&#xD;
      from the nursery, including the mother, other family members, and hospital staff.&#xD;
      Approximately 75% of cases of neonatal enteroviral disease carry a benign outcome, with&#xD;
      diagnosis and symptomatic treatment in non-intensive care unit settings. For the remainder of&#xD;
      patients, more serious consequences can result from systemic enteroviral infection, including&#xD;
      meningoencephalitis, cardiovascular collapse, myocarditis, or hepatitis. These last two&#xD;
      organ-specific complications carry high mortality rates. Historically, symptom management and&#xD;
      supportive care have been the rule in the management of these patients. No specific&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention is currently available for the management of these gravely ill&#xD;
      neonates. The current study will evaluate the antiviral drug pleconaril as a treatment for&#xD;
      enterovial sepsis syndrome. This trial is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study to evaluate the virologic efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of pleconaril in the&#xD;
      treatment of severe enteroviral sepsis syndrome. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to drug or&#xD;
      placebo. For enrollment into this trial, infants must have evidence of severe hepatic&#xD;
      involvement, myocardial involvement, and/or consumptive coagulopathy. Their age must be 15&#xD;
      days or less at the time of the onset of disease symptoms. Enrollment will continue until 45&#xD;
      subjects with confirmed enteroviral disease have been enrolled. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      investigation is to determine if administration of pleconaril to critically ill neonates with&#xD;
      enteroviral sepsis syndrome results in more rapid clearance of virus from various body sites.&#xD;
      Other objectives of this study are to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of this drug in&#xD;
      this patient population. The effects of pleconaril on measures of clinical outcome also will&#xD;
      be evaluated. These include the degree of inotropic and blood product support required during&#xD;
      the acute illness; duration of hospitalization; the time to resolution of residual organ&#xD;
      injury; and short-term (at 2 months of age) and long-term (at 1 year of age) survival. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be the percentage of patients shedding virus (as detected by viral&#xD;
      culture) from the oropharynx (i.e. throat) 5 days after beginning study drug. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will include: duration (in days) of shedding of virus (as detected by viral&#xD;
      culture) from the oropharynx, rectum, urine, and serum; change in baseline laboratory&#xD;
      abnormalities [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin,&#xD;
      platelets, creatinine), reflecting either resolution or progression of enteroviral disease;&#xD;
      pleconaril pharmacokinetics; safety; duration (in days) of total hospitalization; survival at&#xD;
      2 months of age; time (in days) to resolution of residual organ-related abnormalities&#xD;
      following acute disease; and survival at 1 year of age.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Suspected or proven enteroviral disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One or more of the following three conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) greater than 3 times the upper limit&#xD;
                  of normal (ULN);&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. platelet count less than 100,000 and prothrombin time greater than 1.5 times ULN&#xD;
                  and positive fibrin split products;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. cardiac shortening fraction less than 25% or cardiac ejection fraction less than&#xD;
                  50% as measured by echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of bacterial or non-enterovirus viral pathogen that can produce the&#xD;
             constellation of presenting symptoms, known at the time of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Imminent demise (estimated life expectancy less than 24 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cyanotic congenital heart lesion.&#xD;

             judgment of the participating investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants known to be born to women who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive&#xD;
             (but HIV testing is not required for study entry). These infants are at known risk of&#xD;
             acquiring HIV, which would alter their immune response to other infections, including&#xD;
             enteroviral infections. Additionally, they may be receiving antiretroviral and/or&#xD;
             antiviral drugs during the time in which the study of pleconaril is being conducted.&#xD;
             As such, they will be excluded if the mother's positive HIV status is known at the&#xD;
             time of evaluation for study inclusion. If at any point following enrollment it is&#xD;
             learned that an infant is HIV positive, however, he/she will be continued on the study&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
