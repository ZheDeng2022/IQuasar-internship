    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how controlling HIV infection with HAART (highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy) affects the response to hepatitis C treatment with peginterferon&#xD;
      alpha-2b and ribavirin in HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C. HIV worsens liver&#xD;
      disease caused by hepatitis C. Since treatment of HIV infection with HAART improves immune&#xD;
      function, it may be beneficial to start HAART before treating HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with chronic hepatitis C infection may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Patients must have an HCV viral load greater than 2000 copies/mL and&#xD;
      a CD4 count that is either more than 500 cells/mm3, or more than 350 cells/mm3 with an HIV&#xD;
      viral load no greater than 40,000 particles/mL. Candidates will be screened for current or&#xD;
      previous diseases, conditions or treatments that may exclude them from this study. Screening&#xD;
      includes a medical history and physical examination, eye examination, blood and urine tests,&#xD;
      chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG), liver ultrasound, and, possibly, a liver biopsy, if a&#xD;
      recent one is not available. The liver biopsy is optional and is done to determine the&#xD;
      severity of liver disease. Patients will be sedated for this test. The skin in the area over&#xD;
      the biopsy site is numbed with a local anesthetic, and a needle is inserted rapidly into and&#xD;
      out of the liver to obtain a small tissue sample. Patients remain in the hospital overnight&#xD;
      for monitoring. Women of childbearing age will have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment&#xD;
      groups: 1) pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks (control group); or 2) HAART for 6&#xD;
      months, followed by 48 weeks of pegylated interferon and ribavirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAART group - Patients taking HAART will be followed in the clinic every 2 weeks for the&#xD;
      first month and then monthly for the next 5 months. After 6 months of HAART they will begin&#xD;
      taking pegylated interferon and ribavirin and will follow the dosing and follow-up schedule&#xD;
      outlined below for patients in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group - Patients will have weekly injections under the skin of peginterferon alpha-2b&#xD;
      and ribavirin pills daily by mouth. Clinic visits will be scheduled as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 1, 3, 7, and 21 - Blood will be drawn for safety tests and to measure blood levels&#xD;
           of HIV and HCV. HCV medications will be injected on days 7 and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 52, 56, and 64 - Blood and urine&#xD;
           tests will be done to determine the side effects of pegylated interferon and ribavirin&#xD;
           treatment and its effect on the HCV infection. Eye examinations will be done every 3&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 48 or end of treatment - Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin will&#xD;
           stop after 48 weeks. At this time (or earlier for those who do not complete the 48 weeks&#xD;
           of treatment), patients will return to the clinic for a routine visit, blood tests&#xD;
           (including a test for hepatitis B) and abdominal ultrasound. Patients may also be&#xD;
           hospitalized for 2 days for a repeat optional liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 72 and extended follow-up visits - At week 72, patients will return for blood tests&#xD;
           and a routine clinic visit. HCV viral load will be measured. Follow-up visits every 3&#xD;
           months for an additional year will include a blood test to measure HCV viral load and a&#xD;
           complete physical examination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has&#xD;
      risen dramatically since the explosion of the HIV pandemic twenty years ago, with one third&#xD;
      of all HIV positive persons also infected with HCV. Numerous studies have suggested that HIV&#xD;
      exacerbates several steps in the natural history of hepatitis C, and as survival among&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients increases, hepatitis C-related morbidity and mortality is expected to&#xD;
      follow a similar trend in coinfected patients. Some investigators advocate the initiation of&#xD;
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for this population prior to the initiation of&#xD;
      HCV therapy. It is postulated that HAART will improve the host immune function by increasing&#xD;
      the CD4+ cell count and decreasing HIV viral load, thought to be advantageous for patients&#xD;
      starting HCV therapy. Despite its promising hypothesis, whether HAART ultimately leads to a&#xD;
      reduction in HCV load in coinfected persons remains controversial. This is a non-blinded,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of HAART on the immunologic, virologic,&#xD;
      and clinical responses to HCV treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin in coinfected&#xD;
      individuals with CD4 greater than or equal to 500 cells/mm (3) or greater than or equal to&#xD;
      350 cells/mm(3) and a viral load less than or equal to 40,000 copies/mL. The study will also&#xD;
      address the safety and efficacy of administering a combination of HAART along with&#xD;
      peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin to HIV-infected individuals. 128 patients who are&#xD;
      coinfected with HIV and HCV will be recruited for the study and randomized to receive one of&#xD;
      two treatment regimens: 1) control group: will be treated with peginterferon alpha-2b and&#xD;
      ribavirin for 48 weeks, or 2) experimental group: will be treated with highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy for six months. At that point, they will begin receiving peginterferon&#xD;
      alpha-2b and ribavirin at the same doses as the control group for 48 weeks. During the&#xD;
      72-week follow up period, these patients will be monitored for both HCV and HIV viral loads&#xD;
      and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. The results of the study will enable us to better delineate the&#xD;
      relationship between the immune reconstitution effects induced by HAART and the clinical,&#xD;
      immunologic, and virologic responses of coinfected persons treated with peginterferon and&#xD;
      ribavirin. In addition, evaluating the safety of coadministering peginterferon, ribavirin,&#xD;
      and HAART will further refine the best therapeutic regimen for this patient population.&#xD;
