  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the VA, we are achieving progress in decreasing amputation rates through early&#xD;
      identification and multidisciplinary treatment of patients at risk for limb loss. Despite&#xD;
      these accomplishments, however, clinical outcomes post-amputation, especially for PVD&#xD;
      patients, have changed little because of patients' poor cardiovascular condition complicated&#xD;
      by the injurious consequences of imposed inactivity begun in the preoperative period and&#xD;
      continuing through convalescence. If not aggressively managed throughout all phases of&#xD;
      recovery, these problems quickly render patients, already at risk, incapable of the rigors of&#xD;
      rehabilitation as well as lead to reamputation, rehabilitation failure, and secondary&#xD;
      complications. In our research, we are trying to transform this clinical scenario by applying&#xD;
      what has succeeded in cardiac rehabilitation to services provided to amputees. In a series of&#xD;
      studies, we are studying how to incorporate secondary CV risk factor modification and&#xD;
      aggressive exercise interventions into conventional amputation rehabilitation through a&#xD;
      program that we have named Healthy Heart Amputation Rehabilitation Therapy (Healthy&#xD;
      H.A.R.T.). Our goal is to better: 1) increase aerobic capacity and promote rehabilitation&#xD;
      achievements and quality of life, and 2) prevent postoperative complications and curtail&#xD;
      further peripheral vascular deterioration through interventions found successful in cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The basic assumption of this study will be that cardiovascular status and,&#xD;
      thus, aerobic capacity is a most critical factor for rehabilitation success.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this line of investigation is to evaluate the efficacy of an integrated&#xD;
      cardiovascular amputation rehabilitation program (Healthy Heart Amputation Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Therapy (Healthy H.A.R.T.)) that concentrates on secondary CV risk factor modification and&#xD;
      utilizes an aggressive exercise program to: 1) increase aerobic capacity and promote&#xD;
      rehabilitation achievements and quality of life and 2) prevent postoperative complications&#xD;
      and curtail further peripheral vascular deterioration. Given the recognized merits of&#xD;
      systematically building upon incremental research achievements to develop comprehensive and&#xD;
      multi-faceted clinical programs, we will study the above one step at a time, working up to&#xD;
      more wide-scale investigations of the benefits of the integrated Healthy H.A.R.T. program as&#xD;
      conceptualized. The following phases are planned:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 (this proposed 3-year study): examining the clinical effectiveness of Healthy&#xD;
      H.A.R.T.'s exercise components. Findings will be disseminated through presentations and&#xD;
      publications during and immediately following study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: revising amputation rehabilitation and P.A.C.T. program care algorithms as indicated&#xD;
      by Phase 1 findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3: investigating how to implement Healthy H.A.R.T.'s exercise components in distance,&#xD;
      off-site, and home-based programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 4: developing broader scale investigations of additional components of Healthy H.A.R.T.&#xD;
      using physiologic and patient care outcome measures, cost-benefit ratios, patient and&#xD;
      clinician satisfaction, and service potential offset by resource utilization and expense&#xD;
      reports for widespread application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Question/Hypothesis: In Healthy H.A.R.T. Part 1, we will test the hypothesis: Dysvascular&#xD;
      amputees participating in an aggressive exercise program (Healthy H.A.R.T. exercise) in&#xD;
      conjunction with amputation rehabilitation will obtain a greater aerobic capacity and exhibit&#xD;
      better rehabilitation achievements and quality of life than those receiving conventional&#xD;
      amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design: This study (Healthy Heart Amputation Rehabilitation Therapy (Healthy&#xD;
      HART) - Part 1) involves an intent-to-treat designed randomized 2-group pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention study to examine if conventional rehabilitation augmented by Healthy&#xD;
      H.A.R.T. exercise: a) increases aerobic capacity, b) promotes rehabilitation achievements,&#xD;
      and c) improves quality of life. Last, cost estimates of the two therapies will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Houston VAMC amputation patients progress through standardized decision making regarding&#xD;
      surgery options and level of amputation followed by conventional post-operative medical and&#xD;
      surgical care and rehabilitation according to standard VA Amputee Care Algorithm schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Decisions on Surgery and Amputation Level: Decisions about elective amputations&#xD;
      performed by the General Surgery service are made jointly with surgeon and PM&amp;R consultation.&#xD;
      Decisions regarding amputation level are made in light of surgeon-assessed clinical and&#xD;
      physiologic signs and patient characteristics and PM&amp;R assessments of functionality and&#xD;
      patient characteristics such as cognitive function, comorbidity, and rehabilitation&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;
