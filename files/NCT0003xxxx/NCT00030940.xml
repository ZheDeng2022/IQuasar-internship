  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the role of various immune factors involved in producing the disease&#xD;
      symptoms in stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and follow disease progression in patients. SPS is a&#xD;
      progressive disease in which unexpected noises, touches or stressful events set off muscle&#xD;
      spasms and stiffness. It is thought to be an autoimmune disease in which the body produces&#xD;
      antibodies that attack certain healthy tissues. A better understanding of the disease may&#xD;
      help researchers design new therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of any age with SPS may be eligible for this study, except those who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of serum anti-GAD antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have very advanced disease that precludes traveling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have severe cardiovascular, renal, or other end-organ-disease states&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical and neurological examinations&#xD;
      to confirm the diagnosis of SPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, those enrolled in the study will be followed at the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
      every 6 months for 2 years (months 6, 12, 18, and 24) to have the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical and neurological examinations and review of symptoms (every visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for routine tests and for research studies (every visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stiffness assessment (every visit) - Patients are asked a series of questions about&#xD;
           their stiffness, which physicians rate according to the number of stiff areas (e.g.,&#xD;
           0-no stiff areas; 1-stiffness of the lower trunk; 2-stiffness of the upper trunk, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymphapheresis (at the beginning of the study and at 12 months) - This is a procedure&#xD;
           for collecting large quantities of white blood cells. A needle is placed in a vein in&#xD;
           the arm. Blood flows from the vein through a plastic tube (catheter) into a machine that&#xD;
           spins the blood, separating it into its components. The white blood cells (lymphocytes)&#xD;
           are removed, and the rest of the blood-plasma, red cells and platelets-is returned to&#xD;
           the body through a second needle placed in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrophysiologic studies - These studies include electromyography and nerve conduction&#xD;
           testing. For electromyography, a small needle is inserted into a few muscles and the&#xD;
           patient is asked to relax or to contract the muscles. The electrical activity of the&#xD;
           muscle cells is recorded and analyzed by a computer. For nerve conduction testing,&#xD;
           nerves are stimulated through small wire electrodes attached to the skin, and the&#xD;
           response is recorded and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture (at the beginning of the study and at 12 months) - This procedure is&#xD;
           done to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which bathes the brain and spinal cord.&#xD;
           After a local anesthetic is administered, a needle is inserted in the space between the&#xD;
           bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord. About 2&#xD;
           tablespoons of fluid is collected through the needle.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by stiffness&#xD;
      of the trunk or limb muscles and frequent muscle spasms induced by unexpected visual,&#xD;
      auditory, or somatosensory stimuli. It is an incapacitating disorder that leads to recurrent&#xD;
      falls and impaired ambulation. The cause of the disease is unknown but an autoimmune&#xD;
      pathogenesis is implicated based on its association with other autoimmune diseases and&#xD;
      auto-antibodies, specific HLA haplotypes and high titer antibodies against GAD, the&#xD;
      rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of GABA. Understanding the autoimmune mechanisms of&#xD;
      SPS is fundamental to refine the diagnostic criteria and develop specific therapies. The&#xD;
      goals of this study are: a) define the natural history of SPS in a homogeneous cohort of&#xD;
      patients, b) explore a pathogenetic link between SPS and viral infections based on the known&#xD;
      peptide homology between GAD and certain viruses and c) establish GAD-specific T-cell clones&#xD;
      and search for candidate antigenic epitopes using synthetic peptide libraries. Collected&#xD;
      clinical data will be used to delineate the rate of disease progression and the frequency of&#xD;
      association with other autoimmune illnesses, auto-antibodies, or malignancies. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that the knowledge acquired from the study will help us understand the mechanism&#xD;
      of the disease and design antigen-specific therapeutic strategies. This is an investigative&#xD;
      study intended to define the natural history and pathogenesis of SPS. No new therapy will be&#xD;
      provided except of standard care.&#xD;
