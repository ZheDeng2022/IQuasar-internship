    <textblock>
      In this study, patients will be randomized to one of three dose regimen groups. Each dose of&#xD;
      OvaRex MAb-B43.13 is 2 mg by slow intravenous administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive two doses, one month apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive three consecutive monthly doses, then at 12-week intervals through 2&#xD;
      years or until disease relapse up to a total of 9 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 will receive six consecutive monthly doses, then at 12-week intervals through 2 years&#xD;
      or until disease relapse up to a total of 11 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare the time to disease relapse of patients who demonstrate an immune&#xD;
      response to OvaRex MAb-B43.13 with time to disease relapse of those who do not demonstrate an&#xD;
      immune response to OvaRex MAb-B43.13. Differences in the percentage of patients demonstrating&#xD;
      an immune response in each dose regimen group will also be assessed.&#xD;

             remaining following the staging laparotomy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
