      The purpose of the proposed DVA cooperative study is to evaluate the efficacy of exposure&#xD;
      therapy for treating PTSD and associated problems in female veterans and active duty military&#xD;
      personnel. We propose to compare exposure therapy, Prolonged Exposure, with a comparison&#xD;
      therapy that focuses on current problems, Present Centered Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized clinical trial involving 384 female veterans and active duty&#xD;
      personnel in 11 VA medical centers and 1 DoD medical center. All subjects, even&#xD;
      self-referrals, will enter the study through referrals by mental health clinicians at the&#xD;
      participating sites. Following informed consent, subjects will be screened for inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion diagnoses. If they meet these criteria and agree to participate, they will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the two treatments, which will occur weekly for 10 weeks.&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed before treatment, immediately following treatment, and 3 and 6&#xD;
      months after the end of treatment. The primary outcome is PTSD severity. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      are anxiety and depression. Exploratory outcomes include associated features of PTSD, such as&#xD;
      dissociation and substance abuse; psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health,&#xD;
      satisfaction with treatment, and service utilization. Both treatments will be described in&#xD;
      detail in a treatment manual and monitored intensively to ensure that they are administered&#xD;
      correctly.&#xD;

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to one of two interventions: Prolonged Exposure&#xD;
      (PE) consisting of 10 weekly treatment sessions that include education about and exposure to&#xD;
      the memories of the trauma to which the patient was engaged; or Present Center Therapy (PCT),&#xD;
      which will consist of a control therapy of the same duration that will provide emotional&#xD;
      support for the trauma victim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Prolonged Exposure (PE) will be more effective than Present-Centered&#xD;
      Therapy (PCT) for the treatment of PTSD due to military-related trauma in women veterans. PE&#xD;
      specifically targets PTSD symptoms, and the CAPS, our primary outcome measure. The Clinician&#xD;
      Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is considered to be the gold-standard for PTSD assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: PE will be more effective than PCT for treating the anxiety and&#xD;
      depression that often are comorbid with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Abstract: As noted in a recent report on the VA Women's Health Project, it is important&#xD;
      to study women veterans because they are increasingly seeking VA health care. For many women&#xD;
      veterans, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a specific healthcare concern that is&#xD;
      associated with substantial psychosocial and functional disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was proposed in response to the Research Priority Announcement on Posttraumatic&#xD;
      Stress Disorder research issued August 1, 1997, as a study aimed a special subpopulation of&#xD;
      VA patients with PTSD: women veterans who have been traumatized during their military&#xD;
      service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first planning meeting for the study was held January 20-21, 2000 in Washington, DC. The&#xD;
      protocol was submitted on August 1, 2000; it was reviewed and approved by the Cooperative&#xD;
      Studies Evaluation Committee on October 10, 2000. Intake of training cases is expected to&#xD;
      begin 01/01/2002.&#xD;
