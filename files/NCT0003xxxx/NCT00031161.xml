  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the safety of dichloroacetate (DCA) with a low-tyrosine diet&#xD;
      given with or without nitisinone (NTBC) in children with chronic lactic acidosis (CLA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DCA is being studied for the treatment of patients with CLA, which is a rare collection of&#xD;
      mitochondrial metabolism errors causing cellular energy failure and early death. DCA causes&#xD;
      reversible liver and peripheral nerve toxicity and it interrupts both tyrosine and heme&#xD;
      metabolism. The inhibitory effect of DCA on mammalian tyrosine metabolism elicits biochemical&#xD;
      changes similar to those observed in hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT). However, some&#xD;
      reports and studies indicate substantial reduction in the biochemical and clinical&#xD;
      consequences of HT may occur when patients are treated concomitantly with a low-tyrosine diet&#xD;
      (LTD) and the chemical NTBC, which inhibits an early step in tyrosine catabolism. Possibly,&#xD;
      the same dietary and pharmacologic interventions may mitigate or prevent toxicity associated&#xD;
      with chronic DCA exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients visit the Center 5 times over a 1-year period, usually for 2 to 3 days per visit,&#xD;
      for an extensive series of clinical and biochemical tests. Visit 1 is for baseline&#xD;
      examinations and blood and urine chemistries and to educate the patient on an LTD. This visit&#xD;
      lasts approximately 7 days to determine acceptable circulating tyrosine concentrations for&#xD;
      LTD formula at discharge. Patients are provided with tubes to take to local laboratories&#xD;
      every 2 weeks for blood work. Patients are readmitted in 1 month to determine adherence to&#xD;
      diet and serum tyrosine levels. Patients who evidence dietary compliance, no adverse effects,&#xD;
      and a willingness to continue are placed in 1 of 2 treatment arms: DCA plus an LTD plus&#xD;
      placebo or DCA plus an LTD plus NTBC. Thereafter, patients return during Months 5, 9, and 13,&#xD;
      which completes their 1-year treatment phase.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biochemical or molecular genetic proof of a defect in mitochondrial enzyme of glucose&#xD;
             metabolism or oxidative phosphorylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical history consistent with CLA (e.g., basal hyperlactatemia, stroke-like&#xD;
             episodes, neuromuscular degeneration, and seizures).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to withstand an 8-hour fast (if 2 years old or younger) or a 12-hour fast&#xD;
             without developing hypoglycemia (blood glucose greater than or equal to 50 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Secondary lactic acidosis due to impaired oxygenation or circulation.&#xD;

             deficiencies of gluconeogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary, defined organic acidurias other than lactic acidosis for which effective&#xD;
             therapy is available (e.g., propionic aciduria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary disorders of amino acid metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary disorders of fatty acid oxidation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Primary hepatic disease unrelated to chronic lactic acidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex deficiency, an inability to&#xD;
             maintain a diet greater than 50% calories from fat without biological and/or&#xD;
             neurological deterioration.&#xD;
