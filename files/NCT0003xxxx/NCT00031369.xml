  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for subtle&#xD;
      differences in brain anatomy between patients with focal hand dystonia (also called writer s&#xD;
      cramp) and healthy normal volunteers. Patients with hand dystonia have prolonged muscle&#xD;
      contractions that cause sustained twisting movements and abnormal postures. These abnormal&#xD;
      movements often occur with activities such as writing, typing, playing certain musical&#xD;
      instruments such as guitar or piano, or playing golf or darts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with focal hand dystonia and healthy volunteers will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from NINDS s database of patients with focal hand dystonia.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be selected to match the patients in age, sex and handedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves two visits to the NIH Clinical Center. The first visit is a screening&#xD;
      visit, in which patients and volunteers will have a medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
      neurological examination, and assessment of handedness. Women of childbearing age will be&#xD;
      screened with a pregnancy test. Pregnant women are exclude from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who join the study will return for a second visit for magnetic resonance imaging. MRI&#xD;
      uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the brain. For the procedure, the&#xD;
      participant lies still on a stretcher that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder&#xD;
      containing the magnet). Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises caused by electrical&#xD;
      switching of radio frequency circuits used in the scanning process. The scan will last about&#xD;
      45 to 60 minutes, at most. Some volunteers may be asked to return for a third visit to obtain&#xD;
      a second MRI on a different scanner.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term, dystonia, is used to describe a syndrome characterized by prolonged muscle&#xD;
      contractions causing sustained twisting movements and abnormal postures of the affected body&#xD;
      part(s). Although no structural brain abnormalities have been definitively demonstrated in&#xD;
      the visual inspection of MRI scans from patients with primary focal dystonia, there are&#xD;
      several lines of evidence for subtle structural brain abnormalities at both the subcortical&#xD;
      and cortical levels. We hypothesize that those abnormalities might be detected by using&#xD;
      appropriate acquisition and analysis methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be conducted using patients with primary focal dystonia and normal&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using high-resolution 3D structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and&#xD;
      voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at 3 Tesla and high&#xD;
      resolution anatomical images at 7 Tesla, we will detect structural changes in patients with&#xD;
      primary focal dystonia in comparison with control subjects. VBM and DTI are methods&#xD;
      implemented in the statistical parametric mapping software (SPM2). Magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy (MRS) will use special software to calculate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)&#xD;
      levels in a region of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      VBM and DTI analysis in SPM2 will enable us to make a voxel-wise comparison of local&#xD;
      concentration/volume of gray/white matter among these groups of subjects. This study can lead&#xD;
      to an improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of primary hand dystonia can help to&#xD;
      elucidate dystonia s pathogenesis/etiology and may lead to specific preventative or&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches. The MRS study will enable us to study GABA levels in the sensory&#xD;
      motor cortices, prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia in primary dystonia patients and normal&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS: Healthy volunteers who consented to participate in the study and&#xD;
        matched for age, sex, handedness with the group of patients with primary focal hand&#xD;
        dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PATIENTS: Patient with primary focal dystonia from our dystonia patient database who&#xD;
        consented to participate in the study. This criterion will be established by the&#xD;
        preliminary screening in the Human Motor Control Outpatient Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following subjects will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy volunteers with cognitive complaints, abnormal neurological exam or history of past&#xD;
        neurological disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Dystonia patients with the presence of a second neurological disease or condition; abnormal&#xD;
        neurological findings on exam that are not related to primary focal dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with past or present neuropsychiatric illness, head trauma with loss of&#xD;
        consciousness, epilepsy, cerebro-vascular disease, migraine, past and present history of&#xD;

&#xD;
        Subjects with abnormal MRI findings at visual inspection (prominent normal variants such as&#xD;
        mega cisterna or cavum septum pellucidum, signs of severe cortical or subcortical atrophy,&#xD;
        brain tumors, vascular diseases, trauma or AVMs).&#xD;
&#xD;

        pacemaker, aneurysm clips [metal clips on the wall of a large artery], metallic prostheses&#xD;
        [including heart valves and cochlear implants] or shrapnel fragments. Welders and metal&#xD;
        workers are also at risk for injury and may not take part in the study because of possible&#xD;
        small metal fragments in the eye of which they may be unaware.&#xD;
