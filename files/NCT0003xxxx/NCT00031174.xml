  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect white blood cells or plasma (the liquid part of the blood), or both,&#xD;
      from healthy volunteers and from patients with rheumatic or kidney disorders for research&#xD;
      purposes. Rheumatic disorders involve abnormalities of the immune system, the body s defense&#xD;
      against disease. The immune system consists of white blood cells such as lymphocytes and&#xD;
      monocytes, which produce substances such as antibodies and cytokines. White cells and plasma&#xD;
      will be collected through a procedure called apheresis (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with confirmed or suspected rheumatic or kidney disease who&#xD;
      are 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this study. Patients must be participating&#xD;
      in a current protocol of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin&#xD;
      Diseases or the National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes and Kidney Diseases. All candidates&#xD;
      will be screened with a history, physical examination, and blood tests for hepatitis B and C&#xD;
      and HIV infection. Women of childbearing age will be tested for pregnancy. Routine blood&#xD;
      tests will be done in all volunteers, and in patients where needed. Pregnant women and people&#xD;
      who test positive for hepatitis or HIV may not participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo apheresis to collect lymphocytes, monocytes, or plasma from the&#xD;
      blood. For this procedure, a needle is placed in a vein in the arm. Blood flows from the vein&#xD;
      through a tube (catheter) into a machine that spins the blood, separating it into its&#xD;
      components. The required cells or plasma are extracted, and the rest of the blood, including&#xD;
      the red cells and platelets, is returned to the body through the same needle or through a&#xD;
      second needle placed in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells collected from volunteers will be used in studies comparing the number and function of&#xD;
      similar cells from patients with rheumatic diseases, focusing on the differences in number&#xD;
      and function of the cells in health and disease. Components collected from patients will be&#xD;
      used only for studies described in the protocol in which they are currently enrolled.&#xD;

      Blood components will be collected using apheresis from normal volunteers and patients with&#xD;
      rheumatic or kidney diseases. Mononuclear cells and plasma will be used by various&#xD;
      investigators for research studies.&#xD;
