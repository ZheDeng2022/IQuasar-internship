      Patients in 'parent' cooperative studies projects are interviewed about their experiences in&#xD;
      the informed consent process.&#xD;

      Intervention: Self-Monitoring Questionnaire (a questionnaire relating to the process of IC&#xD;
      self-administered by study coordinators) and evaluation of the informed consent process using&#xD;
      the Brief Informed Consent Evaluation Protocol (BICEP) developed during the EQUIC-DP phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: We hypothesize that by focusing attention on what may have become a&#xD;
      routinized process, the quality of the IC encounter will be enhanced. We will evaluate the&#xD;
      success of this intervention by having the patient-subject complete a telephone&#xD;
      questionnaire, the BICEP (Brief Informed Consent Evaluation Protocol), after the IC process&#xD;
      is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes: The quality of the informed consent process, as measured by the BICEP&#xD;
      (Brief Informed Consent Evaluation Protocol). The BICEP also offers a method to certify&#xD;
      informed consent in routine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Abstract: Enhancing the Quality of Informed Consent Self-Monitoring (EQUIC-SM) is one&#xD;
      component of a VA Cooperative Studies Program-wide initiative on informed consent (EQUIC).&#xD;
      Its objective is the field testing and iterative improvement of one intervention in the&#xD;
      informed consent (IC) process, self monitoring. Self-monitoring involves having the person&#xD;
      obtaining IC complete a Self-Monitoring Questionnaire, or SMQ after the IC encounter with a&#xD;
      patient-subject being recruited for a participating study. We conceive of the SMQ as an&#xD;
      activation device which prompts the person obtaining IC to monitor how he/she conducts the IC&#xD;
      encounter. RESEARCH DESIGN: EQUIC-SM will be conducted in conjunction with participating&#xD;
      clinical trials of the VA CSP at multiple VAs throughout the country. Patient-subjects will&#xD;
      be recruited from among participants in these parent studies. Parent studies will be&#xD;
      randomized to SM protocol or to control sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY: Patient-subjects will be informed about EQUIC-SM at the time that they are first&#xD;
      presented with information about the parent study. The person obtaining consent will use a&#xD;
      scripted description of EQUIC-SM. If the subject agrees, verbal consent for EQUIC-SM will be&#xD;
      obtained. The same parent study informed consent process will be used for both the SM&#xD;
      protocol and control arms of EQUIC-SM; however in the SM protocol arm, the person obtaining&#xD;
      consent will complete the SMQ after the IC process. In both arms, patient-subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to complete the BICEP interview after the parent study IC process is completed.&#xD;
      FINDINGS: Investigators will use the results of EQUIC-SM to assess the value of the&#xD;
      self-monitoring technique in improving the quality of informed consent. The premise is that&#xD;
      focusing the attention of the person obtaining informed consent on the IC process will&#xD;
      enhance the quality of the IC encounter, and thus of the informed consent obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE: Practitioners of clinical trials have a responsibility to ensure that patients&#xD;
      participation in research be informed and voluntary. This responsibility implies that we&#xD;
      should strive continuously to improve the effectiveness of methods for informing prospective&#xD;
      research volunteers about experimental studies, thereby enhancing the protection of their&#xD;
      interests. If the self-monitoring technique tested in EQUIC-SM proves to enhance the quality&#xD;
      of informed consent, this technique may be adapted for wider use in conducting clinical&#xD;
      trials, thus representing an important step towards this goal.&#xD;
