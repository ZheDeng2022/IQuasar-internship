      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of donepezil (Aricept) for treating&#xD;
      mild dementia in patients with Parkinson's disease. Donepezil is approved for treating&#xD;
      patients with Alzheimer's disease, whose memory and cognition problems are similar to those&#xD;
      of patients with Parkinson's disease who are affected by dementia. Donepezil prevents the&#xD;
      breakdown of a chemical messenger called acetylcholine, which is involved in memory and other&#xD;
      cognitive functions, and may improve cognition in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 40 years of age and older with Parkinson's disease who have mild to moderate&#xD;
      dementia may be eligible for this 6-month study. It involves 6 clinic visits of approximately&#xD;
      2 hours each, described below. Candidates will be screened for participation during Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 (screening visit): Study candidates will have a medical history, physical and&#xD;
           neurological examinations, electrocardiogram (EKG), and possibly blood tests. They will&#xD;
           also undergo neuropsychological testing (tests of memory, language, mood and, other&#xD;
           brain functions) and fill out a quality of life questionnaire. Those enrolled will be&#xD;
           randomly assigned to receive either donepezil (5 mg per day) or placebo-a look-alike&#xD;
           pill with no active ingredients. After 4 weeks, the dose of donepezil will be increased&#xD;
           to 10 mg per day. Patients who do not tolerate the higher dose will have it reduced to 5&#xD;
           mg. Those who do not tolerate the 5-mg dose will be taken off medication but will&#xD;
           continue to be followed and tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2 (week 7): Patients will have a neurological examination and neuropsychological&#xD;
           testing and will fill out a quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3 (week 10): Patients will repeat the evaluations done during visit 2 and will&#xD;
           stop taking the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4 (week 16): Patients will repeat the evaluations done during visit 2 and will&#xD;
           have their study medication switched. That is, patients previously on placebo will be&#xD;
           switched to donepezil, and patients who were taking donepezil will be switched to&#xD;
           placebo. After 4 weeks, the dose of donepezil will be increased to 10 mg per day.&#xD;
           Patients who do not tolerate the higher dose will have it reduced to 5 mg. Those who do&#xD;
           not tolerate the 5-mg dose will be taken off medication but will continue to be followed&#xD;
           and tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits 5 and 6 (weeks 23 and 26): Patients will repeat the evaluations done during visit&#xD;
           2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted at the National Institutes of Health, the University of&#xD;
      Pennsylvania, and Northwestern University&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dementia is a common problem late in the course of the disease and&#xD;
      there is no effective therapy. Dementia severely impairs patients'' functional status and&#xD;
      limits the treatment of the motor manifestations of PD. No effective therapy for dementia in&#xD;
      PD is available. The pathophysiology of dementia in PD is not completely understood, however,&#xD;
      as in AD, it is thought to be related to cholinergic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will determine whether a therapeutic intervention with donepezil, an&#xD;
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, shown to be effective in AD, will improve cognitive function&#xD;
      in PD. The study is planned as a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      cross-over study of the efficacy and safety of donepezil in PD with dementia. The study is&#xD;
      being conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, Northwestern University&#xD;
      and NINDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure in this trial is the change in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment&#xD;
      Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog). The secondary outcome measures will include other scales&#xD;
      of cognitive function, activities of daily living, mood, and quality of life. Tolerability of&#xD;
      the drug will be assessed based on the side effect profile, specifically, the effect on motor&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;

        Diagnostic Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mild to moderate dementia with Mini Mental Status Score of 17-26.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of an alternative cause of dementia such as AD or stroke, based on clinical&#xD;
        evaluation. Subjects will have serologic screening for reversible causes of dementia,&#xD;
        including syphilis, thyroid dysfunction and B12 deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of uncontrolled hallucinations-hallucinations that are disruptive such that they&#xD;
        would interfere with cognitive testing.&#xD;

        Anticholinergic or cholinergic therapy within 2 weeks prior to inclusion in the study&#xD;
        except for Amantadine and Detrol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with unstable or clinically significant medical problems such as cardiac&#xD;
        arrhythmia or unstable heart disease (e.g. new onset angina) that would, in the judgment of&#xD;
