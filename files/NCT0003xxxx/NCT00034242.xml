  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is safe and&#xD;
      effective for treating cerebellar ataxia-degeneration of the cerebellum, the part of the&#xD;
      brain responsible for coordinating muscle movements and balance. The disease causes a slowly&#xD;
      progressive impairment of speech and balance, with patients often developing slurred speech,&#xD;
      tremor, clumsiness of the hands, and walking difficulties (ataxia). IVIG is derived from&#xD;
      donated blood that has been purified, cleaned and processed into a form that can be infused.&#xD;
      IVIG is an immune suppressant that is routinely used to treat other neurological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with hereditary (genetic) or sporadic (unknown cause)&#xD;
      cerebellar degeneration may be eligible for this 5-month study. They must have evidence of an&#xD;
      immune component to their condition, such as gluten sensitivity or antiganglioside&#xD;
      antibodies. Candidates will be screened with a neurological examination, a review of medical&#xD;
      records and possibly blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive infusions of either IVIG or placebo (an&#xD;
      inactive substance) through an arm vein once a month for two months. The infusions will be&#xD;
      given in the hospital in doses divided over 2 days, each lasting 6 to 10 hours. Before the&#xD;
      infusions, patients will undergo ataxia assessments through tests of coordination and balance&#xD;
      that may involve finger tapping, walking in a straight line, talking, and eye movements. When&#xD;
      the treatment is finished, patients will be followed in the clinic once a month for 3 months&#xD;
      for blood tests repeat ataxia assessments to evaluate the effects of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that there is an antibody mediated, autoimmune component in&#xD;
      hereditary and sporadic cerebellar degeneration. The objective of this study is to show&#xD;
      clinical improvement or stabilization in ataxia using treatment with intravenous&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. This study is a clinical, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial of IVIG in adult patients with cerebellar ataxia. Patients will be selected from the&#xD;
      motor control clinic based on a diagnosis of sporadic or hereditary cerebellar degeneration.&#xD;
      Study drug (placebo versus active) will be given in an intravenous infusion over a 2-day&#xD;
      period while the patient is hospitalized. This will be repeated monthly for 2 months.&#xD;
      Efficacy measurement will include clinical ataxia rating scales, motor speed testing and&#xD;
      clinical gait evaluation. These will be performed at baseline, during each hospitalization,&#xD;
      and 1 month following final IVIG infusion. Main outcome measure will be difference from&#xD;
      baseline in score on the NINDS ataxia rating scale 1 month following 2 treatments of 2 mg/kg&#xD;
      IVIG (total 4 mg/kg).&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults over 18 with hereditary or sporadic cerebellar degeneration. Sporadic cerebellar&#xD;
        degeneration may include the cerebellar predominant variant of Multiple System Atrophy&#xD;
        (MSA-C). Hereditary ataxia is limited to the SCAs (spinocerebellar ataxias) or those&#xD;
        patients with clear autosomal dominant ataxia. Patients must also have evidence for an&#xD;
        immune component to their condition such as gluten-sensitivity or antiganglioside&#xD;
        antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients on the gluten-free diet. Those who wish to participate in this trial must be off&#xD;
        the diet for a period of 3 months prior to the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Friedreich's ataxia. To date, this has not been associated with autoimmune&#xD;
        phenomena. We would not expect this population to respond.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with other autosomal recessive and mitochondrial forms of ataxia, since&#xD;
        autoimmunity has not been studied in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with hypercoaguable disorders. This includes conditions like Protein C or S&#xD;
        deficiency, underlying malignancy and/or paraproteinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient with acute renal insufficiency or patients on known nephrotoxic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with selective IgA deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cerebellar ataxia that is congenital, static and/or symptomatic (due to stroke, tumor,&#xD;
        demyelinating or infectious).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are pregnant or lactating. Those of child-bearing age will be asked to use&#xD;
        effective contraception for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Those patients who do not wish to use a product derived from human serum (for example,&#xD;
        Jehovah's Witness).&#xD;
