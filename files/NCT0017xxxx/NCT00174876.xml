  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A sizeable minority of patients suffering from major depression do not have their full set of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms relieved by a single medication. Often times, a second medication is&#xD;
      added to a patient's first antidepressant to obtain a better response in hopes of getting the&#xD;
      depressed patient into full remission from symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A typical psychiatric approach of recent has been to add one of the newer anti-schizophrenia&#xD;
      medications to an existing FDA approved antidepressant in order to achieve better serotonin&#xD;
      levels in the depressed patient's brain. This optimization of brain serotonin helps to&#xD;
      alleviate more depressive symptoms. The newest antipsychotic medication to be FDA approved is&#xD;
      Aripiprazole (Abilify). It may be particularly effective as it may safely elevate sertotonin&#xD;
      through receptor 1a stimulation, receptor 2a blockade. It may also facilitate low levels of&#xD;
      dopamine transmission which is truly novel for this agent when compared to other&#xD;
      schizophrenia drugs. Depressed patients also tend to lack dopamine in their brains. This&#xD;
      makes Aripiprazole and ideal agent to boost both serotonin and dopamine simultaneously. In&#xD;
      theory, this may be an effective way to alleviate more depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The author suggests to enroll 10 subjects initially in open label fashion to take&#xD;
      Aripiprazole plus their current FDA approved antidepressant to see if further elimination of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms occurs and to show this pharmacological approach as a tolerable&#xD;
      combination of medications. If there are no major safety issues, an amendment to allow 10&#xD;
      additional subjects will be forwarded to provide a better tolerability sample size.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, open-label study that will examine the clinical utility and safety of&#xD;
      adding the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole as an augmenting agent to antidepressant&#xD;
      therapy in treatment-resistant depressed patients. The author's a priori hypothesis is that&#xD;
      aripiprazole plus a current FDA approved antidepressant will result in significant reductions&#xD;
      in depressive symptoms over 6 weeks. Responders (&gt;50% improvement in baseline HAM-D score)&#xD;
      will be asked to voluntarily continue in a 6 week open-label extension in order to show that&#xD;
      antidepressant effects of aripiprazole are longstanding in nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening and consenting and liaison with a primary prescriber, 10 eligible subjects&#xD;
      will receive aripiprazole 10-30 mg per day as an augmentation agent in combination with their&#xD;
      current FDA approved antidepressant medication. The dose of the subject's original&#xD;
      antidepressant will remain unchanged during the study unless subject notes intolerable newly&#xD;
      emergent antidepressant-related side effects. Based on tolerability and response,&#xD;
      aripiprazole will be started at 5 mg per day and augmented as follows (baseline, end of week&#xD;
      1, end of week 2, end of week 4, and termination visit end of week 6) at 5 mg per day&#xD;
      increments, the maximum dose being 30 mg per day for patients who are taking antidepressants&#xD;
      that have no pre-existing significant inhibitory effect on CYP450 2D6 enzyme system. However,&#xD;
      if the patient is taking any antidepressant that has significant CYP450 2D6 enzyme inhibitory&#xD;
      properties, that may affect the metabolism of aripiprazole (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine), the&#xD;
      maximum dose will be 15 mg per day (50% less than the maximum recommended dose). These dose&#xD;
      ranges have been chosen because they capture the mean effective dose for ameliorating&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in schizophrenia. The dose will be titrated upward or downward based on&#xD;
      clinical response. Other psychotropic medications will be permitted during the study if&#xD;
      deemed necessary to control side effects (hypnotics, anxiolytics, antimuscarinics, beta&#xD;
      blockers, etc.). Subjects who have been on a stable dose of hypnotic or anxiolytic (GABA or&#xD;
      Histamine-based) for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry may opt to continue these at&#xD;
      current dose or be washed out prior to study start. Aripiprazole will be dispensed biweekly&#xD;
      and the participants will be followed for 6-weeks. Participants will be monitored every other&#xD;
      week by the HAMD (blinded), CGI, and SAFTEE. Vital signs and weight will also be taken at&#xD;
      each visit. After 6 weeks, there will be a two-week taper of aripiprazole (50% reduction in&#xD;
      dose per week). Compliance will be measured by pill count All subjects will be voluntarily&#xD;
      offered to stay in the study for an additional six weeks where they will meet one final time&#xD;
      at the end of week 12 to re-evaluate safety and effectiveness of longer term aripiprazole&#xD;
      augmentation. Subjects would then go through a two week taper as above. Subjects who do not&#xD;
      wish to continue an additional six weeks may opt out of the study at the original 6 week&#xD;
      termination mark. If interim safety analysis (by independent psychiatrist TBD) suggests good&#xD;
      safety profile and amendment will be sent to the IRB asking for 10 additional subjects to be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary measures and safety evaluations: The primary measures of the study will&#xD;
      be changes in HAMD scores over time (we will monitor this to make sure depression scores do&#xD;
      not worsen with aripiprazole); the secondary efficacy measure will be changes in CGI scores&#xD;
      over time. Safety evaluations will be determined by the SAFTEE rating scale and patient AE&#xD;
      reports. An Expectancy Scale will be given to determine if subjects' level of perceived&#xD;
      confidence in the drug correlates to the outcomes noted above. This is a superficial way to&#xD;
      look at placebo-like rates when placebo is not used in the study.&#xD;
