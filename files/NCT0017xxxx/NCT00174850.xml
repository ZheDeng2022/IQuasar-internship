  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxious patients are now treated with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor medications&#xD;
      (common antidepressants) which elevate serotonin and thus alleviate anxiety. These&#xD;
      medications have clearly proven efficacy upwards of 70% for many anxiety disorders. In&#xD;
      regards to tolerability, they have a major problem in that they often produce sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction in men and women (ie. decreased libido, anorgasmia, impotence) upwards of 30% of&#xD;
      the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benzodiazepine anxiolytics are also FDA approved to treat anxiety with equal efficacy and&#xD;
      greater tolerability (very little, if any sexual dysfunction). They do, however, carry a&#xD;
      substantial risk for addiction. Tiagabine is a Selective GABA Reuptake Inhibitor (SGRI) that&#xD;
      is FDA approved to treat certain types of epilepsy. Like benzodiazepines, Tiagabine also&#xD;
      increases the neurotransmitter, GABA, in the brain and is thought to alleviate anxiety (see&#xD;
      references below) this way too, but without any addiction risk common to Valium-type drugs.&#xD;
      The safety profile of Tiagabine is thought to be much safer. Two double blind studies are&#xD;
      ongoing which are looking at Tiagabine's effectiveness in PTSD and GAD. There are many open&#xD;
      label studies showing anxiety reduction and many psychiatrists in clinical practice are&#xD;
      utilizing this agent as an anxiety treatment in an off-label manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate anxious patients who are taking SSRI medication, have had&#xD;
      a reasonable response, but are experiencing significant sexual side effects which are pushing&#xD;
      them towards noncompliance and possible relapse into anxiety. 30 subjects (15 men and 15&#xD;
      women) will be asked to join the study and be placed on Tiagabine as well as their current&#xD;
      SSRI. Once an acceptable dose of Tiagabine is reached in the first four weeks, the subjects'&#xD;
      SSRIs will be slowly stopped. Two weeks after enrollment, all subjects will be called in&#xD;
      order to check for any side effects to the study drug and to insure that each subject is&#xD;
      titrating to the proper dose of study drug according to the study protocol. An open-label,&#xD;
      non-placebo prospective 10 week follow up will occur, where the now Tiagabine monotherapy&#xD;
      subjects will be followed to see primarily if their sexual dysfunction improves and if there&#xD;
      anxiety remains controlled.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (no placebo) study to see if a change from SSRI to Tiagabine may&#xD;
      alleviate sexual dysfunction while maintaining subject in a non-anxious state. 30 Subjects (&#xD;
      at least 50% female) will currently be taking a single SSRI for at least 4 weeks and report&#xD;
      at least a 50% drop in their anxiety severity as a result. They must also report a&#xD;
      chronological emergence of sexual dysfunction ( decreased sex drive, arousal, lubrication, or&#xD;
      onset of impotence, anorgasmia or delayed ejaculation) following the SSRI initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete consenting process and attend a screening visit where they will be&#xD;
      given a MINI psychiatric diagnostic evaluation to confirm anxiety disorder, be given a&#xD;
      Hamilton Anxiety and a Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale evaluation to delineate current&#xD;
      anxiety level (secondary measure). They will also complete self rated sexual health scales&#xD;
      such as the ASEX to assess sexual functioning (primary measure). Subjects will undergo a&#xD;
      brief physical exam and bloodwork will be ordered if the patient has an underlying medical&#xD;
      condition that warrants this type of medical clearance. The same would hold true if an EKG is&#xD;
      needed. Neither SSRIs, nor tiagabine warrants blood monitoring or EKGs per the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming subject meets eligibility, they will start titrating upwards as tolerated on&#xD;
      tiagabine and downwards on their SSRI. Titration with Tiagabine is flexible but typically&#xD;
      starts at the night of Day 1: 4 mg/day (2mg qAm with breakfast and 2mq qHS before bedtime&#xD;
      with a snack for five days). On day 6: 8mg/day (2mg with breakfast and 6mg before bedtime&#xD;
      with a snack). Day 13: 12mg/day in split doses: (4mg am with breakfast and 8mg before bedtime&#xD;
      with a snack). Two weeks after enrollment, all subjects will be called in order to check for&#xD;
      any side effects to the study drug and to insure that each subject is titrating to the proper&#xD;
      dose of study drug according to the study protocol. At the discretion of the investigator,&#xD;
      dosing may be lowered to alleviate side effects. Vist 2 will occur at the end of week 4 when&#xD;
      all SSRI is off and optimal tiagabine is in place. All scales except MINI will be completed.&#xD;
      Vist 3 will occur at the end of week 8 and scales will be completed. Visit 4 will be the&#xD;
      final visit at end of week 14, scales, PE and blood/EKG collected as warranted. The efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Tiagabine will be evaluated throughout the treatment period (see flow chart).&#xD;
      At the end of the study, subjects may opt to continue tiagabine or be titrated back to their&#xD;
      SSRI. Our team will also liaison with the subject's prescriber to ensure follow up and&#xD;
      continuity of care after study exit.&#xD;
