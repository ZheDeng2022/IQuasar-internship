      Evaluate the autoantibodies, such as glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), tyrosine&#xD;
      phosphatase (IA-2 or ICA125), islet autoantibodies (IAA) and other associated autoimmune&#xD;
      autoantibodies: microsomal antibodies, thyroglobulin antibodies, gastric parietal cell&#xD;
      antibodies in patients with type 1 DM.&#xD;

      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common disease in pediatric endocrine clinic and&#xD;
      epidemiological studies showed the racial variation in the incidence, with the highest of 35&#xD;
      cases per 100000 in Finland. The incidence of type 1 DM in Taiwan is reported to be 1.5 per&#xD;
      100000 for the population less than 30 years old. While the diagnosis is made, the residual&#xD;
      islet cell function is only about 20% of normal population. Therefore, the principle therapy&#xD;
      in these patients is insulin therapy lifelong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus is multifactorial and controversial, involving&#xD;
      the genetic and environmental factors. Type 1 DM is an autoimmune disease, which is T cell&#xD;
      mediated islet cell destruction. Ninety percent of patients with type 1 DM express at least&#xD;
      one of the autoantibodies to the islet. Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65)&#xD;
      were observed in 60-80% of such patients, which were considered the most important&#xD;
      autoantigens. The autoantibodies disappeared successively after diagnosis and decreased in&#xD;
      concentrations over time, but titers of antibodies to GAD65 had been observed fluctuated in&#xD;
      patients with type 1 DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of GAD antibodies, insulin autoantibodies, IA-2 (tyrosine phosphatase) were&#xD;
      reported as 45-67%, 23-67% and 49%, respectively in Taiwan. Other associated autoimmune&#xD;
      disease, such as autoimmune thyroiditis were reported as 13-24%. Such differences may be&#xD;
      caused by the enrolling criteria and different age population. Therefore, we want to&#xD;
      elucidate the role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of type 1 DM.&#xD;
