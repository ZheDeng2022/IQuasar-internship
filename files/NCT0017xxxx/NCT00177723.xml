  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate and improve the performance of pharmaco-statistical models previously&#xD;
      developed in the compassionate use program in patients being treated with linezolid under&#xD;
      clinical usage conditions. This study will also develop a sensitive and specific tool that&#xD;
      may be used to predict patients at risk of hematological toxicity, based on factors including&#xD;
      linezolid concentration and duration of therapy and use these models to better understand the&#xD;
      determinants of toxicity with linezolid and define better strategies to manage toxicity or&#xD;
      reduce its occurrence.&#xD;

      Epidemiologic information to be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (upon signing informed consent), the following information will be collected:&#xD;
      Demographic data - age, sex, height, weight, state of birth, previous pathology reports&#xD;
      associated with the bacteria the subject has contracted, laboratory results, current&#xD;
      medication use, and any other prior medical problems/history. The following outcome measures&#xD;
      will be assessed: (a) time to resolution of fever, (b) time to normalization of white blood&#xD;
      cell count, (c) time to microbiologic eradication of infection, (d) mortality at 28 days&#xD;
      following onset of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood work to be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematological parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in this study will be required to have blood samples taken to determine&#xD;
      their platelet count and hemoglobin at baseline (prior to the first dose of linezolid),&#xD;
      weekly whilst receiving linezolid and at end of linezolid treatment. Monitoring of&#xD;
      hematological parameters is recommended as part of the standard of care for patients being&#xD;
      treated with linezolid for greater than 2 weeks. This information will be collected from the&#xD;
      participant's medical record and become part of the research record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On doses 4 or 5 of Linezolid administration blood samples will be obtained from the patient's&#xD;
      vein prior to the first dose of the day of intravenous (IV) or oral Linezolid. Subsequent&#xD;
      samples of blood will be obtained over an eight hour period following dose administration (2&#xD;
      hours, 4 hours and 8 hours after dose administration). About 5 ml or one teaspoon will be&#xD;
      obtained by the bedside nurse for each blood sample for a total of 20 ml or 4 teaspoonfuls.&#xD;
      The GCRC staff will travel to the patient's hospital unit and obtain the blood samples when&#xD;
      necessary. If the patient is an outpatient, the patient will be asked to come to the GCRC to&#xD;
      have the blood samples withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the samples are not obtained prior to the first dose of medicine on days 2 or 3 of dose&#xD;
      administration, blood can be obtained from the patient's vein around two separate doses on&#xD;
      day 2 and 3 and day 3 and 4. Blood will be obtained from the patient's vein prior to taking&#xD;
      the next dose of IV or oral Linezolid and two hours after the medicine has been administered.&#xD;
      About 10 ml or two teaspoonfuls will be obtained by the bedside nurse for each blood sample&#xD;
      for a total of 20 ml or 4 teaspoonfuls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient develops a decrease in hematologic parameters (defined as Hb &lt; 10 g/dL, WBC &lt;&#xD;
      2.5, ANC &lt;1.5 or platelets &lt;100), blood will be collected from the patient's vein immediately&#xD;
      before a linezolid dose and two hours after the medicine has been administered. At these&#xD;
      levels, the clinicians caring for the patient will be advised that the frequency of&#xD;
      hematologic monitoring should increase to three times weekly. If the following hematologic&#xD;
      parameters occur, the clinician will be advised by the investigators to consider utilizing an&#xD;
      alternative antibiotic: Hb &lt;8 mg/dL, WBC &lt;1.5, ANC &lt;1.0, platelets &lt;50. It is acknowledged&#xD;
      that the investigators are not responsible for the care of the patient and that many factors&#xD;
      may influence the clinician's decision to continue or to switch linezolid therapy. The&#xD;
      management decisions will be made by the patient's clinical team and NOT the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples will be processed and stored in a - 80Â° C freezer in a secured laboratory&#xD;
      under the supervision of the principal investigator. These samples will then be used to&#xD;
      determine the amount of Linezolid that reached the participant's blood following dose&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples will be analyzed to obtain the amount of Linezolid found in the blood. No genetic&#xD;
      testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic samples (blood)&#xD;
      will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To protect&#xD;
      confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and birth&#xD;
      date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The&#xD;
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept&#xD;
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples&#xD;
      indefinitely. Part of the biologic samples will be sent to Dr. Craig Rayner at Monash&#xD;
      University of Australia. All samples sent outside of the UPMC facility will be de-identified.&#xD;
      Samples sent to Monash University will be kept in Dr. Rayner's laboratory. If a subject&#xD;
      withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected and not already processed&#xD;
      will be destroyed. All samples at UPMC will be kept in the investigator's laboratory located&#xD;
      in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be seen at the UPMC facility while they are inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject is removed from Linezolid clinically, subjects will not be required to prolong&#xD;
      the use of Linezolid and the subject's hospitalization will not be prolonged if not&#xD;
      clinically indicated.&#xD;
