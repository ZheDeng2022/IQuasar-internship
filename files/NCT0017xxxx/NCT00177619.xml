      The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the effectiveness and safety of once weekly&#xD;
      alendronate (Fosamax) in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in men with prostate&#xD;
      cancer on androgen deprivation therapy and to evaluate maintenance of bone mass following&#xD;
      termination of therapy after one year.&#xD;

      While osteoporosis in women is recognized as a major public health problem, osteoporosis in&#xD;
      men also has a profound clinical impact. Men over the age of 75 who sustain hip fractures&#xD;
      have a higher mortality than women of the same age (30% versus 9%). Hip fractures in men&#xD;
      account for one-third of all hip fractures. In 1995, male osteoporosis accounted for $2.7&#xD;
      billion in health care costs -- nearly one-third of the overall cost of osteoporosis.&#xD;
      Alendronate has been shown to improve bone mass and decrease vertebral fractures in men with&#xD;
      osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is the most common visceral malignancy and the second leading cause of death&#xD;
      in American men. Almost all men who progress to late stage disease are treated with androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy for life, resulting in a 5-fold increased risk of hip fractures and a&#xD;
      13-fold increased risk of all osteoporosis fractures. Several studies suggest the merit of&#xD;
      inducing androgen deprivation much earlier in the course of therapy for prostate cancer. It&#xD;
      is therefore quite likely that androgen deprivation strategies will be employed with&#xD;
      increasing frequency in patients with less advanced disease, resulting in longer life&#xD;
      expectancy but greater bone loss.&#xD;
