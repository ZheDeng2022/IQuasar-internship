      Ovarian cancer is the first in mortality rate of the gynecologic malignancies and the overall&#xD;
      5-year survival rate of ovarian cancer is only 20-30%. Besides, the incidence of ovarian&#xD;
      cancer increased in recent years in Taiwan. Ovarian cancer is indeed a disease that should be&#xD;
      respected, however, there has only been a little research done focusing on it in Taiwan.&#xD;
      Patients with ovarian cancer who have stage I disease (localized to ovaries) after optimal&#xD;
      surgical staging do not need any adjuvant therapy. In contrast, patients with disease&#xD;
      spreading beyond the ovaries have median survival rates that decrease to &lt; 10% for patients&#xD;
      with bulky residual disease after surgery and treated with platinum-based combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In developing effective therapy for ovarian cancer, there should be a&#xD;
      distinction between preventative and therapeutic approaches. Immunoprevention will be&#xD;
      developed for women who are at an increased risk for the development of ovarian cancer. In&#xD;
      contrast, immunotherapy would be used as an adjuvant to surgery or in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy or other biologics as chemoimmunotherapy or biochemoimmunotherapy. Mesothelin is&#xD;
      expressed in some normal epithelial cells and is elevated in certain carcinomas. Mesothelin&#xD;
      has been reported to be selectively overexpressed in most of the non-mucinous ovarian&#xD;
      carcinomas. In addition, the specific epitopes of mesothelin in the HLA-A2 and A24 haplotype&#xD;
      have been identified. It seems that mesothelin has the potential to be a target antigen for&#xD;
      the immunotherapy of ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So the investigators would like to provide this proposal to address the development of&#xD;
      mesothelin -specific immunologic assays. There are two aims in this project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to develop and utilize assays to measure cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to mesothelin,&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the mesothelin-specific immunologic responses between normal control and&#xD;
           ovarian cancer patients.&#xD;

      Incidence of Ovarian Cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian cancer is the first in mortality rate of the gynecologic malignancies with an overall&#xD;
      5-year survival rate of only 20-30%. It became a more and more important disease in recent&#xD;
      years and the incidence of ovarian cancer also increased in recent years in Taiwan. The lack&#xD;
      of symptoms, difficulties in early diagnosis, insufficient accurate tumor markers, and lack&#xD;
      of information about ovarian tumor biology contribute to the poor prognosis in ovarian cancer&#xD;
      patients. The prognostic parameters for ovarian carcinomas are tumor stage, histologic&#xD;
      subtype, degree of malignancy, and residual tumor after surgical treatment. However, these&#xD;
      factors present an incomplete picture of the tumor biology of ovarian cancer and are&#xD;
      frequently interrelated. Thus, the identification of new biologic factors predictive of&#xD;
      individual disease course and prognosis would be extremely useful. From the above-mentioned&#xD;
      data, ovarian cancer is indeed a disease that should be respected, however, there has only&#xD;
      been a little research done focusing on it in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of Ovarian Cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) and extraovarian MÃ¼llerian carcinoma are similar pathologic&#xD;
      entities that share a preference for peritoneal cavity involvement. The spread pattern of&#xD;
      these tumors presents a challenge and unique opportunities for immunotherapy. Patients with&#xD;
      EOC who have stage I disease (localized to ovaries) after optimal surgical staging, have a&#xD;
      5-year survival rate of 90%, with no significant change at 10 years. In contrast, patients&#xD;
      with spreading beyond the ovaries have median survival rates that decrease to &lt; 10% for&#xD;
      patients with bulky residual disease after surgery and treatment with platinum-based&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy. A randomized trial of first-line chemotherapy in patients with EOC&#xD;
      with residual masses larger than 1 cm after initial surgery, showed a median survival period&#xD;
      of 38 months for cisplatin/paclitaxel, significantly greater than 24 months for the&#xD;
      cisplatin/cytoxan treatment arm. In an interim analysis of an equivalency trial, survival&#xD;
      after carboplatin/paclitaxel was not worse than cisplatin/paclitaxel. Even though early&#xD;
      diagnosis is an important goal of ongoing clinical research efforts, it is unclear whether&#xD;
      advanced EOC starts as a multicentric process involving the ovaries and the peritoneal&#xD;
      surface. It is now established that hereditary factors contribute to the development of EOC.&#xD;
      Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations account for approximately 10% of all EOC. In a woman with&#xD;
      a BRCA 1 or 2 mutation, lifetime risk for ovarian cancer ranges from 16%-44%. With the&#xD;
      commercial availability of genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2, more women are being&#xD;
      identified as being at high risk for ovarian cancer. There are no clear guidelines on cancer&#xD;
      prevention for these individuals. Although prophylactic oophorectomy is a reasonable option&#xD;
      for women who have completed childbearing, these women are still at risk for developing&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer. Clearly, other options for prevention are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy for Ovarian Cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In developing effective immune-based strategies for EOC, there should be a distinction&#xD;
      between preventative and therapeutic approaches. It is anticipated that immunoprevention&#xD;
      (immunoprophylaxis) will be developed for women who are at an increased risk for the&#xD;
      development of EOC. In contrast, immunotherapy would be used as an adjuvant to surgery or in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy or other biologics as chemoimmunotherapy or&#xD;
      biochemoimmunotherapy. Patients with undetectable disease after being restaged after&#xD;
      chemotherapy could be considered for immunotherapy with the presumption that a majority does&#xD;
      in fact have micrometastases. Development of effective immune-based concepts for prevention&#xD;
      or treatment of EOC will require an understanding of tumor-immunology principles, mechanisms&#xD;
      of action of the expanding array of immune modulating molecules, identification and&#xD;
      characterization of tumor antigens, and determination of the microenvironment factors that&#xD;
      could impact on the different immune-effector mechanisms. The clinical researcher has been&#xD;
      provided with many immune directed agents, but progress on their integration into standard&#xD;
      therapies has been somewhat slow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesothelin:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesothelin is a 40-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein. It is synthesized as&#xD;
      a precursor of molecular mass 69 kDa, which then is proteolytically processed into an N&#xD;
      terminal secreted form of molecular mass 30 kDa and a membrane-bound form of 40 kDa. In&#xD;
      normal tissues, the expression of mesothelin has subsequently been shown to be largely&#xD;
      restricted to mesothelial cells, although immunoreactivity has also been reported in&#xD;
      epithelial cells of the trachea, tonsil, fallopian tube, and kidney. Hough et al. observed&#xD;
      that mesothelin was over-expressed in ovarian carcinoma. It seems that mesothelin may be&#xD;
      utilized as a tumor marker or target antigen for ovarian carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epitopes of Mesothelin for Human Haplotype:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of HLA-A2 haplotype is over 50% in the Western countries. The incidence of&#xD;
      HLA-A2 and A24 haplotype is around 30% and 15% in Taiwan, respectively. The specific epitopes&#xD;
      of the mesothelin in the HLA-A2 and A24 haplotype have been identified. There are Mesothelin&#xD;
      aa20-28 (peptide SLLFLLFSL) and aa530-538 (peptide VLPLTVAEV) for the HLA-A2 haplotype. And&#xD;
      Mesothelin aa435-443 (peptide FYPGYLCSL) and aa475-483 (peptide LYPKARLAF) are the epitopes&#xD;
      of HLA-A24 haplotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research team has focused on the development of cancer vaccine and immunotherapy for&#xD;
      several years. Our laboratory facilities have also been set up to evaluate the human&#xD;
      immunologic assays for human papilloma virus type 16 E7 antigen by the grant supported from&#xD;
      National Taiwan University Hospital. It is very important to set up various&#xD;
      mesothelin-specific immunologic assays of human beings to evaluate the effect of cancer&#xD;
      vaccine or immunotherapy for ovarian cancer in future clinical trials. So we would like to&#xD;
      provide this proposal to address the development of mesothelin-specific immunologic assays in&#xD;
      human beings. There are several aims in this project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to develop and utilize assays to measure CTLs to mesothelin, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the mesothelin-specific immunologic responses between normal controls and&#xD;
           ovarian cancer patients.&#xD;
