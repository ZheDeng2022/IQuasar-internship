    <textblock>
      This study aims to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) among the programs for&#xD;
      preventing osteoporotic fracture. The main comparison will be made among the effects of three&#xD;
      programs for preventing osteoporotic fractures: 1. health education; 2. exercise intervention&#xD;
      for enhancing bone mineral density (BMD); 3. exercise intervention for preventing falls. The&#xD;
      &quot;cost&quot; will be measured bases on the monetary cost of implementation of each program. The&#xD;
      &quot;effectiveness&quot; will be measured includes the number of prevented osteoporotic fractures of&#xD;
      each program, and related outcomes are the follows: 1. the medical cost of osteoporotic&#xD;
      fracture; 2. the change of BMD in consecutive years; 3. the quality of life (QOL) of patients&#xD;
      with osteoporotic fracture as compared to the reference population.&#xD;

      fracture; 2. the change of BMD in consecutive years; 3. the quality of life (QOL) of patients&#xD;
      with osteoporotic fracture as compared to the reference population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First year (2006): mainly a preparation stage&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a meta-analysis of the effects of various interventions of prevention of&#xD;
           osteoporotic fracture, especially in exercise models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish the exercise programs for the intervention in the 2nd year, including the&#xD;
           booklets and the posters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To review the other alternatives of prevention of osteoporotic fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To establish the social network needed for the following research. Second year (2007):&#xD;
           to start the community-based field studies in Neihu District, Taipei.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 37 &quot;Lis&quot; in Neihu will be invited to join the study, but only the Lis with willingness of&#xD;
      participation will be the units for cluster sampling, and will be randomized to the three&#xD;
      programs (Li as a unit). People living in the sampled Lis meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      (postmenopausal (minimum for 1year) women and men over 65 years old) will be recruited and&#xD;
      they will be further randomized into intervention group or reference group within each&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.To collect the baseline data. Baseline data include: the BMD, physical activity, nutrition&#xD;
      diary, muscle strength, balance, risk factors of osteoporosis, history of fractures and falls&#xD;
      2.To execute the interventions. Three programs will be executed in the sampled Lis. They are&#xD;
      all designed as a randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Health education (HE trial): lectures on knowledge of osteoporosis, osteoporotic&#xD;
           fracture, the risk factors, the nutritional demand, the exercise principles for&#xD;
           enhancing BMD and preventing fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention for enhancing BMD (BMD trial): interventions to emphasize on weight-bearing&#xD;
           exercise and trunk stabilization exercises. The exercise program will be supervised by a&#xD;
           professional physical therapist 3 times per week for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intervention for preventing falls (fall prevention trial): interventions to emphasize on&#xD;
           balance and strength training exercises. The exercise program will be also supervised by&#xD;
           a professional physical therapist 3 times per week for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.To apply the NHRI released health insurance data (2002-2006) for the next year study&#xD;
           Third year (2008): follow-up, cost calculation and study on medical cost&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To calculate the cost of three intervention programs (from the view of provider).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Telephone follow-up (FU) and recording the incidence of fall &amp; fracture every 3&#xD;
                months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The first FU (1st FU) of the items collected at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. To study the medical cost of osteoporotic fracture with NHRI data. Fourth year&#xD;
                (2009): continuing follow-up and study on QOL&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Continuing the telephone FU and recording the incidence of fall &amp; fracture every 3&#xD;
                months&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The second FU (2nd FU) of the items collected at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To conduct a survey for the health-related QOL of people with osteoporotic fracture&#xD;
                from outpatient clinics in hospital and the newly fractured subjects in the&#xD;
                community.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fifth year (2010): continuing follow-up and CEA&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Continuing the telephone FU and recording the incidence of fall &amp; fracture every 3&#xD;
                months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The third FU (3rd F/U) of the items collected at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To investigate the effects of each intervention program&#xD;
