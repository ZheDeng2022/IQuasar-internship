  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachytherapy, or Transperineal implantation of the prostate (TPIP), is a recognized form of&#xD;
      treatment for localized cancer of the prostate. TPIP has been used at the British Columbia&#xD;
      Cancer Agency (BCCA) since 1998. As part of the treatment, some patients also require hormone&#xD;
      therapy for 6 months. This is given as injections of a drug called an LHRH agonist. The LHRH&#xD;
      agonist is made either as short-acting (1-month) or long-acting (3 month) injections. The&#xD;
      LHRH agonist lowers testosterone levels, which helps make delivery of TPIP easier, and more&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are specific guidelines regarding the use of LHRH agonist treatment with brachytherapy,&#xD;
      however there is no policy whether short-acting or long-acting LHRH agonists should be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of results from BC has shown that there seems to be a delay in the time in which&#xD;
      testosterone levels return to normal in men who receive the long-acting LHRH agonist compared&#xD;
      with the short-acting LHRH agonist, however this is not known for sure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The suppression of testosterone to castrate levels has a definite advantage in terms of&#xD;
      prostate volume downsizing, disease control and ease of Brachytherapy, in this patient&#xD;
      population. The improved potency preservation rate seen with brachytherapy, when compared to&#xD;
      other treatments such as radical prostatectomy or external beam, may be an important&#xD;
      determinant in the patient's choice of treatment modality. Hence, testosterone recovery&#xD;
      should be an important endpoint to consider in this patient population since prolongation of&#xD;
      testosterone suppression may also delay the return of erectile function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to compare the impact of LHRH agonist preparations on the rate of testosterone&#xD;
      recovery, we propose a randomized clinical trial using one versus three-month Leuprolide&#xD;
      preparations in patients otherwise suitable for our Brachytherapy Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is the median time to testosterone recovery in patients&#xD;
      receiving 6 X 1-month or 2 X 3-month LHrH preparations and TPIP as radical treatment for&#xD;
      limited stage prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, testosterone recovery is defined as the return to the lower limit of normal&#xD;
      for the patient's age group as well as return to pre treatment levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will mainly focus on time to testosterone recovery as defined by return to the lower&#xD;
      limit of normal for the patient's age group as well as return to pre treatment levels. The&#xD;
      lower limits of normal are defined as 5.8nmol/L and 5.5nmol/L for &lt; 50 and &gt; 50 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in PSA level, QOL and erectile function will also be recorded&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients who elect to undergo brachytherapy for the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
        prostate and who are otherwise recommended treatment with LHRH agonist. All patients must&#xD;
        have a confirmed histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate and elect to be&#xD;
        treated with transperineal implantation of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible patients will have confirmed clinical stage T1 or T2 (UICC 1997 staging system)&#xD;
        with&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. PSA &lt; 10 and Gleason score = 7 OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prostate volume &gt; 50cc as measured on trans rectal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;

        combination with criteria 1 OR 2.&#xD;
