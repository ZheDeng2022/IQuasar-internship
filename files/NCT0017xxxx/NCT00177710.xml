  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the steady state concentrations of inhaled&#xD;
      liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome®) in lung transplant recipients via aerosolized&#xD;
      nebulization.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will receive 1 mg/kg/day of inhaled Ambisome® for four days prior to the BAL&#xD;
      (bronchoalveolar lavage) procedure. The dosage of 1 mg/kg was calculated by extrapolating the&#xD;
      dosage of 1.6 mg/kg for the surface area of the rat lung to the human lung surface area in a&#xD;
      60 kg individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All four doses will be given in the presence of a physician and/or study coordinator. The&#xD;
      forty eight subjects will be randomized such that six subjects undergo the BAL at 1, 12, 24,&#xD;
      48, 72, 96, 120, and 168 hours after the last dose of inhaled Liposomal amphotericin B&#xD;
      (AmBisome®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample (5 ml) will be obtained prior to the fourth dose of study medication and on&#xD;
      the day of bronchoscopy (pseudo steady state trough). Concentrations of amphotericin in the&#xD;
      serum, and bronchoalveolar lavage will be measured at pre-specified intervals after&#xD;
      administration of liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome®) in lung transplant recipients&#xD;
      undergoing routine bronchoscopy as mentioned earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 5 ml blood sample will be recovered at the time of bronchoscopy for the purpose of&#xD;
      determination of serum amphotericin B concentration and for the determination of serum urea&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage of subjects is done as a part of routine&#xD;
      transplant care. Subjects will be followed for the follow-up of results of bronchoscopy at&#xD;
      the interval deemed necessary by their transplant pulmonologist. The samples (blood and&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar samples) will be under the control of the principal investigator of this&#xD;
      research project. To protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social&#xD;
      security number, and birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific&#xD;
      code number. The information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects'&#xD;
      identities will be kept in a separate, secure location (ID lab at 8th floor Scaife Hall). The&#xD;
      investigators on this study will keep the samples indefinitely. Samples may be given to&#xD;
      investigators outside of UPMC or may be utilized in future studies about infectious diseases.&#xD;
      If the samples are given to investigators not associated with this study, the samples will be&#xD;
      provided without any identifiers. No genetic testing will be done on the samples obtained.&#xD;
