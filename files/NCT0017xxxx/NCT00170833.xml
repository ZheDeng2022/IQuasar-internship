        positive hepatitis C serology, who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Hepatitis B&#xD;
        surface antigen positive. Laboratory results obtained within 6 months prior to first dose&#xD;
        of everolimus are acceptable. Recipients of organs from donors who test positive for&#xD;
        Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C are excluded Presence of cardiac disease ( Old&#xD;
        New York Heart Association Classification Grade 3, elevated creatine phosphokinase&#xD;

        of any investigational drug within 4 weeks of the baseline period 15.Patients who have been&#xD;

        dose of everolimus 16.Patients with severe systemic infections 17.Existence of any surgical&#xD;
        or medical condition, other than the current transplant, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
        investigator, preclude enrollment in this trial 18.Malignancy (current or history within&#xD;
        last 5 years) except for successfully treated localized basal or squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
        the skin 19.Patients with any medical condition requiring long-term anticoagulation, such&#xD;
