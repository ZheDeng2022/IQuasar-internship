    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: When irradiated lymphocytes from a donor are infused into the patient they may&#xD;
      help the patient's immune system kill cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab,&#xD;
      can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to&#xD;
      them. Giving irradiated donor lymphocytes together with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well giving irradiated&#xD;
      donor lymphocytes together with rituximab works in treating patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory lymphoproliferative disease.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity of irradiated HLA-partially matched related donor lymphocytes&#xD;
           when administered with rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory CD20-positive&#xD;
           lymphoproliferative disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate response with Fc receptor FcγIIIA polymorphisms or predicted HLA-directed&#xD;
           natural killer cell reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab therapy: Patients receive rituximab IV on days -1, 6, 13, and 20. Treatment&#xD;
           repeats approximately every 4 months in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donor lymphocyte infusion: Patients receive irradiated donor lymphocytes IV over 1 hour&#xD;
           on day 0. Treatment repeats every 8-16 weeks (alternating with courses of rituximab&#xD;
           therapy) for up to 6 donor lymphocyte infusions in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood is collected periodically during study for correlative laboratory studies.&#xD;
      Blood samples are analyzed for FcγIIIA polymorphism by fluorescent in situ hybridization or&#xD;
      by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Survival of donor lymphocytes is assessed&#xD;
      by chimerism studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
