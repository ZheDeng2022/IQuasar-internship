    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is primarily to assess the ability of a music therapy program to&#xD;
      improve holistically the psychological, somatic, and social symptoms of patients with&#xD;
      Huntington 's disease (HD). We hope to demonstrate the benefits of applying music therapy&#xD;
      interventions to the management methods of HD, thus paving the way for the development of an&#xD;
      effective music therapy program for individuals with HD.&#xD;

      ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Recent studies show that music therapy helps improve the symptomatic&#xD;
      manifestations of Parkinson's Disease. Few studies have looked at music therapy as a&#xD;
      treatment for the psychiatric, cognitive and motor symptoms of patients with Huntington's&#xD;
      disease (HD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To examine the feasibility and tolerability of a treatment program of music&#xD;
      therapy for patients with Huntington's disease. Also, to determine if music therapy improves&#xD;
      the mood and motor features of HD while improving quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Subjects with HD were recruited to participate in a six-week study that included one&#xD;
      individual, half-hour music therapy session and one hour-long group session per week. The&#xD;
      music therapy protocols were adapted from the Colorado State University's Neurological Music&#xD;
      Therapy program and were targeted to HD symptoms including balance and posture, fine motor&#xD;
      skills, memory and attention, vocalizations, and mood. In particular the protocols included&#xD;
      Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS), Pattern Sensory Enhancement (PSE), and Therapeutic&#xD;
      Instrumental Music Playing (TIMP). Primary outcome of tolerability was to be assessed by the&#xD;
      subjects' adherence to the therapeutic protocol, attendance, and the results of an exit&#xD;
      survey inquiring about their feelings toward the use of music therapy in HD. A secondary&#xD;
      outcome of the study was the change in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS)&#xD;
      score between baseline and study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Five subjects were recruited for study participation (one female and four males).&#xD;
      Music therapy was found to be a tolerable and feasible treatment for patients with HD (100%&#xD;
      adherence and 98% attendance). Exit surveys demonstrated strongly positive feelings towards&#xD;
      the music therapy treatment program in four of the five subjects (one survey was completed&#xD;
      with contradictory answers by the subject). While there was improvement in UHDRS scores for&#xD;
      finger tapping, pronation/supination and the Luria, these changes did not achieve statistical&#xD;
      significance with the small sample size in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: Music therapy was well tolerated among subjects with HD in this small study.&#xD;
      Future studies are now being planned to look at the efficacy of this intervention in a larger&#xD;
      population of HD subjects.&#xD;

    <description>During individual Music Therapy sessions, subjects will participate in a variety of active music-making opportunities, including: playing musical instruments, singing, improvising, learning relaxation techniques, song writing, and/or lyric analysis. The activities for each session will be determined by both subject and therapist, and will be selected based on preference, emotional state, and desired goals for the day.&#xD;
Group music therapy sessions will focus on improving socialization, depression, and group dynamics. In this setting, the Music Therapist will choose from the following interventions:&#xD;
Group singing&#xD;
Group drumming&#xD;
Music assisted relaxation&#xD;
Group song writing&#xD;
Lyric analysis&#xD;
Improvisation&#xD;
