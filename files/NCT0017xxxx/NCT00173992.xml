      The specific aims of this research are delineated as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To investigate the neuromuscular and biomechanical mechanisms of the emerging&#xD;
      processes of proactive and reactive balance control during sitting and standing in patients&#xD;
      with stroke at different stages of the recovery course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the relationships between brain lesion sites and the recovery patterns of&#xD;
      reactive and proactive balance control mechanisms in patients with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine the relationships between the impairments in reactive and proactive&#xD;
      balance control mechanisms and functional outcome as well as fall incidence in patients&#xD;
      following stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To investigate the efficacy of different training regimens in improving reactive and&#xD;
      proactive balance control strategies and in preventing falls in stroke patients with&#xD;
      different brain lesion sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principally, three hypotheses are to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1:The emerging processes and recovery patternes of proactive and reactive balance&#xD;
      control may be different among stroke patients with different brain lesion locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2:There are positive correlations between the level of impairments in reactive and&#xD;
      proactive balance control mechanisms and functional outcome as well as fall incidence in&#xD;
      patients following stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3:Training regimens that could best facilitate the emergence or improvement in&#xD;
      reactive and proactive balance control strategies are different.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of chronic disability in the world. Falls are one of the&#xD;
      primary complications after stroke. The incidence of falls ranges from 25% to 75% among&#xD;
      stroke patients residing in different settings, with greater incidence of falls occurring&#xD;
      after discharge home. Postural instability has been suggested as one of the main causes&#xD;
      leading to falls in this population. The recovery of the ability to maintain balance during&#xD;
      activities of daily living, therefore, is essential for functional independence and safety of&#xD;
      these patients. In the following paragraphs, the knowledge gaps taht we are proposing to&#xD;
      bridge in this study and the revelant literature that leads us to identify these gaps are&#xD;
      discussed.&#xD;
