      The purpose of this study is to determine the epidemiology of throat isolates of group A&#xD;
      streptococci among 3-15 year-old children with pharyngitis (sore throat) living in Leon,&#xD;
      Nicaragua.&#xD;

      Streptococcus pyogenes (GrAS) is a human pathogen that leads to great disease burden&#xD;
      throughout the world. In the United States, an estimated 30 million infections occur yearly.&#xD;
      Most of these are local infections of the skin or the throat but still lead to considerable&#xD;
      use of health-care resources. These common, simple forms of GrAS disease may progress to or&#xD;
      be followed by the more serious GrAS-related illnesses acute rheumatic fever,&#xD;
      post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, sepsis, pneumonia,&#xD;
      or other invasive illnesses. Outside the U.S., in the developing world, the burden of&#xD;
      GrAS-related disease is presumed to be even higher, but is not completely elucidated in many&#xD;
      of the poorer regions of the world. It is known, though, that rheumatic heart disease causes&#xD;
      more cardiovascular morbidity in the children of the world than any other illness. Although&#xD;
      the incidence of rheumatic fever in the U.S. has fallen to levels of approximately 0.5 per&#xD;
      100,000 per year, in some areas, the developing world's children still have rates over 100&#xD;
      per 100,000 per year. The percentage of cardiac admissions attributable to rheumatic heart&#xD;
      disease in hospitals located in the developing world remains in the range of 30 to 50%, where&#xD;
      it has been studied. GrAS is one of the best characterized human pathogens with regards to&#xD;
      its microbiology, its spectrum of diseases, and its ability to lead to serious sequelae such&#xD;
      as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. Yet, efforts to control it through the use of&#xD;
      antibiotics have been only partially successful in the United States and largely unsuccessful&#xD;
      in the developing world. The health impact of uncomplicated streptococcal infections, such as&#xD;
      pharyngitis, and the less common but more severe diseases, such as rheumatic heart disease,&#xD;
      must be better studied in order to move forward with control measures. In this study,&#xD;
      patients aged 3-15 presenting with sore throat, fever and cervical lymphadenopathy will be&#xD;
      examined and a throat swab will be submitted to the lab for culture. All of these patients&#xD;
      will be treated with either benzathine penicillin or, if they have a history of allergy to&#xD;
      penicillin, oral erythromycin. The parent will be given a follow-up appointment to convey the&#xD;
      result of the culture and to evaluate the course of the child's illness. Children presenting&#xD;
      with sore throat only will be cultured and given a follow-up appointment to return after the&#xD;
      result of the culture is known. Antibiotic treatment is given only if the culture is positive&#xD;
      for group A streptococci. Within this algorithm is latitude for the physician to treat any&#xD;
      patient based on clinical signs and symptoms and the concern that a particular child may not&#xD;
      return for treatment if it is delayed based on the culture result. The overriding goal is the&#xD;
      prevention of acute rheumatic fever and suppurative complications. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to characterize the GrAS isolates genotypically (emm type or sub-type). The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to describe the epidemiology of throat isolates of GrAS among 3- to&#xD;
      15- year old children with pharyngitis living in Leon, Nicaragua. Primary endpoint of the&#xD;
      study is the frequency and proportion of each emm-type among children with pharyngitis.&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints for the study are as follows: The proportion of children with pharyngitis&#xD;
      from whom GrAS is isolated. The minimal incidence of GrAS pharyngitis in children based on&#xD;
      annual cases per 100,000 children in the catchment areas. The age, gender, and&#xD;
      ethnicity-specific minimal incidence rates of GrAS pharyngitis in children living in the&#xD;
      catchment areas.&#xD;
