  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy is still unknown.&#xD;
      Histopathologically, extraocular muscle inflammation and orbital fat inflammation are two&#xD;
      prominent changes. In the past year, we had investigated the morphological features of the&#xD;
      Müller muscle in patients with thyroid lid retraction using the special stain and&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry. In our findings, the smooth muscle cells, in the diseased group, were&#xD;
      replaced by variable adipose and fibrosis tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, TSHR, has been verified to express in orbital connective tissue and&#xD;
      extra-ocular muscle. From functional studies and an increase in adipogenesis in cultured&#xD;
      fibroblasts with expression of TSHR protein, the role not only the target but effector cells&#xD;
      in orbital fibroblasts were validated. Quantitative RT-PCR may help to differentiate whether&#xD;
      a less extent of expression at the end stage or low protein amount to be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the diverse phenotypes of orbital fibroblasts, with regard to expression of&#xD;
      Thy-1 protein or not, had been reported from several studies, the investigators believed&#xD;
      heterogeneity in orbital fibroblast may determine the clinical presentation of&#xD;
      Graves'ophthalmopathy. We also are curious to know if the phenotypic heterogeneity of the&#xD;
      fibroblasts in the ocular adnexal and orbital tissues correlates to distinct morphological&#xD;
      features of adipogenesis and fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, increased CD40 expression in skin fibroblasts were noted from patients with&#xD;
      systemic sclerosis. Expression of IGF-I and IGF-IR seemed to be up-regulated in processes of&#xD;
      several fibrotic diseases. A nuclear transcription factor, PPAR-γ, has been verified to have&#xD;
      a close relationship with adipogenesis. We hypothesize that some immunological processes&#xD;
      involve the ocular adnexal and orbital tissues, which result in various ophthalmological&#xD;
      manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the different stage of the ocular adnexal and&#xD;
      orbital tissues to identify the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy by frozen sections&#xD;
      with Immunohistochemistry, mRNA expression of TSH receptor, PPAR-γ, IGF-1R, and IGF-1 and&#xD;
      different cytokines using quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry at the acute and stable&#xD;
      stage in GO.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) is still unknown.&#xD;
      Histopathologically, extraocular muscle inflammation due to lymphoid infiltration, edema and&#xD;
      interstitial fibrosis, and increased glycosaminoglycan deposition and orbital fat&#xD;
      inflammation are two prominent changes. There are various manifestations including ocular&#xD;
      adnexal tissues inflammation, proptosis, lid retraction, extraocular movement limitation and&#xD;
      compressive optic neuropathy. In the past year, we had investigated the morphological&#xD;
      features of the Müller muscle in patients with thyroid lid retraction using the special stain&#xD;
      and immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed paraffin-embbeded (FFPE) sections. In our&#xD;
      findings, the smooth muscle cells, in the diseased group, were replaced by variable adipose&#xD;
      and fibrosis tissues. Two distinct features in the disease group seem to be notable for&#xD;
      further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, TSHR, a putative autoantigen, has been verified to express in orbital&#xD;
      connective tissue and extra-ocular muscle. In addition, they were further demonstrated to&#xD;
      express on the surface of cultured orbital fibroblasts and orbital adipose tissue, in&#xD;
      patients with GO in several laboratories. From functional studies and an increase in&#xD;
      adipogenesis in cultured fibroblasts with expression of TSHR protein, the role not only the&#xD;
      target but effector cells in orbital fibroblasts were validated7. We used&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry to verify the existence of TSHR on the fibroblasts within the Müller&#xD;
      muscle, and the positive staining is manifested in only18 % of patients. It may due to a less&#xD;
      extent of expression at the end stage. We are very curious to know if there any difference on&#xD;
      the expression of TSHR between orbital specimens from patients with acute and those with&#xD;
      stable stage. Quantitative RT-PCR may help to differentiate whether a less extent of&#xD;
      expression at the end stage or low protein amount to be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the diverse phenotypes of orbital fibroblasts, with regard to expression of&#xD;
      Thy-1 protein or not, had been reported from several studies, the investigators believed&#xD;
      heterogeneity in orbital fibroblast may determine the clinical presentation of Graves'&#xD;
      ophthalmopathy. We also are curious to know if the phenotypic heterogeneity of the&#xD;
      fibroblasts in the ocular adnexal and orbital tissues correlates to distinct morphological&#xD;
      features of adipogenesis and fibrosis. In addition, systemic or local pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines may contribute to turn on and turn off the expression of different roles of the&#xD;
      fibroblasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, increased CD40 expression in skin fibroblasts were noted from patients with&#xD;
      systemic sclerosis. Expression of IGF-I and IGF-IR seemed to be up-regulated in processes of&#xD;
      several fibrotic diseases. A nuclear transcription factor, PPAR-γ, has been verified to have&#xD;
      a close relationship with adipogenesis. In our previous study, the smooth muscle cells, in&#xD;
      the diseased Mullers' muscle, were replaced by variable adipose and fibrosis tissues. The&#xD;
      increased adipose and fibrosis tissue ex vivo of the Müller' muscle may result from&#xD;
      over-action of some biochemical markers in the fibroblasts infiltrating around muscle cells.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that some immunological processes involve the ocular adnexal and orbital&#xD;
      tissues, which result in various ophthalmological manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the different stage ( acute or stable stage) of&#xD;
      the ocular adnexal and orbital tissues ( including orbital fat, extraocular muscles,&#xD;
      orbicularis muscles and eyelid fat) to identify and validate the pathogenesis of Graves&#xD;
      ophthalmopathy by frozen sections of the ocular adnexal and orbital tissues with&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry (IHA) (Thy-1 and PPARγ), mRNA expression of TSH receptor, PPAR-γ,&#xD;
      IGF-1R, and IGF-1 and different cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8) using quantitative RT-PCR&#xD;
      and flow cytometry at the acute and stable stage in GO.&#xD;
