  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine molecular and biochemical changes, associated with the relaxation response&#xD;
           (RR) that can counteract the effects of stress in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare genomic, molecular and biochemical parameters between healthy adults with a&#xD;
           long term meditative practice and those with no experience in meditation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since stress is a factor in the development of many health conditions, a further&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms of the RR should be developed. The project is designed to&#xD;
      determine how the RR can improve the quality of life that has been adversely affected by&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
