  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of stenting in&#xD;
      the treatment of obstructive carotid artery disease. Secondary objectives are the assessment&#xD;
      and standardization of optimal operator techniques and successful deployment and retrieval of&#xD;
      the AngioGuard XP Distal Protection Device. This is a single center, prospective, open-label&#xD;
      feasibility study. The study population will consist of patients with atherosclerotic&#xD;
      obstructive or post-endarterectomy restenotic lesions in native carotid arteries. The&#xD;
      intention is to include patients with both types of lesions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a single center, prospective, open-label feasibility study evaluating the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of Carotid Stenting. The study population will include patients with&#xD;
      atherosclerotic obstructive lesions and/or post-endarterectomy restenotic obstructive lesions&#xD;
      in native carotid arteries. The intention is to include patients with both types of lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 30-day, 6-month and 1-year post-procedure clinical visits, the procedures will include&#xD;
      a neurological examination and an evaluation of any adverse events. A carotid ultrasound will&#xD;
      be performed at 6 months and 1 year after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines for stopping the study will be event rates such as stroke and death that exceed&#xD;
      twice the expected frequency of such events treated by surgical endarterectomy techniques.&#xD;
      The control rates utilized will be drawn from the NASCET Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (as specified&#xD;
      in sections 4.1 and 4.2 respectively) will be offered the choice of participating in this&#xD;
      study. . Within the inclusion/exclusion criteria are included patients who would otherwise be&#xD;
      at high risk for surgical endarterectomy. This would include patients with restenosis after&#xD;
      endarterectomy, radical neck dissection, contralateral carotid artery occlusion, and high&#xD;
      take-off carotid bifurcation disease. Since 1989, 8000 carotid artery stent procedures have&#xD;
      been performed worldwide with a success rate of 98.6%. This procedure combined with the&#xD;
      distal protection device, is predicted to show an even greater success rate and a decrease in&#xD;
      adverse events for these patients. For these reasons, any patient with significant carotid&#xD;
      artery disease felt to be at high risk for surgical correction will be offered the chance to&#xD;
      enroll in this registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are referred by the stroke team and also by vascular surgery. The potential&#xD;
      risks, including recent stroke, excessive cardiopulmonary risk, last remaining patent vessel,&#xD;
      etc are all considered as well as the risks of traditional medical or surgical therapy. All&#xD;
      treatment options along with possible risks and benefits will be extensively discussed. Cases&#xD;
      are reviewed by a multidisciplinary team at a scheduled conference. It is determined at that&#xD;
      time whether the patient may be a candidate for carotid stenting. If all criteria are met,&#xD;
      then the procedure and study as well as other options will be explained to the patient. An&#xD;
      extensive discussion will occur with the patient and family regarding all potential treatment&#xD;
      options, risks, and benefits. If the patient wishes to proceed with carotid stenting and be&#xD;
      included in the study, an office visit is made with the investigator if not previously done&#xD;
      and a possible procedure date is set after the visit with the investigator. At the office&#xD;
      visit, the study and informed consent will be explained. All questions will be answered and&#xD;
      the patient, if he wishes, will agree to the study by signing the informed consent. The&#xD;
      patient and family will be given phone numbers to call for any additional concerns or&#xD;
      questions and are repeatedly encouraged to contact us for any arising concerns both before&#xD;
      and after the procedure.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient must be &gt; 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient must be clinically symptomatic, i.e., within the previous 120 days have&#xD;
             experienced in the ipsilateral carotid artery distribution, either 1) one or more&#xD;
             TIAs, characterized by distinct focal neurologic dysfunction or monocular blindness&#xD;
             with clearing of signs and symptoms within 24 hours, or 2) one or more completed&#xD;
             strokes (as defined by this protocol) with persistence of symptoms or signs for more&#xD;
             than 24 hours (the most recent event is used as the qualifying event). Except as&#xD;
             excluded below, the patient must have documented stenosis &gt; 60%, of the common or&#xD;
             internal carotid artery. For an asymptomatic patient to be considered, the patient&#xD;
             must have a &gt; 70% diameter stenosis of the internal or common carotid artery without&#xD;
             neurological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. An angiogram is required to qualify the patient, it should be as recent as feasible&#xD;
             and will not be acceptable if done &gt; 120 days from study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. An ultrasound will be used as a screening procedure for potential eligible patients&#xD;
             and will be performed less than 30 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stenosis &gt;50%: PSV&gt;130 cm/sec; EDV &lt;135 cm/sec&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stenosis &gt;80%: PSV&gt;220 cm/sec; EDV ³135 cm/sec&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PSV ICA/PSV CCA ratio ³ 4.011&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The stenosis must be of presumed atherosclerotic origin or secondary to restenosis&#xD;
             after previous endarterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The target lesion may be in the native common or internal carotid artery&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Temporary cardiac pacing of the patient must be possible, if necessary, along with any&#xD;
             necessary hemodynamic support such as vasopressor agents or hemodynamic monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients taking warfarin may be included if their dosage is reduced before the&#xD;
             procedure to result in an INR of 1.5 or less and a Prothrombin Time of 15 seconds.&#xD;
             Warfarin may be restarted after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a documented negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test during the index hospitalization because exposure to the radiation and the drugs&#xD;
             (antiplatelet agents, anticoagulant agents) given during the cath lab procedure would&#xD;
             be potentially harmful to an unborn fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient or legally authorized representative must sign a written informed consent,&#xD;
             prior to the procedure, using a form that is approved by the local Institutional&#xD;
             Review Board or Medical Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates will be excluded from the study if ANY of the following conditions apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has had an intracranial hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, major stroke, or&#xD;
             any stroke with mass effect demonstrated on CT scan or MRI within four weeks of the&#xD;
             index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has an intracranial mass lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient has an ipsilateral intracranial or extracranial arterial stenosis greater&#xD;
             in severity than the treatment lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient has known allergies to heparin, to both ticlopidine and clopidogrel or to&#xD;
             metals used in stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient has a history of prior life-threatening reaction to the radiocontrast&#xD;
             agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient has peripheral vascular, supra-aortic or internal carotid artery&#xD;
             tortuosity precluding use of catheter-based techniques required for successful&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Femoral access is not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient, if female, has a positive pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient has any intracranial aneurysm (&gt; 6 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;

             artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The patient has unstable angina or evolving MI. .&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.&#xD;
