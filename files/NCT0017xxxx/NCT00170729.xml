  <brief_title>A Study to Compare Ocular Safety and Tolerability of Eye Drops Containing Prednisolone Acetate in Patients With Intraocular Inflammation After Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
  <official_title>Multi-center, Randomized, Double Masked, Vehicle Controlled Phase IV Study to Compare the Efficacy, Ocular Safety and Tolerability of a Two Day Treatment With Eye Drops (0.5% Prednisolone Acetate, One Drop Four Times Per Day) in Patients With Intraocular Inflammation After Cataract Surgery, Followed by an Open Label Observational Period of 12 Days</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to demonstrate that two days of treatment with 0.5% prednisolone&#xD;
      acetate eye-drops after cataract surgery are superior to vehicle in reducing the flare in the&#xD;
      anterior chamber of the operated eye.&#xD;
