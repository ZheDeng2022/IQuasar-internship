    <textblock>
      This is a complimentary study to an elderly influenza study. Subjects 18-40 will receive a&#xD;
      single dose flu vaccine and be evaluated for humoral and cell mediated immunity to influenza&#xD;
      antigens.&#xD;

      The goals of this study are to provide in depth humoral and cellular immune responses to the&#xD;
      standard-dose trivalent SV influenza virus vaccine containing 15 pg HA of each virus strain&#xD;
      in healthy young adults. Serum samples will be submitted for the following analysis:&#xD;
      measurement of serum anti-HA (hemagglutinin) IgG and IgA antibodies by ELISA, IgG antibody&#xD;
      subclasses, IgG and IgA Avidity, Virus neutralizing functional assay, HAI antibody titer.&#xD;
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from these subjects will be evaluated for&#xD;
      the following: &quot;central&quot; (TCM) and &quot;effector&quot; (TEM) memory T cell responses, including their&#xD;
      proliferative responses and cytokine production profiles by flow cytometry, IFN-7 production&#xD;
      by ELISPOT, following specific antigenic stimulation. Serum samples will be submitted for the&#xD;
      following analysis: measurement ex vivo of the frequency of circulating influenza-specificT&#xD;
      cells by using commercially available MHC/tetramers and/or MHC/pentamers and flow cytometry,&#xD;
      role of regulatory T cells in the modulation of influenza responses in young adults. Fifteen&#xD;
      healthy young adult subjects, age 18-40 years, inclusive, will be recruited from the general&#xD;
      population to be enrolled in this study. No randomization or masking procedures will be used.&#xD;
      All eligible subjects will be administered one intramuscular (IM) injection of the same FDA&#xD;
      approved standard-dose (15 mcg HA per strain) trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine,&#xD;
      2004-2005 season, and key humoral and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses will be compared&#xD;
      to those of elderly subjects enrolled under DMID 05-0028. On both Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and&#xD;
      day 28 (post-vaccination), an 100 ml volume of whole blood will be obtained for a complete&#xD;
      blood count (CBC) with differential and to isolate and cryopreserve serum and PBMCs. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate key humoral and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses in healthy young&#xD;
      adults to establish a baseline immune response which will be used to evaluate changes&#xD;
      associated with immunosenescence. This study is linked to DMID protocol 05-0028.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or nonpregnant female (as indicated by a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             immediately prior to vaccine administration) between the ages of 18 and 40 years,&#xD;
             inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women of childbearing potential who are at risk of becoming pregnant must agree to&#xD;
             practice adequate contraception (i.e., barrier method, abstinence, and licensed&#xD;
             hormonal methods) for the entire study period (28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. In good health, as determined by medical history and a targeted physical examination,&#xD;
             if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able to provide informed consent and be available for all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has a known allergy to eggs or other components of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has a positive urine pregnancy test at screening or prior to vaccination (if female),&#xD;
             is lactating, or has the intention to become pregnant within 3 months of enrollment in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Is undergoing immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has an active neoplastic disease or a history of any hematologic malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is using oral or parenteral steroids, high-dose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 mcg/day of&#xD;
             beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic&#xD;
