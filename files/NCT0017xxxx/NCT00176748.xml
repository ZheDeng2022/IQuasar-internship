  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out the good and bad effects of an investigational drug that&#xD;
      is not approved for sale, called AG-013736. Tumors need blood vessels in order to continue to&#xD;
      grow, and AG-013736 is thought to work by playing a role in preventing new blood vessels from&#xD;
      growing. We want to see if AG-013736 has any effect on your disease by making your tumor&#xD;
      smaller and if so, for how long. We also want to test the safety [the effect on your body] of&#xD;
      AG-013736 and to measure the amount of AG-013736 that gets into your blood. AG-013736 has&#xD;
      been given to over 140 patients with cancer on other studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 23,600 new cases of thyroid&#xD;
      cancer (5,960 in men and 17,640 in women) annually in the United States, and about 1,460&#xD;
      people (620 men and 840 women) will die from this disease.1 It is the most common malignancy&#xD;
      of the endocrine system. Depending upon type and stage, thyroid cancer may be treated with&#xD;
      surgery, radioactive iodine (131I), hormone treatment, external radiation, or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The systemic therapy of metastatic disease remains palliative until new agents are found that&#xD;
      might afford a better prognosis. Thyroid tumors are often vascular, and a decrease in the&#xD;
      number of blood vessels that supply the tumor may starve it of needed nutrients. An approach&#xD;
      to blocking the growth of blood vessels that supply the tumor is to inhibit the VEGF receptor&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase (VEGFR TK) signaling pathway. The VEGFR TK inhibitor SU011248 has produced 4&#xD;
      objective responses in 15 patients receiving the drug on Phase 1 studies.2 AG-013736 is&#xD;
      another VEGFR TK inhibitor. Besides having potential anti-angiogenesis properties through&#xD;
      VEGFR TK inhibition, it also has additional potential antitumor through platelet derived&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (PDGFR) TK inhibition.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for the study, subjects must satisfy all the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically documented thyroid cancer with metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Failure of 131I to control the disease or 131I is not an appropriate therapy (eg, due&#xD;
             to lack of iodine uptake by the tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No expectation of further effects of prior anticancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. At least 1 target lesion, as defined by RECIST (Appendix C), that has not been&#xD;
             irradiated. New lesions that have developed in a previously irradiated field may be&#xD;
             used as sites of measurable disease assuming all other criteria are met. All target&#xD;
             lesions must have a unidimensional diameter of at least 2 cm. (1 cm is acceptable for&#xD;
             spiral CT scans if the reconstruction algorithm is 0.5 cm). Baseline&#xD;
             measurements/evaluations must be completed within 4 weeks prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function documented within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             treatment as documented by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC, calculated as the absolute number of neutrophils&#xD;
                  and bands) ≥1.5 x 109 cells/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥100 x 109 cells /L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST and ALT ≤2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless there are liver metastases&#xD;
                  in which case AST and ALT ≤5.0 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or calculated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Urinary protein &lt;2+ by urine dipstick. If dipstick is ≥2+ then a 24-hour urine&#xD;
                  collection can be done and the patient may enter only if urinary protein is &lt;2 g&#xD;
                  per 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (see Appendix D)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No evidence of preexisting uncontrolled hypertension as documented by 2 baseline blood&#xD;
             pressure readings taken at least 1 hour apart. The baseline systolic blood pressure&#xD;
             readings must be ≤140, and the baseline diastolic blood pressure readings must be ≤90.&#xD;
             Patients whose hypertension is controlled by antihypertensive therapies are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Written and voluntary informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with one or more of the following criteria are ineligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Central lung lesions involving major blood vessels (arteries or veins). (Central&#xD;
             lesions that maintain the structural integrity of vessels have the potential to bleed&#xD;
             if the tumor lesion undergoes necrosis. MRI or CT angiography should be used in any&#xD;
             case where there is any question as to whether blood vessels are involved.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of hemoptysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Gastrointestinal abnormalities including:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  requirement for intravenous alimentation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  prior surgical procedures affecting absorption including gastric resection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  treatment for active peptic ulcer disease in the past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  active gastrointestinal bleeding, unrelated to cancer, as evidenced by&#xD;
                  hematemesis, hematochezia or melena in the past 3 months without evidence of&#xD;
                  resolution documented by endoscopy or colonoscopy.&#xD;

             of epidermoid growth factor (EGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), or&#xD;
             fibroblast growth factors (FGF) receptors.&#xD;

             CYP3A4 inhibitors (ie, grapefruit juice, verapamil, ketoconazole, miconazole,&#xD;
             itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ergot derivatives, indinavir, saquinavir,&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Active seizure disorder or evidence of brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that would impair their&#xD;
             ability to receive study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of a malignancy (other than thyroid cancer) except those treated with curative&#xD;
             intent for skin cancer (other than melanoma) or in situ breast or cervical cancer or&#xD;
             those treated with curative intent for any other cancer with no evidence of disease&#xD;
             for 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Major surgical procedure or any radiation therapy within 4 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding&#xD;
             or rendering of informed consent and compliance with the requirements of this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients (male and female) having procreative potential who are not using adequate&#xD;
             contraception or practicing abstinence&#xD;
