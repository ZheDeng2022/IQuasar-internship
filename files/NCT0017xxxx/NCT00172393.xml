  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study involved 142 children with EV71 CNS infections that included 61 (43%) with viral&#xD;
      meningitis, 53 (37%) with severe CNS involvement including encephalitis, polio-like syndrome&#xD;
      and encephalomyelitis, and 28 (20%) with cardiopulmonary failure after CNS involvement. These&#xD;
      children were subjected to physical and neurological examinations 2.85 (range 1.0-7.39) years&#xD;
      after disease onset. Those below the age of 6 years took the Denver developmental screening&#xD;
      test, while those 4 years and over took the intelligence quotient (IQ) test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For the purposes of our study we identified all the EV71 pediatric patients at Chang Gung&#xD;
      Children's Hospital (CGCH) and at the NTUH between 1998 and 2003. These patients were&#xD;
      clinically confirmed to have hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) of herpangina or febrile&#xD;
      illness, and a positive laboratory-confirmed EV71 infection. The EV 71 infection was&#xD;
      confirmed on the basis of a positive viral isolation of EV71 and/or a positive EV71 IgM&#xD;
      and/or a four-fold rise in EV71 neutralizing antibody serotiters between the acute and the&#xD;
      convalescent sera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involved 621 EV71 patients in total, 534 of them at the CGCH and 87 of them at the&#xD;
      NTUH. Of these, 232 cases (37.4%) had CNS involvement. The clinical severity of the EV71 CNS&#xD;
      involvement was classified in terms of the increasing severity of the infection: Group 1:&#xD;
      cases with mild CNS involvement i.e. aseptic meningitis; Group 2: cases with severe CNS&#xD;
      involvement including encephalitis, polio-like syndrome or encephalomyelitis; and Group 3:&#xD;
      cases with cardiopulmonary failure after central nervous system involvement. Patients placed&#xD;
      in Group 1, were those experiencing headaches, irritability and CSF pleocytosis (&gt;5x106&#xD;
      leukocytes/L) but no altered level of consciousness or focal signs. Patients placed in Group&#xD;
      2, were encephalitis with an altered level of consciousness plus CSF pleocytosis,&#xD;
      poliomyelitis-like syndrome with acute limb weakness, and decreased reflex and muscle&#xD;
      strength, and encephalomyelitis with the occurrence of both encephalitis and&#xD;
      poliomyelitis-like syndrome. Patients placed in Group 3 were those who had experienced&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary failure (defined as a decreased ejection fraction of the left ventricle as&#xD;
      assessed by echocardiography with or without pulmonary edema/hemorrhage, necessitating&#xD;
      inotropic agent and ventilator support). Patients who experienced cardiopulmonary failure&#xD;
      after CNS involvement have been found to have had a sudden onset of cardiopulmonary failure&#xD;
      several hours or several days after the manifestations of their EV71 CNS infections.5,16 Of&#xD;
      these 232 cases with CNS involvement, 25 (10.8%) patients died of cardiopulmonary failure and&#xD;
      brainstem encephalitis during acute illness. 19 of these 25 patients died within 7 days of&#xD;
      the onset of acute illness, while 14 (6.0%) patients died due to a deep coma or aspiration&#xD;
      pneumonia during the convalescent stage (i.e. more than one month after onset of their&#xD;
      disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the remaining 193 patients with CNS involvement (172 of these at the CGCH and 21 of these&#xD;
      at the NTUH), 22 refused to be assessed and 29 could not be located. This means that a total&#xD;
      of 142 (73.6%) patients were enrolled in our study and took the assessment between January&#xD;
      2003 and December 2005 after informed consent was obtained from their parents (Figure 1). The&#xD;
      clinical severity and the demography of the 142 patients who were assessed and the 51&#xD;
      patients who were not assessed (p=0.22 for clinical severity, p=0.33 for their age of onset,&#xD;
      and p=0.35 for genders) were similar. It is therefore clear that the size of the study&#xD;
      population involving these 142 patients is representative of the 193 EV71 patients with CNS&#xD;
      involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and neurological outcome and neurodevelopment assessment All the children were&#xD;
      physically and neurologically examined by a pediatrician or a pediatric neurologist during an&#xD;
      outpatient visit or during their stay at chronic respiratory centers. Their physical handicap&#xD;
      or neurological sequelae, the requirement of ventilator support and the need of tube feeding&#xD;
      were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EV71 patients who were younger than 6 years of age during our assessment were tested with the&#xD;
      Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST II). The DDST II has four categories: gross motor,&#xD;
      fine motor, language, and personal-social.17 Each test item was scored as either passed or&#xD;
      failed. The overall assessment of each child was considered normal when the child passed&#xD;
      tasks in 25-75% for his/her age, or delayed when the child failed tasks to the left of&#xD;
      his/her age line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive function assessment The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition&#xD;
      (WISC-III, Wechsler, 1991) profile was individually assessed by a child psychologist for all&#xD;
      children over four years of age except for 3 of the children who had tracheostomy and could&#xD;
      not talk. The WISC-III is a widely used measure of general intelligence for children aged&#xD;
      4-16 years. The WISC-III is composed of 13 subtests to test children's cognitive ability of&#xD;
      different dimensions, which are grouped into two scores: the performance IQ score and the&#xD;
      verbal IQ score. The Performance IQ score (7 subtests) includes Picture Completion, Block&#xD;
      Design, Object Assembly, Picture Arrangement, Coding, Symbol Search and Mazes subtests. The&#xD;
      Verbal IQ score (6 subtests) includes Information, Comprehension, Arithmetic, Similarities,&#xD;
      Digit Span and Vocabulary subtests.18 Four factorially derived composite subscales have been&#xD;
      created: (1) Verbal Comprehension: Information, Similarities, Vocabulary, and Comprehension;&#xD;
      (2) Perceptual Organization: Picture Completion, Picture Arrangement, Block Design, and&#xD;
      Object Assembly; (3) Freedom From Distractibility: Arithmetic and Digit span; and (4) Process&#xD;
      Speed: Coding and Symbol Search. 18 Each of the IQ scores and four composite subscales yield&#xD;
      standard scores with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation (S.D.) of 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed with the SAS Statistical Package (Version 9.1, SAS&#xD;
      Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Data are expressed as mean Â±S.D., median (range) or number&#xD;
      (percentage). The Chi-square test was used for categorical data, and the student t-test and&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for continuous variables with normal distribution. The&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney rank sum test or Kruskal-Wallis test was used for continuous variables without a&#xD;
      normal distribution in the univariate analysis. If a significant difference was found with&#xD;
      ANOVA, pairwise comparison would be performed with the Scheffe test. Multivariate analysis of&#xD;
      variance (MANOVA) was used to identify the most significant factors affecting the cognitive&#xD;
      function (IQ and the four composite subscales).. P values less than 0.05 were considered&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
