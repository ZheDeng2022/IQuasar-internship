  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the interest of improving visual quality after LASIK we have designed a multifaceted study&#xD;
      to test the theoretical, physical, biomechanical and functional effects of commercial and&#xD;
      independently designed aspherical ablation profiles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The quality of an image on the retina is determined by the optical system of the eyeball,&#xD;
      which is dominated by the refractive contribution of the optically powerful cornea. The large&#xD;
      difference in refractive index between air and the cornea is the basis for anterior corneal&#xD;
      refractive surgery such as Laser in situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) which reshapes the naturally&#xD;
      aspherical cornea to correct a patient's vision. In addition to correcting refractive errors,&#xD;
      current spherical LASIK treatments have been shown to increase ocular wavefront aberrations&#xD;
      which can reduce visual quality postoperatively. Modifications of the corneal-ablation&#xD;
      algorithm have been suggested to correct this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, most ablation algorithms have relied on the Munnerlyn formula, which assumes&#xD;
      the anterior corneal surface to be spherical before and after refractive surgery. One concept&#xD;
      for customized ablation is to apply an ablation during the surgical procedure which has been&#xD;
      adapted to the patient's own aberration pattern. Since custom ablation algorithms are&#xD;
      proprietary and we do not know how they consider the role of asphericity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precisely altering the corneal asphericity after refraction surgery is a complex phenomenon&#xD;
      which includes biomechanical effects. Thus, knowledge of the cornea's response to the&#xD;
      different aspherical ablation profiles is vital for understanding corneal properties and&#xD;
      prediction of surgical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve computer simulation of ablation profiles for the respective lasers,&#xD;
      interferometric analysis of actual ablation profiles on PMMA plates, optimization for visual&#xD;
      correction, functional studies of the short and long term effects of the profiles on in vivo&#xD;
      human corneas, and quantitative subjective (questionnaire and visual tests) and objective&#xD;
      analysis (calculation of retinal image quality metrics) and comparison of the effects&#xD;
      aspherical ablation profiles on visual quality. The completion of the project will lead to&#xD;
      objective evaluation of current ablation profiles as well as the development and evaluation&#xD;
      of new optimized laser refractive surgery procedures with improved outcomes.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This will be a prospective study including at least 60 patients. The initial study&#xD;
             group will include 6-10 patients. Both eyes of enrolled patients should be included in&#xD;
             the study unless exclusion criteria prevent it. The primary efficacy variables for&#xD;
             this study are wavefront error, visual acuity, autorefraction and contrast&#xD;
             sensitivity. Subjects will be followed over a 3 month period. A proposed examination&#xD;
             schedule is listed in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eyes will also be divided into groups by refractive error: Low myopia 0-3D, moderate myopia&#xD;
        3-6D, and high myopia 6-9 D and very high myopia &gt; 9D MSRE. The size of the Optical Zone&#xD;
        and Transitional Zone is measured, and results are compared for patients of similar&#xD;
        refractive error (+/- 0.5 S +/- 0.5 C). Analysis is carried out using a matrix analysis of&#xD;
        the total refractive error, comparison of Visual Acuity, Contrast Sensitivity and Responses&#xD;
        on a Questionnaire to assess the patient's quality of vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Equal numbers of eyes from each of the four refractive error groups and from each of the&#xD;
        three treatment groups (OATZ profile 5, OATZ profile 6, conventional) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will consider patients operated on by the same doctor (Dr. Lin). We will also compare&#xD;
        treatments of patients and wavefront maps of patients who have similar spherical and&#xD;
        cylindrical refractive errors.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if they have a history of ocular pathology, previous ocular&#xD;
             surgery, thin corneas (preoperatively calculated minimal residual bed &lt; 250um) or fit&#xD;
             into the group of the usual exclusionary criteria (e.g. irregular astigmatism,&#xD;
             asymmetric astigmatism, unstable refraction).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Possible additional exclusion criteria include no previous refractive surgery, no&#xD;
        hyperopia, preop BSCVA 20/25 or better, ages from 21-60 years old, astigmatism above 2D,&#xD;
        difficult cases and equal numbers of men and women&#xD;
