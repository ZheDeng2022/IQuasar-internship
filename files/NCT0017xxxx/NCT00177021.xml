  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to examine the efficacy and tolerability of Aldara Cream 5% for the treatment of&#xD;
      extensive alopecia areata. Aldara is a immune-response modifier. The drug induces the&#xD;
      production of cytokines which are small, hormone-like proteins involved in cellular&#xD;
      communication during immune responses. We hypothesize that this drug will effect the&#xD;
      inflammatory cells present around hair follicles in patients with alopecia areata.&#xD;

      Ten patients with extensive scalp alopecia areata (&gt;95% hair loss)of less than 2 years&#xD;
      duration will be invited to participate in this study. For six months each person will be&#xD;
      asked to apply Aldara Cream 5% daily to the right half of the scalp. No drug will be applied&#xD;
      to the left side. Skin biopsies will be taken of the right scalp before and at the completion&#xD;
      of the therapy.&#xD;
