      This study uses a double autologous peripheral blood stem cell rescue (PBSC) following&#xD;
      dose-intensive chemotherapy for the treatment of high-risk pediatric solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significant advances have been made in recent years in the treatment of solid tumors of&#xD;
      childhood. However, much of the improvement in survival has been made in low stage and&#xD;
      localized disease. Of significance is the fact that the improvements have come in up-front&#xD;
      remission rates without translation into significantly high event-free survival(EFS) or&#xD;
      overall survival (OS). This is despite the fact that these tumors as a whole are largely&#xD;
      chemotherapy responsive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in the understanding of the biology of hematopoeitic stem cells have driven&#xD;
      the design of treatment regimens that allow for dose intensification without unacceptable&#xD;
      hematologic toxicity. Protocol development has focused on active agents that have a broad&#xD;
      range between hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities. This study uses a double autologous&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cell rescue (PBSC) following dose-intensive chemotherapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of high-risk pediatric solid tumors. This study utilizes PBSC to limit the risk of&#xD;
      tumor cell contamination while retaining prompt hematologic recovery from these highly&#xD;
      intensified treatments.&#xD;

    <description>Patients on this study will undergo a tandem Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Rescue following high-dose chemotherapy. The first Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Rescue will consist of Etoposide, Carboplatin, Cyclophosphamide, and Mesna. Once the patient recovers, the patient will be evaluated again and will then undergo a second stem cell transplant consisting of the chemotherapy drugs; Melphalan, Cyclophosphamide, and Mesna.</description>
    <other_name>Cyclophosphamide call also be referred to as Cytoxan</other_name>
