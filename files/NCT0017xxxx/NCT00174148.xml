  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systematically assessing the proprioception-coordination capacity of the spine in patients&#xD;
      with different severity of neck disability could reveal how the dysfunction of the&#xD;
      sensory-motor system was progressed. From the result of the research, a prospective study&#xD;
      would be designed to test the hypotheses that described the mechanism of neck pain based on&#xD;
      the results to the present study.&#xD;

      The purposes of this research were to investigate the effect of age and chronic neck pain on&#xD;
      cervical proprioception, the change of ultrasonographic (USD) patterns in deep neck muscle&#xD;
      and superficial neck muscles. The hypotheses of this research included: 1) the alteration of&#xD;
      neck proprioception is determined predominantly by the changed activation deep neck muscles&#xD;
      and superficial neck muscles. 2) Age factor contributes to the alteration of cervicocephalic&#xD;
      sensibility, USD pattern of deep and superficial muscles. 3) Chronic pain contributes to the&#xD;
      alteration of cervicocephalic sensibility, USD pattern of deep and superficial muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neck proprioception is measured by an ultrasound-based coordinate measuring system (CMS 70P,&#xD;
      Zebris, Germany) by asking the subjects to performed head repositioning to the neutral head&#xD;
      position or to a target position in three cardinal plane. These repositioning error expressed&#xD;
      in root mean square errors could represent the craniocervical kinesthetic sensibility. The&#xD;
      change of muscle thickness (mm) of the superficial (Trapezium, Splenius) and deep&#xD;
      (semispinalis cervicis and multifidus) dorsal neck muscle is measured by a real-time&#xD;
      ultrasonographic scanner (HDI 5000, ATL Ultrasound, USA). Image is obtained for each cervical&#xD;
      level, and the thickness of the muscle is identified manually using a custom-written C++&#xD;
      computer graphic program. The measurements of pain intensity and pain frequency are modified&#xD;
      from the symptoms questionnaire to indicate the intensity, location, frequency and duration&#xD;
      of pain and disability of the subjects. The age and pain effects for each independent&#xD;
      variables measured in patients with chronic neck pain (pain: intensity, location, frequency,&#xD;
      and duration, NDI), will be tested with the General Linear Model (GLM; age and pain factors).&#xD;
      The confounding factors such as gender, range of motion, body height and weight are&#xD;
      controlled in the regression model.&#xD;
