      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between SDF-1/CXCR4 and&#xD;
      metastasis of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer of the larynx and hypopharynx remains the third most common head and neck malignancy,&#xD;
      constituting about 20% of all tumors. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common&#xD;
      histopathologic type of the laryngeal and hypopharyngeal malignancies, accounting for more&#xD;
      than 90% of cancers occurring in this region. Lymph node metastasis directly affects the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal SCC. The presence of lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis significantly reduces the probability of regional control and survival.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the American Cancer Society shows no trend toward an improvement in 5-year&#xD;
      survival rates between patients diagnosed in 1974 to 1976 and 1989 to 1995.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor metastasis is the hallmark of malignancy, and is probably a result of the interaction&#xD;
      between tumor cells and a supportive microenvironment. Malignant cells that have the&#xD;
      capability to metastasize to a particular organ may have various properties supporting their&#xD;
      tissue invasion or growth such as enhanced adherence to the microvascular cells of the organ,&#xD;
      higher responsiveness to chemotactic signals released from the target organs and increased&#xD;
      response to local soluble or tissue associated growth signals in the target organ. Though&#xD;
      several molecules expressed or produced in cancer cells are considered the metastatic&#xD;
      factors, it remains unknown which factors produced by the lymph node or tissue affect the&#xD;
      metastasis of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemokines are a large family of pro-inflammatory polypeptide cytokines, consisting of small&#xD;
      (7-15 kDa), structurally related heparin-binding proteins. They are grouped into CXC&#xD;
      chemokines and CC chemokines, on the basis of the characteristic presence of four conserved&#xD;
      cysteine residues. Chemokines are produced locally in the tissues and act on target cells&#xD;
      through G-protein-coupled receptors, which are characterized structurally by seven&#xD;
      transmembrane spanning domains. Chemokines are involved in the attraction and activation of&#xD;
      mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes to sites of inflammatory responses, bacterial or&#xD;
      viral infections, allergy, cardiovascular diseases and wound healing. Chemokines are known to&#xD;
      also function as regulatory molecules in the leukocyte maturation, trafficking, and homing of&#xD;
      T and B lymphocytes, in the development of lymphoid tissues, and in dendritic cell&#xD;
      maturation. Other functions of chemokines have been described more recently, particularly for&#xD;
      the CXC chemokines. The role of chemokines in malignant tumors is not clear yet. Some&#xD;
      chemokines may enhance innate or specific host immunity against tumor dissemination. On the&#xD;
      other hand, some may advocate tumor growth and metastasis by promoting tumor cell&#xD;
      proliferation, migration or angiogenesis in tumor tissue. Reports have suggested that several&#xD;
      types of cancer, such as breast, ovary, prostate, kidney, brain, lung, and thyroid, expressed&#xD;
      the chemokine receptor and used the chemokines to metastasize to the target organ as in the&#xD;
      homing of hematopoietic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SDF-1 belongs to the CXC chemokine family and is a ligand for CXCR4. SDF-1 was initially&#xD;
      cloned by Tashiro et al. and later identified as a growth factor for B cell progenitors, a&#xD;
      chemotactic factor for T cells and monocytes, and in B-cell lymphopoiesis and bone marrow&#xD;
      myelopoiesis. Most of the chemokine receptors interact with pleural ligands, and vice versa,&#xD;
      but the SDF-1/CXCR4 receptor ligand system has been shown to involve a one-on-one&#xD;
      interaction. Recently, several studies have been conducted to detect the mRNA expression of&#xD;
      CXCR4 and SDF-1 in solid tumors. The results are not uniform, and the relevance to cancer&#xD;
      progression is not determined. Sehgal et al. concluded that CXCR4 plays an important role of&#xD;
      proliferation and tumorigenic properties of human glioblastoma tumors. Muller et al. have&#xD;
      reported that SDF-1 signaling through CXCR4 interaction appears to determine the directional&#xD;
      migration of breast cancer cells through the basement membrane. Furthermore in vivo, the&#xD;
      interaction between SDF-1 and CXCR4 significantly represses the metastatic potential of&#xD;
      breast cancer cells to lymph node and lung. Barnard and his colleagues showed the contrary&#xD;
      results that CXCR4 mRNA expression was reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue when&#xD;
      compared with noncancerous tissue, but was not changed in colon, esophageal, and gastric&#xD;
      cancer. They also found reduced mRNA expression of SDF-1 in these malignant tissues. Thus,&#xD;
      there is a diversity of views on the role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 receptor ligand system in&#xD;
      malignant tissues. And such studies are limited in laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastasis of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer occurs frequently through the lymphatic&#xD;
      system, and metastasis is a key prognostic factor for the disease. Evaluation of the&#xD;
      relationship between SDF-1/CXCR4 system and metastasis in laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer&#xD;
      could help us understand whether this system is important in the metastasis of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that SDF-1/CXCR4 (ligand/receptor) system plays an important role in&#xD;
      laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the distribution of CXCR4 protein expression in cancer and lymph node tissues by means&#xD;
           of immunohistochemical analysis of tissue samples obtained from surgical operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the relationship between CXCR4 expression and clinicopathological findings with special&#xD;
           reference to cancer metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the expression of SDF-1 and CXCR4 in the cancer cell line cells and tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the chemotactic activity and the growth-promoting effect of SDF-1 on cancer cell line&#xD;
           cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the role of Src, MAPK, and Akt signal transduction pathway in this response&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. the effect of the blocking agent on this response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undoubtedly, the findings of this study will help us understand whether SDF-1/CXCR4 system&#xD;
      could be a focal point of anti-cancer research. If laryngeal and hypopharyngeal SCC that&#xD;
      express high levels of CXCR4 show a consistently higher incidence of lymphatic and distant&#xD;
      metastasis, then blocking SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling may be a novel approach to inhibit metastasis&#xD;
      in these patients. The development of SDF-1/CXCR4 system antagonists will provide an&#xD;
      opportunity to improve the survival rate.&#xD;
