      This study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of an investigational drug on bone loss&#xD;
      in men with prostate cancer who are receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to participate, male patients 18 years and older must be veterans from participating&#xD;
      Veterans Administration Medical Centers that are receiving ADT for prostate cancer and have&#xD;
      established osteoporosis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of carcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage M0: Patients just starting ADT must be stage M0 [PSA &lt;10 (then bone scan not&#xD;
             needed) or negative bone scan (regardless of PSA)]. Patients already on ADT must have&#xD;
             been M0 at the initiation of ADT and have maintained a stable, low PSA (&lt; 2.0) on&#xD;
             continuous ADT since that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients initiating or receiving ADT with a LHRH agonist (with or without an&#xD;
             antiandrogen) and with the intended duration of ADT of at least 12 months from the&#xD;
             time of randomization. Patients undergoing bilateral orchiectomy or with history of&#xD;
             this procedure are also eligible. For patients already on ADT, the therapy must be&#xD;
             continuous, and if there is more than one missed or delayed dose (&gt; 1 mo delay) in any&#xD;
             one year period, the patient is not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with a baseline BMD T-score &lt;-2.0 in the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and/or the total&#xD;
             hip are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zubrod performance status of 0, 1, or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received any bisphosphonate therapy in the past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metabolic bone disease including Paget's disease or hyperparathyroidism or vitamin D&#xD;
             deficiency. Patients with vitamin D deficiency or secondary hyperparathyroidism due to&#xD;
             vitamin D deficiency may be treated and reassessed for consideration for the trial, as&#xD;
             detailed in Appendix 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiographic evidence of bone metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received treatment with systemic corticosteroids within the past 12&#xD;
             months (short term corticosteroid therapy for up to one month duration, e.g. for acute&#xD;
             illness like asthma exacerbation, is acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior exposure to anabolic steroids or growth hormone within the past 6&#xD;
             months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current treatment with estrogen or complementary medicines known to contain estrogens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previous or concomitant malignancy within the past 5 years except&#xD;
             adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and colonic polyps&#xD;
             with non-invasive malignancy which have been removed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with nonmalignant conditions which would confound the evaluation of the&#xD;
             primary endpoint, impair tolerance of therapy, or prevent compliance to the protocol,&#xD;
             including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  uncontrolled infections&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  diseases with influence on bone metabolism, such as Paget's disease or&#xD;
                  uncontrolled thyroid or parathyroid dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, pulmonary and neurologic/psychiatric diseases&#xD;
                  which would prevent prolonged follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinical or radiological evidence of existing fracture in the lumbar&#xD;
             spine or either hip&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of lumbar spine surgery that directly involved the bone or&#xD;
             resulted in implanted hardware; or rendered the lumbar spine not evaluable (Some&#xD;
             patients with a history of laminectomy alone may qualify).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of unilateral fracture of hip due to trauma or unilateral hip&#xD;
             surgery and the other hip and lumbar spine are not evaluable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom the lumbar spine and at least one hip are not evaluable for any&#xD;
             reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients treated with systemic investigational drugs(s) and /or device(s) within the&#xD;
             past 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any prior treatment for osteoporosis except for calcium and vitamin D&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with abnormal renal function as evidenced by either a serum creatinine&#xD;
             greater than 3 mg/dL or by a calculated creatinine clearance of 40 ml/minute or less&#xD;
             (Use Cockcroft-Gault equation. See Appendix 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corrected (adjusted for serum albumin) serum calcium concentration &lt; 8.0 mg/dl (2.00&#xD;
             mmol/L)\&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.&#xD;
