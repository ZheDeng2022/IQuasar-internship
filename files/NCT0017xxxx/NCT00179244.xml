  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of Risperdal&#xD;
      (risperidone) or bupropion ER (extended release) combined with a SSRI medication and to test&#xD;
      the relative safety of the combinations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depression is a severe disorder with serious consequences. Effective treatments are&#xD;
      available; however, in clinical trials 30-40% of patients do not experience even a 50%&#xD;
      reduction in depression severity scores, while 50-70% fail to achieve a full therapeutic&#xD;
      response. Futhermore, impairment from the disorder continues essentially unabated in patients&#xD;
      who are treated but do not fully remit. If anything, the situation is at least as bad or not&#xD;
      worse in clinical practice. Clearly, alternatives are needed to manage this common clinical&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of bupropion ER (extended release) to an SSRI has empirical support, and has&#xD;
      become the most common augmentation strategy in the US. A comparative trial of the&#xD;
      combination of risperidone or bupropion ER added to an SSRI in treatment resistant deperssion&#xD;
      could help support risperidone for this condition; such a trial seems warranted at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are currently on a SSRI at an adequate dosage for at least 3 weeks with no&#xD;
      response, will be randomly assigned (open-label) to either risperidone or bupropion ER&#xD;
      augmentation for a period of 6 weeks. Patients will be followed weekly at the beginning and&#xD;
      bi-weekly towards the end of the trial to compare the response of each group.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male or female 18 years or older&#xD;

             significant change in depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;

             duloxetine) at an adequate dose for at least 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness to provide consent for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical condition that would preclude treatment with an SSRI, risperidone, or&#xD;
             bupropion ER&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant unstable medical condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of bipolar disorder or a primary diagnosis of any psychotic disorder&#xD;

             caffeine dependence/abuse) or abuse within the last month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented non-response to the combination of a novel antipsychotic or bupropion ER&#xD;
             and a SSRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of any psychotropic other than an SSRI or zolpidem (PRN for sleep)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Score of 4 on the suicide item of the Ham-D scale and determination by the&#xD;
             investigator of significant suicide risk&#xD;
