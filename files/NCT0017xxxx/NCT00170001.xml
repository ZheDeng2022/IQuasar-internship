      The investigators hypothesize that persons with the particular cluster of symptoms that are&#xD;
      due to supraesophageal reflux (SER) will have complete resolution of those symptoms with&#xD;
      adequate acid suppression when a PPI is administered for 6 months.&#xD;

      Estimates suggest that up to 50% of Voice Clinic patients and 10% of ENT and Pulmonology&#xD;
      outpatients seek medical care for chronic laryngopharyngeal symptoms resulting from&#xD;
      supraesophageal reflux (SER). While many anecdotal and uncontrolled studies have shown&#xD;
      significant clinical benefit with Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs), this conclusion has not been&#xD;
      supported in small, randomized, placebo-controlled studies. The recent negative Vaezi trial&#xD;
      (unpublished) was limited by bias introduced in the patient enrollment process due to&#xD;
      reliance on physician diagnosis of SER. This bias became clear during conduction of the&#xD;
      Supraesophageal Reflux Questionnaire (SRQ) Validation Study (Mayo, in press), which&#xD;
      demonstrated that Otolaryngologists vary in their threshold for considering the diagnosis of&#xD;
      SER. This project aims to remove selection bias from the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses/Questions: Our underlying assumptions are as follows: SER is due to the passage of&#xD;
      gastric contents into the esophagus; and with adequate acid suppression provided by a PPI,&#xD;
      there is less overall volume available to reflux, which should improve SER. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that persons with the particular cluster of symptoms that are due to SER will have complete&#xD;
      resolution of those symptoms with adequate acid suppression when PPI is administered for an&#xD;
      adequate duration of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine which symptom(s) (chronic cough, hoarseness, sore throat, globus sensation,&#xD;
           or throat clearing) are completely ameliorated with PPI therapy and hence reflective of&#xD;
           SER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine which features of a patient's history are predictive of a positive response&#xD;
           to PPI therapy, and which confer lack of response; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a scoring system for the SRQ that would predict a diagnosis of SER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Large simple randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of subjects with&#xD;
      chronic laryngopharyngeal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Subjects will be recruited from Olmsted County and from General ENT Clinic and&#xD;
      Pulmonary Chronic Cough Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: Subjects must have at least 1 of 5 chronic (present for at least one&#xD;
      month) and recurrent (at least twice per week) symptoms of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: A dynamic allocation algorithm will be used by the Mayo Pharmacy to balance&#xD;
      the treatment arms for confounding variables for treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention: Either twice daily esomeprazole 40 mg or placebo for 6 months. Beyond a&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing age, no other examination is required for&#xD;
      enrollment or participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up: Subjects will be contacted by phone monthly to assess symptoms, check compliance,&#xD;
      and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: True responders will be those subjects who lack at least one of their&#xD;
      initial symptoms by the 3-month time period, and remain asymptomatic at 4, 5 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Based on previous studies we anticipate a 30-40% placebo response rate at 3&#xD;
      months that will not be sustained at 6 months. We expect roughly 60% to completely respond to&#xD;
      PPI therapy (i.e. 40% do not completely respond). Assuming 140 patients do not completely&#xD;
      respond, we would need 350 patients on PPI therapy. Hence, 70 subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive PPI therapy and 30 randomized to placebo for each symptom group for a total N=500.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This project will identify patients with laryngopharyngeal symptoms most likely&#xD;
      to benefit from empiric PPI therapy. Until we have clarified which symptoms best respond and&#xD;
      do not respond to therapy, we are bound to repeat the errors of the past. Finally, this&#xD;
      project will further validate the SRQ for use in future trials.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary complaint includes one of the following symptoms: chronic cough (dry, hacking,&#xD;
             or nocturnal), hoarseness, sore throat, globus sensation, or throat clearing. These&#xD;
             symptoms will be identified by a yes response to SRQ (Appendix 7) items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,&#xD;
             and 8. Furthermore, symptom(s) must be chronic (present for at least 1 month), and&#xD;
             recurrent (at least twice per week). These criteria correspond to SRQ columns on page&#xD;
             3-5. The first column asks: When in your life did you first notice this symptom? A&#xD;
             response with either number 2, 3, 4, or 5 meets criteria for chronic. The second&#xD;
             column asks: How frequently have you noticed the symptom? A response with either&#xD;
             number 3, 4, or 5 meets criteria for recurrent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of head and neck cancer/radiation/surgery (SRQ items 15, 16, 17)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of esophagus/stomach surgery (SRQ item 22)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peptic or duodenal ulcer disease; stomach or gastric ulcer disease; history of&#xD;
             esophageal stricture, or Barrett's esophagus, or esophagitis, or tumor of the&#xD;
             esophagus or stomach (SRQ item 23 and review of electronic surgical records of Mayo&#xD;
             Clinic patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of alarm symptoms (hemoptysis, unexplained loss of 10 or more pounds in the&#xD;
             past 3 months), obtained from Appendix 5 for Community Subjects, medical record for&#xD;
             clinic subjects. History of dysphagia, defined as a yes answer to SRQ item 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PPI use within 4 weeks, obtained from Appendix 5 for Community Subjects, medical&#xD;
             record for clinic subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of warfarin or digoxin, obtained from Appendix 5 for Community Subjects, medical&#xD;
             record for clinic subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy at the time of enrollment, based on urine pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to understand or read English at a 6th grade level&#xD;
