  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bloodborne pathogens are infectious bacteria, viruses, or other disease-causing germs carried&#xD;
      in blood or other body fluids. These germs include hepatitis B and C viruses and HIV.&#xD;
      Surgical and examination gloves are worn by health care workers to reduce the risk of workers&#xD;
      catching germs from patients or patients catching germs from workers. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to further develop polyvinylidene fluoride coatings for use as a protective coating&#xD;
      worn underneath the gloves. Some health care workers may have tiny cuts on their hands that&#xD;
      need to be protected, and gloves can have defects such as tiny holes that can allow germs to&#xD;
      travel through them. The undercoating can add an additional layer of protection under gloves.&#xD;
      The coating is applied in liquid form to hands and dries as a film without wrinkling,&#xD;
      tearing, lifting, or bubbling. The liquid contains chemicals that fight germs. The coating&#xD;
      also provides protection from skin irritation caused by the latex in some gloves.&#xD;

      The goal of this project is to complete development of a unique thin film technology to be&#xD;
      used as a skin barrier underneath surgical and examination gloves. The technology, which is&#xD;
      antimicrobial upon application to skin, has been developed to reduce transmission of bacteria&#xD;
      and bloodborne pathogens, and is expected to protect skin from the detrimental effects of&#xD;
      chronic glove occlusion and hand washing. Due to the increased prevalence of human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis, the efficacy of surgical and examination gloves&#xD;
      has become an important safety issue, especially for health care workers where occupational&#xD;
      exposure to pathogens in blood or other body fluids is common. Transmission can occur from&#xD;
      both caregiver to patient, and from patient to caregiver. However, glove leaks are frequent&#xD;
      and the potential for pathogen transmission is of great concern. In addition, as awareness of&#xD;
      the hazards from bloodborne pathogen transmission increased along with AIDS awareness in the&#xD;
      1990s, the concomitant increased use of disposable gloves has adversely affected skin&#xD;
      condition, causing increased cumulative irritation contact dermatitis and heightened dermal&#xD;
      sensitization to natural rubber latex. This unique thin film technology is a blend of&#xD;
      polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and acrylic polymers that forms thin membrane coatings that&#xD;
      provide a tough, flexible barrier to liquids, yet have a &quot;breathable&quot; microporous structure.&#xD;
      PVDF-based coatings are applied as a fast drying liquid solution that casts an adherent&#xD;
      contiguous film directly on the skin upon drying. The liquid solution is antimicrobial on&#xD;
      contact, and after drying, the coatings are durable, resistant to penetration by pathogens,&#xD;
      and stay intact for 8 hours or longer. Phase I studies established the feasibility of using&#xD;
      the PVDF technology as a protective barrier to be worn underneath gloves. The Phase I studies&#xD;
      focused on exploiting the coating's inherent hydrophobicity to create a barrier to bacterial&#xD;
      and viral penetration while maintaining breathability and comfort. The coatings demonstrated&#xD;
      barrier function to viral and bacterial pathogens in vitro, proved to be safe in animal&#xD;
      safety studies, and were shown to be a barrier to liquid in human trials. Phase II studies&#xD;
      will complete the development of the PVDF technology for use as a novel protective&#xD;
      underglove. The following aims have been designed to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      product and to satisfy Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements: implement Good&#xD;
      Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and establish packaging; evaluate coating formulations in human&#xD;
      subjects for effects on skin physiology; and demonstrate safety of coatings in human studies.&#xD;
      A skin coating to be worn under gloves that is antimicrobial on contact, provides a barrier&#xD;
      to bloodborne and bacterial pathogens, is a barrier to latex proteins, and could improve skin&#xD;
      conditions on hands, would be beneficial to healthcare in the workplace and likewise have&#xD;
      significant commercial potential.&#xD;
