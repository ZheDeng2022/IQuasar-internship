      This is a dose ranging study comparing different vaccine schedules of rPA vaccine, for&#xD;
      Anthrax, to the licensed dose of AVA, another Anthrax vaccine. Safety and the capability to&#xD;
      induce an immune response will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anthrax is a zoonotic disease, occurring in wild and domestic mammals, caused by the&#xD;
      spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis). Anthrax occurs in humans when they&#xD;
      are exposed to infected animals, tissue from infected animals or when they are directly&#xD;
      exposed to B. anthracis or its spores. Depending on the route of infection, anthrax disease&#xD;
      can occur in three forms: cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and inhalation. In the United States&#xD;
      of America (USA), the annual incidence of human anthrax has declined from approximately 130&#xD;
      cases annually in the early 1900s to no cases during 1999 to 2000. However, in the USA,&#xD;
      shortly after September 11th, 2001, there were 22 cases (18 confirmed) of inhaled and&#xD;
      cutaneous anthrax infection that were related to contaminated mail. The development of a new&#xD;
      anthrax vaccine is necessary because the current AVA vaccine requires the growth of B.&#xD;
      anthracis in its manufacturing process and has a complex administration regimen of six&#xD;
      administrators of vaccine in 18 months. As protective antigen (PA) is a central virulence&#xD;
      factor in anthrax pathogenesis and a major immunogen in the current vaccine, a recombinant,&#xD;
      acellular, protective antigen-based anthrax vaccine, could offer an improved manufacturing&#xD;
      process and a simpler dosing schedule. Furthermore, the vaccine could offer improved&#xD;
      protection against inhaled B. anthracis, and could, when used in conjunction with&#xD;
      antibiotics, form part of the management of anthrax exposed individuals. This is a dose&#xD;
      ranging study comparing different primary vaccine schedules of rPA Anthrax vaccine to the&#xD;
      licensed dose of Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed. The study is designed to measure the immune&#xD;
      response, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of different doses of rPA Anthrax&#xD;
      Vaccine. After subjects have given informed consent, they will undergo physical exams,&#xD;
      medical history screening, pregnancy tests, ECG, HIV, Hepatitis B &amp; C tests, safety blood&#xD;
      tests, and urine drug and alcohol screen. Subjects will be asked to complete a diary card to&#xD;
      record any symptoms they may experience. The subjects that receive AVA will be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to complete the licensed course of vaccination which would involve AVA&#xD;
      vaccinations at 6, 12 and 18 months.&#xD;
