      Aims This study was conducted to examine the association between the ACE insertion/deletion&#xD;
      (I/D) genotype distribution in children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome and the response&#xD;
      to steroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods The patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome were divided into 2&#xD;
      groups according to their clinical response to steroid: SS group including infrequent and&#xD;
      frequent relapsers and non-SS group including steroid resistant (SR) and steroid dependent&#xD;
      (SD) patients. Children without previous renal diseases and negative proteinuria were&#xD;
      enrolled as control group in genetic study. The genotypes for ACE gene I/D polymorphism&#xD;
      including DD, ID and II were analyzed by the newly developed automatic denaturing high&#xD;
      performance liquid chromatography system (DHPLC).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total 59 children diagnosed as nephrotic syndrome at the age of 1 to 10 year-old were&#xD;
             recruited in this study. These children with nephrotic syndrome were under follow-up&#xD;
             at the Pediatric Nephrology Clinic in National Taiwan University Hospital. In&#xD;
             addition, children without previous renal diseases and negative proteinuria were&#xD;
             enrolled as control group in genetic study.&#xD;
