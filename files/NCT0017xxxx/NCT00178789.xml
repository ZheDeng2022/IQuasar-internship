  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, most emergency physicians have limited access to obtaining formal radiology&#xD;
      ultrasound studies, particularly overnight. Many are forced to adopt risky and expensive&#xD;
      strategies in managing their patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) who present&#xD;
      during off-hours: for low risk patients, discharging without anticoagulation and arranging&#xD;
      for outpatient studies; for moderate to high risk patients, empirically anticoagulating and&#xD;
      admitting to the hospital to await definitive testing. If emergency physicians could reliably&#xD;
      perform an accurate ultrasound exam for DVT, such risks could be obviated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, observational cohort study assessing the accuracy of emergency&#xD;
      physician diagnosis of proximal DVT using compact ultrasound equipment and a simplified&#xD;
      compression technique. The value of color flow doppler and augmentation will also be&#xD;
      assessed. Outcomes (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative&#xD;
      likelihood ratio) will be assessed at 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrolling patients in the study, emergency physicians will undertake a 2 hour&#xD;
      training course on the performance of the simplified compression technique for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of lower extremity DVT. Emergency physicians will perform the DVT ultrasound exam on study&#xD;
      subjects with suspected DVT. Clinical management of the study subjects will not be altered;&#xD;
      all subjects will proceed to receive a formal DVT ultrasound study by the radiology&#xD;
      department which will serve as the criterion reference for the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Presenting signs and symptoms sufficiently suspicious for lower extremity DVT to&#xD;
                  warrant a formal radiology study in the opinion of the treating physician AND&#xD;
                  EITHER 2a. Moderate or high pre-test clinical probability of DVT (Wells Criteria)&#xD;
                  OR 2b. Low pre-test clinical probability of DVT with a positive D-dimer&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Documented lower extremity DVT within the past 60 days&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Anatomic abnormality that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude&#xD;
                  imaging of both femoral and popliteal veins on the affected leg (i.e. above-knee&#xD;
                  amputation or severe scarring from intravenous drug abuse in the inguinal area)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patient below the age of 18 years.&#xD;
