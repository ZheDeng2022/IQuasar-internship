  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of Part 1 of the study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of hematologic response (HR) lasting ≥4 weeks in participants with&#xD;
           Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the accelerated&#xD;
           phase (AP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate duration of HR, overall survival, cytogenetic response (CyR), time to blast&#xD;
           crisis in CML participants in the AP, improvement of symptomatic parameters,&#xD;
           tolerability and safety of STI571 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the extension (Part 2) was:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To enable participants to have access to study drug and continue study treatment and to&#xD;
      decrease data collection to include only overall survival and serious adverse events.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Hematologic Response in Accelerated Phase Chronic Myeloid/Myelogenous Leukemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years after start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Hematologic response was evaluated from hematology measurements in the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) and assessments of extramedullary leukemic involvement (EMD) at physical examination. Response was defined as complete hematologic remission (CHR), no evidence of leukemia (NEL), or return to chronic phase (RTC).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Cytogenetic Response in Accelerated Phase Chronic Myeloid/Myelogenous Leukemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years after start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Bone marrow (BM) cytogenetic analysis was required at baseline, after 12 weeks (visit 22) and after 24 weeks (visit 28) to evaluate Ph chromosome positivity. In several participants, this was also done after 4 and 8 weeks. Based on the percentage of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) cells = (positive cells/examined cells)x100, at each BM assessment the cytogenetic response was classified as: Complete, 0% Ph+ cells; Partial, &gt;0 - 35% Ph+ cells; Minor, &gt;35 - 65% Ph+ cells; Minimal, &gt;65 - 95% Ph+ cells; None, &gt;95% Ph+ cells; Not done: &lt;20 metaphases were examined and/or response could not be assigned. Cytogenetic response was defined as confirmed complete or partial response. A BM sample was considered as assessable for cytogenetic response only if it contained ≥20 metaphases. However, an assessment of partial response was retained in a sample with &lt;20 metaphases when it was immediately preceded or followed by a complete or partial response in another sample with ≥20 metaphases.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response in Participants With Accelerated Phase Chronic Myeloid/Myelogenous Leukemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years after start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Time to response was defined for all participants as the time until first documented response (which was confirmed ≥4 weeks later).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response in Participants With Accelerated Phase Chronic Myeloid/Myelogenous Leukemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years after start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was defined as the time between first documented response (which was confirmed ≥4 weeks later) and the earliest date of the following: loss of response (when any of the criteria for response were no longer fulfilled); progression to blast crisis (≥30% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow, extramedullary involvement other than liver/spleen enlargement); discontinuation due to adverse event, laboratory abnormality, unsatisfactory therapeutic effect or death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression to Blast Crisis in Participants With Accelerated Phase Chronic Myeloid/Myelogenous Leukemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years after start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Progression to blast crisis was defined as ≥30% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow or as extramedullary involvement other than liver or spleen enlargement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Overall Survival by Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, and 156 months after start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate overall survival, all participants were followed after the last dose of study drug every month for the first three months and thereafter every three months until death. Overall survival was calculated for all participants as the time between start of treatment and death due to any reason. The time was censored at the date of last contact for participants who discontinued treatment and were in survival follow-up. For participants without survival follow-up information, the time was censored at last available visit/treatment date.</description>

        <description>Bone marrow (BM) cytogenetic analysis was required at baseline, after 12 weeks (visit 22) and after 24 weeks (visit 28) to evaluate Ph chromosome positivity. In several participants, this was also done after 4 and 8 weeks. Based on the percentage of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) cells = (positive cells/examined cells)x100, at each BM assessment the cytogenetic response was classified as: Complete, 0% Ph+ cells; Partial, &gt;0 - 35% Ph+ cells; Minor, &gt;35 - 65% Ph+ cells; Minimal, &gt;65 - 95% Ph+ cells; None, &gt;95% Ph+ cells; Not done: &lt;20 metaphases were examined and/or response could not be assigned. Cytogenetic response was defined as confirmed complete or partial response. A BM sample was considered as assessable for cytogenetic response only if it contained ≥20 metaphases. However, an assessment of partial response was retained in a sample with &lt;20 metaphases when it was immediately preceded or followed by a complete or partial response in another sample with ≥20 metaphases.</description>

Based on the percentage of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) cells = (positive cells/examined cells)x100, at each BM assessment the cytogenetic response was classified as: Complete, 0% Ph+ cells; Partial, &gt;0 - 35% Ph+ cells; Minor, &gt;35 - 65% Ph+ cells; Minimal, &gt;65 - 95% Ph+ cells; None, &gt;95% Ph+ cells; Not done: &lt;20 metaphases were examined and/or response could not be assigned. Cytogenetic response was defined as confirmed complete or partial response. A BM sample was considered as assessable for cytogenetic response only if it contained ≥20 metaphases. However, an assessment of partial response was retained in a sample with &lt;20 metaphases when it was immediately preceded or followed by a complete or partial response in another sample with ≥20 metaphases.</description>

        <title>Overall Survival by Dose in Participants With Accelerated Phase Chronic Myeloid/Myelogenous Leukemia</title>
        <description>To evaluate overall survival, all participants were followed after the last dose of study drug every month for the first three months and thereafter every three months until death. Overall survival was calculated for all participants as the time between start of treatment and death due to any reason. The time was censored at the date of last contact for participants who discontinued treatment and were in survival follow-up. For participants without survival follow-up information, the time was censored at last available visit/treatment date.</description>
        <time_frame>12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, and 132 months after start of treatment</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population consisted of all enrolled participants. The overall survival was calculated as per initial dose (400 mg or 600 mg) only for participants with Accelerated Phase Chronic Myeloid/Myelogenous Leukemia, as pre-specified in the protocol.&#xD;
Data is reported with data that is available. No additional data tables were found that could provide results with arms broken down any further.</population>

      <desc>AEs were not collected separately for each disease and dose groups of participants. The data has been reported as originally produced by the team at the time of reporting. We have exhausted all efforts to locate additional data; therefore, no additional data is available to report or modify what has previously been reported. No other non-serious AEs were collected during extension phase within clinical database.</desc>
