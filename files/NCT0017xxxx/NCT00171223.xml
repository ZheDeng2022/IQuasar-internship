  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the Core Phase of the study, participants received STI571 at a dose of 400 milligrams&#xD;
      (mg) daily for up to 12 months. Participants completing 12 months of therapy were eligible to&#xD;
      continue treatment in the Extension Phase of the study provided that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
      investigator, they had benefited from treatment with STI571 and there were no safety&#xD;
      concerns.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Cytogenetic Response (Complete Cytogenetic Response and Major Cytogenetic Response) to STI571</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 years after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Response was evaluated from bone marrow aspirates and biopsy samples. Bone marrow cytogenetic studies were performed every 3 months during the core phase of the study, then twice yearly, then annually to evaluate Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+). Cytogenetic response was defined as the best response the participant achieved during study. Based on the percentage of Ph+ cells = (positive cells/ examined cells) x100, at each BM assessment the cytogenetic response was classified as: Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR):, 0% Ph+ cells; Partial Cytogenetic Response (PCyR):, &gt;0 - 35% Ph+ cells; Minor: &gt;35 - 65% Ph+ cells; and Minimal: &gt;65 - 95% Ph+ cells, None: &gt;95 % Ph+ cells and Not done: &lt;20 metaphases were examined and/or response could not be assigned. Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) was defined as sum of the CCyR plus PCyR rates.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Hematologic Response to STI571</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Hematologic response was evaluated from hematology measurements in the peripheral blood. Complete hematological response was defined as normalization of peripheral blood counts [WBC and platelet count &lt; upper limit of normal (ULN) at the laboratory where the analysis was performed], with a normal WBC differential, and no immature granulocytes present, lasting for 4 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Complete Hematologic Response to STI571</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of hematologic response was defined as the time from the first documentation of the complete hematologic response to the date the loss of complete hematologic response is documented. Loss of complete hematological response was defined as a rising WBC count (increased to a level above the ULN at the laboratory where the analysis was performed confirmed by two samples obtained one month apart). The mean survival time and its standard error were underestimated because the largest observation was censored and the estimation was restricted to the largest event time. Complete hematological response was defined as normalization of peripheral blood counts (WBC and platelet count &lt; ULN at the laboratory where the analysis was performed), with a normal WBC differential, and no immature granulocytes present, lasting for 4 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Complete Hematologic Response to STI571</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Time to Complete Hematologic Response was defined for all participants with calculated confirmed complete hematologic response as the time until first documented response (which was confirmed &gt;= 4 weeks). Complete hematological response was defined as normalization of peripheral blood counts (WBC and platelet count &lt; ULN at the laboratory where the analysis was performed), with a normal WBC differential, and no immature granulocytes present, lasting for 4 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 3 or 4 Cancer-related Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>National Cancer Institute (NCI)/ National Institute of Health (NIH) provides a grading (severity) scale for each adverse event (AE) term, the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). Grade 3 refers to severe AE and Grade 4 refers to life-threatening or disabling AE. Cancer-related symptoms included fever, night sweats, bone pain, arthralgia, abdominal discomfort, fatigue and anorexia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Grade 3 or 4 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The ECOG performance status was recorded at baseline and every 3 months during the core study. The ECOG Performance Scale has 5 grades. 0 = Fully active, able to carry out all pre-disease activities; 1 = Restricted in strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of light or sedentary nature; 2 = Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out work activities. Active about 50% of waking hours; 3 = Capable of limited self-care, confined to bed/chair more than 50% of waking hours; 4 = Completely disabled; cannot carry on self-care. Totally confined to bed/chair.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Alive Over Time Based on Kaplan-Meier Estimates</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144 and 156 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was defined as the time from the first dose of STI571 to the death of the participant. If a participant is not known to have died, survival was censored at the time of last contact. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the percentage of participants at each time point was calculated.</description>

          <title>Hematologic Failure</title>
          <description>Participants failed to achieve a complete hematologic response, defined as lasting for at least 1 month despite 6 or more months of an interferon-alpha containing regimen, or had a rising white blood cell count (WBC) [to a level 20 x 10^9/L] confirmed by two samples taken at least two weeks apart after achieving a complete hematological response while receiving an interferon- alpha containing regimen of at least 25 million international units (MIU) per week. Participants received STI571, capsules or tablets, orally, once a day at a dose of 400 milligrams (mg). During the Core Phase of the study, participants received STI571 daily for up to 12 months. Participants completing 12 months of therapy were eligible to continue treatment in the Extension Phase of the study, and they continued STI571 for as long as the therapy was beneficial or until death, intolerable toxicity or the decision to discontinue by the investigator, whichever came first. (Maximum duration on study was approximately 14 years).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Cytogenetic Response (Complete Cytogenetic Response and Major Cytogenetic Response) to STI571</title>
        <description>Response was evaluated from bone marrow aspirates and biopsy samples. Bone marrow cytogenetic studies were performed every 3 months during the core phase of the study, then twice yearly, then annually to evaluate Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+). Cytogenetic response was defined as the best response the participant achieved during study. Based on the percentage of Ph+ cells = (positive cells/ examined cells) x100, at each BM assessment the cytogenetic response was classified as: Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR):, 0% Ph+ cells; Partial Cytogenetic Response (PCyR):, &gt;0 - 35% Ph+ cells; Minor: &gt;35 - 65% Ph+ cells; and Minimal: &gt;65 - 95% Ph+ cells, None: &gt;95 % Ph+ cells and Not done: &lt;20 metaphases were examined and/or response could not be assigned. Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) was defined as sum of the CCyR plus PCyR rates.</description>

          <description>Response was evaluated from bone marrow aspirates and biopsy samples. Bone marrow cytogenetic studies were performed every 3 months during the core phase of the study, then twice yearly, then annually to evaluate Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+). Cytogenetic response was defined as the best response the participant achieved during study. Based on the percentage of Ph+ cells = (positive cells/ examined cells) x100, at each BM assessment the cytogenetic response was classified as: Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR):, 0% Ph+ cells; Partial Cytogenetic Response (PCyR):, &gt;0 - 35% Ph+ cells; Minor: &gt;35 - 65% Ph+ cells; and Minimal: &gt;65 - 95% Ph+ cells, None: &gt;95 % Ph+ cells and Not done: &lt;20 metaphases were examined and/or response could not be assigned. Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) was defined as sum of the CCyR plus PCyR rates.</description>
