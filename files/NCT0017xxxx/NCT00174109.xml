      Betel quid chewing has been shown to have intimate correlation with oral cancer. In Taiwan,&#xD;
      the incidence of oral cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in male and in fact, 90% of&#xD;
      which has been linked to betel quid chewing. The predisposing factors in oral cancers between&#xD;
      the western countries and India, Southeast Asia including Taiwan are different. The factor is&#xD;
      smoking in the former countries and betel quid chewing is the most important one in the&#xD;
      latter groups. The genetic aberrations of oral cancers are different too between the western&#xD;
      countries and India, Southeast Asia including Taiwan. The percentage of RAS mutations of oral&#xD;
      cancers in the western countries is around 5%, and 35% in the India. In Taiwan, the RAS&#xD;
      mutation rate revealed with immunohistochemical staining is 92%, comparing with those in&#xD;
      western countries (62%), Japan (55-65%) and vice versa in the p53 mutations. The percentage&#xD;
      of p53 mutations of oral cancers in the western countries is around 50%, and 16% in the&#xD;
      India, Southeast Asia and Taiwan. It is generally believed that betel nut itself, arecoline&#xD;
      and arecaidine, the major betel alkaloids, account for the etiological factors in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of oral cancer while betel quid supplements, unlike the former two main&#xD;
      components, were reported to have little relevancy to oral cancer. Despite the fact that the&#xD;
      cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of betel nut extract and arecoline, arecaidine have been&#xD;
      extensively documented, and that some well-studied oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes have&#xD;
      been implicated in betel quid-related oral cancer, the molecular mechanisms, addressed in a&#xD;
      broader view, by which betel nut ingredients lead to oral tumorigenesis are not fully&#xD;
      understood. Our preliminary results, by virtue of different genome-wide screening approaches&#xD;
      to explore cellular functions of protein kinases in this context, identified several&#xD;
      candidates that showed differential expression upon treatment of BQ on primary cultures from&#xD;
      human oral mucosa. Of the candidates isolated, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), a&#xD;
      neuron-specific cytoskeletal protein that is thought to predominantly express in rat brain&#xD;
      cells, was found up-regulated at RNA level by RT-PCR in primary cultures. Our expanded&#xD;
      immunohistochemical results of normal mucosa, leukoplakia and oral squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (OSCC) suggest that expression of the MAP2 significantly correlates with progression of&#xD;
      BQ-induced OSCC (P = 0.0046), since the percentage of MAP2 positive staining is as much&#xD;
      fourfold in BQ-exposed OSCC (41.2%) as in BQ-free OSCC (10.5%), whereas normal mucosa and&#xD;
      leukoplakia show much less immunoreactivity as a whole. Furthermore, the MAP2 is shown to be&#xD;
      preferentially expressed in histopathologically less differentiated OSCC (P = 0.014).&#xD;
      Finally, we show that the MAP2 is highly expressed in the majority of invasive OSCC (67%).&#xD;
      Consequently, this finding, in conjunction with the previous one, raise a possibility that&#xD;
      overexpression of the MAP2 may play a critical role in the development of highly malignant&#xD;
      OSCC characteristic of invasive and/or metastatic. Here we study the issue by establishing an&#xD;
      in vitro system where extracts from the whole betel quid sandwiches are used to treat head&#xD;
      and neck cancer cell lines and primary oral epithelial cells and subsequently, the effects of&#xD;
      such treatments will be evaluated in terms of cell migration, Western blotting. Eight head&#xD;
      and neck cancer cell lines and normal oral mucosae from 8 patients undergoing oral surgery&#xD;
      will be collected. Extracts from the whole betel quid sandwiches with the concentration of&#xD;
      1.5 mg/ml will be added to the cell lines and primary oral epithelial cells for 1,3 and 5&#xD;
      days, respectively. Migration assay and detection of MAP2 expression will be performed to&#xD;
      elucidate the relationship of MAP2 and cell migration.&#xD;
