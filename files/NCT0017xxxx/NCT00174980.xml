  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain damage as a result of decreased oxygen to the brain is found in 80% of patients that&#xD;
      die with severe head injuries. Laboratory studies in animals and clinical trials have shown&#xD;
      that increasing oxygen in the brain results in better brain oxygen consumption, less cell&#xD;
      death, and better functional outcome. This study will test the hypothesis that Oxycyte is an&#xD;
      effective way to increase brain oxygen levels in severe head injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decreased brain oxygen in severe brain injuries appears to be implicated in poor functional&#xD;
      outcome and death. Animal and clinical studies have shown that increasing brain oxygen in&#xD;
      such patients improves functional outcome, and Oxycyte has been shown to be an effective&#xD;
      means of delivering oxygen to tissues, including the brain. This study is an eight patient&#xD;
      proof of concept study to test the effects of oxygen delivery with Oxycyte in patients with a&#xD;
      severe traumatic head injury with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 to 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects diagnosed with a severe head injury (GCS 3-9) who receive a brain oxygen monitor and&#xD;
      microdialysis catheter, will undergo baseline monitoring for 4 hours. In the first 4 subjects&#xD;
      the Fi02 on the ventilator will be increased to 50% for a 4 hour stabilization period and&#xD;
      this will be followed by a single intravenous infusion of 3ml/kg of Oxycyte. The Fi02 will&#xD;
      remain at 50% for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second 4 subjects the Fi02 on the ventilator will be increased to 100% for a 4 hour&#xD;
      stabilization period and this will be followed by a single intravenous infusion of 3ml/kg of&#xD;
      Oxycyte. The Fi02 will remain at 100% for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled, treated, and then monitored by LICOX 02 monitor before and after&#xD;
      infusion of PFC, and then for at least 48 hours following the discontinuation of Oxycyte.&#xD;
