      This is an Open Label Extension Study (OLES) for patients who participated in the 18 month&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III trial (Protocol ALX1 11 93001 the TOP Study)&#xD;
      studying the effect of ALX1-11, recombinant human parathyroid hormone, rhPTH(1-84), on&#xD;
      vertebral fracture incidence. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      of continued dosing with ALX1-11, up to a maximum of 24 months, in postmenopausal&#xD;
      osteoporotic women who participated in Protocol ALX1 11 93001.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effects of ALX1-11 on bone mineral density (BMD) have been documented in a dose-finding Phase&#xD;
      II clinical trial in osteoporotic postmenopausal women, supplemented with calcium and Vitamin&#xD;
      D3 but without any other treatment for osteoporosis. The anabolic effects of ALX1-11 in the&#xD;
      lumbar vertebrae were statistically significant after the 12-month treatment period and more&#xD;
      pronounced than any approved therapy. Additionally, animal studies have shown that the new&#xD;
      bone formed by treatment with ALX1 11 is of good quality both histologically and&#xD;
      biomechanically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this OLES is to evaluate the safety of continued dosing with&#xD;
      ALX1-11, up to a maximum of 24 months, in postmenopausal osteoporotic women who participated&#xD;
      in Protocol ALX1-11-93001. A secondary objective is to assess the change in vertebral BMD and&#xD;
      compare the changes observed in patients who received ALX1-11 or placebo in Protocol&#xD;
      ALX1-11-93001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 100 µg/day of ALX1-11 daily via subcutaneous injection in this study.&#xD;
      Patients should continue the study drug dosing frequency they were following at the end of&#xD;
      Protocol ALX1-11-93001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enhance their safety, all patients will continue to take their daily supplements of 700 mg&#xD;
      calcium and 400 IU Vitamin D3 prior to and during this OLES. Patients whose calcium&#xD;
      supplement was discontinued during Protocol ALX1-11-93001 should maintain that&#xD;
      discontinuation during this OLES. However upon completion of ALX1-11 dosing in the OLES, oral&#xD;
      calcium supplement at a dose of 700 mg each morning should be restarted and maintained for&#xD;
      the remainder of the OLES. Additional supplemental calcium and/or Vitamin D3 will not be&#xD;
      permitted. A daily multivitamin supplement may be taken during the study. However, the&#xD;
      multivitamin must contain no more than 200 mg/day calcium and 400 IU/day Vitamin D3. Patients&#xD;
      will be monitored for the development of hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria and managed as&#xD;
      described in Appendices 4 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a stopping rule in this OLES. Any patient who reaches a BMD T score of -0.5 or&#xD;
      above, at the site or sites (vertebral, total hip, or femoral neck) that were used in the&#xD;
      qualification of the patient for Protocol ALX1 11-93001, will stop ALX1-11 treatment. The&#xD;
      patient must continue on calcium and Vitamin D3 and be followed for the remainder of this&#xD;
      18-month OLES. At the time of discontinuation, the patient must complete the Month 18&#xD;
      evaluations (Appendix 1A or 1B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Advisory Board (CAB) used in Protocol ALX1-11-93001 will be involved in&#xD;
      reviewing any patient issues that arise in this OLES. This group will provide not only&#xD;
      continuity of care for all the patients, but also enhanced and consistent safety monitoring&#xD;
      for patients participating in the OLES.&#xD;

                       dose for at least 2 months, the patient may be enrolled in this study. The&#xD;
                       patient's history with L-thyroxine must be clearly documented in the source&#xD;
                       documents.&#xD;
