  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicity,&#xD;
      and maximum tolerated dose of vatalanib administered orally once daily in combination with&#xD;
      capecitabine in patients with advanced cancer. The study is also designed to determine the&#xD;
      effect of vatalanib on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and the effect of capecitabine on&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of vatalanib, and to describe the anti-tumor activity of this&#xD;
      combination regimen.&#xD;
