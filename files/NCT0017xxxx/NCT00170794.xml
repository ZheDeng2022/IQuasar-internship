        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female cardiac transplant recipients, 18-70 years old, with established&#xD;
             cardiac allograft vasculopathy or at risk to develop a cardiac allograft vasculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are more than 12 months post-transplant and who are receiving a&#xD;
             cyclosporine microemulsion-based immunosuppressive regimen with/without azathioprine&#xD;
             /mycophenolate mofetil, with/without steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients need to have stable renal function with a calculated GFR exceeding 40 ml/min&#xD;
             (Nankivell).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients without a biopsy-proven acute rejection ≥ grade 2, within 12 months prior to&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7&#xD;
             days prior to enrollment. Effective contraception must be used during the trial and&#xD;
             for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the study medication, even where there has&#xD;
             been a history of infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are willing and able to participate in the full course of the study and&#xD;
             from whom written informed consent has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are recipients of multiple solid organ transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a calculated GFR of less than 40 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a biopsy-proven acute rejection episode ≥ 2 within 12 months prior to&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had received any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently being treated with sirolimus or having a history of prior therapy&#xD;
             or having a hypersensitivity to drug similar to everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with a platelet count of &lt; 50,000/mm3 or with a white blood cell count of ≤&#xD;
             2,500/mm3 or with a hemoglobin value &lt; 10 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of severe hypercholesterolemia (≥ 9.1 mmol/L) or hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 8.55&#xD;
             mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with NYHA class IV heart failure, or with left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
             &lt;30%. Patients with life-threatening cardiac allograft vasculopathy and/or graft&#xD;
             dysfunction (life expectancy 1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe systemic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are known to have HBsAg or HCV positive hepatitis, or who are HIV&#xD;
             positive. Serology results obtained within 6 months prior to study entry are&#xD;
             acceptable. If results cannot be obtained prior to study entry, a sample must be&#xD;
             retained for later analysis. This stored sample will be destroyed at the end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any past (within the last 5 years) or present malignancy other than&#xD;
             non-melanotic skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existence of a co-morbid condition likely to result in death prior to study completion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptoms of significant mental illness, which in the opinion of the investigator may&#xD;
             interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the protocol. History of drug or&#xD;
             alcohol abuse within 1 year of baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to cooperate or communicate with the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential who are planning to become pregnant, who are&#xD;
             pregnant and/or lactating, or who are unwilling to use effective means of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
