      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the NIDCAP program of individualized&#xD;
      patient consultation on the neurobehavioral organization of transported preterm infants in&#xD;
      the NICU. Behavioral response to routine caregiving will be compared between infants in the&#xD;
      pre-NIDCAP group to infants in the post-NIDCAP group. And it is this behavioral response that&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the NIDCAP program.&#xD;

      Therapies that have brought about sharp decreases in neonatal mortality have not brought&#xD;
      about similar decreases in neurodevelopmental morbidity for preterm infants. Developmentally&#xD;
      supportive care is NICU care that seeks to optimize the developmental course and outcomes for&#xD;
      preterm infants. While other staff training programs for developmentally supportive care&#xD;
      exist, it is the Newborn Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) that has been the&#xD;
      methodology used in randomly controlled trials that demonstrate positive medical and&#xD;
      neurobehavioral outcomes for preterm infants receiving developmentally supportive care. NICUs&#xD;
      that care for all out-born or transported infants face unique challenges in balancing&#xD;
      developmentally supportive nursing care with the high-technological medical needs of the most&#xD;
      critically ill and extremely premature infants. Yet it is these most fragile infants who can&#xD;
      most benefit from the positive impact the NIDCAP program can offer. Yet, there are no&#xD;
      published studies documenting the impact of the NIDCAP program on neurobehavioral outcomes of&#xD;
      these transported preterm infants exclusively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of this project is to study the impact of implementing the NIDCAP&#xD;
      program of individualized patient consultation on the neurobehavioral organization of&#xD;
      transported preterm infants in the NICU of a major pediatric medical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods: A random sample of approximately 40 preterm infants will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in this descriptive study. In this phase-lag design, 20 infants will participate&#xD;
      in the pre-NIDCAP intervention phase and 20 infants will participate in the post-NIDCAP&#xD;
      intervention phase. Each infant within each phase will be videotaped during 2 routine&#xD;
      nurse-caregiving sessions. The first session will occur within 72 hours of admission to the&#xD;
      NICU at Children's Memorial Hospital (CMH). The second session will occur when the infant is&#xD;
      34-36 weeks corrected gestational age. The videotapes will be collected so that observations&#xD;
      of the infant's physical environment and caregiving and an assessment of the infant's&#xD;
      behavioral function can be scored randomly at the end of the study by an outside consultant&#xD;
      without bias as to what phase the infant participated. In addition, demographic data will be&#xD;
      collected on the sample infants. Data will be subjected to descriptive statistics,&#xD;
      inferential statistics and correlational procedures.&#xD;
