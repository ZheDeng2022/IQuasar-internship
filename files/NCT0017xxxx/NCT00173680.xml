      This project is to study the methylation status of the transcriptional regulatory region of&#xD;
      CD44 gene in surgically resected NSCLC specimens and normal lung tissue, correlate the&#xD;
      methylation status of promoter region with the expression of CD44 gene, and analyze if&#xD;
      methylation is associated with survival.&#xD;

      CD44 is a cell surface receptor for the extracellular matrix hyaluronan. It mediates adhesion&#xD;
      of cells to the extracellular matrix. Its ability to organize extracellular matrix into a&#xD;
      medium is also used by cancer cells in their becoming metastatic. Invasive tumor cells are&#xD;
      frequently observed to bind hyaluronate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD44 gene is made up of 20 exons, at least 10 of which are variably expressed due to&#xD;
      alternative splicing of the mRNA. The standard form, CD44s, has a coding sequence of exons&#xD;
      1-5 and 16-20. Variant isoforms (CD44v), all larger, arise from alternative splicing of&#xD;
      combinations of exons 6-15 (v1-10). A variant isoform CD44 can induce metastasis of a rat&#xD;
      pancreatic carcinoma. Studies in human tumors, however, have produced variable results. Some&#xD;
      breast cancers demonstrate positive correlation between CD44v expression and tumor&#xD;
      progression, while others lack any correlation. Some colorectal tumors even show an inverse&#xD;
      correlation. CD44 has also been demonstrated to be a metastasis suppressor gene for prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Thus, CD44 may be a marker for metastasis for some tumors, but not for others, and it&#xD;
      may actually be a metastasis suppressor gene for yet another groups of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For primary lung cancer, the correlation between CD44 expression and tumor metastasis has not&#xD;
      been established. The metastasis-prone small cell lung cancer rarely showed any&#xD;
      immunohistochemical staining for CD44s or CD44v. For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), some&#xD;
      studies showed positive correlation between immunohistochemical CD44v expression and tumor&#xD;
      progression, while others showed no correlation. Our own study using RT-PCR, sequencing and&#xD;
      immunohistochemical staining showed that in pulmonary adenocarcinoma, CD44v6 expression is&#xD;
      down-regulated as the disease progressed. Based on our finding, and the observation that&#xD;
      CD44s and CD44v expression are low in metastasis-prone small cell lung cancer, we assue that&#xD;
      CD44 is a metastasis suppressor gene which is inactivated in lung cancers. Because in&#xD;
      prostate cancer DNA hypermethylation has been shown to be related to the down-regulation of&#xD;
      CD44 gene, we plan to study the methylation status of the transcriptional regulatory region&#xD;
      of CD44 gene in primary lung cancer. We'll study CD44 expression by immunohistochemistry, the&#xD;
      methylation status of CD44 regulatory region by sequencing of the bisulfite-modified genomic&#xD;
      DNA, and correlate these two findings with each other, and with histologic type, tumor&#xD;
      staging and survival.&#xD;
