      Sleep is disrupted in the PICU. This disruption has been reported in studies that have used:&#xD;
      (a) observation of sleep-wake cycles (b) self-reports by children themselves , and (c)&#xD;
      objective measures (e.g., electroencephalograph( EEG). Noise and light levels have been&#xD;
      correlated with profound sleep disruption in the PICU . Sleep disruption is known to have a&#xD;
      profound impact on the overall health of a child, both from a physiological and a&#xD;
      psychological standpoint . In addition, sleep disruption has been shown to change cortisol&#xD;
      levels, cause impaired immune responses and impair cognitive function in both children and&#xD;
      adults . Disruption in sleep also is known to impair healing through these many complex&#xD;
      connections with other homeostatic processes in the human body. What is the effect of wearing&#xD;
      earplugs in critically ill children admitted to the PICU on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sleep states&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physiological stability (e.g. melatonin, cortisol and immune status)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sleep habits after discharge from the PICU (on the general pediatric unit, 2 weeks and 2&#xD;
           months after discharge), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Child behavior at 2 weeks and 2 months after discharge from the PICU by parent report on&#xD;
           the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).&#xD;

      While often life saving, the need for admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)&#xD;
      places children in a profoundly artificial environment that has the potential to alter the&#xD;
      biological processes that defend homeostasis. All living organisms have biological rhythms&#xD;
      that serve as their basic organizing feature. These rhythms vary widely, ranging from seconds&#xD;
      (e.g., heartbeat) to weeks (menstrual cycle). Biological rhythms that have a 24-hour cycle&#xD;
      are termed circadian rhythms. Of the many circadian rhythms, the sleep-wake cycle is the most&#xD;
      evident [2]. Other biological processes that have a circadian rhythm include growth hormone,&#xD;
      melatonin, and cortisol secretion .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep is disrupted in the PICU. This disruption has been reported in studies that have used:&#xD;
      (a) observation of sleep-wake cycles [6, 7]; (b) self-reports by children themselves, and (c)&#xD;
      objective measures (e.g., electroencephalograph( EEG). Noise and light levels have been&#xD;
      correlated with profound sleep disruption in the PICU . Sleep disruption is known to have a&#xD;
      profound impact on the overall health of a child, both from a physiological and a&#xD;
      psychological standpoint . In addition, sleep disruption has been shown to change cortisol&#xD;
      levels, cause impaired immune responses and impair cognitive function in both children and&#xD;
      adults . Disruption in sleep also is known to impair healing through these many complex&#xD;
      connections with other homeostatic processes in the human body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a dearth of research on improving sleep and reversing the negative effects of sleep&#xD;
      disruption on homeostasis in critically ill children&#xD;
&#xD;
      RQ1: What is the effect of wearing earplugs in critically ill children admitted to the PICU&#xD;
      on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sleep states&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physiological stability (e.g. melatonin, cortisol and immune status)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sleep habits after discharge from the PICU (on the general pediatric unit, 2 weeks and 2&#xD;
           months after discharge), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Child behavior at 2 weeks and 2 months after discharge from the PICU by parent report on&#xD;
           the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents or primary caregivers ages 18 years or older, who can read and speak English&#xD;
             and their critically ill children who meet the following criteria will be eligible for&#xD;
             participation (a) ages 1-15 years, (b) anticipated survival, (c) no severe&#xD;
             handicapping (neurological) conditions, (d) not a prior transplant patient, (e) no&#xD;
             active oncology or metabolic process (other than diabetes), (f) not diagnosed with a&#xD;
             traumatic brain injury and (a) between 1 and 15 years of age, (b) expected length of&#xD;
