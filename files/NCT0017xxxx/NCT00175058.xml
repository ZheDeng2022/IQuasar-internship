      To determine whether or not HyperOxemic therapy rendered to patients (that meet the study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria) with anterior acute myocardial infarction &lt; 6 hours from symptom onset to&#xD;
      reperfusion, results in a significant reduction in infarct size as measured by SPECT @ 14&#xD;
      days post event.&#xD;

      The AMIHOT II clinical trial is designed as a focused study of a promising patient subset&#xD;
      from the completed AMIHOT study. A brief synopsis of the AMIHOT experience is provided below,&#xD;
      followed by a description of the AMIHOT II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pivotal AMIHOT clinical study for the TherOxÂ® Aqueous Oxygen (AO) System in treating post&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients was approved by FDA on January 10, 2002 under IDE&#xD;
      G980257/S011. The study objective was to determine whether the adjunctive administration of&#xD;
      AO Therapy immediately after successful PCI in a group of patients presenting less than 24&#xD;
      hours from AMI symptom onset improves left ventricular function and reduces the area of&#xD;
      infarction, with no increased incidence of 30-day Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) when&#xD;
      compared to a control group receiving only PCI standard-of-care treatment. 30-day MACE&#xD;
      comprises the combined incidence of death, reinfarction, target vessel revascularization, and&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred eighty-nine (289) patients were enrolled from January 16, 2002 through December&#xD;
      24, 2003, including 20 run-in subjects and 269 randomized patients. Three independent&#xD;
      biomarkers (infarct size reduction, regional wall motion score improvement at three months,&#xD;
      and reduction in ST segment elevation) were designated as co-primary endpoints to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of AO Therapy. The study was designed to demonstrate superiority of the AO&#xD;
      Therapy group as compared to controls for each of these endpoints, and to demonstrate&#xD;
      non-inferiority of the AO Therapy group as compared to Control with respect to 30-day MACE.&#xD;
      The study population was comprised of qualifying AMI patients treated with either PCI alone&#xD;
      or with AO Therapy as an adjunct to successful PCI within 24 hours of symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observed 30-day MACE rates were comparable between the AO Therapy and Control groups. The&#xD;
      AMIHOT trial results revealed positive trends for the overall study population in favor of&#xD;
      the AO Therapy test group in each of the three co-primary endpoints. These favorable results&#xD;
      did not demonstrate the required level of statistical significance to claim superiority.&#xD;
      However, an examination of a pre-specified patient subset, anterior AMI subjects treated&#xD;
      within six hours of symptom onset, showed promising results after analysis of the surrogate&#xD;
      endpoint data, forming the basis for this IDE supplement that requests approval to conduct a&#xD;
      new trial focused on this further defined patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TherOx has designed a follow-up clinical trial focused on these anterior AMI subjects treated&#xD;
      within six hours, utilizing a Bayesian statistical design that incorporates both the existing&#xD;
      AMIHOT data, and the new proposed AMIHOT II study data, into a hierarchical model for&#xD;
      combined analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key differences between the proposed AMIHOT II study and the previously conducted AMIHOT&#xD;
      trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focused target patient population - anterior AMI subjects revascularized within six&#xD;
           hours of symptom onset. (AMIHOT included patients revascularized within 24 hours of&#xD;
           symptom onset, irrespective of location of infarct.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single effectiveness endpoint - infarct size reduction as measured by 14-day Tc-99m&#xD;
           Sestamibi SPECT imaging. (AMIHOT included 3 co-primary endpoints)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-inferiority comparison of 30-day MACE rates within a 6% safety delta (AMIHOT&#xD;
           proposed an 8% delta.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization scheme - AMIHOT II will be randomized on a 2.8:1 (AO Therapy Group:&#xD;
           Control Group) basis, as compared to the (1:1) randomization used in AMIHOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of administration of AO Therapy and the basic design of the AO System and AO&#xD;
      Cartridge have not changed since the approval was granted by FDA to conduct the AMIHOT trial.&#xD;
      The IDE number for the AMIHOT II clinical proposal is consistent with AMIHOT (G980257).&#xD;
