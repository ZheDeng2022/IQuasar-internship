  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define the mechanism(s) through which Obstructive Sleep&#xD;
      Apnea/Hypopnea (OSAH) promotes abnormal metabolic processes which characterize the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. The investigators hypothesize that the sleep fragmentation and intermittent sleep&#xD;
      hypoxia which occur in OSAH patients promote oxidative stress and inflammation which in turn&#xD;
      lead to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, abnormal vascular reactivity and other processes&#xD;
      which are consistent with the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome has been defined as insulin resistance, central obesity, systemic&#xD;
      hypertension and dyslipidemia and is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk.&#xD;
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea (OSAH) is also associated with increased CV risk and insulin&#xD;
      resistance. Since OSAH is associated with oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory processes,&#xD;
      both of which are associated with insulin resistance, it follows that oxidative stress and&#xD;
      inflammation may mediate the linkage between OSAH, insulin resistance and ultimately, the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this research is to test the hypothesis that oxidative stress and&#xD;
      inflammation link OSAH to insulin resistance as well as other CV risk-promoting conditions&#xD;
      reflecting the metabolic syndrome (e.g. hyperlipidemia). We will specifically test if the&#xD;
      individual sleep consequences of OSAH, including sleep fragmentation and intermittent sleep&#xD;
      hypoxia, promote oxidative stress and inflammation which in turn promote insulin resistance&#xD;
      and other features of the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a: To determine the effect of sleep fragmentation on oxidative stress and inflammation&#xD;
      and features of the metabolic syndrome including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, obesity,&#xD;
      and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b: To assess the interaction between pre-existing metabolic syndrome and the overweight&#xD;
      condition without metabolic syndrome, with regard to the effects of sleep fragmentation on&#xD;
      the study variables, we will contrast the effect of experimentally-induced sleep&#xD;
      fragmentation in non-OSAH/overweight individuals with the metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      non-OSAH/overweight individuals without metabolic syndrome and a control group of&#xD;
      non-OSAH/normal weight without metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: 2: To evaluate the effect of intermittent sleep hypoxia on oxidative stress and&#xD;
      inflammation and explore the relationships between these two processes and insulin&#xD;
      resistance, lipid profile, heart period variability and plasma cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: 3: Using microarray data from peripheral monocytes, we will explore if specific gene&#xD;
      expression patterns after the study conditions are associated with alterations consistent&#xD;
      with metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: 4: This exploratory aim is to collect preliminary data regarding the correlation among&#xD;
      genetic variations (polymorphisms), gene expression patterns (microarray) and resultant&#xD;
      protein production (proteomics). These data will be used for hypothesis development.&#xD;
