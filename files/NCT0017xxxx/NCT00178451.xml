      In the first portion of the study, the goal will be to determine the safety of the drug&#xD;
      Abciximab for use during and in the period after open carotid artery surgery. In addition,&#xD;
      using specialized ultrasound equipment (a probe that is placed on the outside of your skin of&#xD;
      your head), we will aim to measure the number of particles released around the time of&#xD;
      surgery while being treated with Abciximab. The second phase of the study will be determine&#xD;
      if Abciximab can safely reduce the number of particles released into the bloodstream around&#xD;
      the time of surgery in order to reduce the risk of stroke.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Carotid endarterectomy is the most frequently performed vascular procedure in the United&#xD;
      States. In the last decade, there has been a large increase in case volume following&#xD;
      confirmation of the efficacy of endarterectomy for carotid artery atherosclerotic disease by&#xD;
      the NASCET and ACAS trials. Estimates for 1994 suggested that over 130,000 patients underwent&#xD;
      carotid endarterectomy in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the efficacy of endarterectomy over medical management for extra cranial cerebral&#xD;
      vascular disease, the risk of having an ipsilateral perioperative stroke after carotid&#xD;
      endarterectomy remains at 2-7%. There are two main types of operation-related stroke. The&#xD;
      intra-operative stroke is apparent upon recovery from anesthesia and is directly attributable&#xD;
      to intra-operative ischemia or embolization. The post-operative stroke occurs sometime after&#xD;
      an uneventful recovery from surgery and is due to vessel occlusion or embolization off the&#xD;
      thrombogenic endarterectomy surface. Evidence suggests that platelets adhere to the exposed&#xD;
      collagen of the endarterectomy surface within minutes of restoring flow. The maximal rate of&#xD;
      adherence appears to be one hour after clamp release. Postoperative strokes are preceded by&#xD;
      micro-particulate embolization, which can be detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasound.&#xD;
      There is good correlation between TCD detection of 25 or more emboli in the middle cerebral&#xD;
      artery distribution during any ten-minute period after surgery and an increased occurrence of&#xD;
      transient ischemic attack and or stroke. Another study found an embolic rate greater than 50&#xD;
      per hour predicted stroke in 50% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further study by TCD of the prevalence of post-operative micro particulate thromboembolic&#xD;
      events after carotid endarterectomy found five percent of patients have sustained&#xD;
      postoperative embolization. The embolic rate is maximal in the first two hours&#xD;
      postoperatively and if no evidence is found for embolization by the third post-operative hour&#xD;
      then it is unlikely to occur thereafter. Infusion of Dextran 40 has been shown to decrease&#xD;
      the rate of embolization of micro particulate debris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent success in decreasing thrombotic events in both percutaneous coronary interventions&#xD;
      and acute myocardial infarction with platelet glycoprotein IIB/IIIA antagonists has&#xD;
      stimulated interest in furthering the applications of these drugs. A recent randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial using Abciximab in acute ischemic stroke documented safety when administered&#xD;
      up to twenty-four hours after stroke onset, with a trend toward improvement in functional&#xD;
      outcomes. Abciximab has also been used in conjunction with heparin and aspirin in carotid&#xD;
      artery percutaneous angioplasty and stenting and is thought to potentially reduce recurrent&#xD;
      stenoses. Unfortunately, the use of platelet IIb/IIIa inhibitors with open surgical&#xD;
      procedures not been studied due to concerns of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist holds great potential for diminishing or&#xD;
      eliminating the micro particulate embolization seen with TCD and thus helping lower the&#xD;
      combined operative morbidity and mortality to less than the five percent rate that is&#xD;
      commonly accepted. Our primary aim is to document the safety and ideal dosing of Abciximab&#xD;
      for use in open vascular surgery, namely Carotid Endarterectomy. Our secondary aim is to&#xD;
      evaluate the incidence of perioperative embolic events after carotid endarterectomy as&#xD;
      monitored by transcranial Doppler with the perioperative administration of Abciximab.&#xD;
