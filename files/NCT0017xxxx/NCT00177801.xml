  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fungal infections are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients, yet&#xD;
      comprehensive epidemiologic studies in this area are lacking. For this reason, the Centers&#xD;
      for Disease Control and Prevention have provided a grant to the University of Pittsburgh to&#xD;
      study this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has four specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the risk of fungal infections in a center where &quot;tolerogenic&quot;&#xD;
      immunosuppressive protocols are currently in place, and to determine whether there are any&#xD;
      measures of immune system function which correlate with risk of fungal infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2: To create a repository of serum, urine and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens for the&#xD;
      purpose of determining the effectiveness of novel diagnostic tests for invasive fungal&#xD;
      infections. Such a repository could also be utilized for the purpose of determining the&#xD;
      effectiveness of novel diagnostic tests for viral infections such as West Nile Virus,&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus, HHV-6 and HHV-8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 1 will be investigated by creating a prospective database of solid organ&#xD;
      transplant recipients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, including demographic&#xD;
      factors as well as subsequent development of infection. The immune function of patients will&#xD;
      be assessed by measuring T cell subsets and assessing T cell function using the Cylex assay.&#xD;
      Specific aim 2 involves collection of serum, urine and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These&#xD;
      specimens will be stored and later tested at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
      in the assessment of novel tests developed for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal cohort study. Participation in the research database is limited to&#xD;
      placement of the subjects' identifiable medical information related to their organ&#xD;
      transplantation and immunosuppression use. Participants can consent to allow only medical&#xD;
      information collected and/or provide blood and tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients seen by the Infectious Disease/Transplant team will be asked to provide their&#xD;
      written informed consent to allow their past, current and future identifiable medical record&#xD;
      information related to their condition placed in the research database. The medical record&#xD;
      information that will be placed in the database will be related directly to the&#xD;
      patients'-participants' disease process. However, since concurrent medical conditions and&#xD;
      treatments (i.e., not related directly to transplantation) may impact substantially the&#xD;
      patients'-participants' condition, it is likely that all of the patients'-participants' past,&#xD;
      current and future identifiable medical record information will be placed in the research&#xD;
      database. Consent will be obtained in the pre-transplant period. The advantage of this system&#xD;
      is that consent is obtained directly from the patient (rather than from a proxy, as would be&#xD;
      necessary in situations where consent is obtained post-transplant). Secondly, since the&#xD;
      timing transplantation can not be predicted with certainty and may occur at hours during&#xD;
      which research coordinators are not working, consent prior to transplantation ensures that&#xD;
      the entire post-transplant period is covered by consent. This would ensure that early&#xD;
      post-transplant infections are not missed, thereby eliminating a form of systematic bias. The&#xD;
      disadvantage of this system is that some patients undergo informed consent who do not&#xD;
      subsequently undergo transplantation. Additionally, occasional patients who present with&#xD;
      acute organ system failure (for example, patients with fulminant hepatic failure) will not&#xD;
      undergo pre-transplant consent. We will attempt to minimize this risk by pre-study and&#xD;
      subsequent meetings with transplant surgeons to ensure the study team is informed about such&#xD;
      patients on a timely basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant medical information will be stored electronically within the research data base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names, social security numbers, and medical record numbers of the participants will be&#xD;
      deleted from their stored medical information and replaced with a linkage code. Access to&#xD;
      participant medical information contained within the research database will be restricted to&#xD;
      the research investigator and research staff..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information linking the linkage codes to the participants' names, social security numbers and&#xD;
      medical record numbers will be stored in a secure location separate from the medical&#xD;
      information. Access to the information linking the linkage codes with participant names,&#xD;
      social security numbers and medical record numbers will be granted only to the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator and research coordinator of this research database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant medical record information will be stored in the research database for an&#xD;
      indefinite period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be followed for up to four years after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologic information to be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (upon signing informed consent), the following information will be collected:&#xD;
      Demographic data - age, sex, state of birth, prior travel to an area endemic for&#xD;
      histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis, indication for listing for&#xD;
      transplantation, other prior medical problems, prior chemotherapy/immunosuppressive therapies&#xD;
      and prior fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first week post transplant, the following information will be collected: Type and&#xD;
      date of transplant, UNOS status, pre-transplant conditioning with thymoglobulin or&#xD;
      alemtuzumab, ongoing immunosuppressive regimen. At the time of fungal infection, the&#xD;
      following information will be collected - symptoms and signs of infection and their duration,&#xD;
      receipt of antifungal prophylaxis, presence of indwelling vascular devices, duration of&#xD;
      neutropenia, presence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and its severity and treatment,&#xD;
      history of graft rejection and its treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six weeks following the fungal infection, the following information will be collected -&#xD;
      treatment of the infection, outcome (including duration of hospitalization, fate of organ&#xD;
      graft and mortality)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood work to be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate consent form will be presented for blood work. This is to ensure that the patients&#xD;
      who decline blood work specifically for the study still have the opportunity to have their&#xD;
      epidemiologic information collected. The following tests will be collected specifically for&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD4 lymphocyte count pre-transplant and then every three months post-transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood for Cylex assay pre-transplant then once per month X18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood for storage (see below)* Additionally, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be&#xD;
           collected (see below for schedule)&#xD;
&#xD;
           *Blood for storage will be collected on those patients at highest risk for invasive&#xD;
           fungal infections (4, 11, 42, 43). These patients will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung transplant recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intestinal transplant recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney/pancreas transplant recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver transplant recipients on renal replacement therapy or requiring re-transplantation&#xD;
           in the first week post-transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BAL samples will be collected only if the subject undergoes a clinically indicated&#xD;
      bronchoscopy and only the excess BAL fluid will be collected for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycologic samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      All fungi grown from routine clinical specimens from patients in the study will be saved by&#xD;
      the clinical microbiology laboratory. They will be made available to the Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention (CDC) - other researchers working in conjunction with the CDC may also&#xD;
      examine these isolates for mechanisms of antifungal resistance or mechanisms of&#xD;
      pathogenicity. No patient identifiers would be provided to either the CDC or to other&#xD;
      researchers. Only relevant &quot;de-identified&quot; clinical information (eg, prior use of specific&#xD;
      antifungal agents) would be provided.&#xD;

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic&#xD;
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To&#xD;
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and&#xD;
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The&#xD;
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept&#xD;
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples&#xD;
      indefinitely. The biologic samples may be given to the Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected and&#xD;
      not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's&#xD;
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.&#xD;
