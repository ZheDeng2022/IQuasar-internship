  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenomyosis refers to the presence of endometrial glands and stroma that is haphazardly deep&#xD;
      within the myometrium. However, the etiology and pathologic mechanism responsible for&#xD;
      adenomyosis are not yet very well known. Our previous results revealed that the expression of&#xD;
      killer inhibitory receptors on natural killer cells was decreased in eutopic endometrium in&#xD;
      women with adenomyosis. It implies that the formation of adenomyosis might be due to abnormal&#xD;
      endometrial tissues, but not the aberrant local immunological dysfunction in myometrium. Our&#xD;
      further investigation revealed that in vitro coculture of macrophages and endometrial stromal&#xD;
      cells (ESCs) increase the expression of IL-6 mRNA in ESC, which might further enhance the&#xD;
      proliferation of ESC and subsequently result in the formation of ectopic endometrial implants&#xD;
      in adenomyosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal cell proliferation has been generally found in the tumorigenesis, including the&#xD;
      formation of endometriosis. Adenomyosis is considered to have a similar pathophysiology with&#xD;
      endometriosis, and it must be interesting to examine whether there is abnormal cell&#xD;
      proliferation in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found&#xD;
      to promote proliferation of ESCs via induction of TNF-a and IL-8 expression, whereas IFN-g&#xD;
      significantly inhibited ESCs proliferation. Therefore, whether abnormal cell proliferation&#xD;
      occurs under the effects of LPS and IFN-g in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis needs&#xD;
      further clarification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenomyosis preferentially affects women between the ages of 35 and 50 years, and the&#xD;
      symptoms subside gradually after menopause. It is well known that there is a close&#xD;
      conjunction between estrogen and adenomyosis. Estradiol (E2) was demonstrated to induce&#xD;
      endometrial cell proliferation, whereas medroxyprogesterone (MPA) inhibited endometrial cell&#xD;
      proliferation via antagonizing estrogenic effects. Experiments to investigate these steroid&#xD;
      effects on ESC proliferation in vitro in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis are of&#xD;
      clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we try to collect endometrial tissues from women with and without adenomyosis,&#xD;
      and then purify ESCs from endometrium. ESCs are cultured for 2 days with the supplement of&#xD;
      LPS, IFN-gamma, Estradiol, MPA and Estradiol+MPA. Quantification of cell proliferation was&#xD;
      done with Cell Proliferation Assay Kit and immunocytochemical detection of Ki-67, in an&#xD;
      attempt to examine the cell proliferation of ESCs in women with adenomyosis.&#xD;

      Eutopic endometrium was obtained and separated into single endometrial stromal cell (ESC) in&#xD;
      women with adenomyosis (study group) and without adenomyosis (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESCs are cultured for 2 days with the supplement of LPS, IFN-gamma, Estradiol, MPA and&#xD;
      Estradiol+MPA.&#xD;
