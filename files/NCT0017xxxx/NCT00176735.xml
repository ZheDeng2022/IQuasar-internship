  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer has traditionally been treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy with&#xD;
      limited results. Preliminary studies of parts of this program in patients with advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer have produced favorable results with acceptable side effects. We feel that&#xD;
      this treatment sequence may help to slow and/or control the growth of pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help doctors learn whether pancreatic cancer will respond to this treatment.&#xD;
      This study will use the combination of two chemotherapy drugs, gemcitabine and cisplatin,&#xD;
      before and after treatment with radiation therapy and an oral chemotherapy drug called&#xD;
      capecitabine. This sequence of combination chemotherapy before and after radiation therapy,&#xD;
      and radiation therapy with the drug capecitabine is what is under study. Parts of this&#xD;
      sequence, for example, the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin, have shown promising&#xD;
      results in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This research study is an attempt to combine&#xD;
      these various parts.&#xD;

        Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have cytologic or histologic confirmation of pancreatic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have unresectable disease with or without distant metastases. A status&#xD;
             of unresectable will be based on review of helical CT scan and surgical consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with a history of previous abdominal irradiation or chemotherapy for&#xD;
             pancreatic cancer are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have an estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks and a Zubrod&#xD;
             performance status of ≤ 2 (appendix I).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be 18 years of age or older. Patients with reproductive potential must&#xD;
             agree to use an effective contraceptive method during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have adequate organ function defined as follows: bone marrow -&#xD;
             granulocytes ≥ 1500/cmm, platelets &gt; 100,000/cmm, renal - serum Cre &lt; 1.5 mg/dl,&#xD;
             hepatic - bilirubin &lt; 3 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must be free of other active systemic malignancy or any other serious&#xD;
             co-morbid medical or psychiatric condition that would interfere with safe delivery of&#xD;
             protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must be aware of the investigational nature of the therapy and provide&#xD;
             written informed consent as per institutional guidelines prior to the initiation of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
