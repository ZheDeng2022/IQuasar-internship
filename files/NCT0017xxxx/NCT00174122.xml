  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, a physician plays a more important role in managing patients with potential&#xD;
      infectious complications in the emergency room. Previous studies demonstrated the importance&#xD;
      of early and adequate anti-microbial therapy in reducing the mortality and morbidity of&#xD;
      patients with severe sepsis. However, in one study, about 6% of clinically significant&#xD;
      bacteremic patients were misdiagnosed and discharged from the emergency room. In other&#xD;
      studies, about 8.5 to approximately 17% of empirical antibiotic selection was judged&#xD;
      inappropriately according to subsequent microbiology, and anti-microbial susceptibility was a&#xD;
      result. It reflects the diversity in the presentations of infectious diseases and limited&#xD;
      available microbiological reports from the first-line emergency physicians. Timely diagnosis&#xD;
      and selection of appropriate antibiotics/treatment in treating those patients challenge an&#xD;
      emergency physician more than ever before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serum marker, procalcitonin, was recently demonstrated to be a potential indicator in&#xD;
      distinguishing between non-infectious and infectious acute inflammatory reactions, viral and&#xD;
      bacterial infections, and non-bacteremic and bacteremic infections. It also demonstrates the&#xD;
      association with high-mortality risk in patients with severe sepsis. However, some areas&#xD;
      remain inconclusive in the clinical application of this potential serum marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed this prospective study with the following purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To clarify the sensitivity and specificity of the serum procalcitonin quantitative test&#xD;
           as a clinical indicator of sepsis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the cut-off value of the serum procalcitonin level in sepsis screening among&#xD;
           various groups of patients with different co-morbidities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the potential role of the procalcitonin quantitative test in identifying occult&#xD;
           sepsis in patients with an acute undifferentiated febrile reaction in the emergency&#xD;
           room;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To test the possibility of the sequential procalcitonin quantitative test as a&#xD;
           serological guide of the appropriateness of an empirical antibiotic before the&#xD;
           microbiology results are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions in the investigators' study will clarify the clinical application of the serum&#xD;
      procalcitonin quantitative test in the differential diagnosis of patients with systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory reaction syndrome, the screening of high-risk sepsis patients, and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an empirical antibiotic evaluation.&#xD;
