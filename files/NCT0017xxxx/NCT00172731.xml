  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop a questionnaire on community occupational&#xD;
      participation for persons with schizophrenia living in the community. In the International&#xD;
      Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) recently revised by World Health&#xD;
      Organization, activity participation is recognized as an important indication of&#xD;
      health-related status. From the perspective of occupational therapy, the researcher intends&#xD;
      to investigate the experiences of occupational participation among schizophrenic patients&#xD;
      living in the community, and to develop a measuring tool for occupational participation&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of the Community Occupational Participation Questionnaire will be based on&#xD;
      the result of a qualitative research project which the researcher is carrying out at the&#xD;
      moment. The resultant questionnaire will provide a quantitative measure of community&#xD;
      occupational participation for persons with schizophrenia, as well as a measurement tool of&#xD;
      activity participation for health-related research studies. Furthermore, it may provide&#xD;
      valuable information to the development of community psychiatric services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study will take one year. Tasks to be accomplished include: building item pool,&#xD;
      examining content validity of each item, pilot testing, item analysis, norm establishment,&#xD;
      and testing reliability and validity. Data will be collected in different areas of Taiwan,&#xD;
      and will be analyzed with the following methods: content validity ratio, item-total&#xD;
      correlation, Cronbach's alpha, and confirmatory factor analysis. The study will result in an&#xD;
      occupational participation questionnaire with norm, validity and reliability.&#xD;
