  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dopamine (DA) is one of the main catecholamines in mammals. Its major role as a brain&#xD;
      neurotransmitter is well known as well as its contribution to the development of pathologies,&#xD;
      mainly arterial hypertension. Traditionally, dopamine receptors are divided into two families&#xD;
      according to the stimulation or inhibition they may produce at the adenyl cyclase level. Five&#xD;
      dopamine receptors have been identified: D1 (D1a) and D5 (D1b) exist in the D1 family. D2s,&#xD;
      D2l, D3 and D4 belong to the D2 family. Formerly, less than 1% of patients with hypertension&#xD;
      were believed to have primary hyperaldosteronism; however, recent studies have suggested that&#xD;
      primary aldosteronism affects 5-13% of patients with hypertension and aldosteronomas are a&#xD;
      more common cause of hypertension than previously thought. At least 2% of patients with&#xD;
      hypertension may have an aldosteronoma. The investigators' previous clinical observation&#xD;
      found two subtypes of aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), which were defined according to&#xD;
      their responses to metoclopramide during salt manipulation. On a high-salt diet (HS), the&#xD;
      nonsuppressible subjects, with less dopaminergic inhibition of aldosterone secretion, had&#xD;
      less urinary DA excretion and greater blood pressure (BP) elevation [Wu KD et al. 2002]. The&#xD;
      investigators' recent study of six patients with an APA found that the expression of the D2&#xD;
      receptor in APA was not universal. The amounts of D2 receptor messenger ribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (mRNA) were more variant in either APA or their remnant adrenal glands. Only two cases of APA&#xD;
      expressed the D2 receptors with much weaker signals compared with those in their respective&#xD;
      remnant adrenals [Wu KD et al. 2001]. The investigators' current work demonstrates that the&#xD;
      D2 receptor negatively regulates AII-stimulated aldosterone secretion and aldosterone&#xD;
      synthase mRNA expression in NCI-H295R cells. On the other hand, the D4 receptor counteracts&#xD;
      with the effect of the D2 receptor. In a future study, the investigators wish to quantify D2&#xD;
      and D4 receptor mRNA and protein expression in APA and their remnant adrenal glands and&#xD;
      correlate them to their clinical metoclopramide test results. The investigators also wish to&#xD;
      know whether the difference between the D2 and D4 receptor expression reflect the different&#xD;
      effects of dopamine inhibition on AII-stimulated aldosterone secretion and aldosterone&#xD;
      synthase transcription. Finally, the investigators will explore the role of D2 and D4&#xD;
      receptors on AII-stimulated adrenal cell proliferation.&#xD;
