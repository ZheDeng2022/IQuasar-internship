  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In malignant or neoplastic disease, angiogenesis is defined as the generation of new&#xD;
      capillaries from preexisting blood vessels, e.g. by sprouting or by intusseption. Through the&#xD;
      pioneering work of Folkman, it was recognized that angiogenesis plays an important role in&#xD;
      tumor development, progression, and metastasis. It is also conceivable that there are forms&#xD;
      or developmental stages of leukemia, multiple myeloma, or lymphomas that will progress&#xD;
      independently of angiogenesis. Synthesis of angiogenesis activators, such as vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other angiogenic factors, such as basic fibroblast&#xD;
      growth factor (bFGF), has been demonstrated for leukemia cells, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and&#xD;
      myeloma cells. Microvessel density is also significantly elevated over normal controls with&#xD;
      progressive increases according to the stages of myelodysplastic syndrome. Increased&#xD;
      microvessel density (MVD) in the bone marrow was found in patients with multiple myeloma in&#xD;
      comparison to normal controls and increased MVD is an adverse prognostic marker in multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. However, the functional status of the blood vessel (e.g. permeability) cannot be&#xD;
      determined by the above mentioned methods.&#xD;
