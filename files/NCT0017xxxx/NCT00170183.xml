  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients hospitalized for treatment of decompensated heart failure (CHF) are at risk for&#xD;
      prolonged length of stay (LOS) and frequent readmissions. Renal dysfunction and diuretic&#xD;
      resistance contribute to this risk, particularly if renal dysfunction worsens during CHF&#xD;
      treatment. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a hormone of myocardial cell origin with&#xD;
      well-defined physiological effects which include arterial and venous vasodilation,&#xD;
      suppression of adverse neurohumoral systems and favorable effects on renal hemodynamics and&#xD;
      sodium excretion. Recombinant human BNP (Natrecor) is approved by the FDA for treatment of&#xD;
      decompensated CHF as it has been demonstrated to lower filling pressures and improve&#xD;
      symptoms. While clinical trials and the FDA support the use of BNP as adjuvant therapy in&#xD;
      decompensated CHF, the extent of its efficacy in improving non-hemodynamic CHF parameters has&#xD;
      not been fully defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical practice protocol is to determine whether use of BNP in&#xD;
      addition to standard therapy, will preserve renal function and facilitate diuresis in&#xD;
      patients with CHF and mild-moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance &gt; 20 but &lt; 60&#xD;
      ml/min) as compared to standard therapy alone. Patients admitted to the Mayo Heart Failure&#xD;
      Service who meet entrance criteria will be randomized to standard clinical practice with or&#xD;
      without a 48 hour infusion of BNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints will be indices of renal function and diuretic response at 1, 2 and 3&#xD;
      days and at discharge. Secondary endpoints will be neurohumoral function, LOS and 30-day&#xD;
      readmission rate.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical practice protocol is to determine whether use of BNP in&#xD;
      addition to standard therapy, will preserve renal function and facilitate diuresis in&#xD;
      patients with CHF and renal impairment as compared to standard therapy alone. The study is&#xD;
      targeted at patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction with adequate blood pressure who&#xD;
      do not require inotropic therapy and are not felt to need intravenous vasodilator therapy for&#xD;
      acute symptom control. Patients will be randomized on admission to the heart failure service&#xD;
      and prior to initiation of therapy. Patients who receive initial therapy in the emergency&#xD;
      department will be eligible but the therapy given in the emergency department will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Creatinine, Creatinine Clearance at 1,2,3 days and at discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Wt loss at 1,2,3 days and at discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fluid balance at 1,2,3 days and at discharge&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. LOS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 30 day readmission for CHF (hospital records Â¡V Mayo and patient phone call at 30 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone, ANP, BNP, N-proBNP, Angiotensin II, cGMP, ET,&#xD;
           Cystatin C at baseline and just prior to end BNP infusion (BNP group) or at 48 hours&#xD;
           after entry (standard care group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cockcroft-Gault Formula (Weight in Kg; Creatinine in mg/dL - Use estimated Dry Weight) Men&#xD;
      Crt Cl = ((140-Age)*Weight) / (72*Crt) Women Crt Cl = 0.85 * ((140-Age)*Weight) / (72*Crt)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation/Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We tabulated the HF hospital service profile in regards to renal function during a&#xD;
      three-month period from May-July 2002 where 140 patients were admitted to the CHF service.&#xD;
      Data to calculate creatinine clearance was not available from this data base. Mild-moderate&#xD;
      renal dysfunction was characterized by creatinine of 1.4 - 3.0 mg/dL and was present in 60&#xD;
      (43%) patients. This likely represents a significant underestimation of those patients&#xD;
      eligible for the study as our patients are elderly where creatinines &lt; 1.4 mg/dL often&#xD;
      correlate to creatinine clearances in the 20-60 range. In the 60 patients with creatinines of&#xD;
      1.4-3.0 mg/dL, the mean change in creatinine during the hospitalization was +0.022 + or -&#xD;
      0.377 mg/dL. Using this change as that expected in the standard therapy group, enrolling 52&#xD;
      patients per treatment group (n=104 total) would provide 80% power (significance level of&#xD;
      0.05) to detect a change of 0.222 mg/dL in mean creatinine (from + 0.022 to -0.200). Using&#xD;
      creatinine, the 0.222 mg/dL change represents an effect size of 0.58. If one allocates&#xD;
      representative weights and ages to the creatinines at admission and discharge and calculates&#xD;
      the mean change in creatinine clearance, a value of 1.54 + or - 6.51 ml/min is obtained. In&#xD;
      this case, a difference of 5 ml/min in the mean change in creatinine clearance between&#xD;
      standard therapy and treated groups would represent a somewhat higher treatment effect&#xD;
      (0.768) indicating more than adequate power to detect a difference of 5 ml/min in the mean&#xD;
      change in creatinine clearance between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 standard therapy to BNP + standard therapy. Randomization&#xD;
      will be stratified by creatinine clearance with two groups (20-39 ml/min and 40-59 ml/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints: Mean change in creatinine, creatinine clearance, fluid balance, and body&#xD;
      weight will be calculated at 1, 2, 3 days and at discharge and compared between the BNP and&#xD;
      standard therapy groups. Percent patients meeting criteria for diuretic resistance and&#xD;
      percent patients receiving advanced therapy for diuretic resistance in the two groups will be&#xD;
      compared. All data will be analyzed by intention to treat and by received active therapy for&#xD;
      full 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: Mean length of stay and readmission rate will be compared between the&#xD;
      two groups. Differences between groups will be compared by Students unpaired t test for&#xD;
      continuous variables and Fischers exact test for nominal variables. Data entry will be the&#xD;
      duty of the nurse coordinator and will utilize both paper and an electronic case report form&#xD;
      currently used by the CV studies unit. The Investigators will utilize the Center for Patient&#xD;
      Oriented Research for consultation in setting up the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &gt; 560 patients/year admitted to CHF service If 46% have crt creatinine clearance 20-59 ml/min&#xD;
      = 257 patients/1 year If 50% eligible patients enrolled = 129 patients/1 year If 40% eligible&#xD;
      patients enrolled = 103 patients/1 year If 30% eligible patients enrolled = 77 patients/1&#xD;
      year&#xD;
&#xD;
      BNP therapy - in treatment arm only 2 ug/kg bolus and 0.01 ug/kg/min x 48 hours as long as:&#xD;
      Systolic BP (SBP) &gt; 90 and no symptoms thought related to decreased BP If SBP &lt; 90 and&#xD;
      asymptomatic- dc infusion, 250 cc NS , resume at 0.007 ug/kg/min (no bolus) once BP &gt; 90 If&#xD;
      SBP &lt; 90 and symptomatic - dc infusion, 250 cc NS bolus , Trendlenberg, do not restart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard therapy (to be used in both arms):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACE inhibitors/Angiotensin Receptor Blockers - initiate or adjust per clinical judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Digoxin - per clinical judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hydralazine/Isordil - per clinical judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coumadin/Aspirin - per clinical judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beta Blockers - per clinical judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calcium channel blockers - per clinical judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-cardiac meds - per clinical judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spironolactone&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. already on - continue at current dose or dc as appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. already on - increase at dc if clinically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. not on - add at dc if clinically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other diuretic - discontinue and follow algorithm&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diet - 2 gm NaCl and 1.5 Liter total fluid restriction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Daily weights (same scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Accurate I and O&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Oxygen - per clinical judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diuretic therapy - Standardized Diuretic Algorithm based on initial creatinine clearance (see&#xD;
      below). BNP must be started within 1-2 hours of randomization Diuretics will be started at 1&#xD;
      hour after start of the BNP infusion in BNP group. Diuretics can be started immediately after&#xD;
      randomization in the standard therapy group. The study period is considered to start with&#xD;
      initiation of BNP (BNP group) or diuretics (Standard therapy group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard clinical care which includes daily electrolyte panel (creatinine, blood urea&#xD;
      nitrogen, sodium, potassium). Humoral function (BNP, ANP, PRA, Aldosterone, ET, N-proBNP,&#xD;
      Angiotensin II, cGMP) at baseline and prior to end of Natrecor infusion (research labs).&#xD;
      Twenty ml of blood in standard EDTA tube and five ml of blood in EDTA tube with ACE inhibitor&#xD;
      will be needed per blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitals monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard clinical care which includes established nursing protocols for use of BNP infusion&#xD;
      on telemetry. Introduction of BNP into clinical practice was piloted in the CCU and then on&#xD;
      the cardiology telemetry units (4 Domatilla and 4 Joesph) by the CHF group and is now&#xD;
      standard clinical practice on these floors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diuretic Algorithm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial dosing and subsequent dosing of diuretics are to follow the diuretic algorithm&#xD;
      outlined below. Can substitute bumex (1 mg bumex/ 40 mg furosemide). Can delay progression to&#xD;
      next level if within 10% of goal fluid balance/weight. Clinician may use fluid balance OR&#xD;
      weight to make decisions regarding progression to next level.&#xD;
