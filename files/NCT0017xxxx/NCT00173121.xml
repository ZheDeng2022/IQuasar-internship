  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From last decades, because of lacking the powerful quantitative methods, such as real-time&#xD;
      qPCR, there is no environmental monitoring data about enterovirus transmission. If the major&#xD;
      transmission routes and risk factor are still not clear, it will be very hard for making the&#xD;
      prevention and control strategies. Today, the most popular prevention suggestion for children&#xD;
      is keeping them away from crowded public places during the peak contagious season, because&#xD;
      enteroviruses are easily transmitted through aerosols over a distance of meters, and even&#xD;
      between separated rooms (Chang et al., 2004). However, adults may as easily be infected, but&#xD;
      don』t have any disease symptoms or carry the virus home. Another recommendation is washing&#xD;
      hands to avoid contact of hands or anything else with the mouth and nose, as it is through&#xD;
      contact of viruses with the mucosal membranes in the mouth and nasal passages that infection&#xD;
      occurs. However, these actions did not be great helpful for preventing enterovirus infection&#xD;
      and spread. Understanding and disrupting the major transmission pass way of enterovirus could&#xD;
      be more effective than just keeping personal hygiene. Therefore, an applicable environmental&#xD;
      monitoring program is needed for understanding the transmission routes and risk factor of&#xD;
      enterovirus infection. In this study, we will monitor enteroviruses in hospital, household&#xD;
      and kindergarten. For the environmental monitoring of enteroviruses, we will apply&#xD;
      traditional plaque assay, real-time quantitative PCR and combine with questionnaire-based&#xD;
      interviews to understand the infectious types and concentration of enterovirus from indoor&#xD;
      air, surface and water for recognizing the transmission routes of enterovirus and the&#xD;
      relationships between virus concentration and the symptoms of the cases.&#xD;

      Environmental Monitoring Program for Enterovirus (1) Case Collection. The studies cases&#xD;
      include patients who were suspected of having enterovirus illnesses, such as HFMD and&#xD;
      herpangina. Institutional review board approval was obtained from the Hospital for this study&#xD;
      and informed consent was obtained from all patients or their parents. (2) Questionnaire.&#xD;
      questionnaire based interviews were used to collect information about the family members,&#xD;
      including demographic data, the number of bedrooms in the house, amount of contact time with&#xD;
      the patient, presence and pattern of current or recent signs and symptoms. (3) Patient and&#xD;
      culture samples. Laboratory evidence of enterovirus infection was defined as the isolation of&#xD;
      enterovirus from a throat , and rectal swab sample. (4) Environmental Sampling. (a) Air&#xD;
      sampling. For the filter/real-time qPCR assay, the air in each ward was filtered through a&#xD;
      37-mm-diameter Nuclepore filter (Costar, Cambridge, MA), which is a track-etched&#xD;
      polycarbonate filter consisting of a polycarbonate membrane with straight-through pores of&#xD;
      uniform size (0.4 μm). The filters were supported by cellulose pads and loaded into open-face&#xD;
      three-piece plastic cassettes. The pump and filter apparatus were placed within 1 m from the&#xD;
      patient's bed on an adjacent nightstand. (b) Surface sampling Regarding surface sampling,&#xD;
      surfaces of environment and equipment were sampled with moistened sterile cotton swabs.&#xD;
