      The investigators' hypothesis is that oral L-carnosine treatment (as compared with placebo)&#xD;
      will enhance cognitive abilities (specifically: measures of attention, executive function,&#xD;
      working memory, visuospatial ability and language) in persons with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder. Secondarily, they hypothesize that there will be secondary&#xD;
      improvements in positive, negative and mood symptoms with L-carnosine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to test these hypotheses by conducting a randomized, placebo&#xD;
      controlled, add-on treatment trial of L-carnosine (added to existing antipsychotic treatment)&#xD;
      up to 84 recruited subjects with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th&#xD;
      Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder for a period of 16&#xD;
      weeks. Measures of cognition and psychopathology will be utilized for evaluating primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes, along with safety assessments.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the available neuroscience and human data, we hypothesize that supplemental&#xD;
      L-carnosine treatment (a potent naturally occuring antioxidant and anti-glycation agent) will&#xD;
      be a useful disease modifying agent when used adjunctively with antipsychotic drugs in&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. More&#xD;
      specifically, our hypothesis is that oral L-carnosine treatment (as compared with placebo)&#xD;
      will enhance cognitive abilities (specifically: measures of attention, executive function,&#xD;
      working memory, visuospatial ability and language) in persons with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder. Secondarily, we hypothesize there will be secondary improvements in&#xD;
      positive, negative and mood symptoms with L-carnosine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, placebo controlled, add-on treatment trial of L-carnosine (added to existing&#xD;
      antipsychotic treatment) for a period of 16 weeks. Measures of cognition, and psychopathology&#xD;
      will be utilized for evaluating primary and secondary outcomes, along with safety&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to eighty-four subjects with DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder will be&#xD;
      recruited from Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, Mayview State Hospital, Mon Yough&#xD;
      Community Services, Inc. and Dubois Regional Medical Center using a 1:1 randomization,&#xD;
      subjects who sign a informed consent document will be randomized to receive L-carnosine or&#xD;
      placebo. During a 4 week titration period, the L-carnosine dosage will be increased from 500&#xD;
      to 2000 mg/day, and continued for an additional 8 weeks. If side-effects are noted, a minimum&#xD;
      of 500 mg/day of L-carnosine can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computerized cognitive battery will form the main efficacy measures and be administered at&#xD;
      baseline and at visit 6 (i.e. just prior to the 4 week taper); some of these measures will be&#xD;
      administered at visit 4 (28 days). Standard psychopathology rating scales will be&#xD;
      administered to evaluate secondary aims such as impact on positive and negative symptoms of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Safety will be assessed by tailing a careful medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination at screening and evaluating results of laboratory measures. Any adverse effects&#xD;
      will be assessed by asking questions at each visit, and if required bringing subjects in for&#xD;
      assessments outside the scheduled visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive dysfunction in persons with schizophrenia is a serious limitation to achieving&#xD;
      significantly better functional outcomes (Green, et. al., 1996). Till recently, therapeutic&#xD;
      nihilism prevailed when it came to treatments that improve cognitive abilities in&#xD;
      schizophrenia. One reason for this pessimistic view was that cognitive dysfunction was not&#xD;
      considered to be malleable to treatment but instead was thought to represent an unchanging&#xD;
      dimension of the illness. However, that view is now changing, and psychosocial and cognitive&#xD;
      remediation techniques are being evaluated to treat cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. A&#xD;
      recent synthesis of data would suggest that mediators of a better cognitive outcome may also&#xD;
      include agents that target the inefficient antioxidant defenses in persons with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, or those that counter NMDA-glutamate neuronal excitotoxicity (Yao et al.,&#xD;
      2001). These mechanisms may underlie the neuronal membrane pathology in schizophrenia, and in&#xD;
      turn these abnormalities may contribute to the cognitive dysfunction and decline reported&#xD;
      during the course of the illness. The benefits of L-carnosine (a naturally occurring&#xD;
      antioxidant and anti-glycation agent) for improved cognitive abilities and in social behavior&#xD;
      and communicative skills were reported in a random-assignment, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial in children and adolescents with autism; specifically improvements&#xD;
      in receptive language scores and socialization and communication skill scores (Chez et al.,&#xD;
      2002a).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary focus of this study is to evaluate the ability of L-carnosine, a naturally&#xD;
      occurring dipeptide, to enhance cognitive abilities in people with schizophrenia. The study&#xD;
      will also evaluate whether L-carnosine has secondary benefits for positive and negative and&#xD;
      mood symptoms. As a relatively benign agent, L-carnosine offers the potential to achieve a&#xD;
      significant clinical impact in improving cognitive dysfunction in persons with schizophrenia,&#xD;
      if efficacy is confirmed.&#xD;
