  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify specific chemotherapy-related changes in sleep&#xD;
      stages/architecture that may relate to an increase in fatigue in individuals with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesize that the fatigue experienced by cancer patients receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy is in part due to changes in restorative sleeping during the non-rapid eye&#xD;
      movement cycles of sleep (i.e., delta activity).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown a strong positive correlation between self-reported changes in sleep and&#xD;
      cancer patients' fatigue, and also between an objective measure of sleep continuity, [i.e.,&#xD;
      actigraphy and polysomnography (PSG)] and self-reported fatigue. Chemotherapy disrupts normal&#xD;
      sleep patterns, and fatigue, in the later stages of chemotherapy, may occur as a result of&#xD;
      disturbed nocturnal sleep continuity. However, the causes of chemotherapy-related fatigue&#xD;
      remain unknown, and whether or not abnormal sleep architecture contributes to this&#xD;
      debilitating effect has yet to be explored. We believe that fatigue experienced by many&#xD;
      cancer patients receiving chemotherapy is due, at least in part, to changes in delta activity&#xD;
      [i.e., restorative sleep during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) cycles of sleep]. A finding&#xD;
      that slow wave sleep abnormalities play a significant role in fatigue would prompt further&#xD;
      confirmatory studies and support controlled intervention studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: In a clinical trial of individuals with cancer prior to, during, and after&#xD;
      completion of chemotherapy, we will identify and compare specific chemotherapy-related&#xD;
      changes in sleep stages/architecture that may relate to an increase in fatigue. These changes&#xD;
      will be measured by actigraphy, PSG, and patient self-reporting techniques (e.g., sleep&#xD;
      diaries, questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine the role of delta sleep in the development of chemotherapy-induced fatigue in&#xD;
           cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  characterize the involvement of other elements of sleep architecture [e.g., rapid eye&#xD;
           movement (REM) sleep] and changes in sleep continuity relating to the development of&#xD;
           chemotherapy-induced fatigue in cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine the role of sleep architecture in the persistence of chemotherapy-induced&#xD;
           fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine (in post hoc analyses) the relationship of various physical symptoms and patient&#xD;
           variables that may be related to fatigue (e.g., pain, hot flashes, anxiety, hemoglobin,&#xD;
           menopausal status, sleep continuity, and QOL) and to each other, both during and&#xD;
           following chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answers to these questions will provide information that will be helpful in developing&#xD;
      potential targets for interventions to reduce fatigue.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Polysomnography (PSG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two consecutive nights prior to first chemotherapy, approximately three weeks following the patient's last chemotherapy, and three months following the last treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Polysomnography provides direct and quantitative measures of cortical activity during sleep (in the form of brain waves). The sleep continuity data derived from this technique include sleep latency (time taken to fall asleep), wake after sleep onset time, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency (SE). The sleep architecture information derived from this technique consists of the assessment of sleep in terms of its constituent component stages (i.e., percent Stage-1, Stage-2, SWS, and REM sleep).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>On the first night of each of the three polysomnography assessments</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory is a 9-item, patient-report instrument with established reliability and validity that allows for the rapid assessment of fatigue level in cancer patients. Possible scores on this scale range from 0 - 10 with higher numbers indicating greater fatigue.</description>

&#xD;
          -  On a short term basis (less than 3 months), taking any prescription medication for the&#xD;
             control of anxiety, sleep, depression, or fatigue OR taking any over-the-counter&#xD;
