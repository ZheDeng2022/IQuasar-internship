  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether the closely supervised provision of&#xD;
      injectable, pharmaceutical-grade heroin (in combination with oral methadone) is more&#xD;
      effective than methadone therapy alone in recruiting, retaining, and benefiting long-term&#xD;
      heroin users who have not been helped by current standard treatment options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-centre (Vancouver, Montreal) RCT involving a total of 235 volunteers. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to injectable heroin combined with oral methadone as desired&#xD;
      (45%) versus oral methadone alone (45%). A subset of 10% will be randomized to injectable&#xD;
      hydromorphone (Dilaudidâ„¢). Hydromorphone and heroin will be given in a double-blind fashion;&#xD;
      the purpose is to permit validation of reported illicit use of heroin through urine testing&#xD;
      in the hydromorphone group. Research visits will be conducted quarterly and will occur&#xD;
      independently of treatment clinic visits. Incentives will be used to maintain research&#xD;
      follow-up whether or not the subject is retained in treatment. The analysis will be under&#xD;
      intent-to-treat. The primary outcomes of interest are 1) recruitment and retention in the&#xD;
      study and 2) illicit drug use and criminal behavior (as determined by the Europ-ASI) at 12&#xD;
      months. Secondary outcomes are measures of social function (e.g., social integration and&#xD;
      functioning, quality of life) and cost-benefit/effectiveness of the interventions.&#xD;
