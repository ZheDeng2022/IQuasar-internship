      This PPG entitled &quot;A Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like&#xD;
      Disorder (SOPRES)&quot; is designed to study the &quot;Progress of Psychopathology&quot; of pre-psychotic&#xD;
      state of schizophrenia (SCH) using a prospective follow-up design. Based on the&#xD;
      neurodevelopment hypothesis of schizophrenia, the neurobiological dysfunctions, such as&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, neurophysiological dysfunction, neuroanatomical pathology, is the core&#xD;
      pathology. The pathology may exist prior to onset of psychotic symptoms, and at post&#xD;
      psychotic state. It also presents in the first-degree relatives. SCH is mainly with a gradual&#xD;
      mode of onset, ranging from pre-schizotypal (or pan-neurotic state), schizotypal, prodromal&#xD;
      to frank psychotic SCH (DSM-IV criteria) state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to the present time, there are arbitray criteria for diagnosing schizotypal disorder and&#xD;
      frank psychiatric schizophrenia, but the valid clinical assessment method of pre-schizotypal&#xD;
      and prodromal state is still controversial. The psychopathological progress from&#xD;
      pre-schizotypal to frank psychotic SCH state is still unclear. In this SOPRES, we intend to&#xD;
      establish a set of valid clinical assessments for defining the cases of early SCH-like&#xD;
      disorder [ESLD], to examine the clinical progression, such as conversion rate of psychosis&#xD;
      from non-psychotic state in a prospective longitudinal follow-up; to validate the clinically&#xD;
      defined cases of ESLD with different dimensions of neurobiological studies, including niacin&#xD;
      skin flush test, neuropsychological, neurophysiological (such as prepulse inhibition [PPI],&#xD;
      P50 inhibition [P50I]), and magnetic resonance spectrometry (MRS) and Diffusion Tensor&#xD;
      Imaging (TDI); to demonstrate the validity of the ESLD using the family&#xD;
      genetic-epidemiological data and to explore the awareness, reaction, coping strategy, social&#xD;
      stigma, and help seeking process of the patients and the families of ESLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve these goals, we designed this PPG of SOPRES, which comprises of 4&#xD;
      inter-locked projects and one core unit. Project No.1 is the &quot;Clinical Phenomenological&#xD;
      Follow-up Study of ELSD: Clinical Validity&quot;; Project No. 2 is the &quot;Validity Study of&#xD;
      Neurobiological Tests of ELSD&quot;; Project No. 3 is the &quot;Validity Study of Family Genetic Study&#xD;
      of ELSD&quot;; and Project No. 4 is the &quot;Awareness and Pathways of Help Seeking of ELSD&quot;. The only&#xD;
      one core unit is designed for the purposed of monitoring research progress, communication&#xD;
      among researchers such managing PPG research meeting, data management, and budget management&#xD;
      and other research-related administrative secretary work. These 4 projects are integrated&#xD;
      study approaches by means of (1) using the same samples; (2) study different levels of&#xD;
      psychopathology, including clinical symptoms, neurobiological impairment, family genetic&#xD;
      data, and psychosocial variables; and (3) mutual hypothesis testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that this SOPRES research will create a new frontier of SCH research in the fields&#xD;
      of early intervention of SCH for preventing the recurrence of frank psychotic state of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, and will provide the background for improving treatment outcome and quality of&#xD;
      life of SCH.&#xD;

      Project No: 1 Title: A Study of Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like&#xD;
      Disorder specific aims are 1) To elicit the psychopathology of identified Early&#xD;
      Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) and to categorize into 3 groups of pre-schizotypal,&#xD;
      schizotypal, and prodromal ESLD. 2) The reveal the prevalence of different neurobiological&#xD;
      impairment (studied in Project No.2) in 3 groups of these identified ESLD subjects. 3) The&#xD;
      stability of psychopathology of 3 groups of identified ESLD. 4) The process of conversion and&#xD;
      conversion rates of psychotic state from non-psychotic state in a 2-year follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The high-risk group of schizophrenia will be recruited by referral from psychiatric&#xD;
           outpatient clinics in Northern Taiwan, referral from school counseling room in Taipei&#xD;
           City and Taipei County, and subjects with known family history from our previous&#xD;
           schizophrenia genetic study, which has a size of 850 families. As we have good&#xD;
           collaborative works with several psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric departments of&#xD;
           general hospitals, it is expected that 100 subjects could be assessed from the&#xD;
           outpatient referral. The increasing needs of psychiatric consultation from school system&#xD;
           give us a chance to recruit 50 subjects by school referral (school counseling system).&#xD;
           Our previous family genetic studies in schizophrenia have already recruited 850&#xD;
           families. As the relatively risk of schizophrenic spectrum disorders (schizophrenia and&#xD;
           schizotypal disorder) is much higher in families with schizophrenic patients, and in our&#xD;
           experiences the families of schizophrenic patients often expressed worries about&#xD;
           developing the illness themselves, it is expected that 100 subjects could be assessed&#xD;
           from this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The school surveillance will be conducted in three selected senior high schools and&#xD;
           three colleges in Taipei metropolitan aiming at subjects fitting our recruiting&#xD;
           indicators, including cognitive decline, affective symptoms, social isolation, and&#xD;
           school failure (CASIS). A pilot study will be conducted in initial 5-10 nominated&#xD;
           candidate students to cross check the validity and applicability of each screening&#xD;
           methods. There are 75,084 senior high school students in Academic Year 2003-2004 in&#xD;
           Taipei City. We plan to survey the teachers of 3000 students to from 3 senior high&#xD;
           schools (around 1000 students each), representing schools with highly-academic-,&#xD;
           vocational-, and mixed-orientation. Another 3000 students will be recruited from 3&#xD;
           colleges by administering freshman self-report questionnaire. It is expected that 100&#xD;
           subjects could be identified as subjects with early schizophrenia-like clinical&#xD;
           presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The general public will be recruited by respondents to our study ads co-sponsored by the&#xD;
           Mental Health Foundation (MHF) framed in terms of highlighting awareness of early&#xD;
           cognitive deficits and prevention from severe mental disorders (Caring Brain and Worry&#xD;
           Free Program). As the PI had recruited subjects for &quot;brain bank&quot; by public advocacy and&#xD;
           the Mental Health Foundation already had annual surveys regarding the general public's&#xD;
           mental health conditions and subjective well-being with good response rate and the&#xD;
           results have been broadcast on major media. Based on the highly expected credit of the&#xD;
           MHF, we expect to identify and recruit 50 subjects from this channel.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The normal control will be recruited from the subjects' schoolmates or friends not&#xD;
           meeting our recruitment criteria, matched by age, gender, and education. We need 200&#xD;
           normal control subjects based on a two to one ration between the study subject and the&#xD;
           normal control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Referral criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient group: suspected &quot;latent&quot; or &quot;beginning of&quot; schizophrenia based on psychiatrists'&#xD;
      clinical experiences; school referral group: problematic students unable to be explained by&#xD;
      common conduct problems or psychosocial issues from teachers' perspectives (un-understandable&#xD;
      emotional, behavioral, interpersonal, or academic problems); family study group: siblings or&#xD;
      offspring of schizophrenic patients exhibiting symptoms or behavioral patterns warrant&#xD;
      family's attention (something reminding them about their schizophrenic relatives).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Recruitment criteria: (CASIS) Cognitive deficits: subjectively poor concentration; decline&#xD;
      of intelligence; inefficient learning; rigid thinking; Affective symptoms: unexplainable&#xD;
      depressiveness, anxiousness, fearfulness, obsession, or hypochondriacal ideas; social&#xD;
      isolation: having less than two close friends; generally withdrew, distant, aloof, or&#xD;
      isolated; frequent absence without identifiable causes; school failure: markedly&#xD;
      deterioration of academic performance or quitting school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects presenting at least two of the above conditions (one of cognitive deficit and at&#xD;
      least one of the remaining three) will be screened for psychotic-prone symptoms by the Latent&#xD;
      Schizophrenia Screening Sheet (LSSS) (necessary to have cognitive deficit) of 26 items (6&#xD;
      dimensions) including thoughts, perceptions, inappropriate behaviors, affective symptoms,&#xD;
      interpersonal relationship, and neurotic symptoms. Subjects respond &quot;sure&quot; for any item of&#xD;
      the LSS will be recruited for further assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Results: The cross-sectional and longitudinal progress of psychopathology of ESLD&#xD;
      will be revealed. The comprehensiveness and the domains of psychopathology of ESLD will be&#xD;
      elicited. The progressing process of the psychopathological domains will be characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The validity of subgrouping of ESLD into pre-schizotypal, schizotypal and prodromal&#xD;
           types will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We'll reveal the pattern of aggravation of symptomatic level as time goes by: more&#xD;
           subjects progress to the severer level during the 2-year follow-up (i.e., from&#xD;
           pre-schizotypy to schizotypy, from prodrome to SCH, etc; few subjects could &quot;drift back&quot;&#xD;
           to the milder symptomatic level (i.e., from prodrome to schizotypy or from schizotypy to&#xD;
           pre-schizotypy, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine some specific items in the screening tools, i.e., LSS, SOPS, for better&#xD;
           positive predictive values than the others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The sensitivity and specificity of the screening tools will be examined using&#xD;
           neurobiological indicators (Project No.2) by constrast validity testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project No: 2 Title: Neurobiological Study of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD)&#xD;
      Specific Aims: Based on the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia (SCH), it is&#xD;
      assumed that clinically identified pre-psychotic state of SCH, termed as Early&#xD;
      Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD)(Project No.1), may have impaired neurobiological&#xD;
      functions. Our previous family-based studies also supported that some neurobiological&#xD;
      markers, such as sustained attention deficits, were potential endophenotypes of schizophrenia&#xD;
      (see background below). Therefore, in Project No.2 of the Study on Psychopathological&#xD;
      Progress of ESLD (SOPRES) Program, we plan to adopt multi-level approaches to investigate the&#xD;
      potential neurobiological changes in patients with ESLD. The approaches include certain&#xD;
      specific neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of neuropsychological study are as follows: 1) to examine whether&#xD;
      individuals with ESLD evidence controlled processing dysfunction of neurocognition; 2) if&#xD;
      true, to further explore whether such dysfunction involving neurocognitive domain is simplex&#xD;
      or multiplex in nature; 3) to determine whether neurocognitive controlled processing&#xD;
      measure(s) used in the present study can be a useful screening tool for ESLD and further for&#xD;
      early detection of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the other dimensions of neurobiological studies are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To clarify the prevalence of impaired flush response to Niacin skin patch in ESLD and to&#xD;
           assess the predictive validity of Niacin skin test in the progression of schizophrenia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To reveal the prevalence of two brain inhibitory functions (i.e. prepulse inhibition of&#xD;
           startle (PPI) and P50 event-related potential (ERP) suppression) in ESLD and the change&#xD;
           along clinical course of those ESLD subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To measure the regional changes of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in hippocampus&#xD;
           and frontal lobe in subjects with ESLD, and define the predictive validity in the&#xD;
           follow-up course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To measure the connectivity and diffusion anisotropy between the hippocampus and frontal&#xD;
           lobe by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in subjects with ESLD, and define the predictive&#xD;
           validity in the follow-up course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the possibility of skin niacin response/MRS/DTI/P50/PPI as endophenotypes in&#xD;
           further genetic research of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of the specific inhibitory measures also resides in the fact that they are&#xD;
      understood at neurobiological (and in some cases, molecular) levels, based on extensive human&#xD;
      and animal model studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. P50 Suppression:&#xD;
&#xD;
           P50 suppression is an important endophenotype of schizophrenia. P50 suppression occurs&#xD;
           when two clicks are presented with a 500 msec interstimulus interval. The impaired&#xD;
           suppression of the P50 to the second stimulus has been reported in a number of studies&#xD;
           in chronic schizophrenia patients, both medicated and unmedicated, first-episode&#xD;
           patients, and first-degree relatives of schizophrenics, as well as schizotypal&#xD;
           individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Impaired P50 suppression is extensively studied using anatomical and molecular genetic&#xD;
           and other neurobiological studies. These findings support that P50 suppression&#xD;
           impairment is a possible endophenotype of information processing deficits in&#xD;
           schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prepulse inhibition (PPI):&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPI of the startle response is an operational measure of preattentive sensorimotor gating.&#xD;
      The term startle modification refers to the changes in the startle reflex, induced by various&#xD;
      stimulus modalities, when the startle-eliciting stimulus is preceeded by a (usually weak)&#xD;
      stimulus called a prepulse. It is stable over time in both normal subjects and schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deficits in PPI have been consistently identified in schizophrenia, and PPI is an excellent&#xD;
      candidate endophenotype in schizophrenia since PPI deficits occurred in schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients, and schizotypal personality disorder patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the presence and change of impaired PPI and P50 suppression in ESLD may help us&#xD;
      clarify the stability of the impairment along the disease course and the validity of using&#xD;
      the PPI and P50 test as a screening tool for pre-psychotic state of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project No: 3 Title: Family Genetic Study of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder I. Specific&#xD;
      Aims: Genetic high-risk (HR) approach, in which subjects with one or more affected relatives&#xD;
      were recruited since infancy or early childhood, has been the most commonly adopted one to&#xD;
      address the early detection of schizophrenia (1). However, as pointed out in a recent review&#xD;
      (2), there are two major limitations of these studies. First, because the majority of these&#xD;
      genetic high-risk studies were started 30-40 years ago, many of them used methods that are&#xD;
      outdated and sometimes focused on less relevant subjects in their assessments. Second, only&#xD;
      approximately 10% of the HR children develop schizophrenia, making the predictions concerning&#xD;
      vulnerability indicators unprecise. Recently an alternative approach called clinical&#xD;
      high-risk or ultra-high-risk has been advocated, in which adolescents or young adults&#xD;
      referred for mental health evaluation with attenuated psychotic symptoms or behavioral&#xD;
      problems commonly observed in the HR children were recruited for prospective follow-ups (3,&#xD;
      4). In this PPG, we propose an approach that combines both genetic HR and clinical HR to&#xD;
      enrich the recruitment of subjects at increased risk of developing early schizophrenia-like&#xD;
      disorder (ESLD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the interpretation of the contrast between HR subjects and normal controls or&#xD;
      between HR with onset of schizophrenia and HR without onset of schizophrenia tends not to be&#xD;
      straightforward. Any neurodevelopmental disturbances can be distributed in two independent&#xD;
      dimensions: a genetic-environmental causal continuum and an early-to-late maturation&#xD;
      expression continuum (5). A factor that is present in an HR subject but absent in normal&#xD;
      controls is not necessarily of genetic origin. One way to distinguish is to examine whether a&#xD;
      similar deficit is present in other non-HR sibling of the HR proband. However, previous HR&#xD;
      studies tended to measure only the HR subject in each family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this component project, we propose to adopt a family-genetic approach to provide more&#xD;
      information for the interpretation of the contrast between HR of different severity and&#xD;
      normal controls or between HR with progression to a more severe stage and HR without such&#xD;
      progression. The specific aims of this component project are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1:To assess to what extent the psychopathological features identified in the probands of&#xD;
      pre-schizotypal ESLD, schizotypal ESLD, prodromal ESLD, or early schizophrenia are also&#xD;
      present in their first-degree relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess to what extent the neurodevelopmental or neurobiological impairment&#xD;
      identified in the probands of pre-schizotypal ESLD, schizotypal ESLD, prodromal ESLD, or&#xD;
      early schizophrenia are also present in their first-degree relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To assess to what extent the conversion in psychotic-like state of the three groups of&#xD;
      ESLD probands can be explained by the presence of psychopathological, neurodevelopmental, or&#xD;
      neurobiological features observed in their first-degree relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probands of the three groups of ESLD (pre-schizotypal ESLD, schizotypal ESLD, and&#xD;
      prodromal ESLD), early schizophrenia, and normal controls will be recruited by the Component&#xD;
      Project 1 of this PPG. On the basis of these probands, this Component Project will recruit&#xD;
      their first-degree relatives to participate in the study. Part of these probands will have&#xD;
      neurobiological assessment conducted in Component Project 2. Part of the family identified in&#xD;
      this Component Project will be evaluated for help-seeking behavior. In these joined efforts,&#xD;
      we will be able to decipher the psychopathological pathways for both genetic and&#xD;
      environmental etiological factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core Unit Code No: A Title: Core Unit of A Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early&#xD;
      Schizophrenia-like Disorder (CUSOPRES) This PPG of Study on Psychopathological Progress of&#xD;
      Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) [SOPRES] is composed of 4 inter-related projects:&#xD;
      (1) A Phenomenological Prospective Follow-up Study of ESLD; (2) A Neurobiological Study of&#xD;
      ESLD; (3) Family Genetic Study of ESLD; (4) Awareness and Pathways to Care in ESLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study samples participate all these four projects. The major hypothesis of the SOPRES was&#xD;
      based on neurodevelopmental etiological hypothesis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis testing&#xD;
      is interrelated among three projects No.1, No.2 and No.3. The projects No.4 is supplementary&#xD;
      to other 3 projects. This SOPRES belongs to a translational study. Project No.4 is essential&#xD;
      to bridge the process for clinical application of this SOPRES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these predicted research activities commonly needed for these four projects of this&#xD;
      PPG, an efficient Core Unit of this SOPRES (CUSOPRES) is mandatory for carrying out the&#xD;
      research work smoothly. There are several sections of research-related work of this CUSOPRES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Administrative Coordination of this SOPRES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This CUSOPRES has to coordinate the regular research meeting, to make record of this research&#xD;
      meeting. Literature related to this SOPRES PPG has to be collected and to be distributed to&#xD;
      all research participants. It has to monitor the reality of the progress of this SOPRES. The&#xD;
      progress of sampling, data collection, data check, setting up computer data file has to be&#xD;
      monitored weekly. Report of research progress has to be done and has to be distributed to all&#xD;
      main researchers. All the filing system of this SOPRES has also to be done by this CUSOPRES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Budget management: Some proportion of the budget are commonly used in three projects. Each&#xD;
      project also has its own budget schedule. The salary system of all research assistant has to&#xD;
      be scheduled and managed clearly. This budget is of government grant. Detailed descriptions&#xD;
      and records of budget expenditure are critically demanded by the regulatory and census system&#xD;
      of the government. The expenditure every year must to be regulated to meet the requirement of&#xD;
      research activity. This CUSOPRES has to manage all these works. A full time business&#xD;
      assistant is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Training of Research Assistants and Participant Researchers: This PPG OF SOPRES will&#xD;
      recruit research assistants (RA) for sampling, for data collection and data management. In&#xD;
      Taiwan, the job of RA is always in a temporary basis. They (RA) come and go. All these RA's&#xD;
      enrolled have to receive a through training for their work to guarantee high training of data&#xD;
      collection and data management. All participant young researchers of all different&#xD;
      disciplines also have to arrange training program related to the SOPRES research activities.&#xD;
      This training program has to be arranged, scheduled and managed by the CUSOPRES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Manuscript Preparation and Submission. Other than collecting new data, this PPG also have&#xD;
      abundant data bank of previous psychopathological studies. As stated in the preliminary work&#xD;
      of these three projects, these data has to be analyzed along the progress of data collection&#xD;
      of this SOPRES. These continuous data analysis will create many drafts of paper manuscripts.&#xD;
      Thus, this SOPRES PPG will have many manuscripts preparations for submitting to international&#xD;
      and/or domestic journals. Typing, editing, and the preparation of these manuscripts are part&#xD;
      of the work of this CUSOPRES. This is one important supporting function of CUSOPRES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Data management and Data Analysis After preliminary management of data collected from the&#xD;
      study subjects, all research data have to be set up in suitable computer data bank. Data&#xD;
      cleaning is important work. Integrated data analyses of this SOPRES are unique of this SOPRES&#xD;
      PPG. Other than independent analysis of the specific project itself, coordinated and mutual&#xD;
      data matching analysis is unique of this SOPRES. The clinical definition of ESLD will be&#xD;
      validated by concurrent psychopathological data (Project No.1) and follow-up data, and will&#xD;
      be validated by all different dimensions of neurobiological data (Project No.2). The&#xD;
      clinically defined ESLD will also be validated by family genetic data. Most importantly,&#xD;
      heterogeneity of ESLD will also be explored using statistical maneuvers and then, will&#xD;
      receive further validation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Structure and Statistical data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure1 illustrates the possible data relationship and statistical analysis tools and data&#xD;
      analysis strategies to be involved in and incorporated into the project. Structure of data&#xD;
      sets to be collected by four component projects is very complicate in nature:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Data sets to be collected by all four projects are inter-correlated and dependent.&#xD;
           Subjects may be stratified by various relationships among all four projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Data sets are highly multidimensional. Each program project employees multiple&#xD;
           interviewing and measurement tables. Subjects match different criteria may have&#xD;
           different sets of measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . These measurements have different scales: ratio, interval, ordinal, nominal.&#xD;
           Multivariate variables with different scales will be studied simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. . Some of the subjects/measurements combinations may have longitudinal pattern with&#xD;
           follow-up studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. . Data sets collected by Project 3 may be of dependent nature - samples are clustered as&#xD;
           families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the high complexity of the data structure involved, the core unit has the following&#xD;
      strategies to handle the statistical data analyses for all different&#xD;
      project/subject/table/variable combination and situation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Descriptive statistics and various exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools will first be&#xD;
           used to study the basic distribution structure for all the subjects/variables collected.&#xD;
           This provides the researchers most of the univariate distributions and some of the&#xD;
           associations structure of tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Generalized association plots (GAP), developed by Dr. Chun-houh Chen (Chen 2002) for&#xD;
           our previous projects, will also be used to explore the basic clustering structure of&#xD;
           subjects and grouping structure of variables and the interaction patterns of the&#xD;
           subject-clusters with variable-groups for each individual data table and combination of&#xD;
           tables. This provides us an overall picture of data structure for all the&#xD;
           subjects/tables involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . Many conventional multivariate statistical analysis tools will be employed to conduct&#xD;
           further exploratory analyses and some confirmatory studies for the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. . Various statistical testing procedures will also be used to verify and answer some of&#xD;
           the hypotheses generated and proposed by all four component projects. The results may&#xD;
           lead to new or modified hypotheses. Statistical analyses and hypothesis testing&#xD;
           procedures will be performed again to verify the new hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. . Various statistical and epidemiological genetic analysis tools are to be used for&#xD;
           analyzing the familial data generated by project 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. . Latent class model (LCM) developed by Dr. Huang (Huang &amp; Bandeen-Roche 2004, Huang&#xD;
           2005) can be used to study subject clustering pattern for various project/table&#xD;
           combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. . CateGAP, longGAP, canoGAP will be applied to study the categorical, longitudinal, and&#xD;
           canonical relationship data structure respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. . New statistical methodologies and data analysis procedures suitable for analyzing&#xD;
           specific data pattern to be generated by all four projects will be developed by the&#xD;
           statisticians of the core unit when there is the need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. International and Domestic Communication Related to academic activities of this SOPRES,&#xD;
      this SOPRES focuses on the up-to-date psychopathological study issue. All participant&#xD;
      researchers of this SOPRES have abundant communication with other academic institutes or&#xD;
      personnel for academic interests. This CUSOPRES has to manage all these communications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. The GENOP research team of this SOPRES program has also done the positional cloning study&#xD;
      in order to find the vulnerability gene of schizophrenia in an independent molecular genetic&#xD;
      study on SCH. We have found 12 potential candidate vulnerability genes up to now. In the&#xD;
      coming years, there will be risk mutations identified in these vulnerability genes. These&#xD;
      risk mutations will be as the direct genetic marker to validate the different groups of ESLD.&#xD;
      This core unit will hire one assistant of bachelor degree to do blood sample collection and&#xD;
      DNA extraction, as well as lymphocyte immortalization by EBV transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Summary and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      This PPG of &quot;A Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder&#xD;
      (SOPRES)&quot; was designed to validate Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) defined&#xD;
      clinically, using neurodevelopmental-associated core psychopathology. The SOPRES will recruit&#xD;
      subjects of potential cases of ESLD using clinical psychopathological data obtained by&#xD;
      self-report and face-to-face interview approach. Three groups of ESLD will be defined: (1)&#xD;
      pre-schizotypal (or pan-neurotic), (2) schizotypal and (3) prodromal groups. These three&#xD;
      groups represent three steps of psychopathological progress of ESLD. Using prospective&#xD;
      follow-up design, the conversion rates of these three groups converted into successive group&#xD;
      and into frank psychotic state of schizophrenia will be revealed. These clinically defined&#xD;
      cases will be validated using neurobiological indicators, such as neuropsychological,&#xD;
      neurophysiological, niacin skin flushing test, neurochemical, neuroanatomical indicators&#xD;
      (Project No.2) as well as family genetic epidemiological data (Project No.3). The subtypes of&#xD;
      ESLD will also be delineated using these validation procedures. The awareness, reaction and&#xD;
      coping strategy of the patients and the family care-givers will be elicited as well. This&#xD;
      SOPRES is 5-year study design, which includes 4 study periods: (1) half year preparation, (2)&#xD;
      2 years of case recruitment, (3) 2 years of follow-up and (4) half year ending and data&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychopathology of schizophrenia has been well studied in the past decade. The SOPRES is&#xD;
      a translational study design to examine the psychopathological progress of the pre-psychotic&#xD;
      state of schizophrenia based on neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia. This SOPRES&#xD;
      is, thus, of high academic merit in the study of schizophrenia psychopathology. This SOPRES&#xD;
      will demonstrate the successful application of basic neurobiological study data on clinical&#xD;
      condition of ESLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This SOPRES will successfully set up a battery for valid diagnostic assessment of ESLD&#xD;
      covering multidimensional psychopathology and it will also reveal the psychological progress&#xD;
      of ESLD. This valid diagnostic assessment of ESLD will identify cases of ESLD from the cases&#xD;
      with school failure, job difficulty, and of anxiety-depressive disorders in general&#xD;
      psychiatric clinics. This will be helpful for avoiding the undesirable clinical condition of&#xD;
      mis-diagnosis and mis-treatment. This will also substantiate the background for the&#xD;
      development of further frontier of early intervention of ESLD. As schizophrenia is a&#xD;
      devastating disease for the patient himself/herself, the family and the society. It also&#xD;
      carries heavy psychosocial stigma. The result of SOPRES will be very helpful for building up&#xD;
      early, intervention of schizophrenia, and will contribute a lot in reducing the cost of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The SOPRES study results regarding the awareness and coping strategy of the&#xD;
      patients and the family will provide useful empirical data for developing psychosocial&#xD;
      service for the ESLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This SOPRES study will provide the learning experience for participating researchers,&#xD;
      including research assistants in the area of developing diagnostic assessment, combing&#xD;
      clinical psychopathology and neurobiological pathology of early pre-psychotic state of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. This experience will cultivate the future professional persons in the research&#xD;
      area of preventive psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Institutional Environment and Resources&#xD;
&#xD;
      This PPG of SOPRES will be carried out with the main researcher center located at the&#xD;
      Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine,&#xD;
      National Taiwan University. There are main psychiatric hospitals affiliated with this&#xD;
      research center. Massive case and family recruitment in local and nationwide programs for&#xD;
      molecular genetic study of schizophrenia has been carried out by this research center and the&#xD;
      affiliated hospitals. This research center has been doing psychopathological study on&#xD;
      schizophrenia in its academic tradition. This research center is one part of the active&#xD;
      medical campus of the National Taiwan University. Multidisciplinary team related to&#xD;
      neurobiological study has been organized for years. These neurobiological studies of&#xD;
      neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging fields and neurobiological technology&#xD;
      have been well developed. This university medical campus is very active in collaborating with&#xD;
      other research sections as shown by this PPG of SOPRES. The Department of Imaging, Department&#xD;
      of Neurology, Department of Nursing, and Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine;&#xD;
      Department of Psychology, College of Science, Department of Social Worker, College of Social&#xD;
      Science, Institute of Epidemiology, College of Public Health of the same University are&#xD;
      integrated with this PPG. The active research centers of statistical science located in&#xD;
      Academia Sinica, and National Chiao Tung University, as well as Institute of Anthropology,&#xD;
      National Tsing Hua University are also integrated into this PPG of SOPRES. These institutions&#xD;
      are all engaged in biomedical research actively and also encouraging researchers to pursuit&#xD;
      incultidisciplinary collaborative research too. The clinical phenomenological study,&#xD;
      follow-up study, genetic laboratory, the neuropsychological, neurophysiological, the&#xD;
      neuroimaging technique, and statistical technology are well equipped and well developed in&#xD;
      these collaborative research centers and well mastered by these participating researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, this research center is the leading center of psychopathological study and service&#xD;
      in the area of adolescent Psychiatry. There was wide and intensive connection between this&#xD;
      research center and schools. Besides, this research center has also been involved with public&#xD;
      mental health promotion through Mental Health Foundation (MHF). These intensive connections&#xD;
      and wide resources are crucial for the successful case recruitment of ESLD targeted by this&#xD;
      SOPRES program.&#xD;
