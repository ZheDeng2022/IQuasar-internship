      The purpose of this study was to explore the quality of life and its related factors of&#xD;
      patients with major depressive disorder. This study adopted cross-sectional research design.&#xD;
      Purposive sampling was used to collect data from 120 patients came from the psychiatric&#xD;
      outpatient departments of a medical center and a psychiatric hospital in northern Taiwan.&#xD;
      Data were collected through structured questionnaires, which included：(1) demographic data&#xD;
      sheet, (2) 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5), (3) the Center For Epidemiologic&#xD;
      Studies Depression Scale(CES-D), (4) Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviors(ISSB), (5)&#xD;
      World Health Organization's Questionnaire on Quality of Life：BREF-Taiwan Version&#xD;
      100(WHOQOL-BREF). Data were analyzed by using SPSS/Windows 10.0 statistical software. The&#xD;
      descriptive statistics methods included frequency distribution, arithmetic mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, and percentage. Data were analyzed by using independent t-test, Pearson's&#xD;
      product-moment correlation, one way ANOVA and stepwise multiple regression and so on, with&#xD;
      which we can examine the demographic, degree of depression, social support and their links to&#xD;
      the quality of life. Through the research, we found out the following results：&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.The condition of major depressive disorder patients' quality of life is score range of each&#xD;
      subtitle from 4-20. A sum from the following subtitles：physical domain is 11.54,&#xD;
      psychological domain is 10.46, social domain is 11.61 and environmental domain is 12.82. The&#xD;
      quality of life results is higher of environmental domain, which is poorer of psychological&#xD;
      domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. The results of quality of life related to demographic, degree of depression, social&#xD;
      support were as followed：&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical domain：the independent variables of significant linear correlation is age, the&#xD;
           age of early-onset, type of occupation, living arrangements, economic status, health&#xD;
           status, the degree of depression and emotional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Psychological domain：the independent variables of significant linear correlation is age,&#xD;
           the age of early-onset, type of occupation, living arrangements, economic status, health&#xD;
           status, the degree of depression, the sum of social support, emotional support,&#xD;
           instrumental support, informational and appraisal support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Social domain：the independent variables of significant linear correlation is age, the&#xD;
           age of early-onset, marital status, type of occupation, economic status, health status,&#xD;
           the degree of depression, the sum of social support, emotional support, instrumental&#xD;
           support, informational and appraisal support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Environmental domain：the independent variables of significant linear correlation is age,&#xD;
           the age of early-onset, marital status, economic status, the degree of depression, the&#xD;
           sum of social support and emotional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.The best stepwise regression models of predicting major depressive disorder patients'&#xD;
      quality of life were as followed：&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical domain：the best predicting factor is the degree of depression, and accounted&#xD;
           for explained 60.30﹪of the variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Psychological domain：the best predicting factors are the degree of depression, the sum&#xD;
           of social support, the age of early-onset, age more than 71 years old, and accounted for&#xD;
           explained 76.50﹪of the variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Social domain：the best predicting factors are the degree of depression, the age of&#xD;
           early-onset, informational and appraisal support, unemployment and age more than 71&#xD;
           years old, and accounted for explained 53.80﹪of the variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Environmental domain：the best predicting factors are the degree of depression, income&#xD;
           less than one hundred thousand, income more than one hundred ten thousand and more than&#xD;
           71 years old, and accounted for explained 53.50﹪of the variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study could understand major depressive disorder patients' quality of&#xD;
      life condition and provide related research in the future, develop local data and health&#xD;
      administration reference of foundation.&#xD;
