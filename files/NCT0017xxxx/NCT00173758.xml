  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human decidual tissue appears to play an important role not only in nurturing the implanted&#xD;
      embryos, but also in preventing its rejection by the maternal immune system. Insight into the&#xD;
      maternal immunologic modulations during implantation is our main research interests. Our&#xD;
      previous studies have shown that most lymphocytes in deciduae are natural killer cells.&#xD;
      However, their phenotype is CD16-CD56+CD3-, which is different from that of peripheral&#xD;
      natural killer cells. More importantly their cytotoxic activity is decreased and they can't&#xD;
      attack the cytotrophoblasts. All of these contributes to no rejection developing at the&#xD;
      fetomaternal interface and are related to success of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1994, a new cytokine IL-15 was first discovered, which could act on the IL-15 and IL-2&#xD;
      receptors to stimulate the activation and propagation of the lymphocytes. Let us want to&#xD;
      study the critical role of IL-15 in the endometrial lymphocytes. In this study, we try to&#xD;
      analyze the distribution of IL-15 and its receptor in deciduae. We will clarify whether the&#xD;
      IL-15 receptor exists on the decidual natural killer cells and it is regulated by sexual&#xD;
      hormones or not and whether their cytotoxic activity will change after IL-15 action.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we will demonstrated whether the IL-15 receptor exists on the embryo cells and&#xD;
      IL-15 might improve the quality of the embryo. We also design a co-culture system of the&#xD;
      embryo and autologous endometrial cells to improve the success rate of in vitro&#xD;
      fertilization.&#xD;

      The expression of IL-15 and IL-15Rα in the lymphocytes of peripheral blood and decidua during&#xD;
      early pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collection of specimens Collect the peripheral blood and decidual tissue from 20-30&#xD;
           pregnant women of 6-8 weeks gestational age during D&amp;C procedure due to multiparity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immunohistochemical stain of decidual tissue The frozen section of decidual tissue was&#xD;
           performed according to recommended procedures. First antibody, mouse anti-human IL-15 or&#xD;
           IL-15Rα monoclonal antibody, second antibody, peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse&#xD;
           polyclonal antibody, and color reagents were added sequentially. Finally the slides were&#xD;
           counter-stained with hematoxylin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Separation of mononuclear cells Decidual tissue and peripheral blood samples were taken&#xD;
           from each pregnant woman at the time of abortion. In order to minimize contamination by&#xD;
           blood, the decidual tissue was macroscopically separated from the chorionic villi,&#xD;
           washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution, cut into small pieces, washed twice&#xD;
           again, and passed through a 1.9-mm mesh to remove the residual blood without enzymatic&#xD;
           treatment. These samples were then filtered through a 45.7-μm stainless steel mesh to&#xD;
           remove tissue debris. The filtered solution was layered over a Ficoll-Paque PLUS&#xD;
           gradient and centrifuged for 45 minutes at 400g. An enriched cell suspension of&#xD;
           mononuclear cells was collected at the interface and then washed twice with RPMI-1640&#xD;
           medium. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were also isolated by Ficoll-Paque PLUS&#xD;
           sedimentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cytometric analyses The expression of intracellular IL-15 and surface IL-15Rα in&#xD;
           mononuclear cells were analyzed with flow cytometry. The antibody combinations included:&#xD;
           FITC/PE/PerCP- CD4/IL-15/CD3, CD8/IL-15/CD3, CD56/IL-15/CD3, CD4/IL-15Rα/CD3,&#xD;
           CD8/IL-15Rα/CD3, CD56/IL-15Rα/CD3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Separation of CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells and NK cells The CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells and NK&#xD;
           cells in peripheral blood and deciduae were separated respectively with magnetic&#xD;
           activated cell sorter (MACS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Real-time PCR of IL-15 and IL-15Rα mRNA The total RNA in CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells and NK&#xD;
           cells was extracted with Trizol, and was transformed to cDNA with reverse transcription.&#xD;
           Real-time PCR was performed using different probes for ß-actin, IL-15 and IL-15Rα with&#xD;
           ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector System. The primer sequences were: ß-actin, 5' GTG GGG&#xD;
           CGC CCC AGG CAC CA; 5' CTC CTT AAT GTC ACG CAC GAT TTC; IL-15, 5' GGC TTT GAG TAA TGA&#xD;
           GAA TTT CGA; 5' ATC AAT TGC AAT CAA GAA GTG TTG; IL-15Rα, 5' GGC GAC GCG GGG CAT CAC; 5'&#xD;
           TCG CTG TGG CCC TGT GGA TA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Functional tests of CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells and NK cells&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Proliferative assay Using incorporation of BrdU during cellular proliferation, the&#xD;
                proliferative ability of CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells and NK cells was assessed when&#xD;
                different concentrations of IL-15 and IL-2 were added.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Secretion assay The concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-10 in the supernatant were&#xD;
                detected using ELISA kits when different concentrations of IL-15 and IL-2 were&#xD;
                added into the culture medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Fluoresence-based cellular cytotoxicity- FCC assay NK- and CTL-mediated cytolysis&#xD;
                of target cells constitutes a form of apoptosis, and is accompanied by many of the&#xD;
                same events, including caspase activation. We incorporated the fluorogenic&#xD;
                substrate for caspase 6 into the target cells (K562 cells and autologous&#xD;
                cytotrophoblasts) and measured the caspase activation by detecting the fluorescence&#xD;
                emitted from the cleaved substrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expression of IL-15 and IL-15Rα in the human embryo before and after co-cultured with&#xD;
      autologous endometrium&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Immunocytochemical stain of human embryo Human embryos from IVF program were fixed on&#xD;
           the adhesion slide with ice-cold Fixation Buffer. The phycoerythrin-conjugated&#xD;
           anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody or biotinylated anti-human IL-15Rα antibody and&#xD;
           streptavidin- fluorescein isothiocyanate (SAv-FITC) Conjugate were added. The&#xD;
           fluoroscope was used to detect the fluorescence emitted from the targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Single-cell PCR of IL-15 and IL-15Rα mRNA Using the principle of biotin/streptavidin&#xD;
           &quot;capture&quot;, the embryo mRNA was isolated with Micro RNA Isolation Kit, labeled with&#xD;
           biotin-labeled oligo dT-probe and extracted with streptavidin-coated tubes. After&#xD;
           transforming to cDNA, real-time PCR was performed using different probes for ß-actin,&#xD;
           IL-15 and IL-15Rα with ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector System, as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Separation of autologous endometrial cells A luteal phase endometrial biopsy was&#xD;
           performed in a cycle before the patient's IVF procedure with a Pipelle Endometrial&#xD;
           Suction Curette. The tissue was digested with 0.2% collagenase type 2 and allowed to&#xD;
           settle by differential sedimentation at unit gravity. The above steps were repeated four&#xD;
           times and the supernatant was collected. After differential sedimentation at unit&#xD;
           gravity, the supernatant, containing the stroma-enriched fraction, was transferred into&#xD;
           tissue culture flasks for future use. The tissue pieces, which remained after the four&#xD;
           digests, were resuspended in 10 mL HBSS. After approximately 30 seconds, the top 8 mL&#xD;
           was allowed to settle at unit gravity. This sedimentation, containing glandular-enriched&#xD;
           fraction, was resuspended in RPMI and plated into tissue culture flasks for future&#xD;
           co-culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Autologous endometrial co-culture of human embryo Approximately an equal amount of the&#xD;
           glandular and stromal cells were mixed on the estimated day before the administration of&#xD;
           hCG during the patient's IVF cycle. About 3x10^5 cells were seeded into a four-well&#xD;
           tissue culture plate and the zygotes were placed into the co-culture system or&#xD;
           conventional medium (human tubal fluid plus 15% maternal serum). Cleavage rates and&#xD;
           morphological appearance were assessed daily. The morphologically best embryos were&#xD;
           transferred back to the patient 72 hours after retrieval irrespective of culture system.&#xD;
           The implantation rate was defined as the number of intrauterine sacs with fetal cardiac&#xD;
           activity per number of embryos transferred. Clinical pregnancies included only those&#xD;
           pregnancies with a fetal heart beat documented on transvaginal ultrasound by day 49.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The cytokine distribution in co-culture medium The cytokines, including Th1 cytokines&#xD;
           (IL-2 and IFN-γ), Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) and IL-15 were determined by&#xD;
           ELISA technique in the co-culture medium before and after embryos plated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Immunocytochemical stain of human endometrial glandular and stromal cells The purified&#xD;
           endometrial glandular and stromal cells were washed twice with cold Wash Buffer to&#xD;
           remove the cytokines adherent on the cells. These cells were then fixed on the adhesion&#xD;
           slide with ice-cold Fixation Buffer. The phyco- erythrin-conjugated anti-IL-15&#xD;
           monoclonal antibody or biotinylated anti-human IL-15Rα antibody and&#xD;
           streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (SAv-FITC) Conjugate were added. The fluoroscope&#xD;
           was used to detect the fluorescence emitted from the targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Real-time PCR of IL-15 and IL-15Rα mRNA from human endometrial glandular and stromal&#xD;
           cells The total RNA in endometrial glandular and stromal cells was extracted with&#xD;
           Trizol, and transformed to cDNA with reverse transcription. Real-time PCR was performed&#xD;
           using different probes for ß-actin, IL-15 and IL-15Rα with ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence&#xD;
           Detector System, as described above.&#xD;
