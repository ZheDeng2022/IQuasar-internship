  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Video Laryngoscope (VL) is a useful&#xD;
      instrument in patients at risk for difficult intubation. We will compare this device to the&#xD;
      traditional Macintosh Laryngoscope.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements made to the traditional laryngoscope blade since its invention,&#xD;
      occasionally intubation of the trachea cannot be accomplished with facility, even in patients&#xD;
      with anatomy that does not predict difficult intubation. It is estimated that endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation is performed on some 8 million patients per year in the United States. Of these&#xD;
      endotracheal intubations, approximately 80% are performed by direct laryngoscopy with&#xD;
      transoral placement of the endotracheal tube (ET) into the trachea. There is fairly uniform&#xD;
      reporting of the incidence of failed intubation in the literature; it occurs in approximately&#xD;
      0.05% or 1:2230 of surgical patients and in approximately 0.13% to 0.35%, or 1:750 to 1:280,&#xD;
      of the obstetric patients. The incidence of unsuspected difficult intubation is estimated to&#xD;
      be higher at 3%. One factor that contributes to difficult intubation is poor visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VL is designed to optimize visualization by presenting to the operator an enlarged video&#xD;
      image of airway structures. In contrast, using conventional laryngoscopy, anesthesiologists&#xD;
      have only a &quot;keyhole&quot; view of the airway structures; a view that may be further obscured&#xD;
      during attempts to pass the ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VL consists of a laryngoscope handle and Macintosh blade that have been modified to&#xD;
      provide a video image of airway structures on a screen, which can be conveniently located&#xD;
      directly in front of the anesthesiologist. A micro video module is contained in the modified&#xD;
      handle. An image/light bundle is introduced into the standard blade. This system has been&#xD;
      previously tested in which the consensus was that the device is extremely easy to learn to&#xD;
      use because most anesthesiologists are familiar with the use of the Macintosh blade. It has&#xD;
      also been useful in the instruction of laryngoscopy by non-anesthesiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several potential advantages of a video image in the context of direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy. The system provides high quality video images that are enlarged on the video&#xD;
      monitor for easier visualization. If laryngeal manipulation is required to improve&#xD;
      visualization of laryngeal structures, the intubator and the person assisting can coordinate&#xD;
      movements as they observe, simultaneously, the image on the video monitor. With the video&#xD;
      image projected from the distal end of the laryngoscope blade, laryngeal structures are kept&#xD;
      in view as the ET is passed through the oropharynx into the trachea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: Video Laryngoscope as a conduit for possible difficult intubation compared to the&#xD;
      traditional Macintosh blade.&#xD;
