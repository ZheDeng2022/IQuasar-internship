      The purpose of this study is to study the effects of EARLY (no more than 24 four hours from&#xD;
      injury) administration of extra amounts of oxygen on traumatic brain injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain injury continues to be a major cause of death and disability throughout the world. Our&#xD;
      investigations of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) indicate that it is a relatively safe&#xD;
      treatment that has promise as a potential therapy for patients with severe traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury (TBI). The goals of the present proposal are to further elucidate the mechanisms of&#xD;
      action of HBOT on severe TBI and to test hypotheses that are crucial to the possible future&#xD;
      design of a Phase III clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our initial prospective clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of HBOT in severe TBI&#xD;
      documented very significant improvement in survival, particularly in certain subgroups of&#xD;
      patients. In our second study, HBOT was found to improve cerebral aerobic metabolism in&#xD;
      patients with severe TBI, reduce elevated intracranial pressure, and had a persistent&#xD;
      positive effect for at least six hours following the treatment. Our work suggests that HBOT&#xD;
      allows the brain to utilize increased amounts of oxygen more efficiently following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, increasing the inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) to 100% has been proposed as an&#xD;
      alternative way of delivering supranormal levels of oxygen to severe TBI patients.&#xD;
      Experimental investigation in the fluid percussion rat model using HBOT at 1.5 ATA&#xD;
      (atmospheres absolute) for 60 minutes followed by 3 hours of 100%fraction of inspired oxygen&#xD;
      (FiO2) have given optimum results in terms of mitochondrial functional and neurobehavioral&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical and experimental data together provide a strong basis for the restorative effect&#xD;
      of the combination of hyper- and normobaric hyperoxia on severe TBI. The goal of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the use of HBOT and 100% FiO2 separately and in combination.&#xD;
