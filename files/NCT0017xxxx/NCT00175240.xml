  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with coronary artery disease can reduce their chance of having a heart attack by&#xD;
      making healthy lifestyle choices (diet, exercise, quitting smoking,etc.). There are also many&#xD;
      medications that have been proven to reduce the risk of heart attacks and may even help&#xD;
      people live longer. This study will look at different ways of improving the use of these&#xD;
      beneficial medications to enhance the quality of care for people with this condition.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Despite the abundant evidence base for secondary prevention, practice audits&#xD;
      consistently demonstrate substantial &quot;care gaps&quot; between this evidence and clinical reality&#xD;
      such that many patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) are not offered all possible&#xD;
      therapies for the prevention of myocardial infarction or death. For example, even after an&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction, almost one fifth of patients continue to smoke; over half with&#xD;
      hypertension or hyperlipidemia have poorly controlled pressure or lipid levels; and proven&#xD;
      therapies such as statins, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and antiplatelet agents are&#xD;
      under-prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple barriers are often responsible for the lack of implementation of proven efficacious&#xD;
      therapies and traditional means of educating practitioners (journal articles, CME,&#xD;
      conferences, etc) are usually ineffective in altering practice. Clearly novel interventions&#xD;
      to improve the quality of prescribing are needed. Local opinion leaders are trusted by their&#xD;
      peers to evaluate medical innovations and thus influence practice patterns within their&#xD;
      community. Few controlled studies, however, have evaluated their effect on changing&#xD;
      prescribing practices for common conditions such as CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: This trial will test 2 quality improvement interventions. The principle&#xD;
      hypothesis is: does a one-page evidence summary endorsed by local opinion leaders increase&#xD;
      the provision of secondary prevention therapies in patients with CAD compared to usual care?&#xD;
      The secondary hypotheses are: does the same intervention but without local opinion leader&#xD;
      endorsement improve the provision of secondary prevention strategies in patients with CAD&#xD;
      compared to usual care? Does local opinion leader endorsement increase the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the quality improvement intervention?&#xD;
