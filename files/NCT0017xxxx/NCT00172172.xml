      This study is evaluating the effects of calcium supplementation on the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      recombinant parathyroid hormone (ALX1-11) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this clinical study is to evaluate whether increases in bone mineral&#xD;
      density (BMD) for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving no calcium supplementation are&#xD;
      less than increases in BMD observed for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving calcium&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effects of ALX1-11 on bone mineral density (BMD) have been documented in a dose-finding Phase&#xD;
      II clinical trial in osteoporotic postmenopausal women, supplemented with calcium and Vitamin&#xD;
      D3 but without any other treatment for osteoporosis. The anabolic effects of ALX1-11 in the&#xD;
      lumbar vertebrae were statistically significant after the 12-month treatment period and more&#xD;
      pronounced than any approved therapy. Additionally, animal studies have shown that the new&#xD;
      bone formed by treatment with ALX1 11 is of good quality both histologically and&#xD;
      biomechanically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to evaluate whether increases in bone mineral&#xD;
      density (BMD) for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving no calcium supplementation are&#xD;
      less than increases in BMD observed for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving calcium&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective of this clinical study are to evaluate whether changes in other&#xD;
      efficacy parameters, such as bone mineral content (BMC) and biochemical markers of bone&#xD;
      turnover, for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving no calcium supplementation are less&#xD;
      than increases observed for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving calcium&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, multi-centered, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study&#xD;
      comprised of 3 treatment groups: ALX1-11 injection plus oral calcium, ALX1-11 injection plus&#xD;
      oral placebo calcium, and placebo ALX1-11 injection plus oral calcium. All subjects also&#xD;
      receive 400 IU oral vitamin D3. The dose of ALX1-11 to be used in this study is 100 Î¼g, self&#xD;
      administered by daily sc injection. The calcium dose is 700 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional supplemental calcium and/or Vitamin D3 will not be permitted. Patients will be&#xD;
      monitored for the development of hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria.&#xD;

                       for the patient. The patient must have a TSH and thyroxine level within 3&#xD;
                       months of the dose change to ensure that the patient does not become&#xD;
                       hyperthyroid, or hypothyroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Thiazide (Stable dosage of thiazide for &gt;=3 consecutive months)&#xD;
&#xD;
             All patients must stop the following therapies at least 4 weeks before starting the&#xD;
             stabilization period and will remain off these therapies for the remainder of the&#xD;
             clinical study. The informed consent must be signed prior to the washout of any&#xD;
             therapy. Screening laboratories must be performed only after the washout is complete.&#xD;
             However, imaging studies (BMD, X-rays) may be performed prior to starting the&#xD;
             calcitonin, estrogen, or Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulation (SERM) washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Â· Calcitonin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Estrogen replacement therapy by oral, transdermal, or intramuscular&#xD;

                  estradiol: &lt;=0.5 g twice each week [total of 1.0 g weekly] this medication is&#xD;
                  allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  SERM drugs, e.g., tamoxifen, raloxifene, Evista&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cytostatics, e.g., azathioprine, recombinant human tumor necrosis fusion (Fc)&#xD;
                  protein, monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor (e.g., remicade&#xD;
                  [infliximab]&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medication known to affect the metabolism of bone (the Principal Investigator&#xD;
                  should discuss this with the PMO before the patient is excluded from enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
             E. Miscellaneous Concurrent Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
             Â· Methotrexate,which interferes with DNA synthesis, repair and cellular replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Â· Immunomodulatory agents with antiproliferative activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Â· Intra-articular injections&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Patients may receive a maximum of 1 intra-articular injection (ONE JOINT ONLY) every&#xD;
             6 months while participating in this study. The dose of corticosteroid injected should&#xD;
             not exceed the anti-inflammatory equivalent dose of Prednisone 40-mg suspension. The&#xD;
             dose and volume should be adjusted downward as appropriate to the size of the joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
             F. Laboratory Values and Physical Examination Findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -For laboratory values, the levels shown below are the upper limits for exclusions&#xD;
             based on specific test results. For weight, the limit is the lower limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Â· Serum calcium &gt;10.7 mg/dL (&gt;2.67 mmol/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Â· Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL (132.6 Âµmol/L)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total serum alkaline phosphatase &gt;130 U/L (Serum total alkaline phosphatase value&#xD;
                  given is for the U.S.; &gt;311 U/L (Argentina), &gt;159 U/L (Mexico).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Body weight &lt;40 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
             G. Substance Abuse:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Â· Subjects are excluded for a history of alcohol and/or drug abuse as determined by&#xD;

&#xD;
             H. Compliance:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects are excluded if they exhibit suspected or confirmed poor compliance in&#xD;
