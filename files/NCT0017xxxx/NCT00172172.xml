      This study is evaluating the effects of calcium supplementation on the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      recombinant parathyroid hormone (ALX1-11) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this clinical study is to evaluate whether increases in bone mineral&#xD;
      density (BMD) for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving no calcium supplementation are&#xD;
      less than increases in BMD observed for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving calcium&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effects of ALX1-11 on bone mineral density (BMD) have been documented in a dose-finding Phase&#xD;
      II clinical trial in osteoporotic postmenopausal women, supplemented with calcium and Vitamin&#xD;
      D3 but without any other treatment for osteoporosis. The anabolic effects of ALX1-11 in the&#xD;
      lumbar vertebrae were statistically significant after the 12-month treatment period and more&#xD;
      pronounced than any approved therapy. Additionally, animal studies have shown that the new&#xD;
      bone formed by treatment with ALX1 11 is of good quality both histologically and&#xD;
      biomechanically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to evaluate whether increases in bone mineral&#xD;
      density (BMD) for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving no calcium supplementation are&#xD;
      less than increases in BMD observed for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving calcium&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective of this clinical study are to evaluate whether changes in other&#xD;
      efficacy parameters, such as bone mineral content (BMC) and biochemical markers of bone&#xD;
      turnover, for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving no calcium supplementation are less&#xD;
      than increases observed for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving calcium&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, multi-centered, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study&#xD;
      comprised of 3 treatment groups: ALX1-11 injection plus oral calcium, ALX1-11 injection plus&#xD;
      oral placebo calcium, and placebo ALX1-11 injection plus oral calcium. All subjects also&#xD;
      receive 400 IU oral vitamin D3. The dose of ALX1-11 to be used in this study is 100 μg, self&#xD;
      administered by daily sc injection. The calcium dose is 700 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional supplemental calcium and/or Vitamin D3 will not be permitted. Patients will be&#xD;
      monitored for the development of hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria.&#xD;

             therapy. Screening laboratories must be performed only after the washout is complete.&#xD;
             However, imaging studies (BMD, X-rays) may be performed prior to starting the&#xD;
             calcitonin, estrogen, or Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulation (SERM) washout.&#xD;

             · Methotrexate,which interferes with DNA synthesis, repair and cellular replication.&#xD;

&#xD;
             · Intra-articular injections&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Patients may receive a maximum of 1 intra-articular injection (ONE JOINT ONLY) every&#xD;
             6 months while participating in this study. The dose of corticosteroid injected should&#xD;
             not exceed the anti-inflammatory equivalent dose of Prednisone 40-mg suspension. The&#xD;
             dose and volume should be adjusted downward as appropriate to the size of the joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
             F. Laboratory Values and Physical Examination Findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -For laboratory values, the levels shown below are the upper limits for exclusions&#xD;
