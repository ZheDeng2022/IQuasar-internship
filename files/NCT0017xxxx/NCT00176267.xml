    <textblock>
      This study is being performed utilizing two cycles of Paclitaxel and Carboplatin, plus low&#xD;
      doses radiation as initial therapy prior to other treatment (surgery or radiation). The study&#xD;
      is assessing if utilization of low doses radiation as a chemoenhancer will further increase&#xD;
      the response rate seen with initial therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell cancers of the head and neck (SCCHN) comprise 5% of all cancers, with 40,000&#xD;
      new cases diagnosed annually. Surgery followed by irradiation or irradiation alone has been&#xD;
      the standard of care for locally advanced Stage III and IV patients. With this approach,&#xD;
      fewer than 30% of patients achieve long-term remission, and most recur locoregionally.&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been administered prior to definitive therapy with response&#xD;
      rates ranging from 60-90%, with pathologic CR rates documented in 30-70% of clinical&#xD;
      responders. However, large randomized trials have shown no improvement in overall survival.&#xD;
      Because induction chemotherapy alone does not appear to improve long-term disease free&#xD;
      survival in advanced head and neck cancers, concomitant chemotherapy and radiation has been&#xD;
      pursued in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers. The concept of synergy&#xD;
      between radiation and chemotherapy is well established in vitro. Various schedules of&#xD;
      radiation and chemotherapy have been utilized including weekly chemotherapy during radiation,&#xD;
      chemotherapy given every three weeks during radiation and alternating chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One novel approach to capitalizes on the synergy between radiation and chemotherapy is the&#xD;
      use of low doses fractionated radiation (LDFRT) as a chemotherapy enhancer. In vitro data&#xD;
      suggests that LDFRT enhances the response of both p53 wild type and p53 mutant cancer cell&#xD;
      lines to chemotherapy. Not only was the cell death fraction increased, but there was no&#xD;
      development of radioresistance in the cell lines studies when low doses of radiation were&#xD;
      utilized. This strategy was translated into a clinical trial using four 80-cGy fractions of&#xD;
      radiation with Carboplatin and Paclitaxel. Preliminary results have produced an impressive&#xD;
      85% response rate and this neoadjuvant regimen was safe and easy to deliver in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced SCCHN patients. In recently published work by Belani, a regimen using&#xD;
      Carboplatin every four weeks combined with weekly Paclitaxel improved response rates in&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. The delivery of chemotherapy on a weekly schedule would be of&#xD;
      particular benefit when adding LDFRT, because tumor cells could be exposed to LDFRT on&#xD;
      multiple occasions per cycle of induction therapy, without the theoretic development of&#xD;
      radioresistance. We propose to expand our understanding of LDFRT and chemotherapy by using&#xD;
      two cycles of Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in a modification of the Belani regimen, plus LDFRT&#xD;
      as induction therapy prior to definitive treatment (surgery or radiation). It is hoped that&#xD;
      using LDFRT as a chemoenhancer will further increase the response rate seen with induction&#xD;
      therapy in this population of patients.&#xD;
