      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy of two brands of nifedipine 30mg in patients&#xD;
           with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of 8 weeks of therapy with two brands of nifedipine 30mg in&#xD;
           patients with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study flow-mediated dilatation and oxidative stress in nonsmoker with essential&#xD;
           hypertension but without diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Head-to-head, randomized and parallel design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 60 patients with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of hypertension will&#xD;
           provide 30 available patients in each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The drugs and dosage will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: nifedipine 30-60mg once daily (Nifecardia, CCPC) Group B: nifedipine 30-60 mg once&#xD;
      daily (Adalat OROS, Bayer)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After washout period, the eligible patients will randomly be allocated to receive two brands&#xD;
      of nifedipine 30 mg once daily. Each patient will receive two times of ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement (ABPM) at both entrance and final stages of the study. The patients will&#xD;
      also undergo complete clinical evaluation. Therapy dosage will be started at a dose of&#xD;
      nifedipine 30 mg once daily. Dosage will be adjusted if systolic blood pressure greater than&#xD;
      140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg by office measurement after 4 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment. Nifedipine will be increased to 60 mg once daily. The Ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
      measurement will be set to take reading at 1-hour intervals during the 24 hours assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination included the measurement of heart rate and blood pressure. The value&#xD;
      will be read on Visit 1 and 3-12 hours after the last dose of nifedipine. Routine laboratory&#xD;
      test includes hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis. Hematology test and fasting blood&#xD;
      chemistry test will be measured immediately before the start of treatment and after 8 weeks'&#xD;
      treatment or at time of discontinuation. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in&#xD;
      patient plasma were measured for oxidative stress and endothelium-dependent flow-mediated&#xD;
      vasodilation will also be evaluated. Possible concomitant medication will remain constant&#xD;
      throughout the study. The physician will question the patients as to their compliance at each&#xD;
      visit. If compliance dose not reach 80%, the subject will be dropped out.&#xD;

      1. Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nifedipine is one of the first calcium-channel blockers that are widely used in the treatment&#xD;
      of hypertension. Because of its long-term application experience and safety profile,&#xD;
      traditional nifedipine has been remodeled as a sustained released formulary of Nifecardia&#xD;
      SRFC. Nifecardia SRFC is a new formulary designed of zero-order kinetic release system that&#xD;
      maintain a constant plasma concentration of nifedipine and achieve the target of once daily&#xD;
      application. Nifecardia SRFC is bioequivalence in efficacy with that of Adalat OROS which is&#xD;
      also a sustained released type of calcium-channel blockers. In this study, the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety profile of Nifecardia SRFC and Adalat OROS will be evaluated with randomized&#xD;
      head-to-head design to treat the patients with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy of two brands of nifedipine (30mg) in patients&#xD;
           with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the safety of 8 weeks of therapy with two brands of nifedipine (30mg) in&#xD;
           patients with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study flow-mediated dilatation and oxidative stress in nonsmoker with essential&#xD;
           hypertension but without diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia.&#xD;

      visit. If compliance dose not reach 80%, the subject will be dropped out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of a subject is based on the following three assessments: (1) not compliant with&#xD;
      study protocol, (2) occurrence of severe symptoms or complications, (3) unacceptable side&#xD;
      effects with the study drug.&#xD;
