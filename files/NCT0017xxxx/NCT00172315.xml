  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is commonly applied in medicine with 1H proton or&#xD;
      31-phosphorus spectra. The proton MRS is often used in evaluating the central nervous system&#xD;
      and 31P MRS is used in muscular diseases or neoplasms. However, the proton MRS is also&#xD;
      considered to be applied to the musculoskeletal system because of its profound amount of&#xD;
      protons. Ballon used the STEAM technique, and Schick used the PRESS technique, to investigate&#xD;
      the lipid and water spectra of the bone marrow and also correlated those with hematological&#xD;
      diseases and post-treatment effects. Schellinger et al. used the STEAM sequence to calculate&#xD;
      the lipid content of the vertebral bone marrow and found that it was influenced according to&#xD;
      age and sex. The investigator had used the proton MRS to evaluate the lipid and water spectra&#xD;
      of the femoral head and revealed its significance in predicting avascular necrosis of the&#xD;
      femoral head. According to the above research literature, the investigators considered&#xD;
      further investigation of the proton MRS in evaluating the musculoskeletal system.&#xD;
