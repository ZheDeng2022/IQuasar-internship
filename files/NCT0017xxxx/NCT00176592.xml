      This is the first comparison of efficacy of Betaseron and Copaxone for treatment of relapsing&#xD;
      forms of MS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to perform a head to head comparison of Interferon beta and Copaxone for treatment&#xD;
      of patients with CIS and RR forms of MS using acute changes on MRI as primary outcome. The&#xD;
      study will be performed at the two clinical practice sites of the Multiple Sclerosis Center&#xD;
      at University of Medicine and Dentistry New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School, One of the two&#xD;
      FDA approved preparations of higher dose interferon beta (Betaseron) will be compared at&#xD;
      standard dose every other day (QOD) 250 ug subcutaneously(SQ) with Copaxone at 20mg SQ daily&#xD;
      (QD) in 70 to 80 patients. Although the current approved plan is to perform monthly MRIs for&#xD;
      1 year followed by another MRI at 2 years, the protocol has been changed to continue&#xD;
      performing monthly MRIs during the second year of the study for all patients who complete&#xD;
      their first year and up to January 31, 2006 when the study will end. The study uses brain&#xD;
      imaging with 3 Tesla MRI with triple dose Gadolinium for primary and secondary outcomes and&#xD;
      several clinical and cognitive measures for secondary outcomes. The sample size was estimated&#xD;
      to detect a 40-50% difference in the number of active MS lesions by MRI between the two arms&#xD;
      at 1 year follow up, consistent with the primary outcome measure. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      is the number of &quot;combined-active&quot; lesions by monthly MRI at the conclusion of the study,&#xD;
      which includes contrast enhancing lesions and non-enhancing lesions on long Time repetition&#xD;
      (TR) scans that have appeared since the most recent examination. Several secondary MRI&#xD;
      outcome measures are studied in addition to the number of enhancing lesions and the number of&#xD;
      new lesions on long TR images. We will examine the number of patients who remain&#xD;
      &quot;combined-active disease-free&quot; for the duration of the study and the number of&#xD;
      &quot;combined-active disease-free&quot; scans. Apart from these traditional methods of analysis by a&#xD;
      reader who will be blinded to patient clinical status and therapy, objective volumetric&#xD;
      analysis will be carried out. Making use of both automated and manual techniques, we will&#xD;
      determine the overall burden of disease (the volume of lesions on long TR scans), the burden&#xD;
      of active disease (the volume of brain enhancement) and the burden of chronic disease (the&#xD;
      volume of lesions that are markedly hypointense on T1). Another MRI outcome measures will be&#xD;
      detection of diffusion anisotropy differences, MR spectroscopy, and magnetization transfer&#xD;
      ratio as summarized in Appendix 5. These new techniques have shown promise for detecting&#xD;
      disease that cannot be detected with conventional MRI (13, 37).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to MRI, several clinical and cognitive outcome measures will be used for&#xD;
      secondary analysis. These include the number and severity of relapses measured by different&#xD;
      methods, and change in disability measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS),&#xD;
      the Neurological Rating Scale, and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC). The&#xD;
      cognitive measures will be the subject's neurocognitive function measured by standard&#xD;
      neurocognitive examination obtained by a licensed neuropsychologist and the Cognitive&#xD;
      Stability Index (CSI), a novel Internet-based test of cognitive function in addition to the&#xD;
      Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),which is a component of the MSFC.&#xD;
