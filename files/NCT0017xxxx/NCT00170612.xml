  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is the most common reason for admission of Fijian children to hospitals. The most&#xD;
      common germ causing pneumonia is &quot;streptococcus pneumoniae.&quot; It is a common cause of&#xD;
      meningitis (infection around the brain and spinal cord), ear infections, and blood infections&#xD;
      and it lives in the nose of humans. A vaccine has been developed that will help prevent these&#xD;
      common diseases but prevents only about one quarter of pneumonia cases and it is expensive.&#xD;
      This study explores new ways of giving this vaccine that are affordable, safe, and effective&#xD;
      in countries such as Fiji. About 550 Fijian infants presenting at 6 weeks of age, for their&#xD;
      first diptheria, tetanus, toxoid, pertussis vaccine immunization, to one of the participating&#xD;
      Health Centers or Colonial War Memorial Hospital in urban Suva, Fiji will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Children will remain in the study for 2 years. Study procedures include full vaccination&#xD;
      against 7 types of pneumococcus, blood tests, and nasal swabs.&#xD;

      This research project began as a study of alternative strategies for Pnc (Pneumococcus)&#xD;
      immunization for children in developing countries. In the original study, infants presenting&#xD;
      to a health center in urban Fiji were randomized to receive 1, 2, or 3 doses of PCV (Prevnar)&#xD;
      followed by a dose of 23-valent PPS (Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine) at 6 or 9 months of&#xD;
      age. The regimens were compared with each other and with 2 control groups with respect to&#xD;
      immunogenicity, impact on carriage of vaccine type Pnc, and response to a small dose of PPS&#xD;
      at 15 months of age. After the trial was underway and 228 infants had been recruited,&#xD;
      concerns were raised about the safety of PPS in infancy. Specifically concerns were raised&#xD;
      that it might result in later immunological hyporesponsiveness in some of the recipients, to&#xD;
      some of the serotypes. After a thorough review it was decided to proceed with the study, but&#xD;
      to modify it so that it addressed directly the issue of potential hyporesponsiveness, while&#xD;
      not giving PPS to any children under 12 months of age. This protocol represents the&#xD;
      completion of the study with the new design for the children already enrolled, and a new&#xD;
      design for a further cohort of children who will be enrolled. The newly designed trial will&#xD;
      be a single blind, open-label, randomized, controlled trial of 550 healthy infants. Infants&#xD;
      will be randomized to 1 of 8 equal groups to receive 0, 1, 2, or 3 doses of PCV (Pneumococcal&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine), with or without a booster of PPS at 12 months of age. Two control groups&#xD;
      will be recruited, 1 will receive no PCV in infancy and the other will receive a dose of PPS&#xD;
      at 12 months of age. At 18 months of age, all infants will receive a 20 percent dose of PPS&#xD;
      to stimulate and allow the assessment of immunological memory. At 2 years of age, any child&#xD;
      who has received no or one dose of PCV (Groups E, F, G and H) will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      PCV. Blood samples will be taken at 18 weeks age, 12 months of age, before the 18 months dose&#xD;
      and 4 weeks later. In addition half of the children will have a blood sample taken at 9&#xD;
      months and the other half will have a sample taken 2 weeks after their 12 month dose of PPS.&#xD;
      The 9- and 12-month blood sample will assess the long-term persistence of circulating&#xD;
      antibody and avidity maturation following a 1, 2, or 3 dose primary series of PCV. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to demonstrate noninferiority at 19 months of age, of those groups&#xD;
      receiving PPS at 12 months and those who do not with respect to the proportion of children in&#xD;
      each group, with a satisfactory immune response at 19 months of age, measured by OPA to each&#xD;
      of the 11 serotypes included in the PPS for which an OPA has been developed. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to assess the immunogenicity and impact on carriage of various Pnc vaccination&#xD;
      regimens that combine 1 to 3 doses of PCV with a dose of PPS, concerns regarding the&#xD;
      potential for the development of hyporesponsiveness. Endpoints to be evaluated will include&#xD;
      serotype specific immunoglobulin G antibody measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to&#xD;
      the 23 serotypes in the PPS, avidity assays to the same serotypes, opsonophagocytic assays to&#xD;
      the 11 serotypes for which these assays are currently available, and Pnc carriage by&#xD;
      serotype. With hyporesponsiveness as the primary endpoint of interest a scheme of analysis&#xD;
      has been proposed which will require a minimum sample size of 500.&#xD;
