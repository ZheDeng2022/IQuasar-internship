  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorders are common in patients with end-stage renal disease on both hemodialysis and&#xD;
      peritoneal dialysis and are associated with significant medical, psychological and social&#xD;
      disturbances. Numerous factors have been suggested as contributing to or associated with the&#xD;
      high prevalence of sleep disturbance in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing evidence suggests that cytokines are involved in the regulation of sleep and&#xD;
      wakefulness and that the communication between the sleep and the immune system is&#xD;
      bi-directional. Blood-dialyzer or peritoneum-dialysate interaction during dialysis therapy&#xD;
      has the potential to activate mononuclear cells leading to production of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines. These cytokines are believed to play a significant role in dialysis-associated&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, a cytokine overproduction may alter sleep pattern in&#xD;
      chronic dialyzed patients, thus explaining the presence of sleep disorders in these patients.&#xD;
      In the other way, sleep loss may have effects on immune process and secretion of cytokines in&#xD;
      chronic dialyzed patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between&#xD;
      quality of sleep and serum cytokine levels in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients.&#xD;
