      In order to increase our understanding about the pathogenic mechanism and the strategy of&#xD;
      treatment in the subtypes of Guillain Barré syndrome, we will check the temporal changes of&#xD;
      cytokines with different biological activities in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), check&#xD;
      the titer of various anti-ganglioside antibodies, perform skin biopsy and correlate these&#xD;
      data with the clinical findings such as severity and prognosis&#xD;

      In the past the nerve system has long been regarded as a privileged site of immune system due&#xD;
      to (1) the absence of lymphatic drainage, which limits the immunological circulation; (2) the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) or blood-nerve barrier (BNB), which limits the passage of immune&#xD;
      cells and factors; (3) the low level of expression of MHC factors, particularly MHC II, in&#xD;
      the resident cells of the nerve system and the lack of potent antigen presenting cells, such&#xD;
      as dendritic or Langerhans' cells, both of which lead to reduced recognition of the neurons&#xD;
      or nerves by the immune system; and (4) the presence of immunosuppressive factors such as&#xD;
      TGF-b. which suppress the immune response in the nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However in the past few years, the concept of privilege is revised, that is the differences&#xD;
      in the immunological aspects between the nervous system and other organs are more&#xD;
      quantitative than absolutely qualitative. Several lines of evidence indicate that BBB and BNB&#xD;
      are not complete both anatomically and functionally and activated T cells can cross these&#xD;
      barriers and traffic in and out the nervous system. The nervous system also contains a&#xD;
      collection of immunologically resident cells, including professional or non-professional&#xD;
      antigen presenting cells such as resident endoneurial or perivascular macrophage, glial&#xD;
      cells, Schwann cells and endoneurial capillary endothelial cells, which are capable of&#xD;
      synthesizing cytokines that were initially classified within the domain of the immune system&#xD;
      and are found to express a range of appropriate specific receptors, both characteristics&#xD;
      mediate the immunological processes in the nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nerve system is therefore a target of immune attacks. Many disorders of the central or&#xD;
      peripheral nerve system are related to activation of the immune system. Immune mechanisms&#xD;
      seem important in the pathogenesis and treatments of these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokines are a diverse group of soluble proteins and peptides which act as humoral&#xD;
      regulators and modulate the activities of individual cells and tissues either under normal or&#xD;
      pathological condition. Unlike the hormone, cytokines are usually made by more than one type&#xD;
      of cells, have multiple target cells and multiple actions, and usually function in short&#xD;
      acting radius. Constitutive cytokine production is usually low or absent and its production&#xD;
      is promoted by certain stimuli at the transcription and translation level. The functions of&#xD;
      cytokine are pleitropic and redundant. In embryogenesis and organ development, it acts as a&#xD;
      regulator of miosis, differentiation, migration, cell growth and cell death; and in host&#xD;
      defense response to infection, inflammation, autoimmune, trauma and metabolic injury, it not&#xD;
      only stimulate immune cells to proliferate and differentiate but also regulate the&#xD;
      progression and termination of immunological reaction. Some cytokines that make the&#xD;
      inflammation progress are referred as pro-inflammatory cytokines. The major pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines that are responsible for early responses are IL1, IL6, and TNF-alpha. Other&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory mediators include IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, GM-CSF, IL11, IL12, IL17, IL18, IL8&#xD;
      and a variety of other chemokines that chemoattract inflammatory cells. When these cytokines&#xD;
      are produced or administered into human, they induce destruction of tissues, up-regulation of&#xD;
      the synthesis of other pro-inflammatory cytokines by various immunological cells, and&#xD;
      induction of systemic inflammatory reaction like fever and shock. Another immunoregulatory&#xD;
      cytokines that counteract the inflammation or the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      are referred as anti-inflammatory cytokines. These mediators act mainly by the inhibiting the&#xD;
      production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or by counteracting many biological effects of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory mediators and thus contribute to the control of the inflammatory responses.&#xD;
      The major anti-inflammatory cytokines are IL4, IL10, and IL13. Other anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators are IL16, IFN-alpha, TGF-beta, G-CSF, as well as soluble receptors for TNF or IL6.&#xD;
      It is supposed that the balance between pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines determines the net effect of an inflammatory response. In addition, cytokine&#xD;
      responses are regulated by special subpopulations of CD4 (+) T-cells, called helper T cell.&#xD;
      They provide help to other cells of the immune system in mounting immune responses by causing&#xD;
      cell activation or the secretion of cytokines. Th1 cells stimulate strong cellular immunity&#xD;
      but only weak and transient antibody responses. These cells produce a number of cytokines&#xD;
      known asTh1 cytokines and including IL2, IFN-gamma, IL12 and TNF-beta. In contrast Th2 cells&#xD;
      evoke strong antibody responses but relatively weak cellular activity. These cells produce&#xD;
      cytokines that are known as Th2 cytokines and include IL4, IL5, IL6, IL10, and IL13. Th1 and&#xD;
      Th2 cells can keep each other in check and prevent inflammatory reactions in response to&#xD;
      pathogens getting out of control. However, imbalances may also precipitate inappropriate&#xD;
      reactions. It is thought that some autoimmune disorders and allergies may be related to&#xD;
      overactive Th1 or Th2 responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is clinically defined as an acute peripheral neuropathy over a&#xD;
      time period of days or, at the most, up to 4 weeks. GBS may not be a single disease, but a&#xD;
      variety of acute neuropathies with different clinical and electrophysiological&#xD;
      manifestations. GBS is considered to be an autoimmune disease caused by cross reaction of&#xD;
      infectious agents with auto-antigen. The triggering of autoimmunity depends both on the&#xD;
      increase in immunogenicity of the target cell and the individual's own capability to&#xD;
      recognize the antoantigens (HLA genes, T cell repertoire). The pathogenesis of GBS is not yet&#xD;
      fully understood and GBS with variable clinical manifestations are supposed to be associated&#xD;
      different immune mediated pathogenic mechanisms. By studying the GBS patients about their&#xD;
      clinical manifestations, conventional laboratory studies, electrophysiological studies and&#xD;
      skin biopsies and by evaluating the cytokine expression in the CSF and serum in different&#xD;
      subtypes of GBS, we want to clarify the relationship between the immunological parameters and&#xD;
      the clinical manifestations in GBS.&#xD;
