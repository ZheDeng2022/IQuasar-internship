      The purpose of this study is to determine if a family based diet and exercise program is&#xD;
      helpful for extremely overweight children aged 8-12, and to compare this approach to standard&#xD;
      medical management of severe pediatric obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of pediatric obesity has increased significantly, and approximately 11% of&#xD;
      American children and adolescents are obese. Of particular concern, the greatest increase in&#xD;
      prevalence has occured among the heaviest children. Severe pediatric obesity (defined as &gt;&#xD;
      150% of ideal body weight for height) is associated with higher rates of medical and&#xD;
      psychosocial morbidity than milder obesity is. Moreover, severely obese children are likelier&#xD;
      than less severely obese children are to become obese adults and suffer the long-term health&#xD;
      consequences of obesity. Although the efficacy of family-based behavioral weight control&#xD;
      programs in the treatment of moderate pediatric obesity is well established, few studies have&#xD;
      focused on the treatment of severe obesity. Thus in this application, we propose a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a family-based behavioral weight control program&#xD;
      in the management of severe pediatric obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred children aged 8-12 will be randomized to a six-month family-based program or&#xD;
      usual care, and will complete assessments at pre- and post- treatment and 6-month and&#xD;
      12-month follow-ups. We hypothesized that: 1) Children who participate in the family-based&#xD;
      program, when compared to children who receive usual care, will show favorable changes in&#xD;
      body mass index, body composition, food intake, activity level, and cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors. 2) Children who participate in the family-based program, when compared to children&#xD;
      who receive usual care, will report higher levels of self-esteem, social competence and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, and report fewer psychiatric symptoms. A secondary aim of the&#xD;
      the proposed investigation is to examine the relationships among gender, race, compliance to&#xD;
      diet and exercise. level of parent adherence and treatment outcome. The proposed&#xD;
      investigation is significant as the first effort to systematically evaluate a treatment&#xD;
      program for severely obese children. It will provide data about a serious public health&#xD;
      problem and establish a foundation for programmatic research to develop effective treatments&#xD;
      for an underserved population.&#xD;
