      The body's immune system (fights infection) is known to decline during the aging process,&#xD;
      resulting in an increased risk of catching infections. Vaccinations also are not as effective&#xD;
      in protecting older people against infection as they are in younger people. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to better understand how and why vaccines are not as effective in older people.&#xD;
      The researchers believe that the immune response in older people who get a higher dose&#xD;
      vaccine will be similar to the immune response in young adults who get the standard (lower)&#xD;
      dose vaccine. This study is a substudy to a main study, evaluating flu vaccines in people 65&#xD;
      years and older. Volunteers who are in the main study will be asked if they will participate&#xD;
      in the substudy. The substudy requires them to give 2 additional blood samples for an&#xD;
      in-depth look at their immune response to the flu vaccine given in the main study. Substudy&#xD;
      volunteers will have up to 3 clinic visits and participate up to 28 weeks.&#xD;

      There is a need to increase protection against influenza conveyed to elderly persons by&#xD;
      inactivated influenza virus vaccines. Serum antibody titer is the primary surrogate marker&#xD;
      for immunity to influenza after vaccination; and increasing the antigen dose has been shown&#xD;
      to increase the serum antibody response in vaccinated persons, including the elderly. However&#xD;
      it is not known how the remainder of the immune system responds to the higher dose of&#xD;
      influenza antigen. This study is linked to DMID protocols 04-100 and 05-0055. This study will&#xD;
      be conducted as a substudy of DMID 04-100 at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Subjects&#xD;
      ages 65 years and older, who meet the entry criteria for the primary study, will be&#xD;
      approached for participation in an immunology substudy of volunteers who receive a single&#xD;
      intramuscular injection of either the high-dose or standard-dose of licensed 2004-2005&#xD;
      trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. A minimum of 30 elderly subjects (with the&#xD;
      possibility of up to 60 elderly subjects) will be enrolled for the substudy. The substudy&#xD;
      will require an extra 100 ml (total blood draw of 120 ml) of blood drawn from the same 20 ml&#xD;
      venipuncture obtained for hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) titers (as per the primary&#xD;
      study) on days 0 and 28. To minimize adverse side effects, the additional 100 ml of blood&#xD;
      required for the substudy will be obtained from the same venipuncture site from which the 20&#xD;
      ml blood will be obtained for HAI titers (i.e., if blood collection stops after the 20 ml for&#xD;
      HAI are drawn, the researchers will not attempt to obtain additional blood from a separate&#xD;
      venipuncture site). Subjects' blood will be evaluated for key humoral and cell-mediated&#xD;
      immunity (CMI) responses to better understand the mechanisms underlying the predicted&#xD;
      suboptimal immune responses to one or more of the three influenza vaccine antigens observed&#xD;
      in the elderly. With regard to specific study objectives, blood samples will be submitted for&#xD;
      the following analysis: (1) measurement of serum anti-HA (hemagglutinin) IgG and IgA&#xD;
      antibodies by ELISA; (2) IgG antibody subclasses; (3) IgG and IgA avidity, (4) virus&#xD;
      neutralizing functional assay; and (5) HAI antibody titer. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      (PBMC) isolated from these subjects will be evaluated for the following: (1) &quot;central&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;effector&quot; memory T cell responses, including their proliferative responses and cytokine&#xD;
      production profiles by flow cytometry; (2) IFN-gamma production by ELISPOT, following&#xD;
      specific antigenic stimulation; (3) measurement ex vivo of the frequency of circulating&#xD;
      influenza-specific T cells by using commercially available MHC/tetramers and/or MHC/pentamers&#xD;
      and flow cytometry; and (4) role of regulatory T cells in the modulation of influenza&#xD;
      responses in the elderly. Studies for measurement ex vivo of the frequency of circulating&#xD;
      influenza-specific T cells (by using commercially available MHC/tetramers and/or&#xD;
      MHC/pentamers and flow cytometry) will concentrate on IFN-gamma, a cytokine shown by many&#xD;
      investigators to play a central role in the host immune response to influenza antigens. If&#xD;
      promising results are observed, other cytokines (e.g., IL-12, TNF-alpha) might also be&#xD;
      evaluated in future investigations if sufficient cells and resources are available. Major&#xD;
      factors involved in the decision to concentrate these studies on IFN-gamma include the need&#xD;
      to remain focus in a defined set of scientific questions and the fact that we will only have&#xD;
      access to a limited number of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that might preclude&#xD;
      the study of additional cytokines.&#xD;
