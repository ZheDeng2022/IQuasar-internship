      The purpose of this study is to determine if WT1 is an adequate measurement of minimal&#xD;
      residual disease in leukemic patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute Leukemia may have a large number of leukemic cells at the time that&#xD;
      leukemia is evident clinically. At the time that we determine that a patient is in complete&#xD;
      remission (CR) the patient may still have leukemic cells present in smaller quantities. One&#xD;
      of the most important factors in the successful treatment of patients with leukemia is the&#xD;
      ability to determine if the eradication of leukemia has been achieved. The determination of&#xD;
      Minimal Residual Disease may be important in the determination of the therapy that a given&#xD;
      patient will receive as determined by the level of residual disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WT1 gene function and expression. The WT1 gene is a candidate gene for Wilms tumor, which is&#xD;
      thought to arise as a result from inactivation of both alleles of the WT1 gene located at&#xD;
      chromosome 11p13. The WT1 gene has been considered a tumor suppressor gene because intragenic&#xD;
      deletions or mutations are found in tumors, germline mutations have been found in-patients&#xD;
      with leukemia, and mediates growth suppression of Wilms tumor cells expressing a WT1 splicing&#xD;
      variant.&#xD;
