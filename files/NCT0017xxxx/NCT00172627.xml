  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence is rapidly accumulating that chronic inflammation may contribute to carcinogenesis&#xD;
      through multiple mechanisms in a number of malignancies, including gastric carcinoma (GC).&#xD;
      Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an inducible enzyme pivotal in the inflammatory response, converts&#xD;
      arachidonic acid to the prostaglandins (PGs) required in initiating and maintaining reactions&#xD;
      during the inflammatory process. Over-expression of COX-2 has been reported in a wide variety&#xD;
      of cancers and is therefore implicated to play an important role in carcinogenesis. COX-2 can&#xD;
      be blocked by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSIADs) and is currently the most&#xD;
      studied therapeutic target of NSAIDs. Clinically, NSAIDs have long been used to treat various&#xD;
      inflammatory or rheumatologic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier clinical studies have confirmed an association between COX-2 over-expression and GC&#xD;
      occurrence. The known mechanisms by which COX-2 promotes carcinogenesis include evasion from&#xD;
      apoptosis, suppression of immunity, promotion of angiogenesis, and facilitation of&#xD;
      invasiveness. However, inflammation-associated factors mediating the effects of COX-2 on&#xD;
      carcinogenesis remain largely unknown. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      associated with gastritis and GC. Our earlier works has disclosed that IL-6 can promote&#xD;
      angiogenic and anti-apoptotic ability of GC. However, the relationship between COX-2 and IL-6&#xD;
      in GC remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to investigate the clinical association between COX-2 and IL-6 in GC,&#xD;
      to use a GC cell model for experimental study on causation and mechanism, and to verify the&#xD;
      in vivo effect of COX-2 on IL-6 by an animal model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect 100 consecutive surgical samples of GC from the pathology archive of National&#xD;
      Taiwan University Hospital and use immunohistochemical stain to compare protein expression in&#xD;
      GC. The clinical study is to define certain subgroups of GC exhibiting an association between&#xD;
      COX-2 and IL-6. In experimental study, we will clarify the causal relationship by the dose-&#xD;
      and time-dependent experiments of COX-2 transient transfection in a GC cell line. COX-2 acts&#xD;
      mainly via PGs, like PGE2. Therefore, we also stimulate GC cells with exogenous stimulation&#xD;
      of PGE2 and EP receptor 1-4 agonists to determine the possible way(s) by which COX-2 induces&#xD;
      IL-6 expression. A selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 and various inhibitors of PGE2 receptors&#xD;
      are used as well to block COX-2 for determining the signaling pathway of COX-2 on IL-6.&#xD;
      Finally, we will establish a stable COX-2 over-expressing transfectant of GC cells and its&#xD;
      control vector transfectant for xenograft implantation study on mice. A COX-2 selective&#xD;
      agent, celecoxib, will be administered orally to mice and tumor blocks will be harvested for&#xD;
      determination of IL-6 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will provide clearer understanding of the role of COX-2 on the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in GC in both clinical and basic aspects. It might also stand&#xD;
      for a model capable of systemically investigating the role of COX-2 on various cytokines&#xD;
      implicated in GC.&#xD;
