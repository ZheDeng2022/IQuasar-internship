  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients affected by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are subjected to enhanced oxidative&#xD;
      stress, as a result of reduced anti-oxidant systems and increased pro-oxidant activity.&#xD;
      Besides, insulin resistance is also very common in ESRD patients. Both enhanced oxidative&#xD;
      stress and insulin resistance increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality, and intention to reduce oxidative stress and insulin resistance is important in&#xD;
      ESRD patients who suffer from high cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high concentration of glucose and glucose degradation products (GDP), high lactate, and&#xD;
      low pH in conventional peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions are known as bioincompatible&#xD;
      factors, which are believed to increase oxidative stress in PD patients. Physioneal®, a more&#xD;
      biocompatible dialysis solution with neutral pH, physiologic bicarbonate concentration and&#xD;
      low GDP level, has been applied in Europe for several years. Previous studies of Physioneal®&#xD;
      have revealed advantages of improved infusion pain, more efficient acid-base control,&#xD;
      increased ultrafiltration, and reduced peritonitis duration. However, its effects on&#xD;
      oxidative stress and insulin resistance in peritoneal dialysis patients are not reported yet.&#xD;
      The comparison of oxidative stress and insulin resistance before and after using Physioneal®&#xD;
      may help to elucidate the possibly beneficial effects on uremic patients, which frequently&#xD;
      suffer from increased oxidative stress and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients will be selected in this&#xD;
      study, and receive conventional solution (Dianeal® PD-2 or PD-4) for a baseline period of 3&#xD;
      months. Then Physioneal® will be used for 3 months. Clinical conditions, biochemical and&#xD;
      hematological parameters, oxidative markers in blood and effluent, and insulin resistance&#xD;
      will be measured at baseline, before and after Physioneal®, and some markers will be measured&#xD;
      1 month after discontinuing Physioneal® and changing back to conventional solution. The&#xD;
      medication used in each patient will be recorded, and the dialysis prescription will be&#xD;
      adjusted by a nephrologist according to clinical data. The data collected before and after&#xD;
      Physioneal® will be analyzed by paired-t test.&#xD;

      Patients affected by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are subjected to enhanced oxidative&#xD;
      stress, as a result of reduced anti-oxidant systems and increased pro-oxidant activity.&#xD;
      Enhanced oxidative stress in uremic patients increases the risk of atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, bioincompatibility of dialysis therapy further&#xD;
      increases oxidative stress. High concentration of glucose, high lactate, low pH, and/or high&#xD;
      concentration of glucose degradation products (GDP) are known as bioincompatible factors and&#xD;
      believed to increase oxidative stress in peritoneal dialysis patients. A more biocompatible&#xD;
      dialysis solution, i.e., neutral pH, containing physiologic concentration of bicarbonate and&#xD;
      low concentration of GDP has been developed. There is a growing body of in vitro studies&#xD;
      showing this neutral bicarbonate containing dialysis solution more biocompatible compared to&#xD;
      conventional solutions. However, its effects on oxidative stress in peritoneal dialysis&#xD;
      patients are not reported yet. On the other hand, insulin resistance is associated with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, and it is very common in uremic patients. Some animal studies&#xD;
      suggested that reduced oxidative stress enhanced insulin sensitivity, and the effects of&#xD;
      reduced oxidative stress in human have not been extensively investigated. Previous studies of&#xD;
      Physioneal®, a kind of more biocompatible dialysis solution which contains bicarbonate, have&#xD;
      revealed advantages of improved infusion pain, more efficient acid-base control, increased&#xD;
      ultrafiltration, and reduced peritonitis duration. The comparison of oxidative stress and&#xD;
      insulin resistance before and after using Physioneal®, may help to elucidate the possibly&#xD;
      beneficial effects on uremic patients, which frequently suffer from increased oxidative&#xD;
      stress and insulin resistance.&#xD;
