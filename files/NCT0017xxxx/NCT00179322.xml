      This study will measure brain activity in individuals performing language tasks while in&#xD;
      various states of alertness to learn more about how the central nervous system is affected by&#xD;
      impairments such as sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 20 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates must be non-smokers, right-handed, speak English fluently and have at least 12&#xD;
      years of education. They are screened with a medical history, physical examination, hearing&#xD;
      and speech evaluation, computer task training, blood and urine tests and a late-night&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan (see description below). Before screening&#xD;
      and again before participating in the study, candidates wear an actigraph (a wristwatch-like&#xD;
      device that records motion) for 7 days to provide a measure of their sleep-wake patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extended wakefulness: Subjects are kept awake longer than is normal for them in their&#xD;
           everyday life to be able to examine the brain under conditions of sleepiness. They are&#xD;
           engaged in activities with the research staff during this waking time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional magnetic resonance imaging: Subjects undergo five separate fMRI scans-one&#xD;
           during screening and four others during the main part of the study. fMRI uses a magnetic&#xD;
           field and radio waves to produce images of the brain. The subject lies on a table that&#xD;
           is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking&#xD;
           and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. Brain scans are taken at&#xD;
           rest and while the subject performs tasks, which include pressing a button upon seeing&#xD;
           certain shapes and performing various language tasks, such as saying memorized or new&#xD;
           words, listening to narratives, and describing everyday procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological, speech-language, and neuropsychological testing: Before the fMRI exams and&#xD;
           during the period of extended wakefulness, subjects complete a series of tests that&#xD;
           measure speech, language, memory and visual skills. Portions of the tests may be video-&#xD;
           or autiotaped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews and questionnaires: Participants are interviewed about their handedness,&#xD;
           sleep history, and presence of medical or neurological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrophysiological studies: Subjects have an electroencephalograph (EEG) to measure&#xD;
           the electrical activity of the brain and surface electromyography (EMG) to measure&#xD;
           movements of muscles involved in moving and speaking. For the EEG, electrodes (small&#xD;
           metal disks) are attached to the surface of the scalp or to a cap placed over the head.&#xD;
           For the EMG, electrodes are attached to the skin of the face and neck by plastic or&#xD;
           paper tape.&#xD;

      Objectives of this protocol are to examine fMRI data taken concurrently with speech,&#xD;
      language, and decision making tasks under conditions of both alertness and sleep deprivation,&#xD;
      comparing fMRI-defined neural activation across states and behavioral performance, assessing&#xD;
      changes in brain function with sleep deprivation. An additional objective is to develop an&#xD;
      fMRI signal based sleep scoring system. Subjects will be 45 normal healthy volunteers, age&#xD;
      20-40, who meet criteria both for safe participation in an fMRI environment and for&#xD;
      suitability for research on normal human sleep. To examine speech and language processing and&#xD;
      also to examine depth of sleep, we will use a within-subjects free behavior design in which&#xD;
      we search for patterns in the arterial spin labeled (ASL) or the blood oxygen dependent&#xD;
      (BOLD) signal in fMRI data recorded while subjects say rehearsed word sets, describe or&#xD;
      listen to novel procedures, or transition from wake to sleep. To gauge subjects' speech and&#xD;
      language, we will record, concurrently with fMRI, their voice for analysis in conditions of&#xD;
      both alertness and sleep deprivation. To examine decision making, we will compare the fMRI&#xD;
      signal during response execution and inhibition across conditions of alertness and sleep&#xD;
      deprivation. To gauge subjects' depth of sleep during fMRI, we will use both physiological&#xD;
      (e.g., EEG) and behavioral measures (e.g., latency and quality of rehearsed verbal response&#xD;
      to external stimuli presented during sleep). For speech, language processing, and depth of&#xD;
      sleep, key measures will include fundamental frequency, speaking rate, voice onset, word&#xD;
      production, and linguistic variables (phonological, syntactic, and pragmatic) derived from&#xD;
      recorded transcripts. For decision making, the key measure will be subjects' errors and&#xD;
      latencies in responding to cues to make or refrain from making a prescribed action. The fMRI&#xD;
      data corresponding to these behavioral data are expected to show systematic changes in neural&#xD;
      activation patterns that parallel behavioral changes with sleep deprivation.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal healthy volunteers in this protocol should be fluent English speaking and have at&#xD;
        least 12 years of education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects should also be right-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        People who are not native speakers of English or are left handed will be excluded from this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Given the nature of the stimuli presentation (i.e., projected visual images and speakers&#xD;
        carrying voice), anyone with noncorrectable vision impairments, hearing loss, or known risk&#xD;
        for hearing loss will be excluded. Normal hearing is defined as hearing thresholds of 25dB&#xD;
        HL or less for the octave frequencies 250 - 8000 Hz and intact crossed acoustic reflex in&#xD;
        both ears.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The dual focus of this research on sleep deprivation and fMRI yields additional sets of&#xD;
        exclusion criteria for both fMRI safety and normal sleep/wake patterns. Given the&#xD;
        dimensions of the fMRI and the exam table, anyone whose body size or shape cannot be&#xD;
        accommodated in the fMRI with a projected image remaining continuously visible will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are pregnant will be excluded from this protocol.&#xD;
