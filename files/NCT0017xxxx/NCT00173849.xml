      Oral cancer is the most common head and neck malignancy, constituting near 9% of all cancers&#xD;
      (1). Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common histopathologic type of the oral&#xD;
      malignancies, accounting for more than 90% of cancers occurring in this region (2). The&#xD;
      presence or absence of regional lymph node metastases is the single most important factor&#xD;
      affecting prognosis in patients with oral cancer. Cure rates for oral cancer are decreased by&#xD;
      approximately 50 percent in patients having cervical lymph node metastasis (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor metastasis is the hallmark of malignancy, and is probably a result of the interaction&#xD;
      between tumor cells and a supportive microenvironment. Malignant cells that have the&#xD;
      capability to metastasize to a particular organ may have various properties supporting their&#xD;
      tissue invasion or growth such as enhanced adherence to the microvascular cells of the organ,&#xD;
      higher responsiveness to chemotactic signals released from the target organs and increased&#xD;
      response to local soluble or tissue associated growth signals in the target organ (4,5).&#xD;
      Though there are several molecules expressed or produced in cancer cells are considered the&#xD;
      metastatic factors, it remains unknown which factors produced by the lymph node or tissue&#xD;
      affect the metastasis of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemokines are a large family of pro-inflammatory polypeptide cytokines, consisting of small&#xD;
      (7-15 kDa), structurally related heparin-binding proteins. They are grouped into CXC&#xD;
      chemokines and CC chemokines, on the basis of the characteristic presence of four conserved&#xD;
      cysteine residues (6-8). Chemokines are produced locally in the tissues and act on target&#xD;
      cells through G-protein-coupled receptors, which are characterized structurally by seven&#xD;
      transmembrane spanning domains. Chemokines are involved in the attraction and activation of&#xD;
      mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes to sites of inflammatory responses, bacterial or&#xD;
      viral infections, allergy, cardiovascular diseases and wound healing (4, 8-13). Chemokines&#xD;
      are known to also function as regulatory molecules in the leukocyte maturation, trafficking,&#xD;
      and homing of T and B lymphocytes, in the development of lymphoid tissues, and in dendritic&#xD;
      cell maturation (14,15). Other functions of chemokines have been described more recently,&#xD;
      particularly for the CXC chemokines. The role of chemokines in malignant tumors is not clear&#xD;
      yet. Some chemokines may enhance innate or specific host immunity against tumor&#xD;
      dissemination. On the other hand, some may advocate tumor growth and metastasis by promoting&#xD;
      tumor cell proliferation, migration or angiogenesis in tumor tissue (4). Reports have&#xD;
      suggested that several types of cancer, such as breast (16), ovary (17), prostate (18),&#xD;
      kidney (19), brain (20), lung (21), and thyroid (22), expressed the chemokine receptor and&#xD;
      used the chemokines to metastasize to the target organ as in the homing of hematopoietic&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SDF-1 belongs to the CXC chemokine family and is a ligand for CXCR4 (23, 24). SDF-1 was&#xD;
      initially cloned by Tashiro et al. (25) and later identified as a growth factor for B cell&#xD;
      progenitors, a chemotactic factor for T cells and monocytes, and in B-cell lymphopoiesis and&#xD;
      bone marrow myelopoiesis (23, 26-27). Most of the chemokine receptors interact with pleural&#xD;
      ligands, and vice versa, but the SDF-1/CXCR4 receptor ligand system has been shown to involve&#xD;
      a one-on-one interaction (28, 29). Recently, several studies have been conducted to detect&#xD;
      the mRNA expression of CXCR4 and SDF-1 in solid tumors. The results are not uniform, and the&#xD;
      relevance to cancer progression is not determined (30, 31). Sehgal et al. (30, 32) concluded&#xD;
      that CXCR4 plays an important role of proliferation and tumorigenic properties of human&#xD;
      glioblastoma tumors. Muller et al. (33) have reported that SDF-1 signaling through CXCR4&#xD;
      interaction appears to determine the directional migration of breast cancer cells through the&#xD;
      basement membrane. Furthermore in vivo, the interaction between SDF-1 and CXCR4 significantly&#xD;
      represses the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells to lymph node and lung. Barnard and&#xD;
      his colleagues (34, 35) showed the contrary results that CXCR4 mRNA expression was reduced in&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma tissue when compared with noncancerous tissue, but was not changed&#xD;
      in colon, esophageal, and gastric cancer. They also found reduced mRNA expression of SDF-1 in&#xD;
      these malignant tissues (31). Thus, there is a diversity of views on the role of the&#xD;
      SDF-1/CXCR4 receptor ligand system in malignant tissues. And such studies are limited in oral&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since metastasis of oral cancer occur frequently through the lymphatic system, and metastasis&#xD;
      is a key prognostic factor for the disease. Evaluation of the relationship between&#xD;
      SDF-1/CXCR4 system and metastasis in oral cancer could help us understand whether this system&#xD;
      is important in the metastasis of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that SDF-1/CXCR4 (ligand/receptor) system plays an important role in oral&#xD;
      cancer metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate (1) the distribution of CXCR4&#xD;
      protein expression in cancer and lymph node tissues by means of immunohistochemical analysis&#xD;
      of tissue samples obtained from surgical operation, (2) the relationship between CXCR4&#xD;
      expression and clinicopathological findings with special reference to cancer metastasis, (3)&#xD;
      the expression of SDF-1 and CXCR4 in the cancer cell lines cells and tissues, (4) the&#xD;
      chemotactic activity and the growth-promoting effect of SDF-1 on cancer cell lines cells, (5)&#xD;
      the role of Src, MAPK, and Akt signal transduction pathway in this response, (6) the effect&#xD;
      of the blocking agent on this response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undoubtedly, the findings of this study will help us understand whether SDF-1/CXCR4 system&#xD;
      could be a focal point of anti-cancer research. If oral SCC that express high levels of CXCR4&#xD;
      show a consistently higher incidence of lymphatic and distant metastasis, then blocking&#xD;
      SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling may be a novel approach to inhibit metastasis in these patients. The&#xD;
      development of SDF-1/CXCR4 system antagonists will provide opportunity to improve the&#xD;
      survival rate.&#xD;
