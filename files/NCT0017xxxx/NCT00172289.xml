      According to the theory of wave transmission, the speed of wave transmission is dependent on&#xD;
      the nature of the transmission medium, which is the vessel wall for pulse wave transmission.&#xD;
      Then, the pulse wave velocity is related to the mechanical property of the vessel wall. The&#xD;
      mechanical property of the vessel wall is determined by the texture of the vessel wall and&#xD;
      the contraction status of the smooth muscle within the vessel wall. Because the texture of&#xD;
      the vessel wall could not be changed in a short duration, the sympathetic nerve activity,&#xD;
      which controls the contractibility of the smooth muscle, becomes the only determinant factor&#xD;
      of pulse wave velocity. So, pulse wave velocity may reflect the status of sympathetic nerve&#xD;
      activity. The purpose of this project is to use the pulse wave velocity to measure the&#xD;
      sympathetic activity of stroke and spinal cord patients. The present project plans to measure&#xD;
      the pulse wave simultaneously at four limbs by pressure receptors, and use the&#xD;
      electrocardiogram as the reference to synchronize the recorded pulse wave at different&#xD;
      vessels, using the corrected data to calculate the pulse wave velocity. With the pulse wave&#xD;
      velocity of different vessels, we, the investigators at National Taiwan University Hospital,&#xD;
      can understand the local sympathetic nerve activity in different diseases and different&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first year, we will set up the equipment for measuring the pulse wave velocity, and then&#xD;
      apply it to 20 healthy subjects to adjust the measurement error and ascertain the&#xD;
      reproducibility of the machine. The second year, we will apply the measurement to 15 complete&#xD;
      cervical cord injury individuals and 15 healthy subjects in different erected angles by a&#xD;
      tilting table. This procedure will make us understand the response of sympathetic nerve&#xD;
      activity to different postures in normal subjects and cervical cord injury patients. The&#xD;
      third year, we will apply the measurement to 30 cerebrovascular accident patients to&#xD;
      understand the change of sympathetic nerve activity after having a stroke. By comparing the&#xD;
      clinical information, we hope to clear up the relationship between sympathetic nerve activity&#xD;
      and pulse wave velocity.&#xD;

      There are many diseases related to the dysfunction of sympathetic nerve activities in&#xD;
      rehabilitation medicine. Shoulder hand syndrome, a common complication after having a&#xD;
      cerebrovascular accident, is believed to combine with hyper-exciting of the sympathetic nerve&#xD;
      at the lesion side. Autonomic dysfunction in spinal cord injury patients comes from the&#xD;
      vicious cycle of local stimulation of the sympathetic nerve and results in the elevated blood&#xD;
      pressure. Myofascial pain syndrome has been reported to have abnormal sympathetic activities&#xD;
      in the late stage. Considering the above facts, accurate evaluation of sympathetic nerve&#xD;
      activities is an important issue in rehabilitation practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring the skin temperature and the status of local sweating are the common methods in&#xD;
      evaluating the sympathetic nerve activity. However, many external environment factors would&#xD;
      interfere with the result, and the accuracy of the result is questionable. Sympathetic skin&#xD;
      reflex is the traditional electrodiagnostic method in measuring the sympathetic nerve&#xD;
      activity, but its application is limited by poor reproducibility. Microneurography can&#xD;
      measure the sympathetic nerve activity along the distribution of peroneus and bronchial&#xD;
      nerves by inserting the needles into the above nerves, but its application is limited because&#xD;
      of the invasive nature of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the heart is contracted, it pumps the blood into the peripheral vessels and transits a&#xD;
      pulse wave along the vessel walls. The propagation velocity of the pulse wave is different&#xD;
      from that of the blood flow. According to the theory of wave transmission, the speed of wave&#xD;
      transmission is dependent on the nature of the transmission medium, which is the vessel wall&#xD;
      for pulse wave transmission. Then, the pulse wave velocity is related to the mechanical&#xD;
      property of the vessel wall. The mechanical property of the vessel wall is determined by the&#xD;
      texture of the vessel wall and the contraction status of the smooth muscle within the vessel&#xD;
      wall. Because the texture of the vessel wall could not be changed in a short duration, the&#xD;
      sympathetic nerve activity, which controls the contractibility of the smooth muscle, becomes&#xD;
      the only determinant factor of pulse wave velocity. So, pulse wave velocity may reflect the&#xD;
      status of sympathetic nerve activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were limited reports regarding the pulse wave velocity measurement and lack of reports&#xD;
      of clinical application. The present project plans to measure the pulse wave simultaneously&#xD;
      at four limbs by pressure receptors, and use the electrocardiogram as the reference to&#xD;
      synchronize the recorded pulse wave at different vessels, using the corrected data to&#xD;
      calculate the pulse wave velocity. With the pulse wave velocity of different vessels, we can&#xD;
      understand the local sympathetic nerve activity in different diseases and different sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first year, we will set up the equipment for measuring the pulse wave velocity, and then&#xD;
      apply it to 20 healthy subjects to adjust the measurement error and ascertain the&#xD;
      reproducibility of the machine. The second year, we will apply the measurement to 15 complete&#xD;
      cervical cord injury individuals and 15 healthy subjects in different erected angles by a&#xD;
      tilting table. This procedure will make us understand the response of sympathetic nerve&#xD;
      activity to different postures in normal subjects and cervical cord injury patients. The&#xD;
      third year, we will apply the measurement to 30 cerebrovascular accident patients to&#xD;
      understand the change of sympathetic nerve activity after having a stroke. By comparing the&#xD;
      clinical information, we hope to clear up the relationship between sympathetic nerve activity&#xD;
      and pulse wave velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use the self-designed pulse wave velocity (PWV) machine to measure the&#xD;
      patients with cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and spinal cord injury (SCI). The CVA patients&#xD;
      will be divided into two groups with or without shoulder pain. The skin temperature and range&#xD;
      of motion will be recorded. We hypothesize that the patients with shoulder pain may have&#xD;
      higher sympathetic activity and will have higher speed of PWV. Sixty patients will be&#xD;
      included. For SCI patients, we will compare the PWV of the upper extremity and lower&#xD;
      extremity. We hypothesize that the cervical cord injury patients will have lower sympathetic&#xD;
      tone below the lesion, and have lower speed of PWV when compared to the upper extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, we will confirm the hypothesis that the PWV is an accurate method to&#xD;
      measure the sympathetic activity and understand the change of sympathetic activity in CVA and&#xD;
      SCI patients.&#xD;
