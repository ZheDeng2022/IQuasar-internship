  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare two similar treatments for patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      prostate cancer. The two treatment arms being compared are: (Standard Arm) hormone therapy,&#xD;
      which will prevent the production of the male hormone, testosterone, by the testicles, and&#xD;
      pelvic external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) followed by a high-dose, conformal EBRT boost&#xD;
      versus (Investigational Arm) hormone therapy and pelvic EBRT followed by a brachytherapy&#xD;
      boost (implantation of radioactive iodine sources or &quot;seeds&quot; into the prostate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this trial is that more patients may experience 5 year actuarial freedom&#xD;
      from biochemical recurrence of their prostate cancer following treatment with the&#xD;
      investigational arm. Biochemical failure is declared on the date when the post treatment&#xD;
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) is &gt; 2 ng/mL above the lowest level previously recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned with equal probability to one or two treatment arms, Arm 1&#xD;
      or Arm 2, where the interventions associated with these Arms are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant, concurrent and adjuvant androgen suppression, elective pelvic nodal irradiation&#xD;
      (EPNI), high dose conformal EBRT boost to the prostate, and appropriate secondary&#xD;
      interventions at failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant, concurrent and adjuvant androgen suppression, elective pelvic nodal irradiation&#xD;
      (EPNI), permanent 125-Iodine brachytherapy boost to the prostate, and appropriate secondary&#xD;
      interventions at failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is assigned to Arm 1, the radiation oncologist will initiate androgen&#xD;
      suppression and monitor clinical and biochemical response. After an 8-month duration of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant androgen suppression, the patient will undergo a course of elective pelvic nodal&#xD;
      irradiation (EPNI) to a volume encompassing the prostate gland, seminal vesicles and regional&#xD;
      lymph nodes. The pelvic irradiation will be followed by a dose-escalated 3-D conformal EBRT&#xD;
      boost to the prostate with appropriate margins. The total radiation dose to the regional&#xD;
      lymphatics is 46 Gy and prostate dose is 78 Gy at the ICRU reference point with a minimum&#xD;
      dose to the PTV of &gt; 74 Gy. Androgen suppression is maintained throughout radiation therapy&#xD;
      and following the completion of radiation therapy until the patient has received a total&#xD;
      duration of androgen suppression of 12 months including the neoadjuvant phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is assigned to Arm 2, the radiation oncologist will initiate androgen&#xD;
      suppression and monitor clinical and biochemical response. After an 8-month duration of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant androgen suppression, the patient will undergo a course of elective pelvic nodal&#xD;
      irradiation (EPNI) to a volume encompassing the prostate gland, seminal vesicles and regional&#xD;
      lymph nodes. The total radiation dose to the regional lymphatics is 46 Gy. Two weeks&#xD;
      following the completion of the pelvic irradiation, the patient will undergo a permanent&#xD;
      125-Iodine brachytherapy prostate implant at the facilities of the participating institution&#xD;
      by a team of healthcare professionals lead by a Radiation Oncologist with experience in&#xD;
      prostate brachytherapy. To be eligible to participate, the institution must have done at&#xD;
      least 25 cases of prostate brachytherapy with stranded sources. The minimal peripheral dose&#xD;
      (MPD) to the prostate gland from the implant will be 115 Gy. A modified peripheral loading&#xD;
      technique will be used in an effort to maintain the periurethral dose to &lt; 150% of the MPD.&#xD;
      Androgen suppression is maintained throughout radiation therapy until the patient has&#xD;
      received a total duration of androgen suppression of 12 months including the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients randomized are part of the analysis. The patient remains on study whether or not&#xD;
      protocol treatment defined for the assigned arm is completed. The end of the primary&#xD;
      intervention is defined as 18 months following the start of neoadjuvant androgen suppression&#xD;
      in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival, metastasis-free survival, pathological local control, incidence of acute&#xD;
      and late side effects and complications associated with the treatment interventions, effect&#xD;
      of the planned interventions on QOL and rate of testosterone recovery.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients with Gleason sum 8 and/or PSA &gt; 20 must have a CT pelvis, and nuclear&#xD;
             medicine bone scan showing no evidence of nodal (N0) or distant metastases (M0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Registration must occur within 36 weeks of biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with clinical or pathological evidence of seminal vesicle invasion (stage&#xD;
             T3b) or involvement of adjacent pelvic organs/structures (stage T4) are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pre-intervention PSA must not exceed 40 ng ml-1.&#xD;
&#xD;

             their suitability for general or spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients judged clinically to have a prostate volume &gt; 65 cm3 prior to starting&#xD;
             androgen suppression must have a transrectal ultrasound for volume estimation.&#xD;
             Patients with TRUS prostate volumes &gt; 75 cm3 prior to starting androgen suppression&#xD;
             are not eligible for the study.&#xD;

                  suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients must not have received prior surgical treatment for prostate cancer including&#xD;
             transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transurethral resection of the bladder&#xD;
             neck (TURB), cryotherapy, laser ablation, or microwave therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients should have an estimated life expectancy of at least 5 years with an ECOG&#xD;
             performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients may not have received prior radiation therapy to the pelvis.&#xD;

             cardiologist or hematologist).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients must be judged to have no contraindication to high dose pelvic irradiation or&#xD;
             LHRH agonist therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Cancer survivors are eligible providing that all three of the following criteria are&#xD;
             met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior&#xD;
                  malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  There has been no evidence of recurrence for at least five years following&#xD;
                  potentially curative therapy. (For non-melanoma skin cancer the five-year&#xD;
                  requirement does not apply.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient is considered by the treating physician to be at low risk of&#xD;
                  recurrence from prior malignancies.&#xD;
