  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a distinctive syndrome of necrotizing lymphadenitis which was&#xD;
      formally described in 1972 by two Japanese pathologists, Kikuchi and Fujimoto. It is a&#xD;
      benign, self-limited disease that predominantly occurs in young women. It was more common in&#xD;
      Asian people, especially in Japanese. The most frequent clinical presentations are fever&#xD;
      (30~50%) and cervical lymphadenopathy, often tender in palpable. Other lymph node regions can&#xD;
      be affected, and hepatosplenomegaly may be present. The laboratory findings include&#xD;
      leucopenia with atypical lymphocytosis. ESR, transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase are&#xD;
      often raised. The clinical features are easily confused with other conditions, particularly&#xD;
      lymphoma. Therefore the diagnosis depends on the pathological findings. The typical findings&#xD;
      are paracortical lesions consisting of patchy zones of eosinophilic fibrinoid necrosis and&#xD;
      abundant karyorrhexis. In general, spontaneous resolution of symptoms and signs within a few&#xD;
      months can be expected without treatment.For decades, the etiology of Kikuchi's disease has&#xD;
      been speculated. Although the perforin and Fas pathways of cytotoxic T cells induce an&#xD;
      abundance of apoptosis and thus induce necrotizing lesions, the trigger factor is unknown.&#xD;
      Since the disease can precede or occur in association with a connective tissue disorder,&#xD;
      especially SLE, the autoimmune contribution to the etiology has also been speculated.&#xD;
      However, the clinical course of Kikuchi's disease, often sudden onset and spontaneous&#xD;
      resolution, the frequent flu-like or upper respiratory prodrome, and the prominence of&#xD;
      cervical lymphadenopathy, support a viral cause. Evidence for a viral cause also includes&#xD;
      peripheral blood atypical lymphocytosis and elevated serum IFN-a or 2'-5' oligoadenylate&#xD;
      synthetase levels. Several infectious agents have been suggested, including bacteria (e.g.&#xD;
      Brucella, Yersinia), parasites (e.g. toxoplasmosis) and viruses (e.g. EBV, CMV, HHV6, HHV8,&#xD;
      parvovirus B19, HTLV, HIV).The aim of this study is to collect cases of Kikuchi' disease in&#xD;
      bureau of NHI and NTUH. We will analyze the incidence rate, age of onset, sex, season of&#xD;
      onset and clinical course to see if there is any clustered cases, or nosocomial infection.&#xD;
      Then we will study the etiology of Kikuchi's disease especially the infection causes by&#xD;
      analyzing pathologic specimen and serology. We hope to find out the etiology of Kikuchi's&#xD;
      disease and the new treatment.&#xD;
