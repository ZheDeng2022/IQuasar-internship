    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to see if Hydroxyurea + aspirin is a better treatment than&#xD;
      aspirin alone for Intermediate Risk Primary Thrombocythemia (PT) patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The myeloproliferative disease, primary thrombocythaemia (PT), has a median age of&#xD;
      presentation of 60 years but is increasingly being recognised at an earlier age. The risks of&#xD;
      the untreated condition are micro-vascular and major vessel occlusive events and haemorrhage.&#xD;
      Older patients and those with a previous thrombosis are particularly prone to experience a&#xD;
      significant vascular occlusive event. An anti-aggregating agent, such as aspirin, has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce/alleviate minor ischaemic symptoms. Therefore, except in patients with&#xD;
      haemorrhagic symptoms, peptic ulceration and known side-effects to aspirin, the use of&#xD;
      low-dose aspirin is appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myelofibrotic and acute leukaemic transformations can be long-term complications of PT. The&#xD;
      ability of therapeutic agents to delay myelofibrosis or reduce/increase the incidence of&#xD;
      acute leukaemia in prospective studies is unknown. However, examination of retrospective data&#xD;
      provides anxiety about the leukaemogenic risk of the commonly used cytoreductive agent,&#xD;
      hydroxyurea. From an analysis of a few relatively small studies of primary thrombocythaemia,&#xD;
      the incidence of acute leukaemic transformation in selected patients treated with hydroxyurea&#xD;
      has been given as 5-10% over 4-11 years (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the risk factors for vascular occlusion, older patients with a thrombotic history&#xD;
      and high platelet count can be separated into a 'high' risk group. There is evidence from a&#xD;
      randomised prospective study of 'high-risk' patients that cytoreduction with hydroxyurea&#xD;
      significantly reduces vascular occlusion (2). The observed reduction in this prospective&#xD;
      study of 29 months median duration was from 24% for those not given cytoreductive treatment&#xD;
      to 3.6% for those receiving hydroxyurea - approximately a six-fold reduction. In another&#xD;
      prospective study where all patients received hydroxyurea, an incidence of major thrombotic&#xD;
      events was 5.6%/year (3). In these high-risk patients, cytoreductive treatment should&#xD;
      therefore be given. The high risk arm of the PT1 trial, which has now closed, assessed the&#xD;
      cytoreductive treatment of choice for these high risk patients and the results suggest that&#xD;
      hydroxyurea plus aspirin is superior to anagrelide plus aspirin (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the patients at lower risk of vascular occlusion the dilemma is that the risk of vascular&#xD;
      occlusion in untreated patients is relatively low, but includes major life-threatening&#xD;
      events. In two small prospective studies of these patients not receiving platelet lowering&#xD;
      agents, the observed major complications were 3% and 4.1% per year and the total&#xD;
      complications were 5.1% and 10.5% per year respectively (1). Cyto-reductive treatment should&#xD;
      prevent such events and one could predict a similar reduction in complications as seen in the&#xD;
      high-risk patients. However, there is evidence that in patients under the age of 40 years the&#xD;
      complication rate is only one quarter of that seen in patients aged 40 - 59 years (5).&#xD;
      Therefore it has been decided to divide these patients at lower risk of vascular occlusion&#xD;
      into 'intermediate' and 'low risk' groups. Patients aged 40-59 years will fall into the&#xD;
      'intermediate risk' group and will be randomised to cytoreduction or not, while all will&#xD;
      receive aspirin. Patients under 40 years will form the 'low-risk' group and will receive&#xD;
      aspirin alone. Cyto-reductive treatment might also delay myelofibrotic transformation as&#xD;
      observed in primary polycythaemia. However, this benefit and the possible reduction in&#xD;
      vaso-occlusive episodes need to be balanced against the potential long-term risk of&#xD;
      increasing acute leukaemic transformation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The proposal is to include as many patients with PT as possible including previously&#xD;
             diagnosed patients whether or not they have received treatment. Thus all patients are&#xD;
             eligible assuming they meet the diagnostic criteria and they do not have any exclusion&#xD;
             criterion (see below). It will be necessary to stratify patients according to their&#xD;
             previous treatment. This information will be collected on entry to the study. Informed&#xD;
             consent is of course required where there is a change of therapeutic strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnostic criteria for primary thrombocythaemia are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &gt; 600x109/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of overt polycythaemia(confirmed by RCM if necessary)or of polycythaemia&#xD;
             masked by co-existent iron deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No Philadelphia chromosome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of peripheral blood and/or marrow appearances of myelodysplasia, or&#xD;
             myelofibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No known cause of reactive thrombocytosis. Particular care should be taken to exclude&#xD;
             iron deficiency in pre-menopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Notes:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In asymptomatic patients, the platelet count should be observed for a period of at&#xD;
             least 2 months to confirm &gt;600x109/l, and to allow any cause of reactive&#xD;
             thrombocytosis to become overt.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the PCV is above normal upper limit (that is, males &gt;0.51, females &gt;0.48) or in&#xD;
             high normal range in a patient with palpable splenomegaly measure RCM. Iron deficient&#xD;
             primary polycythaemia (polycythaemia vera) is strongly suggested if Hb/PCV is normal&#xD;
             in the presence of iron deficient red cell changes. In this situation, iron therapy is&#xD;
             potentially dangerous.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exceeding rarely, bcr-abl positive Philadelphia chromosome negative patients present&#xD;
             with high platelet counts with little or no elevation in WBC count. The features that&#xD;
             suggest it is necessary to examine for bcr-abl, are:- basophilia, left-shift in WBC,&#xD;
             granulocyte count &gt;16x109/l, difficulty in controlling platelet count, megakaryocytes&#xD;
             of low ploidy (NAP is usually unhelpful).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A normal ESR, CRP or plasma viscosity is useful in excluding a reactive&#xD;
             thrombocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent obtained in accordance with NCRI requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with impaired hepatic / renal function are not excluded although the&#xD;
             respective biochemical tests should be monitored during therapy and reduced doses of&#xD;
             cytoreductive agent should be used, particularly in the case of hydroxyurea and renal&#xD;
             dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        High risk features (any of the following):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;or= 60 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &gt; or= 1500x109/l (current or previous) (a)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of ischaemia, thrombosis or embolic events (including erythromelalgia) (b)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Haemorrhage considered to be related to PT (b)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of hypertension (c)or diabetes (d)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The manufacturers of hydroxyurea state that it should be avoided in pregnancy and in&#xD;
             lactating women. Similarly, hydroxyurea should not be prescribed for women when there&#xD;
             is doubt about their use of an effective contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclude patient from hydroxyurea therapy and, therefore, from the 'intermediate' risk&#xD;
             randomisation if the patient has current leg ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Notes on the definition of high risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In patients with borderline counts the allocation of a patient to a high risk group&#xD;
             based on platelet count alone should rely on at least three samples taken on separate&#xD;
             occasions over at least 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of previous thrombo-embolic, ischaemic and haemorrhagic events should be&#xD;
             given on the patient's entry proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertension is defined as those patients requiring hypotensive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes is defined as those patients requiring therapy with a hypoglycaemic agent.&#xD;
