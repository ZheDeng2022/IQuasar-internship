  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary aldosteronism (PA) is occasionally associated with impaired glucose tolerance.&#xD;
      Glucose intolerance, in general metabolic syndrome is caused by suppression of insulin&#xD;
      release from the pancreas and suppression of insulin sensitivity of the target tissues.&#xD;
      Several studies have suggested that impaired glucose tolerance in primary aldosteronism is&#xD;
      due to an inability of the beta cells to release insulin by potassium depletion. It was&#xD;
      suggested glucose intolerance in PA is caused by the suppression of insulin release related&#xD;
      to hypopotassemia and compensatory increase of insulin sensitivity is observed in PA. The&#xD;
      increased insulin secretory capacity associated with correction of negative potassium balance&#xD;
      may account for the increase in plasma leptin after curing primary aldosteronism. The&#xD;
      conclusion with respect to the possible causal relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM)&#xD;
      and PA, however, can be obtained after the evaluation of the effect of surgical&#xD;
      /pharmacological treatment of PA.&#xD;

      conclusion with respect to the possible causal relationship between DM and PA, however, can&#xD;
      be obtained after the evaluation of the effect of surgical /pharmacological treatment of PA.&#xD;
      From July 2005 to July 2008, patients with primary aldosteronism, hospitalized for a&#xD;
      comprehensive study of the subtypes of primary aldosteronism before operation will receive&#xD;
      informed consent about the insulin sensitivity test. In the present study, we measured&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity via the ability to release insulin by the 75 g oral glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test (OGTT) in PA to clarify the mechanisms of glucose intolerance in PA. Seventy-five gram&#xD;
      OGTT was performed in PA before and after adrenalectomy. Within one minute, 75 g of glucose&#xD;
      dissolved in 200 cc water was ingested. Venous blood samples were drawn at 0, 60, 120 minutes&#xD;
      for determination of plasma glucose and plasma insulin levels. Serum potassium levels were&#xD;
      measures at 0 minutes. Furthermore, the adipokines, HOMA, QUICKI, leptin, adiponectin,&#xD;
      homocystine, C-reactive protein, proinflammatory cytokine and adhesion molecules were also&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
