  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine the efficacy, side effects, and toxicity of an&#xD;
      investigational vaccine that consists of tumor-pulsed dendritic cells administered with an&#xD;
      immune stimulating drug called interleukin-2 (IL-2). Dendritic cells are immune cells that&#xD;
      are obtained from a subject's blood and are important in the body's immune response to&#xD;
      foreign substances. This study will examine the response of a subject's immune system after&#xD;
      receiving several vaccinations containing their own dendritic cells which have been exposed&#xD;
      to dead fragments of their cancer cells in the laboratory. This may result in sensitizing a&#xD;
      subject's dendritic cells to their cancer cells so that their dendritic cells will react with&#xD;
      other cells of the immune system and attack the cancer. It has been shown in the laboratory&#xD;
      that dendritic cells exposed to cancer cell fragments can provide lymphocytes (a type of&#xD;
      white blood cell) with signals they require in order to become fully activated and acquire&#xD;
      the ability to kill cancer cells.&#xD;

      Pretreatment screening: If a subject decides to participate in this study they will first be&#xD;
      presented the informed consent document to read and review with the Principal Investigator&#xD;
      (or his designee) to go over each aspect of the study and answer any questions. Once the&#xD;
      patient has consented, they will first be screened to make sure they meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. The screening process is done to make sure that it is appropriate for the subject&#xD;
      to participate in this study. This process will include a review of their medical history, a&#xD;
      complete physical examination, standard blood tests, an EKG (an electrocardiogram), a chest&#xD;
      x-ray and if it is possible for them to become pregnant, a pregnancy test. These tests are&#xD;
      normally performed on patients prior to receiving chemotherapy for cancer. In addition to&#xD;
      these tests which are normally performed, blood will be obtained for tests which are specific&#xD;
      for this investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These study specific tests include a blood test to determine whether a subject may be&#xD;
      infected with the hepatitis B virus or the AIDS virus, and blood tests to determine the&#xD;
      ability of their immune system to respond to normal stimulation. A doctor will also order CT&#xD;
      scans or nuclear medicine scans to measure the extent of the subject's cancer because the&#xD;
      study therapy has a possibility of shrinking the tumor and this will be determined by&#xD;
      measuring each subject's disease before and after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of this initial evaluation subjects will have skin tests that will determine&#xD;
      their ability to mount an immune response to infectious agents (such as tetanus, measles,&#xD;
      mumps) that they have been exposed to or vaccinated against. If a subject fails to&#xD;
      demonstrate a response to all the skin tests, they will not be allowed to participate in this&#xD;
      study because such lack of response indicates that their immune system may not respond to the&#xD;
      therapy planned in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine therapy: In order to make a vaccine from a subject's tumor they must have surgical&#xD;
      removal of some tumor in order to provide tumor cells. The doctor will determine if a subject&#xD;
      has colorectal cancer cells that are easily obtainable. However, if a subject already has an&#xD;
      available frozen tumor specimen at the University of Michigan, that may be used for the&#xD;
      vaccine preparation instead of undergoing another surgical procedure. This surgery may be&#xD;
      done solely for the purpose of participating in this research and may not otherwise benefit a&#xD;
      subject. A separate consent form will be required for any surgery a subject undergoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cancer cells obtained from each subject will be taken to the laboratory where they will&#xD;
      be separated into single cells, disrupted to make cell fragments, radiated to kill the cells&#xD;
      and then mixed with your dendritic cells. The dendritic cells will be obtained from the&#xD;
      peripheral blood. Subjects will undergo a procedure called leukapheresis that involves&#xD;
      placing a large needle (central line) in a vein in each of their arms. These central lines&#xD;
      will be inserted under local anesthesia (subjects will remain awakeâ€¦only the site of the&#xD;
      insertion will be &quot;frozen&quot;). Blood exits from one needle and is processed through a machine&#xD;
      that selectively removes one kind of white blood cell and then returns the other elements of&#xD;
      the blood back to their body. The leukapheresis procedure generally lasts three to four&#xD;
      hours. Following the procedure, the dendritic cells will be cultured in the laboratory to&#xD;
      increase the number of dendritic cells. This procedure takes about 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor-exposed dendritic cell vaccine will be administered as an intradermal (into the&#xD;
      skin) injection into a subject's thigh or arm on days 1, 15 and 29 of study treatment.&#xD;
      Additionally, they will receive IL-2 by subcutaneous injection daily for 4 days after each&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four weeks after their last vaccination, subjects will undergo skin testing to determine if&#xD;
      they are reactive to their tumor cells. White blood cells will also be obtained by a second&#xD;
      leukapheresis procedure to determine, via research tests in the laboratory, if their&#xD;
      circulating immune cells have developed the capacity to respond to their cancer cells. This&#xD;
      skin testing and leukapheresis are for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, 4 weeks after subjects receive their last vaccination, they will have x-rays and/or CT&#xD;
      scans done to determine whether their disease has responded to the immune therapy. If their&#xD;
      cancer has not worsened or if it has shrunk, then they will be offered the option to receive&#xD;
      additional vaccinations using the tumor-pulsed dendritic cells providing that they did not&#xD;
      experience severe toxicity with the first series of vaccinations and provided there is enough&#xD;
      vaccine material available. The additional vaccinations would be done using the same&#xD;
      procedure and schedule as the previous vaccinations until there is evidence that the&#xD;
      subject's disease has started to grow or worsen. This includes leukapheresis, vaccination,&#xD;
      and IL-2 administration. Re-treatments will be offered until a subject's disease gets worse&#xD;
      or tumor cells are no longer available to produce vaccines. A subject's study participation&#xD;
      will end with the leukopheresis and tumor evaluation 4 weeks following their last series of&#xD;
      vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Drawing: The maximum amount of blood, for standard tests and research purposes that&#xD;
      will be drawn during the 10 weeks will be a total of 100ccs, which is approximately 20&#xD;
      teaspoons, which is equivalent to approximately 7 tablespoons over the 12 week time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of time a subject would be on this study is a minimum of nine weeks. If the&#xD;
      physician determines that a subject is benefiting from this study, they may continue repeat&#xD;
      vaccinations for as long as they continue to have clinical benefit from the study and vaccine&#xD;
      is available. During the study, if other therapy alternatives become clinically indicated,&#xD;
      they will be discussed with the subject. Also, if there are any significant new findings&#xD;
      developed over the course of this research which may affect a subject's willingness to&#xD;
      participate, they will be told of them.&#xD;
