  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease. It is caused by a&#xD;
      novel SARS-associated coronavirus. According to the epidemiological data, it is highly&#xD;
      infectious by intimate contact, respiratory secretion, or direct contact with infectious body&#xD;
      fluid. By June 1, 2003, Center for Disease Control Taiwan, R.O.C reported 677 probable SARS&#xD;
      cases. Among them, 93.2% (631/677) were more than 20 years old. Only 6.8% (46/677) were under&#xD;
      20 years old. Usually the major hosts of respiratory viruses are children, but evidence up to&#xD;
      now shows that SARS is mainly a disease of adults. The data of clinical presentation and&#xD;
      epidemiological prevalence in teenage group and children are lacking. Therefore, this project&#xD;
      is aimed at the children and teenager among 1 month to eighteen years old. Seroepidemiology&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV infection in children would be investigated. Patients who admitted to pediatric&#xD;
      wards or visited ER and received blood sampling due to the need of clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis/management would be enrolled. After the necessary laboratory examinations were&#xD;
      done, the remaining serum would be collected and tested for anti-SARS-CoV IgG by ELISA.&#xD;
