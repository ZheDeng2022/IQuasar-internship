    <textblock>
      All patients undergoing breast cancer surgery are left with scars which can significantly&#xD;
      affect their physical and psychological well being. Patients with breast cancer, motivated to&#xD;
      optimize healing and function, have inquired about the advisability of scar massage after&#xD;
      surgery. Although this is a popular technique advocated by physiotherapists and massage&#xD;
      therapists to improve pain, range of motion, and scar pliability, there is currently no&#xD;
      scientific research to prove the benefits and/or risks of scar massage in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. We propose to study the effect of scar massage on pain, arm function, scar&#xD;
      formation, and quality of life in patients with breast cancer. Patients who have had breast&#xD;
      cancer surgery and who have been referred to the BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver Island Centre&#xD;
      will be offered participation in this research study. To objectively evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      scar massage, those who agree to participate will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.&#xD;
      One group will be taught to perform self-massage of the scars as soon as the scars have&#xD;
      adequately healed. The massage should be done about 10 minutes each day for a total of 6&#xD;
      months. The other group will not be taught self-massage and will be asked to not massage&#xD;
      their breast scars. In both groups, we will monitor pain, upper body range of motion, scar&#xD;
      characteristics and quality of life using standardized criteria for 2 years from the time of&#xD;
      surgery. Problems with infections or blood or fluid accumulation at the scar areas will also&#xD;
      be monitored. After 2 years, the information collected will be analyzed and compared to see&#xD;
      if there are differences in pain, function or quality of life between the two groups. The&#xD;
      results from this study will provide scientific proof of whether or not scar massage after&#xD;
      surgery is beneficial for patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial design. Women who have undergone breast&#xD;
      cancer surgery (breast conserving surgery or mastectomy) and who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria specified will be offered study participation. After obtaining informed consent,&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized between two cohorts: scar massage (intervention group) versus no&#xD;
      scar massage (control group). The primary outcome is scar-related pain (scored using the&#xD;
      McGill Pain Questionnaire Short Form). The secondary outcomes are: upper body range of&#xD;
      motion, physical parameters of the scar (pliability, scar height, vascularity and&#xD;
      pigmentation scored using the Vancouver Scar Scale), lymphedema (evaluated by arm&#xD;
      circumference measurements) and quality of life (using the Functional Assessment of Cancer&#xD;
      Therapy (FACT)-B breast cancer-specific instrument).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 143 patients per arm was estimated to detect a 30% difference in the primary&#xD;
      outcome of postoperative scar-related pain between the intervention and the control groups&#xD;
      with 80% statistical power.&#xD;
