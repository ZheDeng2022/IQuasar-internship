  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is commonly defined as a set of risk factors and abnormalities that&#xD;
      markedly increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Its relevance has been confirmed by a&#xD;
      recent population-based survey of subjects aged 40-79 years indicating that the prevalence of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome in Italy is 34.1% if diagnosed using WHO criteria and 17.8% if diagnosed&#xD;
      using the NCEP-ATPIII criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the above considerations, the aim of this study is to promote the use of the&#xD;
      SCORE algorithm for estimating cardiovascular risk, and to evaluate its evolution in patients&#xD;
      with metabolic syndrome after the implementation of a multifactorial preventive strategy,&#xD;
      with particular reference to the correction of lifestyle, hypertension and dyslipidemia.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of both genders aged 40-65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of metabolic syndrome formulated on the basis of the criteria proposed by&#xD;
             the NCEP - Adult Panel III: i.e. the presence of at least three of the following&#xD;
             conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Waist circumference &gt;102 cm in men and &gt;88 cm in women&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Triglyceridemia 150 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. HDL cholesterol &lt;40 mg/dl in men and &lt;50 mg/dl in women&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Sitting arterial pressure 130/85 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Fasting glycemia 110 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A risk of cardiovascular death of &gt;5% at the current age of the patient or &gt;5% if&#xD;
             projected to an age of 60 years, as calculated by means of the SCORE algorithm using&#xD;
             the table based on the total/HDL cholesterol ratio relating to low-risk populations&#xD;
             and appropriate for Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who have not been in menopause for at least one year or are not surgically&#xD;
             sterile, and do not use an effective contraceptive method, such as spermicidal barrier&#xD;
             methods or intrauterine devices. The use of oral contraceptives is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to valsartan and/or fluvastatin, or other&#xD;
             contraindications to their use;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive history of ischemic heart disease, peripheral artery disease or cerebral&#xD;
             vasculopathy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an SBP of 180 mmHg and/or DBP of 110 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe medical conditions which, in the judgement of the Investigator,&#xD;
             contraindicate trial participation or significantly limit life expectancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with drugs able to modify the lipid profile (ongoing or in the three months&#xD;
             preceding trial entry);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to follow the planned protocol procedures or sign the informed consent&#xD;
             form.&#xD;
