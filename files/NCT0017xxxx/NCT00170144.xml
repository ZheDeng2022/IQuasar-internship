  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With aging, there is a decrease in muscle mass and function especially in the energy&#xD;
      storehouses of cells called mitochondria. Amino acids, the building blocks of protein, and&#xD;
      insulin have been shown to increase muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis and thereby&#xD;
      function. Branched chain amino acids which can only be provided in the diet seem to be key in&#xD;
      this process. Therefore in our study, our aim is to study the effect of branched chain amino&#xD;
      acids on muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis in both the young and elderly. By doing so,&#xD;
      we can then elucidate if branched chain amino acid supplementation has future potential in&#xD;
      improving quality of life and performance in the elderly. The study will involve blood&#xD;
      sampling and needle muscle biopsy.&#xD;

      Skeletal muscle mito ATP production in young people are stimulated by insulin when infused&#xD;
      with a mixture of amino acids while clamping blood glucose at the basal level. Our&#xD;
      preliminary results indicate that this effect on mito ATP production is directly related to&#xD;
      amino acid levels. Recent publications indicated that infusion of insulin with amino acids&#xD;
      specifically stimulate muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis with no effect on synthesis or&#xD;
      contractile proteins or sarcoplasmic proteins. The recent publications also indicated that&#xD;
      intracellular amino acid anabolic sensors are stimulated by amino acids. It appears that&#xD;
      BCAA, especially leucine has a specific effect in stimulating intracellular signaling or&#xD;
      translation of mRNA to protein synthesis. It has been shown that amino acids, especially&#xD;
      leucine, stimulate protein synthesis by activation of the mTOR pathway in mTOR phosphorylates&#xD;
      p70S6 kinase which in turn phosphorylates the ribosomal S6 protein, resulting in increased&#xD;
      activity of the protein synthesis complex. Activated mTOR also phosphorylates eIF4E-BP1 and&#xD;
      activates the protein synthesis initiation complex. It is the abundance of specific mRNAase&#xD;
      that determines synthesis of which specific proteins are promoted. Our preliminary data&#xD;
      supports that amino acids selectively promotes muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis by&#xD;
      enhancing the abundance of transcripts of genes that encode mitochondrial proteins.&#xD;
      Administration of an amino acid mixture, specifically BCAA, is proposed as a stimulant of&#xD;
      muscle mitochondrial ATP production. Secondary measurements will be performed to understand&#xD;
      the underlying mechanism of enhanced muscle ATP production. These results are likely to&#xD;
      contribute to our understanding of the basic mechanisms of the regulation of mitochondrial&#xD;
      biogenesis in humans which will have potential future application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional study between young and old. The study will use the new proteomic&#xD;
      techniques established in our laboratory to profile and quantify mitochondrial protein&#xD;
      synthesis in the participants. The combination of metabolic labeling with stable isotope and&#xD;
      measuring synthesis rates of specific mito proteins by tandem mass spectrometry will&#xD;
      determine whether actual stimulation by BCAA occurs differentially in young and elderly.&#xD;
