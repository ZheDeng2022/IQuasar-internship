      Tripping over obstacles is one of the common movements in daily life and is the most&#xD;
      frequently mentioned cause of falls in the elderly. Indeed, crossing obstacles is a more&#xD;
      complex motor skill than walking, and ensuring sufficient clearance of an obstacle during&#xD;
      locomotion requires accurate movement and appropriate modifications of the swing limb.&#xD;
      However, little is known about the obstacle crossing deficits that following stroke,&#xD;
      especially in good outcome and function independently strokes. It is still a mystery about&#xD;
      motor control and motor plastic of central nerve system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study was to observe and quantify certain characteristics of the&#xD;
      performance of subjects following stroke with good outcome to understand the damage of&#xD;
      central nerve system how to affect motor control. The present study investigated selected&#xD;
      spatial-temporal characteristics, kinematic variables and kinetic variables of the gait&#xD;
      pattern to define further the problems in obstacle crossing following strokes. To quantify&#xD;
      the deficits, we compared results from a group of subjects with stroke with a group of&#xD;
      healthy subjects matched for age, gender, and height.&#xD;

      A stroke (or cerebrovascular accident) is a neurological deficit that lasts beyond 24 hours.&#xD;
      It is a disruption in the blood supply to a region of the brain that causes neurological&#xD;
      impairment. According to 2003 statistical data of National Health Administration of executive&#xD;
      organ in Taiwan, a stroke is considered the second most common cause of death after cancer.&#xD;
      According to the research of the stroke incidence in Taiwan, the incidence is 0.3% in the&#xD;
      population over 35 years-old, and the incidence increases sharply to 3% in the population&#xD;
      over 65 years-old which is nearly 294 to 1806 people. From above, we know that a stroke is&#xD;
      one of the most common neural diseases in the old population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strokes are classified as ischemic and hemorrhagic. Approximately 70-80% of all strokes are&#xD;
      ischemic strokes, including cerebrovascular thrombosis and embolism. The other 10-15% are&#xD;
      either intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage strokes. Distinctive neurological&#xD;
      signs reflect the region of the brain involved. The type and severity of neurological&#xD;
      deficits cover a wide range and gradation of symptoms. Cerebrovascular accidents frequently&#xD;
      cause upper motor neuron syndrome (Change of muscle tension, unilateral hemiplegia, movement&#xD;
      un-coordination, un-reciprocal movement, poor movement control, etc.), sensory deficits,&#xD;
      aphasia, cognitive and behavior problems, etc. These deficits often left with dependence of&#xD;
      movement function in daily life. Previous studies showed that 10% of all strokes resume&#xD;
      working, 40% is slight disability, 40% is server disability and 10% have to live in the&#xD;
      medical organization forever. Moderate to server disability are evaluated easily using&#xD;
      different kinds of outcome measures to determinate the status of neurological injury and&#xD;
      resulting disabilities, which provide guideline of aggressive treatment of rehabilitation.&#xD;
      However, good outcome and function independently in daily life may be showed in some strokes&#xD;
      with mild disability by outcome measures. It is not clear that the nearly normal strokes are&#xD;
      really the same with normal group without stroke, even the normal status was showed in the&#xD;
      strokes by outcome measures. It is unknown that the motor control strategies of strokes with&#xD;
      function independently in daily life are similar to normal group indeed. A recent study found&#xD;
      that 73% of subjects with stroke fell at least once in the 6 months after being discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital; of these, 10% reported falling over an obstacle. Falling may be caused by&#xD;
      the impairment after stroke or the different motor control strategy in the strokes with mild&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, tripping over obstacles is one of the common movements in daily life and is the&#xD;
      most frequently mentioned cause of falls in the elderly (Lu,2005). Crossing obstacles&#xD;
      successfully and safely depend on the stability of the stance leg and maintaining a good&#xD;
      clearance with the obstacles. Indeed, crossing obstacles is a more complex motor skill than&#xD;
      walking, and ensuring sufficient clearance of an obstacle during locomotion requires accurate&#xD;
      movement and appropriate modifications of the swing limb. Therefore, obstacle crossing is one&#xD;
      exercise program in diminishing disability in the rehabilitation. Studies about obstacle&#xD;
      crossing in young or old adults have been much attention. However, little is known about the&#xD;
      obstacle crossing deficits that following stroke, especially in good outcome and function&#xD;
      independently strokes. It is still a mystery about motor control and motor plastic of central&#xD;
      nerve system. Otherwise, knowledge of the motor control strategy after stroke during&#xD;
      obstacle-crossing is helpful for the design of fall-prevention devices and for the planning&#xD;
      of programs for the prevention of associated injuries.&#xD;
